Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with parchment paper. Combine oats, spelt flour, wheat germ, brown sugar, chia seeds, ground flax seeds, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl. Combine applesauce, honey, banana, egg, and dates in a blender; blend until very smooth. Pour over the oat mixture and mix well. Scoop granola mixture into the pan. Press down firmly with wet hands to spread evenly in the pan. Bake in the preheated oven until very lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool for 1 to 2 minutes. Cut into bars. Cool completely before lifting from the pan, about 30 minutes.
