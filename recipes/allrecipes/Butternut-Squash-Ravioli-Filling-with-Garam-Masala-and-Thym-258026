Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place butternut squash halves on a baking sheet. Drizzle olive oil over squash. Season with thyme, salt, and pepper. Bake in the preheated oven, turning once, until squash feels soft when pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Cool until easily handled. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Scoop flesh of the squash into a food processor; add onion-garlic mixture, yogurt, garam masala, and nutmeg. Blend until smooth, adding milk to loosen slightly. Pulse in Romano cheese. Refrigerate squash filling until set, about 30 minutes.
