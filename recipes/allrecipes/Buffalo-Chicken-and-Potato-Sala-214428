In 3-quart saucepan, cover potatoes with water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook 10 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Drain and cool slightly. In serving bowl, toss potatoes with remaining ingredients. Serve chilled or at room temperature. Serve, if desired, on a bed of lettuce, garnished with celery leaves.
