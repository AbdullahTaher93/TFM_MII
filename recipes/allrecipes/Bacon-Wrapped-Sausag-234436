Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Wrap each slice of sausage with a piece of bacon and arrange in the prepared baking dish; sprinkle with brown sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crispy and sugar is caramelized, about 1 hour.
