Combine potatoes, 1/2 cup cheese and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Press into the bottom and up the sides of a greased 9-in. pie plate. In a bowl, beat eggs and milk. Add ham, onion, pepper and remaining cheese and salt; pour over potato crust (dish will be very full). Bake at 350 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand 5 minutes before cutting.
