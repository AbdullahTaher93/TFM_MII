Heat 1/4 cup of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add zucchini slices and garlic; cook and stir until starting to brown but you want the squash to stay firm and not get mushy, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and mix in the vinegar, mint, salt and pepper. Stir in the remaining olive oil. Spoon into a jar and store covered in the refrigerator.
