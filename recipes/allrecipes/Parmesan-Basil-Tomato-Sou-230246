Heat vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato soup and bring to a boil. Add Parmesan cheese, basil, and rosemary. Season with salt and black pepper. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes more.
