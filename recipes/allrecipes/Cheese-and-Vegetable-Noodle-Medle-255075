Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; add Mexican squash, yellow squash, broccoli stems, garlic salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until vegetables are tender but still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Mix in Cheddar cheese; cook and stir until melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a serving plate; garnish with Fresno chile peppers.
