In a blender, puree tahini, 1 tablespoon of the sesame oil, soy sauce, water, vinegar, honey, garlic, gingerroot, chili sauce, and a pinch of salt. Cook the noodles until al dente. Transfer to a colander and rinse under cold water. Drain well; in a large bowl, toss with remaining 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil. Drizzle noodles with tahini mixture; toss with chicken. Top with remaining ingredients. Serve immediately.
