Preheat barbecue grill. In a food processor, whirl coconut, chilies, anchovy paste, garlic, and lime juice until coconut and chilies are minced; scrape container sides frequently. Rinse and drain shrimp. Thread onto metal or water-soaked wooden skewers (10 to 14 in. long). Place shrimp on grill over a solid bed of medium-hot coals or medium-high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 3 to 4 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook shrimp, turning once, until bright pink and opaque but still moist-looking in center of thickest part (cut to test), 3 to 5 minutes total. Transfer shrimp to a platter. Serve with sambal paste.
