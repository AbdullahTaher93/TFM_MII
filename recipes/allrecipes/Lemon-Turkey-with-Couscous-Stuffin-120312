Carefully loosen turkey skin, leaving it attached at the back. Combine the oil, lemon juice, garlic, lemon peel, salt and pepper; spread under turkey skin. Place turkey to one side in a shallow roasting pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. For stuffing, in a bowl, pour boiling water over couscous. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes or until water is absorbed. Add the remaining ingredients; toss to combine. Spoon stuffing into other side of pan, shaping into a 8-in. x 5-in. x 2-in. mound. Cover pan and bake at 325 degrees F for 45 minutes. Uncover turkey; leave stuffing covered. Bake 40-50 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 170 degrees F. Cover turkey with foil and let stand for 15 minutes before slicing. Serve with stuffing.
