Combine water and quinoa in a saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until most of the water has been absorbed, about 8 minutes. Add cranberries; cook until plump and quinoa is tender, 4 to 5 minutes more. Transfer to a bowl. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 5 minutes. Drain; fold into the quinoa mixture. Mix olive oil, orange juice, lime juice, and garlic together in a small bowl to make dressing. Pour over quinoa mixture; toss to combine. Sprinkle walnuts on top.
