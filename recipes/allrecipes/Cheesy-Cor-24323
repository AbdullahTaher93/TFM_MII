Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and crumble. In a 9x13 inch casserole dish combine bacon, creamed corn, whole kernel corn, butter and processed cheese; mix well. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes; stir. Bake another 20 minutes, or until heated through and set.
