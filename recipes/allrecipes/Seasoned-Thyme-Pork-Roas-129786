Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Brown pork and onions in hot oil in large ovenproof pot on medium-high heat 3 min., turning occasionally. Combine barbecue sauce, apple juice and thyme. Pour over ingredients in pot; cover with ovenproof lid. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer 10 min., then place in oven. Bake 2 hours. Add apples and prunes; bake an additional 30 min. or until pork is cooked through (160 degrees F) and apples are tender.
