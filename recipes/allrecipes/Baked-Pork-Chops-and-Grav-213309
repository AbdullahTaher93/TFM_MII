Beat the egg and water in a shallow dish with a fork or whisk. Coat the pork with the flour. Dip the pork into the egg mixture. Coat with the stuffing. Place the pork onto a baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes or until the pork is cooked through. Heat the gravy in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat until it's hot and bubbling. Serve the gravy with the pork.
