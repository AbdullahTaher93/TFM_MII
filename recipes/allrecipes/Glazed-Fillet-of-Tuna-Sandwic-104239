Brush fish with oil; sprinkle with Morton(R) Kosher Salt. Squeeze juice from lemon on each fillet/steak. Place on broiler pan, cover and allow to marinate 15 minutes. Spread 1 tablespoon mustard-mayonnaise sauce on each tuna steak. Broil until fish is opaque*** and flakes easily with a fork, about 8 to 10 minutes, turning once. Lightly toast sandwich buns. Spread each half with chutney, then top with arugula leaves. Place tuna steak on bottom half of bun; top each with dollop of mango chutney; spread to coat top of fish. Cover with top half of bun; cut sandwich in half and serve immediately.
