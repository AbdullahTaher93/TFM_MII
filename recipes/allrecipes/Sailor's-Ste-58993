Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place meat in a plastic bag with the flour. Toss to coat evenly. Heat oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Remove beef cubes from the bag, and shake off excess flour. Brown beef cubes on all sides, and remove to paper towels to drain. Place potatoes on the bottom of a 3 quart casserole dish or Dutch oven. Place the beef cubes over the potatoes, then cover with carrots and mushrooms. Pour in the beer, beef broth, and soy sauce. Toss in the peppercorns. Bake uncovered for 2 hours in the preheated oven, or until meat is very tender.
