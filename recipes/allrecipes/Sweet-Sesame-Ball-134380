In a medium saucepan, heat the oil until a deep-frying thermometer reads 350 degrees F. In a saucepan, bring 1 cup water to a boil; stir in the brown sugar until dissolved. Place the rice flour in a medium bowl and, using a fork, stir in the sugar syrup until a sticky dough forms. Place the sesame seeds in a bowl. Using your hands, roll about 2 tablespoons dough into a ball. Roll the ball in the sesame seeds; repeat with the remaining dough. When the oil is hot, working in batches, fry the sesame balls until golden brown, about 4 minutes per batch. Transfer the sesame balls to a paper-towel-lined plate. Serve with the warm honey.
