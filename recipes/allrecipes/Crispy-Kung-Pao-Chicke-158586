Heat 1 quart of vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or electric skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Toss chicken with beaten egg in a bowl until coated. Place the panko in a shallow dish, then drop the egg coated chicken pieces into the panko one at a time, and roll to coat; set aside. Deep fry the chicken pieces in the hot oil until golden brown on all sides, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the chicken to drain on a paper towel, and keep warm. Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a wok over high heat. Stir in garlic, ginger, green onion, and red pepper flakes. Cook and stir until the garlic and ginger begin to turn golden brown, then pour in the soy sauce, rice vinegar, and brown sugar. Bring to a boil. Dissolve cornstarch in water, then stir into the boiling sauce to thicken. Cook and stir until the sauce clears, about 45 seconds. Toss the fried chicken with the sauce and peanuts in the wok to serve.
