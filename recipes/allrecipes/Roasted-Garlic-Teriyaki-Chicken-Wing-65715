Disjoint chicken wings; discard tips. Place pieces in large plastic food storage bag; pour in roasted garlic teriyaki sauce. Press air out of bag; close top securely. Turn bag over several times to coat all pieces well. Refrigerate 8 hours or overnight, turning bag over occasionally. Arrange pieces in single layer in shallow baking pan. Bake in 350 degrees F oven 20 minutes. Turn pieces over and bake 25 minutes longer, or until chicken is no longer pink near bone.
