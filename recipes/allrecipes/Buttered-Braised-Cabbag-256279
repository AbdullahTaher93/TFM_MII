Heat 3 tablespoons butter in a large pot over medium-low heat until mostly melted. Add cabbage. Place remaining 1 tablespoon butter on top of the cabbage. Cover and cook until cabbage is tender, about 10 minutes. Uncover and stir cabbage to coat evenly with butter. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, about 3 minutes. Season with black pepper.
