Heat oil in large skillet; add pork. Sear pork on both sides on medium-high heat just until brown, about 1 minutes on each side. Remove from skillet and cover loosely with foil. Add garlic and onions to skillet. Cook and stir until tender, about 2 minutes, scraping up brown bits from bottom of skillet. Add rice, stirring constantly until rice just begins to brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add tomatoes, jalapeno chiles, beer and broth or water. Bring to boil; cover. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer 10 minutes. Place pork on top of rice; cover. Simmer 8 or 9 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with chopped cilantro if desired.
