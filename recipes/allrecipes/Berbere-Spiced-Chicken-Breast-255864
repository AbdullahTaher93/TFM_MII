Season both sides of chicken breast with salt. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon berbere spice mix to coat both sides of chicken breast (see Cook's Note for recipe link). Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat until it just starts to turn brown. Immediately transfer chicken breast to skillet; cook 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a warm dish. Stir in lime juice, tomato paste, chicken broth, and coconut milk; stir to deglaze pan. Bring to a simmer while stirring. Add 1/2 teaspoon berbere spice and a pinch of salt. Transfer chicken breast back to skillet; reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until chicken is cooked through and sauce starts to reduce, basting chicken with pan juices as it cooks, 4 or 5 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle with chopped cilantro. Serve with a drizzle of the pan sauce.
