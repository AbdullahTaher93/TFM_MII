Season the pork chops on both sides with brown sugar, and salt and pepper to taste; set aside. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Brown the chops on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Add the apple juice and heat to boiling. Stir in the baked beans, corn, vinegar, and thyme, if desired. Stir briefly to combine the liquids in the pan. Simmer until the chops are firm to the touch (an internal temperature of 155 degrees F), about 10 minutes, turning two or three times. Turn off the heat, cover for about five minutes as you finish preparing the meal; pork will come up to 160 degrees F. When the chops are done move them to a serving platter. If the bean mixture is too liquid, boil over high heat for a few minutes, until lightly thickened, stirring often. Spoon the beans around the chops and serve.
