Finely chop the tuna and salmon. In a large mixing bowl combine tuna and salmon with cilantro, lime juice, garlic, 4 teaspoons of the extra-virgin olive oil, the ginger, chili sauce, wasabi, salt, and pepper. Shape into 6 patties about 3/4 inch thick. Place burger patties on the lightly oiled rack of the grill directly over medium heat. Grill for 10 to 12 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in centers registers 160 degrees F, turning burgers once halfway through grilling. Brush the flatbread with remaining olive oil. Toast on grill rack for 1 to 2 minutes or until golden brown. Serve burgers folded in flatbread and topped with Aquavit Green Cabbage Slaw and, if desired, yellow tomato slices.
