Blend carrot and garlic in a food processor until finely chopped. Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat; cook and stir carrot mixture, onion, and green bell pepper until softened, about 10 minutes. Add millet; stir until fragrant and toasted, about 3 minutes. Pour vegetable broth into millet mixture; season with salt and black pepper. Reduce heat and simmer until all the broth is absorbed and millet is tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in cilantro.
