Heat a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir pine nuts until toasted and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Mix squash, grapes, onion, olive oil, salt, pepper, and sage leaves together in a large baking dish to coat squash, onion, and grapes in oil and seasoning. Roast in the preheated oven until squash and onion are golden and slightly caramelized, about 50 minutes; sprinkle pine nuts over the dish.
