In a large skillet, heat oil. Saute red bell peppers and onions until they begin to soften. Remove from skillet with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add cubed chicken to skillet and brown lightly. Add garlic and ground red pepper. Reduce heat slightly and saute, covered, for 1 to 2 minutes, until garlic is golden brown. Using a wooden spoon, add lemon juice, stirring to break up particles on bottom of skillet (deglazing). Add butter/margarine, stirring and blending well into the sauce. Return bell pepper and onion to skillet, stir all together and add parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve.
