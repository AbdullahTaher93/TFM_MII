Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. In a large bowl, combine the bacon, broccoli, green onions, carrots and salt and pepper. In a small bowl whisk together the mayonnaise and vinegar. Pour dressing over vegetables and toss to coat evenly. Chill for 1 hour before serving.
