Heat oven to 400 degrees F. In small bowl, combine mayonnaise and cheese; mix well. Stir in basil, oregano, onions and garlic. Separate dough into 10 biscuits. On ungreased cookie sheets, press or roll each biscuit to form 4-inch round. Spread about 1 tablespoon cheese mixture over each round to within 1/4 inch of edge. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10 to 13 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
