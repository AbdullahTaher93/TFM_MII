In a small bowl, combine the paprika, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, black pepper, and red pepper. Coat a large cast-iron skillet with cooking spray and heat over high heat. Brush both sides of the snapper with the oil and rub with the spice mixture. Place in the skillet and cook, turning once, for 6 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily.
