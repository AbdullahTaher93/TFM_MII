Season the meat with salt and pepper and let it rest while mincing the lemon zest and rosemary. In a large heavy pot, heat the olive oil on medium-high heat. Brown the roast on all sides; about 3 minutes per side. Meanwhile; mix together the wine, stock, mustard, zest, rosemary and any left over salt and pepper. Add this mixture to the pot. Bring to a boil and cover (use aluminum foil if pot does not have its own lid). Cook for 20 minutes turning the roast frequently so that all sides have a turn in the liquid. Place roast on a carving board or platter. Let rest for 7 minutes. For the gravy: The easiest thing to do is simply strain the liquids and serve it in an au-jus manner (add more salt and pepper if desired). Slice the roast at the table or just prior to serving. Serve with the gravy.
