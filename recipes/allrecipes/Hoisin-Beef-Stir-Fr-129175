Put the noodles in a bowl, cover with boiling water, and leave to soak 5 minutes, or according to the package directions. Meanwhile, heat the sunflower oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add the garlic and ginger and stir-fry to release their flavors. Toss in the red bell pepper and mushrooms, then stir-fry until starting to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the strips of steak, snow peas, and scallions, and stir-fry until the meat just turns from pink to brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Mix in the hoisin and soy sauces and stir well until bubbling, then drizzle in the sesame oil, if using. Drain the noodles. Serve the stir-fry on the noodles, garnished with shredded scallions.
