Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, stir coconut milk and peanut butter together in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until the peanut butter melts and the mixture is smooth, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir chickpeas, ginger, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper into the mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until the chickpeas are tender, about 10 minutes. Add tomatoes; continue cooking until the mixture thickens slightly, about 10 minutes. Season with salt. Serve with the rice.
