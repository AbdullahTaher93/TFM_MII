Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Combine oats, almonds, macadamia nuts, and coconut in a large bowl. Heat olive oil, honey, butter, and brown sugar together in a separate microwave-safe bowl in the microwave until butter is melted, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Whisk butter mixture until brown sugar is dissolved; stir in salt, turmeric, and cinnamon. Pour butter mixture over oat mixture; toss to coat thoroughly. Spread granola evenly on a baking sheet. Bake granola in preheated oven until well-toasted and golden brown, about 30 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet to set, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl; stir in raisins.
