In a small bowl, stir together milk and yeast; set aside. In a separate bowl, combine flour, eggs, yeast mixture, cheese and butter; mix well. Spoon batter into two lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pans. Let rise until doubled, about 60 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 45 minutes, until golden brown and bottom of loaf sounds hollow when tapped.
