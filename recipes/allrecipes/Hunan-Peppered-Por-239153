Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat until smoking; saute garlic and ginger until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add pork to wok; cook and stir until cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer pork to a plate. Pour remaining 2 tablespoons oil into the same wok over medium-high heat; saute chile peppers until well-coated with oil and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add pork to chile peppers and generously season with salt. Cook and stir mixture until peppers are tender, 5 to 7 minutes more. Mix enough soy sauce into pork mixture to add color and taste for desired saltiness.
