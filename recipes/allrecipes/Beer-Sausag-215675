Pour the beer into a large pot, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Layer the potatoes into the bottom of the pot, and sprinkle a little Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper over the potatoes. Layer the baby carrots, onion, smoked sausage, and cabbage, sprinkling every layer with a bit more of the Italian seasonings, salt, and pepper. Turn heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes.
