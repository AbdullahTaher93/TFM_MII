Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Crust: Combine flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Cut room temperature shortening into flour with pastry blender or 2 knives until mixture is uniform and shortening resembles large peas. Beat egg, water and vinegar together. Pour all liquid evenly over flour mixture. Stir with fork until all of the mixture is moistened. Divide dough in half and shape each half into a ball. Flatten each into a 4" (10 cm) circle. Wrap and chill 15 minutes for easier rolling. Roll one half of the dough on a floured surface into a circle 2" (5 cm) wider than a 9" (23cm) pie plate. Transfer into a pie plate. Trim pastry at edges of plate. Roll out remaining dough and set aside. Filling: Combine sugar, flour and cinnamon in a large bowl. Add apples, tossing lightly to coat fruit with sugar mixture. Fill the pastry-lined pie plate with fruit mixture. Dot with butter. Top with remaining pastry. Seal and flute edges. Cut slits on top of pastry. Topping: Brush top of pie with beaten egg and sprinkle with sugar. Place the pie on a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven, on bottom rack, for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and bake for 60-70 minutes or until pastry is golden and fruit is tender. Cool on wire cooling rack for at least 2 hours before serving.
