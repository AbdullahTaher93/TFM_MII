Mix the cheeses and spread evenly among the pepper halves. Place them on a cookie sheet coated with nonstick spray. In a medium bowl, mix together the eggs, milk, flour, and pepper. Pour the mixture into the peppers and bake, uncovered, for 45 minutes or until the eggs are no longer runny. Top with salsa.
