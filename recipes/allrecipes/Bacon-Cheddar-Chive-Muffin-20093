Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and lightly grease 12 muffin cups or use paper liners. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, garlic powder, chives, Parmesan cheese, cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon. In a separate bowl, combine egg, milk, cream of mushroom soup and vegetable oil. Stir this mixture into the flour mixture just until moistened. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin pans. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean.
