Cut the lobster tails in half lengthwise along the spine. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill lobster tails until slightly charred and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Pull out lobster meat and coarsely chop. Combine cooking sauce, green onions, and half of the diced tomato, then add coarsely chopped lobster. Lay out tortillas flat, divide cheese evenly between the tortillas, then divide lobster mixture evenly between tortillas. Fold over and grill until lightly charred on each side and cheese is melted, about 1 minute per side. Garnish with avocado slices, lettuce and remaining tomatoes.
