Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Mix eggs, peanut butter, agave nectar, vanilla extract, salt, and stevia together in a bowl. Sift coconut flour and baking powder together in a bowl; stir into egg mixture until batter is smooth. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean, about 1 hour.
