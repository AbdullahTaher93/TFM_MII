In a blender or food processor, place the strawberries, concentrate, water and ice; cover and process until smooth. Pour into a 2-qt. freezer container. Cover and freeze for at least 12 hours or until icy. Remove from freezer 1 hour before serving. Just before serving, transfer strawberry mixture to a large bowl; stir in soda.
