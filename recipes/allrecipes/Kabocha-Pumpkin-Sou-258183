Place kabocha squash cut-side down into a microwave-safe baking dish. Pour 1/2 inch water around the squash. Microwave on high until tender, about 10 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes. Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a blender. Scoop kabocha squash flesh into the blender. Add pumpkin puree, vegetable broth, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. Blend until smooth. Pour blended mixture into a saucepan. Cook and stir over medium-low heat until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.
