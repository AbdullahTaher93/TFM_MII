Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add plums, cover, and steam until tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer plums to a food processor and blend, adding water from the saucepan as needed, until desired consistency is reached. Allow pureed plums to reach room temperature before serving or freezing.
