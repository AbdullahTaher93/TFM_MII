Heat a Belgian or regular waffle iron. In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, and coconut. In a small bowl, whisk together the maple syrup, honey, and egg substitute. Whisk in the oil and milk. In a medium bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff with an electric mixer at high speed. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour the honey mixture into the well. Stir just until the ingredients are moistened. Gently fold the whites into the batter. Bake in the waffle iron until golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes.
