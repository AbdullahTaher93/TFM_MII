Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a mixing bowl, mix together the whey, Splenda, pecans, flax seed, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, allspice and salt. In a large bowl, beat the egg. Add the pumpkin and vanilla extract. Stir until well incorporated. Add about 1/4 cup of the dry mixture and stir well. Add the melted butter and stir until well incorporated. Add the remaining dry ingredients. Use a lightly buttered non-stick muffin tin (otherwise use parchment muffin cups). Divide the batter between 8 of the cups about 2/3 to 3/4 full. For larger muffins fill only 6, but then each muffin has 8g net carbs instead of 6g. Bake in a 350 degrees F oven for 15 minutes or until the wet gloss has vanished from the top of the muffins and they start to brown. Do not over cook. Let cool for 5 minutes in the tin before turning over to release them.
