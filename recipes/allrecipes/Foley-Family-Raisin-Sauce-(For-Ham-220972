Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir 1 3/4 cup water, currant jelly, cider vinegar, and lemon juice into hot butter. Simmer over low heat until jelly dissolves and mixture is the color of maple syrup, 5 to 10 minutes. Slowly stir white sugar and brown sugar into currant jelly mixture, stirring constantly, until well incorporated. Stir dark raisins, golden raisins, salt, and cloves into currant jelly mixture and simmer for 5 minutes. Whisk 1 tablespoon cold water with cornstarch in a small bowl until fully blended. Stir into raisin sauce and simmer until thickened, at least 5 minutes.
