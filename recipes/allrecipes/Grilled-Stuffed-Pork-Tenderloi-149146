Heat grill. Combine tapenade and blue cheese in small bowl. Fold thin end of tenderloin under to create a uniform thickness; secure with a toothpick. Using a steak knife (or other long narrow knife) create a cavity in the middle of the tenderloin by inserting knife in center of each end toward center of tenderloin. Try to meet in the center to create a continuous cavity. Press down slightly on knife to widen cavity. Use fingers to stretch cavity open slightly and make sure it meets in center. Using fingers and end of rubber spatula or handle of fork to push, press fig mixture from each end into cavity to stuff. Seal each end with toothpick. Season with pepper. Place tenderloin on grill over medium heat. Cover and cook, turning every 10 minutes, or until pork reaches temperature of 160 degrees F in center, about 30 minutes total. Remove toothpicks; slice and serve.
