Cook pasta according to package directions; drain. While pasta is cooking, cut sausage into 1/4-inch slices. Place in bowl and sprinkle with seasoning; toss lightly to evenly coat. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. Add sausage; cook and stir for 3-4 minutes or until lightly browned. Stir in Alfredo sauce, parsley and hot sauce to taste; heat through. Pour over pasta and toss until well coated. Serve immediately.
