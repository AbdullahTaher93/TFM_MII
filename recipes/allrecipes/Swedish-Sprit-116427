In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg and extracts. Combine the flour and baking powder; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Using a cookie press fitted with the disk of your choice, press dough 1 in. apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 400 degrees F for 7-9 minutes or until edges are firm and lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool. Frost as desired.
