Lay the tortilla out flat, and arrange the baby greens across the tortilla. Sprinkle the cherry tomatoes, goat cheese, roasted red pepper, and mozzarella cheese evenly across the greens. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Fold the bottom of the tortilla up about 2 inches to enclose the filling, and roll the wrap tightly.
