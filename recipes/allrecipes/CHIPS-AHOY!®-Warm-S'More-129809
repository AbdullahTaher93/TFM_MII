Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place 8 of the cookies, flat sides up, on foil-covered baking sheet. Top evenly with chocolate, coconut and marshmallows. Bake 4 min. Cover each with second cookie, flat side down, to make sandwich. Continue baking 2 to 4 min. or until cookies are warmed and chocolate and marshmallows are melted. Serve warm. Or, cover and refrigerate 5 to 10 min. or until filling is set.
