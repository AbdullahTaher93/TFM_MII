In an 11- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat, stir onions, butter, and bacon often until onions are limp and lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, shell hard-cooked eggs and chop them. Set aside. Place flour in a small bowl. Add a little of the broth and mix to make a smooth paste. Then add paste to remaining broth and stir into onion mixture along with milk. Stir over medium heat until boiling, then stir about 2 minutes more. Add cheese and stir until smoothly melted. Add chopped eggs and 2 tablespoons chives and mix well. Arrange toast on 4 serving plates. Top equally with onion mixture and serve immediately. Sprinkle with remaining chives and season to taste with salt and pepper.
