Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners. Mix milk, egg, and olive oil together in a bowl. Add flour, sugar, and baking powder; mix well. Fold blackberries into the batter. Spoon batter into the muffin tin, filling each cup 1/2 way. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
