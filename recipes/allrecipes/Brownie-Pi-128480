Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch-round (22.5-cm) tart pan with removable bottom. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, ground walnuts, baking powder, and salt. Remove from the microwave oven, stirring constantly to fully melt the chocolate. Stir in the granulated sugar. Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring after each addition, until well-blended. Stir in the vanilla extract and the flour mixture. Spread into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan on a rack for 10 minutes. Remove from the pan. Arrange the walnut halves on the top. Dust with the confectioners' sugar.
