Top four pastry wedges with one slice each of ham, turkey, cheese and pineapple, folding meat and cheese to fit if necessary. Top each with a pastry wedge; seal and crimp edges with a fork. Cut slits in pastry. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Brush lightly with egg. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
