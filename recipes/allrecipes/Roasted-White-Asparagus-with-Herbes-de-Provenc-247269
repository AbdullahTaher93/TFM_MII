Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Trim 1 1/2 inches off the bottom of each asparagus stalk. Lay flat on a cutting board and peel. Transfer to a casserole dish and brush with olive oil. Sprinkle herbes de Provence, salt, and black pepper over asparagus. Roast in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
