Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for indirect heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is balanced on the sides, not directly under the food). Rinse beef and pat dry. Sprinkle all over with salt and pepper. Set roast, fattiest side up, on center of grill (not over direct heat). Cover charcoal grill and open vents; close lid on gas grill. Cook until an instant read meat thermometer inserted in center of thickest part reaches 125 degrees to 130 degrees for rare, about 1 1/4 hours; 135 degrees to 140 degrees for medium rare, about 1 3/4 hours; 145 degrees for medium well, about 1 hour and 55 minutes; 150 degrees for well, about 2 hours. When roast is almost done, in a bowl, mix together sour cream, 1/4 cup horseradish, and orange peel until well blended. Add salt to taste and more horseradish, if desired. Transfer roast to a rimmed carving board and let rest in a warm place 15 minutes. Slice roast and serve with orange horseradish sauce to taste.
