Pour beet liquid, vinegar, sugar, and cinnamon sticks into a saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook over medium-high heat until the sugar has dissolved, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 5 minutes. Pour mixture over sliced beets, and stir to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours before serving.
