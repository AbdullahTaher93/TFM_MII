Place chicken and chicken broth in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil and cook until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer chicken and broth to a slow cooker. Stir in navy beans, corn, green chilies, garlic, cumin, red pepper flakes, oregano, salt, and onion powder. Cover and cook on Low until flavors are blended, 8 to 9 hours.
