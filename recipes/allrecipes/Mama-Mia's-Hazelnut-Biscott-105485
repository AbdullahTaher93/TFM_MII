Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a cookie sheet or jellyroll pan with baking spray and set aside. Spread hazelnuts in a shallow pan and toast in preheated 350 degrees F oven for 7-10 minutes. Remove hazelnuts from the oven and cool. Mix the oil, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and sugar together in a large mixing bowl. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add hazelnut syrup and mix well. Set aside. Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and nonfat dry milk in a medium mixing bowl. Pour the flour mixture into the oil and egg mixture and stir until blended. Add hazelnuts and mix until just blended. Refrigerate dough 1 hour or until stiff. Divide dough in half. Roll each half into a log approximately 3 1/2 inches wide by 12 inches long. Place the logs on the prepared sheet 2 inches apart. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F oven for 20-25 minutes. Remove from oven and cool for 5 minutes. Cut the loaves with a sharp knife into 48 slices, approximately 1/2 inch wide. Cool completely. If desired, lay slices on their sides and drizzle with melted chocolate chips. Store in airtight containers. Cookies will stay fresh up to 5 days.
