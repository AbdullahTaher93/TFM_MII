Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Drizzle olive oil into the bottom of baking dish to coat. Season squash halves with salt and pepper; arrange into baking dish with flesh side down. Bake in preheated oven until a fork easily pierces through the skin and flesh, about 25 minutes. Flip squash halves and roast 5 minutes more.
