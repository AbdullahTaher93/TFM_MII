Heat the sesame oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the cabbage, onion, celery, carrots, and garlic; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the ground round and the egg; cook and stir until the meat is brown and the egg is no longer runny. Place a tortilla onto your work surface, then spoon 3 large tablespoons of the filling halfway between the bottom edge and the center of the tortilla. Fold the bottom of the tortilla snugly over the filling, then fold in the left and right edges. Roll the burrito up to the top edge, forming a tight cylinder. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Heat the canola oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Place the tortillas seam side down until lightly browned, about 30 seconds per side. After all sides are brown, make the tortillas are seam side down again and add 1/4 cup water to the skillet. Cover, reduce the heat, and steam until all the water has evaporated.
