Cook pasta in boiling water until just tender, about 8 minutes, or according to package directions. Reserve 1/4 cup of the cooking liquid; drain the pasta. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and salt, stir to coat, and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until very soft and just beginning to brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Uncover, increase heat to medium-high, stir in corn, garlic, thyme and pepper, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Sprinkle flour over the vegetables; stir to coat. Stir in wine and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat. When the pasta is ready, return the pan to medium-high heat. Stir in the reserved cooking liquid and clams (and any juices). Simmer, stirring often, until the clams are cooked through, about 1 minute. Stir in the pasta, basil and parsley. Serve with lemon wedges.
