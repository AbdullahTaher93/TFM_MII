In a large mixing bowl, beat egg yolks and sugar very well. Add water and vanilla. Sift together flour and baking powder; add to mixing bowl. Beat egg whites until stiff; fold into batter. Pour into three 8-in. greased and floured baking pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Cool and remove from pans. For frosting, beat all ingredients except cream. Stiffly whip cream and fold into frosting. Split each cake in two. Spread frosting between all layers and around entire torte. Store in refrigerator.
