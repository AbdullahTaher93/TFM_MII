Gently stir in whipped topping; spread evenly over sorbet in pan. Freeze 3 hours or overnight. To unmold, invert pan onto plate; remove foil. Let stand 10 to 15 min. to soften slightly before cutting into 12 slices to serve. Place one slice on each of 12 dessert plates. Top evenly with raspberries. Store leftover dessert in freezer.
