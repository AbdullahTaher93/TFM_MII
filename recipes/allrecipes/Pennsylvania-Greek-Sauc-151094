Place the beef in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook until beef is completely brown; drain. Stir the onions, tomato sauce, water, salt, pepper, oregano, basil, garlic powder, cumin, red pepper flakes, and yellow mustard into the beef. Bring to a boil; lower heat to medium-low and simmer 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
