Slice and toast bread. Cut three pieces of wire approximately 4 inches in length. Create legs by wrapping wire once or twice around cinnamon stick body and leaving an end for Mosquitoast to stand on. Repeat the wire on other side. Wrap a third piece of wire around the cinnamon stick leaving a tiny bit of the ends sticking up, just enough to pierce through raisin eyes. Prop toast upward on top.
