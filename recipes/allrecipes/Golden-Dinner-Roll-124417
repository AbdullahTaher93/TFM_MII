Soften yeast in warm water. Place sugar and salt in large mixing bowl. Set aside. Heat and stir milk and shortening until shortening melts (120 degrees F-130 degrees F). Add to mixing bowl along with eggs and yeast mixture. Stir in 1 cup of flour at a time to form a soft dough that can be kneaded. Knead on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic. Place in a large greased bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Shape into desired rolls or loaves. Place on greased baking sheets or in bread pans. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake rolls at 375 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until golden. Bake loaves at 375 degrees F for about 30 minutes or until bread tests done. Remove from pans and cool on wire racks.
