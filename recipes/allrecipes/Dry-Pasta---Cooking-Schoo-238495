Bring water to a boil in a large pot; add salt. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 to 11 minutes. Reserve 1/4 cup of cooking liquid; drain spaghetti. Bring spaghetti sauce to a simmer in a large skillet. Stir spaghetti and reserved cooking liquid into sauce; toss to coat.
