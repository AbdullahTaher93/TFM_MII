Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Soften cream cheese in a small bowl by zapping in the microwave for about 30 seconds. In a large bowl, beat the eggs and cream. Add the Splenda, maple flavoring, cinnamon, ginger, salt, allspice and cloves. Mix well. Add the pumpkin and mix until well blended. Pour batter into a casserole dish and bake for about 40 minutes. The center may still be a tiny bit wiggly, but this will set with the residual heat. Cool at room temperature for 30 minutes.
