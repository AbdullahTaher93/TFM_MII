Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Shred or dice the chicken. In a sauce pan over medium heat, add the 1/2 cup of the green chile sauce and the chicken. Stir occasionally until it is heated all through. Remove from heat, add 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese, stir. Lay out the 4 tortillas on a flat surface. Divide the chicken mixture evenly amongst them, placing it on the lower 1/3 portion of each tortilla. Roll up each tortilla and place seam side down in an 8x8 casserole dish. Allow a little bit of separation between each enchilada. Cover the enchiladas with the remaining cup of the green chile sauce and sprinkle the top with the remaining cheese. Bake in a 350 degrees F oven (uncovered) for 15 or 20 minute, until the cheese is completely melted and starting to bubble. Do not over-cook; low carb tortillas get soggy quite fast. Serve with the Avocado and Tomato Salad (page 158) or try the Southwestern Salad (with or without the chicken included).
