Blend the flour, milk, eggs, 1-1/2 tablespoons of the sugar, and 1 tablespoon of the butter together and let sit for 30 minutes. Place a skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray over medium heat. Pour 2 tablespoons of the batter into the pan and tilt until the bottom is covered. Cook until the top is set and the underside is golden. Flip the crepe and cook until the bottom is lightly browned. Place the cooked crepe on waxed paper. Cook the remaining batter, stacking the finished crepes on separate pieces of waxed paper. To prepare the filling, combine the cottage cheese, remaining 1-1/2 tablespoons sugar, and vanilla. Divide the filling among the crepes and fold each in half. Melt the remaining butter in the skillet and cook the apples until brown. Top the crepes with apples and sprinkle with cinnamon.
