Heat the lard in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the rice, and stir until rice is toasted. Add the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion just begins to brown. Stir in the tomatoes, tomato sauce, chicken broth, chili powder and salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until rice is tender. Let stand for 5 minutes, covered, before serving.
