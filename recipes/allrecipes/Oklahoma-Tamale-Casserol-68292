In a skillet over medium heat, fry the bacon until evenly brown and crisp. Drain, crumble, and set aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 4 quart casserole dish. In a large bowl, mix the tamales, chicken, corn, tomatoes, raisins, and olives. Season with chili powder and salt. Transfer to the prepared casserole dish. Dot with butter. In a separate bowl, mix the chicken broth and Worcestershire sauce. Pour over the casserole. Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven. Top with Cheddar cheese, and continue baking 15 minutes, or until cheese is melted and lightly browned.
