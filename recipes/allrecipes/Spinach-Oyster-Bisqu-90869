Melt butter in a 4- to 5-quart pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until onion begins to brown (6 to 8 minutes). Stir in flour, then add Worcestershire and pepper. Remove pan from heat and gradually stir in broth, then wine and spinach. Return to high heat and cook, stirring, until spinach is thawed and mixture is boiling (about 5 minutes). Add oysters and their liquid; heat, stirring often, until steaming hot (1 to 2 more minutes). Ladle bisque into bowls. Grate a little nutmeg onto each portion.
