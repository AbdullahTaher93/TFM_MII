Cook the beef in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat. Stir the soup, picante sauce, corn, rice, cheese and water in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium. Cover and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the skillet from the heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Spoon about 2/3 cup beef mixture down the center of each tortilla. Fold up the sides of the tortillas around the filling, then fold up the ends to enclose the filling.
