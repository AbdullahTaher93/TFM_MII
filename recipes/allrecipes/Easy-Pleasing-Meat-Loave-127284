Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Mix meat, stuffing mix, water, eggs and 1/4 cup of the barbecue sauce. Shape meat mixture into four oval loaves. Place, side-by-side, in foil-lined shallow baking pan. Top with the remaining 1/4 cup barbecue sauce. Bake 30 min. or until cooked through (160 degrees F). Cut each meat loaf in half to serve.
