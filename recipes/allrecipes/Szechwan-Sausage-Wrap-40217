In large skillet, cook sausage in oil with Szechwan seasoning until well browned, stirring to break meat into small pieces. Add water chestnuts, carrots, green onions, walnuts and sherry. Cook and stir 2 to 3 minutes or until heated through. To eat, spoon about 1/2 cup sausage mixture into center of each lettuce leaf, fold up and tuck in the edges (like a fajita).
