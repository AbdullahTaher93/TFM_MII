Place the potatoes in a small, deep pot, cover with water and bring to a boil, covered, over high heat. Salt the water and cook until tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the EVOO, 2 turns of the pan, in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook until crisp, about 3 minutes, then add the turkey and break it up with a wooden spoon. Season with salt and pepper and cook until browned, about 5 minutes; push it to the side and add the onions and carrots to the center of the skillet. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, then mix everything together. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce and poultry seasoning. Lower the heat to medium and cover the pan with a foil tent to keep in some of the moisture. Cook for 6 to 7 minutes. Preheat the broiler to high. Drain the potatoes in a colander and return them to the warm pot. Using a pot holder to hold the pot, add 1/3 cup cream, salt and pepper, the egg, butter and chives and smash away with a masher until the potatoes are almost smooth but still a little lumpy. Remove the foil from the pan and stir in the peas and the remaining 1/3 cup cream. Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan and turn off the heat. Scrape the turkey mixture into a casserole dish and top with the potatoes. Broil until the top is golden brown. Sprinkle with the paprika.
