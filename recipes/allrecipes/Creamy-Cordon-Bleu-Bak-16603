Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place chicken breasts in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour soups over the chicken. Then spread the ham around and over the soups. Top all with the cheese and cracker crumbs. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 50 minutes, making sure chicken is fully cooked.
