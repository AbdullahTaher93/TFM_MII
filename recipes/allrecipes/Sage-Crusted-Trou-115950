Heat the broiler. Generously butter a baking sheet. Arrange the trout fillets, skin side down, on the prepared baking sheet. In a small bowl, combine melted butter, sage, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Using a pastry brush, coat each fillet with seasoned butter, and then sprinkle breadcrumbs on top. Broil fillets as close to the heat as possible, turning the baking sheet as needed for even cooking, until the fish is golden brown on top, 6 to 8 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges on the side.
