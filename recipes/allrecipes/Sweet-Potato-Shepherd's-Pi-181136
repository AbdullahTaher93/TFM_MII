Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Microwave potatoes in small microwaveable bowl on HIGH 4 min or until tender. Mash until smooth, gradually adding cream cheese spread and mixing until well blended after each addition. Set aside. Cook meat with mushrooms and onions in dressing in large skillet until meat is browned, stirring occasionally. Drain. Meanwhile, mix flour and water in medium bowl until well blended. Add to meat mixture; cook an additional 2 min. or until slightly thickened, stirring constantly. Add beans; mix lightly. Spoon into two 2-cup ramekins; top evenly with potato mixture, spreading to evenly cover meat mixture in each dish. Bake 15 min. or until casseroles are heated through and tops are lightly browned.
