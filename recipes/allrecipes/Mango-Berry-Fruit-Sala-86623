Place 1 mango and the raspberry vinaigrette dressing in a blender, and blend until liquefied. In a bowl, toss the remaining mango, salad greens, cilantro, and onion. Drizzle with the dressing mixture. Top each serving with equal amounts of raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, blueberries, and hazelnuts. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
