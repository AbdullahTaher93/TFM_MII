Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil and add potatoes, mushrooms, onion, and green pepper. Reduce heat to low; cook vegetables at a simmer until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Drain. Place boiled vegetables back into the pot and raise heat to medium. Stir half-and-half, clams with their juice, cream of mushroom soup, butter, and parsley into vegetables; bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low and simmer until thickened, about 30 minutes; stir often. Season with salt, black pepper, and seafood seasoning.
