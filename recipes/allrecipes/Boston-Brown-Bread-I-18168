In a large bowl, mix together sugar, raisins, baking soda, salt, margarine and boiling water. Cover and let stand overnight. The following day, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Beat egg and flour into raisin mixture. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean.
