Bring the beef broth, water, and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook 5 minutes. Stir in the green onions, mushrooms, green beans, and tarragon; continue cooking until the green beans are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the evaporated milk, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Simmer 2 more minutes until heated through.
