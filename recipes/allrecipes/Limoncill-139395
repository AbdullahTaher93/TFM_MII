In large glass jar or bottle, combine vodka and lemon peel. Seal and let stand in cool, dark place 1 week. If using lemon leaves, in medium saucepan, bring 4 cups water to boil. Add leaves and blanch 10 seconds, then drain and rinse under cold running water. Pat dry. In medium saucepan, whisk together 2 cups water and sugar. Bring to boil over high heat, then boil, uncovered, 15 seconds. Measure 750 milliliters of syrup (reserve remainder for another use) and stir into vodka mixture. Strain mixture, discarding lemon peel, and pour into decorative bottles. If using lemon leaves, tuck 2 into each bottle. Seal bottles with stoppers or corks and label with year.
