In large bowl, combine chocolate crumbs, walnuts, raisins and powdered sugar; mix well. Add liqueur and syrup; mix well to make a stiff mixture. Form into 1-inch balls. Place on waxed paper. Let stand 1 hour to set. Combine vanilla chips and oil in small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on HIGH 30 to 45 seconds or until melted, stirring once during cooking. Dip tops of balls in melted chips, or drizzle over balls. Store in air-tight container for several hours to allow flavor to develop.
