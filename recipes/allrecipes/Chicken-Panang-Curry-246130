Heat a wok or large skillet over medium-low heat. Add curry paste; fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in coconut milk. Bring to a slow boil. Stir in chicken, fish sauce, brown sugar, Thai seasoning, and garlic. Simmer until sauce starts to thicken and chicken is cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Stir red bell pepper into the wok; cook until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Add lemongrass and basil; stir to distribute flavors, about 1 minute.
