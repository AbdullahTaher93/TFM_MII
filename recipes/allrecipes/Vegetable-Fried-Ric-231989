Heat oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook egg in hot wok, stirring continually, until no longer moist, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer egg to a plate and return wok to heat. Cook ginger and garlic in skillet until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add teriyaki sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, salt, and red pepper flakes to the ginger and garlic; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and continue to cook another 2 minutes. Crumble cold rice into the wok. Stir rice with a wooden spoon, breaking rice into individual grains as it warms; add peas, carrots, broccoli, and green onion. Cook and stir mixture until the vegetables are tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Fold scrambled egg into the rice mixture; cook and stir until egg is reheated, 1 to 2 minutes more.
