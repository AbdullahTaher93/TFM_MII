Heat a skillet over medium-low heat. Pour olive oil into skillet gradually, sliding skillet away from burner if oil begins to splatter. Add garlic; cook until sizzling but not brown, about 1 minute. Turn off heat, leaving skillet on burner. Stir in extra-virgin olive oil, basil, and oregano. Transfer to container and store in refrigerator until flavors blend, 8 hours to overnight.
