Whisk flour with 2 tablespoons milk in a small bowl until smooth. Heat the remaining milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until steaming. Add the flour mixture and cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce bubbles and thickens, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in Cheddar, dry mustard, paprika, cayenne (if using) and salt.
