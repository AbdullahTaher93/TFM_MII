In a 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat, bring 4 quarts water to a boil. While water heats, rinse chicken and pat dry. Cut chicken crosswise into 1/4-inch-wide strips. When water boils, add noodles and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender to bite, about 3 minutes. Drain noodles and return to pan. Meanwhile, pour oil into a 12- to 14-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add onion, mushrooms, and garlic; stir often until onion and mushrooms begin to brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Add chicken and stir until no longer pink in center (cut to test), about 3 minutes. Add rice wine, rice vinegar, and soy sauce; cook to blend flavors, 1 to 2 minutes more. Add chicken mixture to noodles in pan and stir over medium-high heat until hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Divide equally among individual bowls, sprinkle with green onion, and serve.
