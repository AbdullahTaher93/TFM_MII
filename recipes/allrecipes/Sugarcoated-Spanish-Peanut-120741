In a large saucepan, combine the first four ingredients. Cook and stir over medium heat for 20 minutes or until almost all of the liquid is absorbed. Spread into a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan; sprinkle with salt. Bake at 350 degrees F for 24-26 minutes or until peanuts are well coated, stirring two to three times. Remove to a waxed paper-lined baking sheet to cool completely. Store in an airtight container.
