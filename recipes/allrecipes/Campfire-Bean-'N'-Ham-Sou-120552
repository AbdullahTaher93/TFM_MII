Place beans in an ovenproof Dutch oven; add enough water to cover by 2 in. Bring to a boil; boil for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat; cover and let stand for 1 hour. Chop one onion; slice the second onion and separate into rings. Drain and rinse beans, discarding liquid. Return beans to the pan. Add onions and remaining ingredients. Cover pan and place on the grill rack over indirect medium heat. Cover grill; cook for 1 hour or until beans are almost tender. Uncover the Dutch oven; cover grill and cook 30 minutes longer or until beans are tender. Discard ham hocks.
