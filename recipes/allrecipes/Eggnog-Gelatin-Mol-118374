In a large saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over cold water; let stand for 1 minute. Stir 1 cup eggnog, sugar and nutmeg into gelatin mixture. Cook over medium-low heat until gelatin and sugar are dissolved, stirring occasionally. Add remaining eggnog. Refrigerate until slightly thickened, about 1 hour. Fold in cream. Transfer to a 7-cup mold coated with nonstick cooking spray. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or until firm. Meanwhile, for compote, in a saucepan, combine the sugar and water. Bring to a boil and stir until sugar is dissolved. Add the cranberries and boil for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Sprinkle gelatin over cold water; let stand for 1 minute. Stir into cranberry mixture until gelatin is dissolved. Remove from the heat; stir in apple and walnuts. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Serve with the eggnog gelatin.
