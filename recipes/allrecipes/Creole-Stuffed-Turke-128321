In a large bowl, combine the first 10 ingredients; add enough chicken broth to moisten. Just before baking, stuff the turkey. Skewer openings; tie drumsticks together. Place on a rack in a roasting pan. Bake at 325 degrees for 3-1/2 to 4 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees for the turkey and 165 degrees for the stuffing. When the turkey begins to brown, cover lightly with a tend of aluminum foil and baste if needed. Remove all stuffing.
