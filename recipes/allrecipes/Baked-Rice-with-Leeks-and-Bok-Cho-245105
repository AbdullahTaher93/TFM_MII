Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Heat oil in a large oven-proof skillet over medium-high. Add leeks and cook until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook another 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in rice and continue stirring until rice is coated with oil. Pour in wine, and bring to a gentle boil over medium heat. Cook until rice absorbs almost all of the liquid, about 1 minute. Add Swanson(R) Chicken Broth, and bring to a boil. Cover skillet; transfer to oven. Bake 10 minutes. Gently stir in bok choy. Continue baking until rice absorbs all of the liquid, about 10 minutes. Remove skillet from oven; stir, and let stand, covered, for 10 minutes before serving.
