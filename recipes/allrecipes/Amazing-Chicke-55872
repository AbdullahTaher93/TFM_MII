Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a shallow baking dish. Season chicken breasts. Coat chicken on all sides with mayonnaise, and roll in bread crumbs until coated. Place coated breasts into the prepared pan. Bake uncovered for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until chicken is no longer pink in the middle and the juices run clear.
