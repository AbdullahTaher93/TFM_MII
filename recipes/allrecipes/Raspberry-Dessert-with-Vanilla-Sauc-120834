In a saucepan, combine the raspberries, orange juice and tapioca; let stand for 15 minutes. Stir in sugar and salt. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat. Stir 1/2 cup of hot mixture into the egg; return all to the pan, stirring constantly. Cook and stir over medium-low heat for 2-3 minutes or just until the sauce thickens slightly and reaches 160 degrees F (do not boil). Remove from the heat. Stir in vanilla. Pour into a bowl; press a piece of waxed paper or plastic wrap over top of sauce. Refrigerate until serving. Divide raspberry mixture between four dessert dishes; top with vanilla sauce.
