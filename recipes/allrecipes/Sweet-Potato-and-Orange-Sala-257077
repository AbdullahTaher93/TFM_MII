Place sweet potato into a microwave steamer with a rack; add water. Cook in the microwave until sweet potato is soft but not mushy, about 8 minutes. Set aside until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes. Peel cooled sweet potato and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Cut each orange segment into 3 pieces. Place sweet potato and orange pieces in a bowl; add raisins. Mix lemon juice and honey together in a bowl; pour over potato-orange mixture. Add a pinch of salt and sprinkle walnuts over salad.
