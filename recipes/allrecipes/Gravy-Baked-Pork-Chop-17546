Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Season pork chops with salt and pepper to taste. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Saute the pork chops in the butter for about 5 minutes per side. In a separate medium bowl, combine the milk, water and soup. Place the pork chops in a 9x13 inch baking dish and pour the soup mixture over the chops. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes.
