Mix flour, almonds and baking powder in small bowl; set aside. Beat Fleischmann's and granulated sugar in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add egg and vanilla; mix well. Add flour mixture; beat until well blended. Divide dough into four equal portions; wrap individually with plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray baking sheet with cooking spray. Place one portion of dough between two sheets of waxed paper; roll to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut into round shapes with 2-1/2-inch cookie cutter. Place, 1 inch apart, on prepared baking sheet. Cut three (1/4-inch) circles from half of the cookies using a sharp knife. Repeat with remaining dough. Bake 8 to 10 minutes or just until edges are browned lightly. Remove to wire racks; cool completely. Assemble cookies by spreading 2 teaspoons preserves onto each solid cookie; top with 1 cut-out cookie. Sift confectioners' sugar over assembled cookies. Store in airtight container at room temperature.
