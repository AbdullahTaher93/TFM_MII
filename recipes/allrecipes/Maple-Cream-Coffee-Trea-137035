Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In ungreased 13x9-inch pan, combine brown sugar, nuts, syrup and 1/4 cup margarine; spread evenly in bottom of pan. In small bowl, combine cream cheese, powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons margarine; mix until smooth. Stir in coconut. Separate dough into 20 biscuits. Press or roll each to form 4-inch round. Spoon 1 tablespoon cream cheese mixture down center of each round to within 1/4 inch of edge. Overlap sides of dough over filling, forming finger-shaped rolls. Arrange rolls, seam side down, in 2 rows of 10 rolls each over brown sugar mixture in pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25 to 30 minutes or until deep golden brown. Cool 3 to 5 minutes; invert onto serving platter.
