Thaw dough and let rise according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a skillet over medium heat, cook sausage until no longer pink. Remove sausage with a slotted spoon and set aside. In the drippings, saute the broccoli, tomatoes and onion until crisp-tender; drain and cool. On a lightly floured surface, roll each loaf of dough into a 12-in. x 10-in. rectangle. Spread sausage lengthwise down the center third of each rectangle. Top with broccoli mixture and cheese. Fold the short sides in 1 in.; pinch to seal. Fold long sides over filling; pinch to seal. Place seam side down on a greased baking sheet. Brush egg over top and sides of each loaf. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.
