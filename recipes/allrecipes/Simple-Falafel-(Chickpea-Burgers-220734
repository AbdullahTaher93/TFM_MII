Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Mash garbanzo beans, whole-wheat flour, garlic, wheat germ, onion, soy sauce, and salt together in a bowl until well combined. Shape garbanzo bean mixture into 12 one-inch balls and place on prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 15 minutes; flip and bake for an additional 5 minutes. Mix sour cream and salsa together in a bowl for the dip.
