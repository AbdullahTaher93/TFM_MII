Pour water into a large kettle, and add bouillon cubes. Mix together the salt, garlic, Italian seasoning, black pepper, oregano, basil, and red pepper flakes on a large plate. Rub roast with 1/2 cup vegetable oil. Roll roast in seasoning mixture until well coated. Place the roast in the kettle along with any left over seasoning mixture and oil. Bring water to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer approximately 3 1/2 hours. Meat should be tender and well done.
