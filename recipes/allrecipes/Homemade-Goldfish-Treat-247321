Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll dough onto a lightly floured work surface and cut into desired shapes using a cookie cutter. If you choose to use a fish cut-out, use a toothpick to make faces.
