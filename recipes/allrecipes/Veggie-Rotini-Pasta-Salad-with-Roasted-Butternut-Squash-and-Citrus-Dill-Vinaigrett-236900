Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the pasta one minute less than required; drain and toss with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Place on sheet tray to cool down. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Mix butternut squash and onions with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place on a baking sheet and roast in preheated oven until slightly browned and thoroughly cooked. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool down. In a blender combine mustard, dill, orange and lemon juices; blend to combine. Slowly drizzle in the remaining olive oil, season with salt and pepper to taste. In a large bowl combine the pasta with the vinaigrette, then fold in the roasted squash and onions. Top with shredded cheese and dill.
