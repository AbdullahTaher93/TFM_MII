Cook the beef, garlic, and onion in a large pot over medium-high heat until the beef has browned; stirring often to break up the meat. Stir in the sauce mix, tomato sauce, and tomato paste. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for about 30 minutes, adding water to thin if needed. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
