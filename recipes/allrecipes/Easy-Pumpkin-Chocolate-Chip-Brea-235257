Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a loaf pan. Stir flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. Whisk pumpkin, butter, and eggs together in a separate bowl. Stir in chocolate chips. Fold pumpkin mixture into flour mixture. Pour pumpkin batter into prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean, 1 hour.
