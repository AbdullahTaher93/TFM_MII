Place English muffins on serving platter. Heat Canadian bacon in large nonstick skillet over medium high heat for 3 minutes or until hot. Place one piece of bacon on each muffin half, cover to keep warm. Meanwhile make the hollandaise. Separate eggs. Stir egg yolks and lemon juice together in 1 1/2 quart saucepan until smooth. Add half of the cold butter. Heat over very low heat, stirring constantly with a whisk until butter is melted. Add remaining butter. Continue stirring vigorously until butter is melted and sauce is thickened. Remove from heat and stir in chives, cover to keep warm. Scramble eggs. Beat remaining egg whites and whole eggs with milk, salt and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Melt butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add egg mixture. As mixture begins to set at bottom and side, gently lift cooked portions with spatula so that uncooked portion can flow to bottom. Cook 3 to 4 minutes or until egg mixture has thickened but is still moist. Top bacon with scrambled eggs. Spoon hollandaise evenly over eggs.
