Melt the butter in skillet over medium-high heat. Add the Brussels sprouts and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sprouts are browned in spots, about 5 minutes. Pour in the cream, and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the sprouts are tender and easily pierced with a fork, 30 to 35 minutes. The cream will have reduced in volume, and will have taken on a creamy beige color. Remove the lid, and stir in the lemon juice. Allow the sprouts to simmer a few minutes more until the cream thickens and coats the sprouts. Season to taste with additional salt and lemon juice before serving.
