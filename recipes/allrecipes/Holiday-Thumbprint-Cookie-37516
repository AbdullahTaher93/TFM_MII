Beat butter in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed to soften. Gradually add powdered sugar and salt, beating until light and fluffy. Beat in vanilla. Stir in flour and cereal. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Place on ungreased cookie sheets. Make an indentation in center of each ball. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from cookie sheets. Cool on wire racks. Fill indentations with jam. Sprinkle with additional powdered sugar, if desired.
