In a small bowl, beat egg yolk with 1 teaspoon water. Crumble cheese, and blend with green onions and egg. Cut pastry into twelve 3 inch squares. Place a mounded tablespoon of filling in the center of each square. Moisten edges with water, and fold pastry over filling to form a triangle. Press edges together firmly with a fork to seal. Brush tops lightly with egg mixture. Cover, and chill until ready to bake. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees) for 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve warm, or at room temperature.
