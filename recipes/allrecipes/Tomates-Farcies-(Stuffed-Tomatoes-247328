Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice tops off the tomatoes and reserve. Scoop out the pulp with a spoon and place, with juices, in a bowl. Sprinkle some salt into each tomato and set upside down in a casserole dish to drain excess juice. Chop tomato flesh into smaller pieces and place in the casserole dish. Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, herbes de Provence, garlic powder, and black pepper in the bowl; mix together with your hands. Turn tomatoes over and stuff them with beef mixture so that a small amount rises over the top. Cover with reserved tops. Roll up any leftover beef mixture into small bowls and place in the casserole dish. Bake in the preheated oven until tomatoes are tender and beef is cooked through, 40 to 45 minutes.
