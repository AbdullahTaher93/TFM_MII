In a large pot, combine bell pepper, onion, celery (reserve leaves for garnish), broccoli, corn, chicken and garlic. Season with basil, oregano, rosemary, parsley, salt and pepper. Stir bouillon into mixture and pour in enough water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
