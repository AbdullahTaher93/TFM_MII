Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Transfer to a large bowl. Stir tomatoes, bacon, and romaine lettuce into bow tie pasta. Whisk mayonnaise, ranch dressing, onion powder, garlic salt, and black pepper together in a small bowl. Pour over pasta mixture; toss to coat. Chill in refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours before serving.
