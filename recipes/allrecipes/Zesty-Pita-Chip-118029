In a small bowl, combine the Italian seasoning, paprika and garlic powder. Cut each pita half into six pieces; place on an ungreased baking sheet. Spray both sides of wedges with nonstick cooking spray; sprinkle wedges with seasoning mixture. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown, turning halfway through baking time. Cool on wire racks.
