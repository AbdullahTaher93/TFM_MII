Dissolve coffee granules in warmed half-and-half; set aside. Beat margarine with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Stir vanilla and salt into the creamed margarine. Beat sugar into the margarine mixture in small amounts until fully incorporated. Stream half-and-half into the mixture while beating continually until all liquid is integrated into a spreadable frosting.
