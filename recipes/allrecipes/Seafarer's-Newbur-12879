Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (225 degrees C). Arrange tater tots on a baking sheet. Bake tater tots 15 to 17 minutes, or until crispy and heated through. In a medium size skillet, heat butter over a medium heat. Stir in flour and salt until blended. Gradually stir in milk, sherry, and soup. Stir constantly until sauce is thickened and smooth; 3 minutes. Stir shrimp, celery, and cheese into the sauce. Bring the mixture to a boil; stirring often. Serve the sauce over the hot tater tots.
