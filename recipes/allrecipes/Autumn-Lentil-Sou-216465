Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in the onions and garlic; cook until the onions soften, turn translucent, and begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Pour in the white wine, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer 10 minutes. Stir in the lentils, chicken stock, Italian seasoning, parsley, garlic powder, and dried onion. Bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the lentils are very tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Season to taste with salt and black pepper before serving.
