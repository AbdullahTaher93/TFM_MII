Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir potatoes into onion mixture and cook until potatoes are lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir kale into potato mixture and drizzle in sesame oil. Cook and stir until kale is wilted, about 2 minutes. Stir black beans and sun-dried tomatoes into kale-potato mixture; pour in chicken broth. Simmer soup until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.
