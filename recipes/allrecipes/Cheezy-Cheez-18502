Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and place in a microwave-safe bowl. Sprinkle the Cheddar and mozzarella cheeses over the macaroni, then microwave on medium-high power in 30 second intervals until the cheese has melted. Stir to distribute the cheese evenly and serve.
