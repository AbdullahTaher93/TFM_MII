Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Unroll dough; divide into 2 equal sections along center perforation. Place 1 inch apart in ungreased 15x10x1-inch baking pan or 13x9-inch (3-quart) glass baking dish. Press perforations to seal. Spread garlic spread from container evenly over each dough section. Bake at 375 degrees F for 9 to 11 minutes or until light golden brown. Remove crusts from oven. Top each partially baked crust with ham, cheese, tomato and olives. Return to oven; bake an additional 5 minutes or until cheese is melted and edges are golden brown. To serve, cut each topped crust into 9 squares. Sprinkle with basil; drizzle with salad dressing. Serve warm.
