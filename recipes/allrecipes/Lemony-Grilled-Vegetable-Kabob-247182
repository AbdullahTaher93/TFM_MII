Cut any large vegetables into 1-inch pieces. Thread vegetables onto skewers. Whisk remaining ingredients in small bowl. Heat grill. Brush lemon mixture onto kabobs. Grill 10 to 15 minutes until vegetables are desired tenderness, turning as necessary to cook evenly. Drizzle with any leftover lemon mixture. Serve warm.
