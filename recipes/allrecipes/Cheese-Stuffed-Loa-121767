In a bowl, combine the first seven ingredients; mix well. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. On a large piece of heavy-duty foil, pat beef mixture into a 10-in. x 6-in. rectangle. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese to within 1/2 in. of edges. Roll up, jelly-roll style, starting with a short side and peeling away foil while rolling. Seal seam and ends. Place seams side down in a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes or until meat is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing.
