Combine sugar, orange juice, vinegar, ginger, orange zest, shallot, cinnamon sticks, and salt together in a skillet; bring mixture to a boil. Cook and stir until mixture thickens and sugar has dissolved, 8 to 10 minutes. Add cranberries; continue cooking and stirring until cranberries pop, about 10 more minutes. Remove from heat. Heat vegetable oil in a small pan over medium heat; add mustard seeds. Cook and stir until mustard seeds begin to toast and pop, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir seeds into chutney. Serve chilled or at room temperature.
