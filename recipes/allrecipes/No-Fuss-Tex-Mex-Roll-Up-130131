Brown meat in large nonstick skillet on medium-high heat; drain. Stir in peppers and chili powder; cook 5 minutes or until peppers are crisp-tender, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat. Stir in sour cream and 1/4 cup of the cheese. Spoon about 1/3 cup meat mixture onto each tortilla. Roll up and arrange in 13x9-inch baking pan. Drizzle with dressing; top with salsa and remaining cheese. Broil, 4 to 6 inches from heat source, 3 to 5 min. or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
