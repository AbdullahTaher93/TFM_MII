Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine sweet potatoes, cauliflower, black pepper, olive oil, curry powder, maple syrup, garlic, thyme, and salt together in a bowl until evenly coated; spread onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are tender and lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
