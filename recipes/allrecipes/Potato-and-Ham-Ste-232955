Combine ham bone, potatoes, onion, sweet peas, ham, carrots, and celery in a large pot; pour in enough water to cover all ingredients. Pour in coconut and season with salt and pepper. Bring soup to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until flavors have blended, about 4 hours. Discard ham bone before serving.
