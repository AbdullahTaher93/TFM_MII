Shredded cabbage finely. Slice Greek olives. Peel cucumber, cut in half, and slice. Cut the onion into slivers. In a medium-size mixing bowl, add the oregano, dill weed, dill seed, and vinegar. Let it sit for about five minutes so that the flavors can meld. Add the cabbage, olives, cucumber, red onion, and feta cheese. Toss together, cover and refrigerate for one hour. Serve
