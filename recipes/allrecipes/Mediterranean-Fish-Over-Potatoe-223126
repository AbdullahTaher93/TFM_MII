Place oil in large saute pan, add potatoes and water, then cover; cook and stir on medium-high 5-6 minutes or until potatoes are tender and water is absorbed. Remove pits from olives; chop olives coarsely. Reduce heat to medium. Arrange potatoes evenly into a single layer; sprinkle with olives, salt, and pepper. Place fish (darker side up) on potatoes. Squeeze juice of one half lemon over fish. Drain tomatoes very thoroughly (press tightly to remove as much liquid as possible). Spread tomatoes over fish and sprinkle with feta cheese, then cover; cook 4-6 minutes, without turning or stirring, or until fish is opaque and flakes easily. Reduce heat to low and remove cover; cook 1-2 minutes to allow any extra liquid to evaporate. Serve.
