Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir rice and garlic in hot oil until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir chicken broth, lime juice, and salt into rice; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover the saucepan with a lid, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Stir cilantro, corn, green onions, and lime zest into rice until well-mixed.
