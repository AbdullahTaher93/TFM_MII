Place eggs in a medium saucepan with enough cold water to cover, and bring to a boil. Cover saucepan, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel, and chop. In a large bowl, mix eggs, mayonnaise, pepper, and paprika. Mash with a potato masher or fork until smooth. Gently stir in the olives. Refrigerate until serving.
