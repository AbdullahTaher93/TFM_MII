Mix the steak seasoning, garlic salt, black pepper, and chili powder in a small bowl. Rub the ribs all over with the seasoning mix, and place into the bottom of a slow cooker. Pour in barbecue sauce, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, orange juice, and hot pepper sauce. Liquid should not cover the ribs all the way. Set the cooker to Low, and cook until ribs are tender, about 8 hours.
