Place radishes (or daikon), carrot and onion in a medium bowl. Cover with cold water and let soak for 5 minutes. Drain. Combine soy sauce, lemon juice, scallions and ginger in a small bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of the mixture to the drained vegetables and toss. Set aside the remaining sauce. Season steak on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the steak 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Let rest on a cutting board for 5 minutes, then thinly slice and serve with the vegetables, drizzled with the reserved sauce.
