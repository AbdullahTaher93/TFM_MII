In a large saucepan, combine the lentils, water, allspice, and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 25 minutes, or until the lentils are tender but still hold their shape. Remove from the heat and stir in 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds, or until fragrant. Add the tomatoes, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes, or until the tomatoes just start to release their juices. Remove from the heat. Drain the lentils and place in a shallow serving dish. Spoon the tomato mixture over the lentils, top with the yogurt, and sprinkle with the chives or scallion greens.
