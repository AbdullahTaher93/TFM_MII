Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread pine nuts onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until pine nuts are fragrant and lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add tomatoes, artichoke hearts, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover skillet, and simmer until tomatoes have softened, about 40 minutes. Stir toasted pine nuts, basil, and Parmesan cheese into sauce; simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes.
