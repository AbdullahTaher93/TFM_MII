Place a 10-inch ovenproof frying pan in a 500 degrees F oven for 5 minutes. Swirl oil in pan. With tongs, roll asparagus in oil. Bake until tender-crisp to bite, 5 to 7 minutes. Drizzle with vinegar; add salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately, or chill and bring to room temperature before serving. Scatter parmesan curls on top to serve, if desired.
