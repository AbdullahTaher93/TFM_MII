Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Generously grease a 9x9 inch glass baking dish. In a bowl, mix cranberries, marmalade, and cloves. Make a pocket in each pork chop by cutting into pork toward the bone; fill pockets with cranberry mixture. Place the pork chops in prepared baking pan. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon 1 tablespoon honey over each chop. Bake uncovered about 45 minutes or until pork is no longer pink in the center.
