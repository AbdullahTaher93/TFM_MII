Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir mushrooms, onion, and garlic into the melted butter, increase heat to medium-high, and cook and stir the mixture until the mushrooms are golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir Marsala wine, chicken stock, brown sugar, lemon juice, molasses, and corn syrup into the mushroom mixture; bring to a boil and cook, stirring frequently, until the liquid reduces by about half, 10 to 15 minutes. Whisk cornstarch into cold water in a small bowl. Stream the cornstarch slurry into the Marsala sauce, stirring continually; cook and stir until the sauce thickens, another 10 to 15 minutes. Heat olive oil with 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook chicken until golden brown until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Arrange each chicken breast into the center of a plate. Drizzle Marsala sauce over each chicken breast; garnish with green onion to serve.
