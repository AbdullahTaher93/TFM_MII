Cut tops of peppers off just below the stem and remove seeds. Place peppers upright in a microwaveable 8x8-inch baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave on high 5 minutes. Slice tops off of the peppers, removing seeds and membrane. Set aside, covered, while preparing filling. In a large bowl, stir together rice, corn, carrot, sausage, green onion and 1/4 cup of the cheese with the KC Masterpiece(R) Original Barbecue Sauce. Spoon 1/4 of the rice mixture into each pepper. Top with remaining cheese. Microwave on high 5-7 minutes or until peppers are softened and cheese is melted.
