Place the broth in a small saucepan and keep warm over medium-low heat. Preheat the broiler to high. Heat 1 tablespoon of EVOO, 1 turn of the pan, with 1 tablespoon of the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. When the pan is hot, add the onion and garlic and cook for 2 minutes, then add the rice and cook for 1 minute. Add the wine and cook it away. Add a few ladles of broth, stirring occasionally and adding more as needed until the risotto is starchy, creamy and al dente, about 22 minutes. Ten minutes before the risotto is done, drizzle the chops with EVOO, season with salt and pepper and arrange on a slotted broiler pan. Place 6 to 8 inches under the broiler and cook for about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.
