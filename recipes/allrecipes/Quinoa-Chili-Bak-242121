Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 9-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add past and olive oil and cook at a boil, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 6 to 9 minutes; drain. Return pasta to the pot; add chili and tomato sauce and stir. Pour the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish; top with layers of mozzarella cheese and Cheddar cheese, respectively. Cook in preheated oven until cheese is completely melted, about 15 minutes.
