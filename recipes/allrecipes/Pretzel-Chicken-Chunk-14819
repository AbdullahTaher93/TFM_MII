Cut the skinless, boneless chicken breast halves into 1 inch cubes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. In a small bowl, combine mustard, honey, cayenne pepper and garlic salt. Mix together, and set 1/2 of mixture aside to be used as dipping sauce. Coat chicken chunks completely in remaining mustard mixture, and then in pretzel crumbs. Place coated chicken on prepared cookie sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve with reserved mustard dip.
