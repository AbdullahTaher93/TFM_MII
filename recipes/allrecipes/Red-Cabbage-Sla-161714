Toss together cabbage and carrots in large bowl. Cook bacon and onion in medium skillet over medium heat, stirring often, until bacon is crisp. Remove from heat; drain and discard drippings. Add coleslaw dressing to onion mixture, stirring to scrape up any browned bits from bottom of skillet. Pour warm dressing over cabbage; toss. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours. Toss again just before serving.
