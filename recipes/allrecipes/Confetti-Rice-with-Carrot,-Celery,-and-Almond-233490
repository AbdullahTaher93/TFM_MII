Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir rice into butter; cook and stir until the rice is just browned, about 5 minutes. Pour consomme and salt over the rice; bring to a boil. Pour the rice mixture into a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish. Bake rice in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Stir green onions, carrots, celery, and almonds through the rice; continue baking until rice is completely tender, about 10 minutes more.
