Process the 'chicken' in a food processor and then transfer it to a medium mixing bowl. Run the celery, onion and green pepper through the processor. Add the vegetables to the mixing bowl and stir in the eggs, stuffing, salt and pepper; mix well. Form into patties. In a medium frying pan heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Fry patties on each side until browned.
