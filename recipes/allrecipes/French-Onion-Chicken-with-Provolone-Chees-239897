Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook chicken in skillet Cook the chicken longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer cooked chicken to a 13x9-inch baking dish; top each with a slice of provolone cheese. Pour soup over the chicken and cheese. Bake in preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the soup hot, about 20 minutes.
