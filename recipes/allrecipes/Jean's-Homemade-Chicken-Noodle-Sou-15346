In a large pot over medium heat combine the broth, water, carrots, celery and ground black pepper and allow to cook. In a medium skillet over medium high heat, combine the ginger, oil and chicken. Saute for about 5 minutes and remove the sliced ginger. Add the chicken to the broth mixture, bring to a boil and then add the egg noodles. Continue to cook over medium heat for about 15 minutes until noodles and vegetables are tender.
