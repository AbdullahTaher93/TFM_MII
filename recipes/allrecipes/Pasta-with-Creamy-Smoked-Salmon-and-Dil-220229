Fill a large pot with water. Add sea salt to taste, and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until pasta is cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain penne well, and reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water. Return penne and reserved cup of pasta water to the empty pot and place over medium-low heat. Stir smoked salmon, cream cheese, dill, green onions, Dijon mustard, lemon zest, lemon juice, and black pepper into pasta until cream cheese is melted, 4 to 5 minutes.
