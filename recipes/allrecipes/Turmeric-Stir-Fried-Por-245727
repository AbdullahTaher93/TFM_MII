Coat pork slices with turmeric and salt. Mix in 1 tablespoon olive oil; set aside to marinate, 15 minutes. Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat. Pour in remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil and heat until shimmering. Add pork slices to the wok in an even layer and let cook, without stirring, until juices run, 2 to 3 minutes. Toss and stir pork until opaque, about 2 minutes more. Push pork to the sides of the wok and let juices and oil flow back to the center of the wok and heat up, 10 to 15 seconds. Stir the pork back into the hot oil until sizzling, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat this process twice more, until pork is golden brown. Push pork to the sides of the wok; add onion. Cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add Worcestershire sauce and toss to coat onions. Mix pork back into the onion mixture. Add the frozen vegetables and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.
