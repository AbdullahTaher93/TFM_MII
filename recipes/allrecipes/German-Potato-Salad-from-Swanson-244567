Heat the potatoes and broth in a 6-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Cover and cook for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are tender. Stir the vinegar, onion, mustard, sugar, bacon, and parsley in a large bowl. Pour the potato and broth mixture into the bowl with the vinegar mixture and stir to coat. Let stand for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season to taste.
