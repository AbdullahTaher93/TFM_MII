Rinse chicken, pat dry, and cut each piece across the grain into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add half of the chicken and cook, stirring often, until browned on all sides (6 to 8 minutes); remove chicken pieces and repeat with remaining chicken, adding more oil if needed. When all chicken is browned and removed from pan, add onion to pan. Cook, stirring, until lightly browned (about 3 more minutes); stir in garlic. Then return chicken and any juices to pan and sprinkle with oregano. Pour in wine, stirring to loosen pan drippings. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until chicken is very tender (10 to 12 minutes). Add lemon juice, sprinkle with lemon peel, and cook, uncovered, stirring gently, for a few minutes more until most of the liquid is gone. Spoon chicken equally onto bottom halves of foccacia squares, cover with tops of rolls, and serve hot.
