For minted yogurt: Place yogurt in a colander lined with a paper towel or cheesecloth. Set in sink to drain for 30 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk thickened yogurt with 1 teaspoon water, chopped mint, coriander, garlic, olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Let stand at room temperature, covered, while pumpkin bakes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a large rimmed baking pan with foil. For pumpkin: With a sharp, heavy knife, carefully cut pumpkin in half vertically. Use a metal spoon to scrape out seeds and strings. Put each pumpkin half, cut side down, on a cutting board. Using the pumpkins natural lines as a guide, cut each half into 8 equal wedges. Peel the pumpkin with a vegetable peeler; place in a large bowl. Drizzle pumpkin with canola oil and evenly rub with sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Turn into prepared pan, scraping sugar mixture onto pumpkin. Cover tightly with foil and bake until very tender when pierced, 20 to 30 minutes. Broil pumpkin about 5 inches from heat until wedges turn deep golden brown in spots (watch to prevent burning) 3 to 5 minutes. On plates, spoon minted yogurt over pumpkin wedges. Garnish with additional mint leaves if you like.
