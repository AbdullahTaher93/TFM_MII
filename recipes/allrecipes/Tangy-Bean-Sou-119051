In a slow cooker, combine the first 10 ingredients. Cover and cook on high for 4-5 hours. For dumplings, combine the flour, cheese, cornmeal, sugar and baking powder in a bowl. In another bowl, combine the egg, milk and oil; add to dry ingredients just until moistened (batter will be stiff). Drop by heaping tablespoons onto soup. Cover and cook on high 30 minutes longer (without lifting cover) or until a toothpick inserted in a dumpling comes out clean.
