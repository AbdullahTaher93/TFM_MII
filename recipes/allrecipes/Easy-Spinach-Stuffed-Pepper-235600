Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Stir 1/2 cup stuffing and butter in a small bowl and reserve. Spray an 11x8x2-inch baking dish with the cooking spray. Arrange the pepper halves, cut-side up, in the baking dish. Stir the soup, sour cream, onion powder, spinach and Parmesan cheese in a large bowl. Add the remaining stuffing and mix lightly. Spoon about 1/2 cup spinach mixture into each pepper half. Sprinkle with the reserved stuffing mixture. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 30 minutes or until the spinach mixture is hot and bubbling. Top each with 1 tablespoon mozzarella cheese. Bake for 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted.
