Place diced bacon in large stock pot over medium-high heat. Cook until almost crisp; add onions, and cook 5 minutes. Stir in water and potatoes, and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and cook uncovered for 15 minutes, or until potatoes are fork tender. Pour in half-and-half, and add butter. Stir clams and the reserved clam liquid into the soup. Cook for 5 minutes, or until heated through. Do not allow to boil.
