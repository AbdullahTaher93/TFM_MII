Place tofu slices between two clean towels; allow tofu to drain, about 10 minutes. Cut tofu into bite-size pieces and transfer to a bowl. Stir in tomatoes and balsamic vinegar; marinate for 20 minutes. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir bell peppers and onion until just tender, about 5 minutes. Add tofu mixture, garlic powder, and salt. Cover and reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes more.
