Preheat oven to 350 degree F. Mix meat and seasoning mix. Shape into 36 (1-inch) balls; place in 15 x 10 x 1inch baking pan. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked through. Fill each taco shell with 1 meatball; drizzle with salsa. Top with 2 meatballs dipped in sour cream. Garnish with olives to make 'eyeballs.'
