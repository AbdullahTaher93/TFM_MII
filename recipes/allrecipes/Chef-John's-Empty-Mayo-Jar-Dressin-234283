Place garlic, parsley, thyme, chives, white wine vinegar, olive oil, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and herbes de Provence into a nearly empty mayonnaise jar containing at least 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise. Cover mayonnaise jar with lid and shake vigorously until mayonnaise combines with dressing ingredients to make a creamy dressing, about 2 minutes. Pour into a serving dish.
