In a 2-qt. microwave-safe bowl, combine kiwi, sugar, pineapple and lime juice. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 10-13 minutes or until mixture comes to a full rolling boil, stirring every 2 minutes. Stir in pectin. Add food coloring if desired. Pour into jars or freezer containers and cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Cover and let stand overnight or until set, but not longer than 24 hours. Refrigerate or freeze.
