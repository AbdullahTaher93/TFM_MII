Dump everything into a blender (uh, except the pork chops) and process until smooth. Pour the mixture into a large resealable plastic bag, slip in the chops, shake everything up, and toss the bag into the fridge for 2 to 4 hours. Then place the marinated pork in a broiler pan and pop it into the oven. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes, turning the chops every few minutes. They're ready when they're no longer pink at the bone.
