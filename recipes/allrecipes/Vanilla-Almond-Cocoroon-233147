Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Put coconut, almond flour, maple syrup, coconut oil, vanilla extract, almond extract, and sea salt in a food processor or blender; pulse, scraping down sides as needed, until thoroughly combined but not liquefied. Scoop mixture using a cookie scoop or spoon and form into mounds on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Turn off heat, keeping cookies in the oven until it is completely cooled and cookies are dried out, 8 hours to overnight.
