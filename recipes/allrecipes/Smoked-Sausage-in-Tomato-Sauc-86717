Place the sausage in a skillet over medium heat. Cook 5 minutes, until evenly brown. Mix the water and flour in a small bowl, until flour is dissolved. Stir into the skillet. Mix in diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, beef bouillon, and green beans. Cook 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened and beans are tender.
