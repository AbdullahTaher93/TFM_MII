Combine sugar, salt, paprika, pepper, thyme, garlic, and zest; spread on a sheet pan; let stand at room temperature overnight so sugar will be hard and dry. Grind in food processor to fine powder. Brush ribs with oil; lightly coat with sugar mixture. Preheat grill or grill pan to medium hot; grill ribs, fat side down first, until meat is just coming off the bone, 20 to 30 minutes per side. Cool slightly. Slice into individual ribs, and serve.
