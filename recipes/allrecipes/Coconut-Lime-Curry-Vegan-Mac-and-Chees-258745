Mix coconut milk, 2 cups water, vodka, onion, poblano peppers, jalapeno pepper, habanero pepper, vinegar, garlic, turmeric, salt, paprika, cumin, black pepper, coriander, ginger, basil, and cinnamon together in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer soup for 15 minutes. Stir lentils and barley into the soup; add 1 cup water. Simmer over medium heat, covered, until most of the liquid is absorbed, 5 to 10 minutes. Add additional water 1 cup at a time, as needed, until lentils and barley are nearly tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in cayenne, lime juice, and lime zest. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
