COOK: Cook pasta according to package directions, adding broccoli during last 1 minute. Rinse with cold water and drain. Meanwhile, spray medium nonstick skillet with nonstick cooking spray; heat over medium heat. CLEAN: Wash hands. Place chicken in skillet; cook 4 minutes. Turn chicken, cover and cook 4 to 7 minutes longer or until internal juices run clear. (Or insert instant-read meat thermometer in thickest part of chicken. Temperature should read 170 degrees F for breasts, 180 degrees F for thighs.) Remove chicken, cool slightly and slice. In small bowl, blend oil, lemon juice, salt, thyme and red pepper flakes. In large bowl, combine pasta, vegetables and dressing; toss to mix well and coat. Top with sliced chicken. SERVE: Serve with bakery rolls, if desired. CHILL: Refrigerate leftovers immediately.
