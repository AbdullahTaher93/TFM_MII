Cook the Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until browned and no longer pink inside, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer sausages to a plate. When cool enough to handle, cut into 1/4-inch thick slices and set aside. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghettini at a boil until tender yet firm, about 8 minutes; drain. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir asparagus pieces in the hot oil until they start to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 more minute. Mix in diced roma tomatoes, garlic salt, and black pepper; cook and stir until the tomatoes soften slightly, 1 or 2 more minutes. Remove vegetables from heat. Toss the sliced sausage in the skillet with the asparagus and tomatoes to combine; lightly mix in the spaghettini. Sprinkle the spaghettini and vegetables with Parmesan cheese.
