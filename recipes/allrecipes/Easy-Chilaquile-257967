Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add tortilla pieces to oil and fry until crisp, about 5 minutes. Pour beaten eggs over the tortilla pieces in the skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until eggs have set, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Top with taco sauce and Monterey Jack cheese.
