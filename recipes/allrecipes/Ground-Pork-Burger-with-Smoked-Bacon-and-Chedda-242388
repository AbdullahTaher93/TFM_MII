Heat charcoal or gas grill to medium. Combine ground pork, onion and hot sauce; mix well with hands. Shape into 4 (8-oz.) burgers; season with salt and pepper on both sides. Grill burgers until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F., turning after 8 minutes. Place 2 slices cheese on top of each burger to melt. Lightly toast brioche buns on grill, being careful not to burn. Place pork burgers on buns; top each with 4 half strips of bacon. Serve with lettuce, tomato, pickles, mayonnaise and mustard on the side.
