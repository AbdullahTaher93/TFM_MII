Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Prepare a baking sheet pan with the cooking spray. Mix zucchini, onions and mushrooms with the reserved oil from the sun-dried tomatoes and spread on the baking sheet. Roast in the oven for 10 minutes. Stir half way, and nicely brown. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). To assemble the NAAN pizza, spread half of each: Alfredo sauce, followed by the roasted vegetables, basil & place the meatballs flat face down, then top sun-dried tomatoes. Sprinkle with mozzarella and asiago, bake 10 minutes until the cheeses are nicely browned. Let sit for 5 minutes, slice and serve.
