Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add green beans and cook uncovered until bright green, about 3 minutes. Immerse green beans in ice water for 1 minute to stop the cooking process. Drain. Heat butter in a large skillet over medium heat until melted and bubbling, about 1 minute. Cook and stir almonds, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper in the hot butter until almonds are golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir green beans, red bell pepper, and mushrooms into the skillet; cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
