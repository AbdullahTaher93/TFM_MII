Rub potatoes with oil; place in a shallow baking pan. Bake at 400 degrees F for 1 hour or until tender. Cool. Cut in half lengthwise. Scoop out pulp, leaving a 1/4-in. shell; set shells aside. In a mixing bowl, combine pulp, butter, sour cream and milk; beat until creamy. Stir in salt, pepper and half of the pimientos and chives. Spoon or pipe filling into shells. Return to baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until lightly browned. Sprinkle with remaining pimientos and chives.
