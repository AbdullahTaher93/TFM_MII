Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Process sun-dried tomatoes and garlic in food processor with chopping blade until finely minced. Transfer to a small bowl. Stir in 1 teaspoon oil. Place breasts, smooth side down, on sheet of waxed paper. Using flat side of meat mallet, pound so they're as thin as possible without tearing. Rub the remaining oil evenly over both sides of the chicken. Season with salt and pepper. Spread half of tomato mixture on the underside of each breast, then roll tightly starting at the bottom (smooth side down). Place in small baking dish with seam side down so they don't touch. Sprinkle parsley over top. Bake until no longer pink inside, about 20 to 25 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes, then slice into five or six even slices across the breast. Fan the slices and serve immediately.
