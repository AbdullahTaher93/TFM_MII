Drain pineapple, reserving juice. Place pineapple and 2 tablespoons juice in a bowl (set the remaining juice aside for glaze). Add the egg, bread crumbs and pepper to pineapple; mix well. Add sausage and beef; mix well. Shape into 1-in. balls; place in a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake, uncovered, at 450 degrees for 12-15 minutes or until no longer pink; drain. In a large skillet, combine glaze ingredients and reserved pineapple juice. Add meatballs. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat; simmer and stir for 5-10 minutes or until heated through.
