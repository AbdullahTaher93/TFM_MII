Heat vegetable oil in a large stockpot over medium heat. Put flour into a wide, shallow dish. Dredge beef chunks in flour to coat. Cook beef in hot oil until completely browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add beef stock, hot water, green beans, tomato sauce, stewed tomatoes, carrots, potatoes, corn, celery, onion, peas, beef bouillon granules, parsley, bay leaves, thyme, chili powder, and black pepper to stockpot; stir, place a cover on the stockpot, and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook soup at a simmer, stirring periodically, for about 6 hours.
