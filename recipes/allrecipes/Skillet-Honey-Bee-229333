Heat olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add onion to skillet; season with salt and black pepper. Cook and stir onion until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Mix ground beef, egg, cheese, bread crumbs, honey, oregano, and cayenne pepper in a bowl to evenly combine; crumble beef mixture into skillet. Cook and stir beef mixture with the onion until beef is completely browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain liquid from skillet. Return skillet to medium heat. Let beef mixture cook unstirred until bread crumbs on bottom begin to get crisp, about 2 minutes. Turn and cook until remaining bread crumbs are crisp, about 2 minutes more. Repeat as needed to crisp the bread crumbs and give the dish a crunchy texture.
