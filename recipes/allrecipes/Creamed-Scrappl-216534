Heat the butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Crumble in the scrapple, and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in the flour, and cook until golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Slowly whisk in the milk, and bring to a gentle simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt, black pepper, and maple syrup.
