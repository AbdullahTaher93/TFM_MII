Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Lightly cook zucchini by tossing into pasta water just before draining. Heat butter and garlic in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir in cream and simmer for 5 minutes, then add cheese and whisk quickly, heating through. Stir in parsley. Toss sauce with cooked whole wheat fettuccine and zucchini strips.
