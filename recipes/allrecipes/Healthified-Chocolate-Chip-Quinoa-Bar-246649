Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a rimmed baking sheet. Combine quinoa flakes, almond flour, flax seeds, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Mix honey, applesauce, chocolate chips, eggs, and vanilla extract in another bowl. Add to quinoa flake mixture and mix well with your hands to combine. Press evenly on prepared baking sheet with your hands or a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 15 minutes. Cool for 20 minutes before cutting into 36 bars.
