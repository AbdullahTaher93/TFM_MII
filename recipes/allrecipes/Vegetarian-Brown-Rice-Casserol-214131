Combine soup, rice, mixed vegetables, peppers and 6 tablespoons of the cheddar cheese in a 2-quart, microwave-safe casserole or baking dish. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and level the top of the mixture. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons of cheddar cheese. Cover and cook in a microwave oven at full power until heated through and the cheese has melted (about 5 minutes). Uncover and cool for 1 minute before serving.
