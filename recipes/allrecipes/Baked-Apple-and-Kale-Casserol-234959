Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk cream of mushroom soup, yogurt, and egg together in a 9-inch square baking pan; stir in Monterey Jack cheese, kale, apples, and onion until evenly combined. Season with salt, pepper, and paprika. Cover pan with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is warmed and bubbling, about 45 minutes.
