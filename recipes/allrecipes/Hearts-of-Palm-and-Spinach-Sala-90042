In a large serving bowl, toss the spinach with hearts of palm, tomatoes, avocados, mushrooms, and almonds. Combine oil, vinegar, ketchup, garlic and sugar in a jar. Season with salt, mustard and paprika. Cover with a tight fitting lid. Shake vigorously until well blended. Before serving, pour dressing over salad, and toss to coat evenly.
