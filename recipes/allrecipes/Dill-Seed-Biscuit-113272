Heat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, dill seeds, and salt. Cut or rub in the butter until the mixture is the texture of coarse meal with a few pea-size pieces remaining. Stir in the cream with a fork just until the dough comes together. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough gently just until smooth, about 5 times. Roll the dough 3/4 inch thick. Using a 2-inch round cutter, stamp out circles of the dough. Put them, about 1/2 inch apart, on an ungreased baking sheet. Roll out the scraps in the same way. Stamp out more circles and put them on the baking sheet. Bake the biscuits in the middle of the oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
