Preheat the grill or broiler. Coat a grill rack or broiler pan with no-stick spray. To make the sauce: In a food processor or blender, combine the avocado, water, sour cream, lime juice, scallions, and cumin. Process until smooth. Season with the hot-pepper sauce or red pepper, salt, and black pepper. To make the fish: Sprinkle both sides of the halibut with the lime juice. Place on the grill rack or broiler pan. Cook 4 inches from the heat for 4 to 5 minutes per side, or until the fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Serve with the sauce and tomatoes.
