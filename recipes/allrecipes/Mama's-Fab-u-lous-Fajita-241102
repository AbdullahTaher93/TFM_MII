Whisk lime juice, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, olive oil, garlic, and cumin together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add skirt steak, onion, and red bell peppers; toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator, 30 minutes to 2 hours. Remove steak, onion, and peppers from marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade. Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat until oil shimmers. Cook and stir steak in hot oil until browned on all sides and still pink in the center, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer meat to a plate, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 minutes. Heat remaining oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and peppers in hot oil until just tender but still crisp to the bite, 5 to 6 minutes. Return meat to skillet; cook and stir until heated through.
