Place the ground beef in a large skillet over medium high heat. Saute for 10 to 15 minutes, or until browned and crumbly; set aside. In a large pot over high heat, combine the potatoes with water to cover and cook for 20 minutes, or until potatoes are almost tender. Add the mixed vegetables, onion, cabbage, tomato sauce, reserved ground beef and ground black pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Season with salt to taste.
