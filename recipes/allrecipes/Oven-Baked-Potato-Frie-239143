Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Arrange potato wedges on a baking sheet. Drizzle olive oil over the wedges; season with thyme, pepper, and salt. Turn wedges with a spatula to coat with oil and seasonings. Roast potato wedges for 15 minutes, turn, and continue roasting until soft in the center, about 15 minutes more. Transfer wedges to a platter and sprinkle cheese over them.
