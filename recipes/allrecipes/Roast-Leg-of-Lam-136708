Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place a wire rack in a shallow roasting pan. Make short, deep slits all over lamb with a sharp knife and fill with garlic slices. Rub the lamb with oil and sprinkle with oregano, thyme, salt and pepper. Transfer to the prepared pan. Roast the lamb for 1 hour. Add water to pan and roast for 15 to 20 minutes more, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 135 degrees F for medium-rare. Transfer the lamb to a serving platter, tent with foil and let rest for 15 minutes before carving. Meanwhile, skim off any fat from pan juices and pour juices into a small saucepan. Reheat gently over low heat. Carve the lamb into thin slices and serve with pan juices.
