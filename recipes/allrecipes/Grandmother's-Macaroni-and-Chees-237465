Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain. Stir macaroni, Cheddar cheese, milk, egg, mustard, hot pepper sauce, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; pour into a baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until brown and thickened, about 45 minutes.
