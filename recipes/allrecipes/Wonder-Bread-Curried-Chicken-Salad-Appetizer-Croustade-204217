Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Wonder Bread Croustades: Cut crusts from Wonder Bread and flatten with a rolling pin until quite flat, about 1/8-inch thick. Cut circles from the bread with a 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter. (You can cut 2 circles from each slice of bread.) Lightly brush mini-muffin pan with melted butter. Gently press each round of bread into a mini-muffin cup, forming it into a bowl shape. Repeat, making as many Croustades as specified in the recipe. Bake about 9 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool slightly, then remove the Croustades from the pan and allow them to cool completely on a wire rack. Curried Chicken Salad: In a medium bowl combine the sour cream, marmalade, curry powder, salt and pepper. Add the celery, green onions, red pepper and chicken breast. Stir to combine; flaking the chicken into small pieces. Gently fold in peanuts. Fill Croustades and top with a red grape half.
