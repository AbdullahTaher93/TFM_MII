In a large bowl, combine the first eight ingredients. Add pears; toss to coat. Line a 9-in. pie plate with bottom pastry; add pear filling. Roll remaining pastry into a 12-in. circle. With a fluted pastry wheel, pizza cutter or sharp knife, cut into eight 1/2-in. strips. Twist strips and position over filling parallel to each other, about 1/2-in. to 3/4 in. apart. Trim strips even with pastry edge. Seal and flute edges. Brush pastry strips with milk. Cover pie loosely with foil to prevent overbrowning. Bake at 400 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool on a wire rack.
