Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute green chile peppers, onion, bell pepper, corn, black beans, and garlic until onion and bell pepper are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. Stir chicken, 1/2 cup enchilada sauce, and black pepper into vegetable mixture. Spread 1/4 cup enchilada sauce in the bottom of an 11x17-inch casserole dish. Lightly coat 1 side of 18 tortilla quarters with sour cream and arrange, sour cream-side up, in the casserole dish. Spread 1/2 of the chicken mixture over tortilla layer. Stir green chile salsa into the remaining chicken mixture. Sprinkle 1/2 cup Mexican cheese blend over chicken mixture layer in the casserole dish; top with 10 tortilla quarters. Pour 1/4 cup enchilada sauce over tortilla layer and cover with chicken-salsa mixture; add 1/2 cup Mexican cheese blend. Lightly coat 14 tortilla quarters with sour cream and arrange, sour cream-side down, over the cheese layer. Spread 1 cup enchilada sauce over tortillas and top with remaining cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and cheese is bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes.
