Place chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl and melt in the microwave on Medium in 30-second bursts, stirring after each burst to ensure even melting, until completely melted. (Alternatively, melt the chocolate in a double boiler over hot water, stirring constantly.) Let cool slightly. Meanwhile, whisk whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Beat butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Add eggs and vanilla; beat until creamy. Add the melted chocolate; beat to combine. Stir in the dry ingredients with a spoon until just combined. Refrigerate the dough until barely chilled, 15 minutes. Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Roll tablespoonfuls of dough into 1-inch balls and place on the prepared baking sheet, 2 inches apart. Bake the cookies, one batch at a time, until puffed and slightly dried on top, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and gently press an almond into the center of each cookie. Let cool for 5 minutes on the pan before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Allow the pan to cool slightly between batches.
