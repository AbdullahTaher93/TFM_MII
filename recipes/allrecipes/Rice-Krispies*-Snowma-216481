Melt butter in a large saucepan set over low heat. Add marshmallows; cook, stirring until melted and well blended. Stir in vanilla. Add cereal; stir until coated. Divide the mixture and lightly pack into three 250 ml (1 cup) portions, three 125 ml (1/2 cup) portions and three 75 ml (1/3 cup) portions. Working quickly, with damp hands, form each portion into a firmly packed round ball with a slightly flattened bottom. Stack the balls, three high, biggest to smallest to create three figures. Spread a thin layer of frosting all over each figure. Place the coconut in a shallow dish. Roll each figure in the coconut until well coated. Use melted chocolate and M&M'S(R) Holiday Mix Chocolate candies to create 'eyes', 'noses' and 'buttons' on the figures. Wrap licorice around the base of the smallest ball as a 'scarf'. Gently push the pretzel sticks into each side of the middle balls for 'arms'.
