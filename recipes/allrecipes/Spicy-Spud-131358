Bring water to a boil in a small frying pan over high heat. Add the salt and potatoes. Reduce heat to simmer and cover. Cook 20 to 25 minutes or until the potatoes are tender throughout. Drain potatoes and transfer them to a small bowl. Drizzle with olive oil, then sprinkle with thyme, garlic, and a pinch of additional salt. Toss to coat evenly. Serve immediately.
