In a skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over a medium heat. Add the onions and cook until onions have softened. Stir in the red peppers and sour cream, and continue to cook stirring until heated through. Transfer the pepper mixture to a blender or food processor. Add the seasoning mixture and process until smooth. Preheat grill or broiler. Grill the pork for 5 to 7 minutes on each side until internal temperature reaches 160F. Let meat rest for 5 minutes covered before slicing. Serve the sauce over the sliced tenderloin.
