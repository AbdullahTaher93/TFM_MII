Whisk soy sauce, olive oil, sherry, orange juice, garlic, ginger, and Chinese five-spice powder together in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken, coat with the marinade, squeeze bag to remove excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour. Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken slices from the marinade; shake to remove excess moisture. Discard remaining marinade. Grill chicken until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 3 minutes per side.
