In a 10- to 12- inch frying pan, combine mushrooms, broth, wine, white pepper, and tarragon. Add chicken to broth mixture, cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until meat in the thickest part is no longer pink; cut to test (15 to 20 minutes). Transfer chicken to a platter and keep warm. Add cream to cooking liquid and mushrooms in pan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Then boil, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is reduced to about 1/2 cup (6 to 8 minutes). Season to taste with salt. Pour mushroom sauce over chicken. Sprinkle with parsley, if desired.
