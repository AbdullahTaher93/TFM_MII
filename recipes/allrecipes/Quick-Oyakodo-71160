Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a small saucepan. Stir in the soy sauce and brown sugar until the sugar has dissolved. Reduce heat to low; keep warm. Heat several tablespoons of the chicken sauce in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the onion and shiitake mushrooms in the sauce until the onion has softened, about 3 minutes. Add the chicken, green onions, and a few more tablespoons of the sauce; continue cooking until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes more. Spread the chicken mixture evenly over the skillet; pour the beaten egg overtop. Reduce heat to medium-low and sprinkle with the snow peas. Cook and stir until the egg has firmed and is no longer runny, about 3 minutes. Divide the rice between two bowls and spoon the egg mixture evenly overtop. Pour additional chicken sauce over the rice to serve.
