Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat; cook the onion in the hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the ground beef, bell peppers, tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and red pepper flakes to the saucepan; stir. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until the peppers are soft and the beef is tender, 4 to 6 hours.
