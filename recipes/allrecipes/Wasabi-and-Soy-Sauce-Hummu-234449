Combine about 1/2 the chickpeas, soy sauce, olive oil, lemon juice, tahini, wasabi powder, garlic, and black pepper in a blender; blend until smooth, scraping down the sides of the blender bowl with a spatula to assure ingredients fully integrated. Scrape mixture into a bowl. Put remaining chickpeas into the blender, reserving 5 to 7 individual beans for later use. Blend until smooth, adding reserved liquid from the cans if moisture is needed to get them smooth; add to the prior batch and stir. Make a shallow pool in the center of the hummus with the back of a spoon; garnish with reserved chickpeas and a small amount of olive oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour.
