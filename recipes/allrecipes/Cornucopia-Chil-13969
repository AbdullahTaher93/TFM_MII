Place beans in a large saucepan, and cover with water. Soak overnight in the refrigerator. Drain, and return to pan. Add 9 cups water; cook for 1 1/2 hours, or until tender. Meanwhile, mix textured vegetable protein and boiling water together in a large bowl. Set aside. In a large saute pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add onions; cook and stir until soft and translucent. In a large stock pot, combine beans, textured vegetable protein, onions, spices, salt, honey, molasses, chili sauce, tomato puree, and diced tomatoes. Stir to mix well. Simmer, stirring often for at least 1 hour.
