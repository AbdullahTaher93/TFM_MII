Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cook the grated carrots in enough water to cover. Boil until just soft and drain. Do not over cook! Cream the shortening and sugar together. Add the egg and mix well. Stir in the cooked carrots while still warm. Add the sifted flour, salt and baking soda and mix to combine. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto parchment paper lined baking sheets and bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 12 minutes. Let cool then frost with Orange Icing. To Make Orange Icing: Add enough confectioners' sugar to the orange juice and orange zest to make a spreading consistency. Spread icing over cooled cookies and let dry.
