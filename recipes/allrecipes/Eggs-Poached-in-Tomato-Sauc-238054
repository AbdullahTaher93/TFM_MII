Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir tomato sauce, red wine, parsley, basil, oregano, salt, pepper, bay leaf, and red pepper flakes with the onion and garlic; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook until the sauce has thickened, about 45 minutes. Crack eggs into a bowl one at a time and gently slide them into the tomato sauce; cook until beginning to firm, 2 to 3 minutes. Spoon sauce over the eggs to cover. Place a lid on the skillet and simmer until sauce has thickened, about 30 minutes.
