Place 4 highball glasses in the freezer to chill. Place chocolate ice cream in a bowl; churn with an electric mixer on low speed until softened, 15 to 20 seconds. Drizzle fudge sauce over the surface of the ice cream. Scatter chocolate sandwich cookies, toffee candy, and brownie chunks evenly on top; fold in with a spatula. Scoop chocolate ice cream mixture into the chilled glasses.
