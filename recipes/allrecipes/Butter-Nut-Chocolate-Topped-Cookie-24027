Beat butter, sugar, egg and vanilla in medium bowl until well blended. Stir together flour, baking soda and salt; add to butter mixture, beating well. If necessary, refrigerate dough until firm enough to handle. 2. Remove wrappers from chocolate pieces. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Shape dough into 1-inch balls; roll in ground nuts. Place on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until almost no imprint remains when touched lightly in center. Remove from oven; immediately press chocolate piece into center of each cookie. Carefully remove from cookie sheet to wire rack. Cool completely. Chocolate should be set before storing.
