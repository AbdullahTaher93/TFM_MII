Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2 quart casserole dish or 9 inch square inch baking dish. Set a large skillet over medium heat and coat with cooking spray. Crumble the ground turkey into the skillet and add carrots. Cook and stir until turkey is no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Add the corn, green beans and gravy; stir to blend. Set aside and keep warm. Prepare the stuffing mix according to package directions. Stir cream of mushroom soup into the stuffing along with the Cheddar cheese and cranberries. Spoon the turkey and vegetables into the prepared baking dish. Drop large spoonfuls of the stuffing on top until the vegetables are completely covered. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the top is lightly browned. Set the oven to broil, and cook for 5 minutes to crisp the top. Enjoy!
