Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, combine the ketchup, brown sugar and beer. Mix well and pour into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place the pork chops over this mixture in the dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour, or internal pork temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). (Note: Place foil over pork chops if they start to brown too quickly.)
