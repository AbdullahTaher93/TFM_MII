Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Butter and flour 18 muffin pan cups. Stir together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, ground ginger, and salt in a large bowl. Stir in the walnuts and crystallized ginger. Make a well in the center and stir in the milk, oil, and egg. Spoon the batter into the prepared cups. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool the cakes on the racks. Serve the muffins warm, with the caramel sauce spooned over the top.
