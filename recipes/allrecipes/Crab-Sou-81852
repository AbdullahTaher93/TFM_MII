In a soup pot over medium-high heat, melt the butter and add the turnips. Saute for about 2 minutes, then add the celery and saute for 1 minute and add the scallions and saute for another minute. Then add the beer, water, tomatoes (with their juices), Old Bay, lemon pepper and salt. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Stir well. Just before serving, add the crabmeat and simmer another 2 minutes. Stir gently; you don't want to break up the crabmeat too much.
