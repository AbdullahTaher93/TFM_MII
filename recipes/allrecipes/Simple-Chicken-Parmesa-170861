Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Dip the chicken breast in egg and then breadcrumbs. Heat oil in a large skillet on medium high heat. Brown chicken on both sides and drain on a paper towel. In an 11x7 inch baking dish evenly spread 1/2 of the RED GOLD(R) or REDPACK(R) CRUSHED TOMATOES. Arrange chicken on sauce and top with remaining RED GOLD(R) or REDPACK(R) CRUSHED TOMATOES. Sprinkle with cheese and bake for 25 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink.
