Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly flour a 2-pound loaf pan. Sift whole wheat flour, baking soda, and salt into a large bowl. Stir in buttermilk gently. Bring dough together using your hands. Sprinkle sesame seeds and pumpkin seeds over the dough; toss dough around the bowl a few times to coat with seeds. Transfer to the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until top is browned and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom, about 40 minutes. Wrap loaf in a clean dish towel and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.
