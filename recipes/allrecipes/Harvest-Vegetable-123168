Cut cabbage into six wedges; spread butter on cut sides. Place cabbage on a piece of heavy-duty foil (about 24 in. x 18 in.). Sprinkle with onion salt if desired and pepper. Arrange remaining vegetables and bacon if desired around cabbage. Seal the foil tightly. Grill, covered, over medium-hot heat for 30 minutes or until vegetables are tender, turning occasionally.
