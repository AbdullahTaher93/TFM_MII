Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook potatoes and cassava in hot oil, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer potatoes and cassava to a plate with a slotted spoon. Cook and stir onion in the same hot oil until translucent; add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in diced tomatoes and tomato paste; cook until fully incorporated and hot, about 1 minute. Stir water, beef, cabbage, carrots, parsley, salt, and black pepper into tomato mixture; bring to a boil. Add potatoes and cassava, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Transfer vegetables and meat with a slotted spoon to a large bowl. Measure liquid in the pot, adding water as necessary to make 6 cups of liquid. Return 6 cups liquid to the pot, add rice, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot with a lid, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Spoon rice onto a platter and top with meat and vegetables.
