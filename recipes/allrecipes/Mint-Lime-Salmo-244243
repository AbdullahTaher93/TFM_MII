Mix mint, soy sauce, lime juice, ginger, and coconut sugar together in a baking dish until marinade is evenly combined. Place salmon on top of marinade, skin-side up. Marinate in the refrigerator, at least 2 hours. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Add water if sauce is getting dry. Continue baking until skin peels off easily and fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes more.
