In an 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking pan coated with nonstick cooking spray, arrange bacon in two rows, overlapping the slices. In a saucepan, combine the orange juice, 4 tablespoons brown sugar, mustard, cardamom and pepper until blended. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently. Boil for 1 minute. Pour over bacon; arrange bay leaves on top. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 20-25 minutes. Discard bay leaves and all but 1/4 cup pan juices. Sprinkle remaining brown sugar over bacon. Broil 4 in. from the heat for 3-5 minutes or until bacon is glazed and bubbly. Serve immediately.
