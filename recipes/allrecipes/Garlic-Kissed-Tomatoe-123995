Peel and cut tomatoes in half horizontally. Squeeze tomatoes lightly to release seeds. Discard seeds and juices. Place tomato halves in a container with a tight-fitting lid. In a small bowl, mix the oil, garlic, lemon juice, oregano, salt and pepper. Pour over tomatoes. Seal lid and invert to thoroughly coat. Refrigerate at least 4 hours or up to 2 days, inverting occasionally to marinate.
