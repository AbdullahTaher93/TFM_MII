Fill a saucepan with water; bring to boil. Fill a bowl with ice water. Cut an x shape into the top and bottom of each peach with a sharp paring knife. Place peaches into the boiling water for 1 minute. Remove peaches; place into ice water until cooled. Remove skins. Place peaches into a bowl; mash with a potato masher. Place strawberries in a large bowl; add 1 tablespoon of white sugar. Toss until berries are covered. Let sit until sugar draws out the berry juices, about 2 minutes. Peel the apple with an apple peeler, keeping the skin as one long piece; set skin aside. Core and mince the apple and place in a bowl; cover with orange juice. Combine peaches, strawberries, apple, apple peel, 2 cups white sugar, brown sugar, and ground cinnamon in a large, high-rimmed saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a boil. Smash the fruit periodically with a potato masher. Cook until jam thickens, about 25 minutes. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Ladle hot jam into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a clean knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, in a draft-free area until cool. Press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.
