Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). On a large baking sheet, pinch the 8 crescent roll dough triangles into 4 rectangles. Layer each rectangle with 6 slices of pepperoni and even amounts of mozzarella cheese. Roll tightly lengthwise and slice each into 4 or more pieces. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Serve with pizza sauce for dipping.
