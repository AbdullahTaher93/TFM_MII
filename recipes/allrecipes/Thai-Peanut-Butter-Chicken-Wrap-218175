Stir together peanut butter, pad thai sauce and green onions in a medium bowl until combined. Place tortilla on microwave-safe plate. Spread 1/4 of peanut butter mixture on tortilla to about 1/2-inch of edge. Microwave on High (100% power) for 20 seconds. Layer chicken, then lettuce on top. Wrap burrito style: Fold one edge of tortilla up about 1-inch over filling. Fold right and left sides over folded edge. Roll up ending with loose edge on bottom. Cut in half diagonally. Repeat with remaining tortillas.
