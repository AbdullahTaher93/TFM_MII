In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in egg yolks; mix well. Gradually add flour. Using a cookie press fitted with a bar disk, press dough into long strips onto ungreased baking sheets. Beat egg whites until stiff; brush over dough. Combine topping ingredients; sprinkle over strips. Cut each strip into 2-in. pieces (there is no need to separate the pieces). Bake at 350 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until edges are firm (do not brown). Cut into pieces again if necessary. Remove to wire racks to cool.
