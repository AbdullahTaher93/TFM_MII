Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook seashell pasta at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water. Mix pasta, cucumbers, onion, green bell pepper, and pimento peppers in a large bowl. Whisk tomato soup, sugar, vinegar, and oil together in a bowl until smooth; pour over pasta mixture. Stir to coat. Refrigerate 12 to 24 hours before serving, stirring occasionally.
