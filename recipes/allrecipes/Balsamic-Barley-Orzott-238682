Heat olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion in hot oil until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add barley to onion; cook and stir until barley is toasted, about 2 minutes. Stir white wine into barley mixture until completely absorbed, 3 to 5 minutes. Add water, balsamic vinegar, and vegetable bouillon to barley; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer until liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Remove pot from heat. Mix milk, Parmesan cheese, and basil into barley.
