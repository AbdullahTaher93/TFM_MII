In a large skillet, heat 1/4 cup olive oil and the garlic over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add the broccoli rabe and cook, turning with tongs and adding oil as needed, until slightly wilted, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Return all the wilted broccoli rabe to the skillet, add the chicken broth and red pepper, cover and cook, turning once, until the stalks are tender, about 6 minutes. Season with salt.
