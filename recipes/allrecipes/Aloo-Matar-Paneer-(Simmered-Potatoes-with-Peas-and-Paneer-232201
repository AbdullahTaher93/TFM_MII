Place garlic and ginger in a blender or food processor; puree until smooth. Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir bay leaves, cinnamon stick, coriander seeds, peppercorns, cardamom pods, and cloves in hot oil until spices change color and become fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt; cook and stir until onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Stir garlic-ginger puree and green chile pepper into onion mixture; cook and stir until chile pepper is tender, 1 to 2 minutes more. Stir in tomatoes. If mixture becomes too thick, add water. Season with chili powder and cumin. Remove tomato mixture from heat and allow to cool for a few minutes. Transfer mixture to the blender or food processor; puree until smooth. Pour sauce into a saucepan and add butter and fenugreek. Bring sauce to a simmer over medium heat and stir in potatoes. Simmer until potatoes are nearly tender, 10 to 15 minutes; add paneer and frozen peas. Continue to simmer until potatoes and peas are tender, about 5 minutes more. Stir in honey and remaining 1 teaspoon salt.
