Place lettuce, pecans and oranges in salad bowl. Combine vinegar, sugar, canola oil, small red onion, salt, mustard and water in blender or food processor. Blend until dressing forms a creamy white consistency. Pour 1/2 of the salad dressing on the salad. Save the remainder in the refrigerator for up to three days for another salad or use as a dip.
