Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Scrub potatoes thoroughly with brush; pat dry. Make 6 to 8 diagonal slices across tops of potatoes about 3/4 of the way through, being careful to not cut all of the way through to bottoms of potatoes. Place potatoes on lightly greased baking sheet. While slightly spreading potatoes apart to open up the slices, drizzle each potato with 1 Tbsp. of the dressing. Bake 1 hour or until potatoes are cooked through. Place hot potatoes on serving dish and sprinkle each with 1/2 Tbsp. of the cheese.
