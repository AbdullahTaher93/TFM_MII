Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat the olive oil in a large oven-proof skillet over medium high heat, and sear the salmon about 4 minutes on each side. Top salmon with Brie cheese. Cover skillet, and place in the preheated oven. Bake 15 minutes, or until the salmon is easily flaked with a fork. In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and simmer the mangos 15 minutes, or until soft and smooth. Serve over the cooked salmon.
