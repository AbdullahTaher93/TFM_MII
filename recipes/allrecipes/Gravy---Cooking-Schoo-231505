Warm pan drippings in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk flour into pan drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until thick and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Increase heat to medium. Slowly whisk chicken stock into flour mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until gravy is thick and coats the back of a spoon, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
