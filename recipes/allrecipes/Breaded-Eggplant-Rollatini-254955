Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place eggplant slices in a large dish and cover with salted water. Let soak, about 15 minutes. Drain and cover with milk. Combine flour, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Beat eggs lightly in a shallow bowl that is long enough for the eggplant slices to fit in. Combine panko, remaining 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in another large resealable plastic bag. Place 1 slice eggplant in flour mixture, shaking to coat. Dip in egg. Transfer to bag with panko mixture, shaking to coat. Repeat with remaining slices. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet. Cook coated eggplant slices in batches until golden brown and crisp, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a cooling rack. Repeat with remaining eggplant, adding oil as needed. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion softens, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, chopped tomatoes, 2 teaspoons pepper, oregano, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, and poultry seasoning. Reduce heat to low and cover; cook sauce, stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, 10 to 15 minutes. Mix ricotta cheese, spinach, egg, Parmesan cheese, 1 teaspoon garlic, nutmeg, salt, and pepper together gently in a bowl to make filling. Spread 2 to 3 tablespoons of filling over each eggplant slice. Roll slices into logs and arrange in a single layer in a 9x13-inch baking pan. Pour tomato sauce evenly on top. Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly, about 30 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
