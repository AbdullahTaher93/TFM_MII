In a medium bowl, combine the chili powder, cornstarch, lemon juice and water. Mix together well. Place the meat in a resealable plastic bag with the marinade and turn to coat thoroughly. Marinate in the refrigerator for 6 to 16 hours. Place in a slow cooker and cook on high setting for about 4 hours, or until the meat is completely cooked and shreds easily.
