Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place pork chops in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a small bowl, mix together the cola and ketchup. Pour over chops and sprinkle with brown sugar. Bake uncovered for about 1 hour, or until pork is cooked through and internal temperature has reached 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
