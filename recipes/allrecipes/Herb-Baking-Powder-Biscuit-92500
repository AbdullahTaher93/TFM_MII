Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Sift dry ingredients into a medium-size bowl. Make a well in flour mixture, and add canola oil and milk. Mix with a fork until mixture cleans the bowl and forms one mass. Place dough on floured surface and knead lightly 10 times. Roll or pat out dough to 1/2-inch thickness. Using a round 2- to 3-inch cookie cutter cut dough into circles. Place biscuits on an unoiled baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes. Best served warm.
