If using wooden skewers, begin soaking in water. Rinse scallops and shrimp; pat dry. Combine seafood, garlic lime marinade, and lime peel in a heavy plastic food bag. Seal bag, turn to mix, and chill for at least 20 minutes or up to 2 hours. Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for direct heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is directly under the food). For charcoal grill: Before you put the grill over the hot coals, brush it with a generous coat of oil. For gas grill: When hot, brush grill with a generous coat of oil. Meanwhile, cut mangoes lengthwise parallel to pit on each side of fruit. On the flesh side of each mango half, cut down to, but not through, the peel lengthwise then crosswise to make 4 equal pieces. With a spoon, scoop chunks from peel. Halve, seed, and peel papayas. Cut each half into 8 roughly equal chunks. Drain marinade from bag and discard. Alternately thread scallops, shrimp, and mango and papaya chunks onto metal or soaked wooden skewers: Spear scallops through their sides, shrimp in a C shape, and fruit through thickest parts; begin and end each skewer with shrimp. Lay skewers on well oiled grill over a solid bed of medium hot coals or medium high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand just above grill level only 3 to 4 seconds). Keep charcoal grill uncovered; close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning once with tongs, until shrimp and scallops are just opaque but still moist looking in center (cut to test), 6 to 8 minutes. Serve immediately, with lime wedges to squeeze over seafood and fruit to taste.
