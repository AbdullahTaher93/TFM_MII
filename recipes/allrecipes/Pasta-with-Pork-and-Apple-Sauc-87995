Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place pasta in the pot, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain. Place the apples, shallot, basil, and red wine in a blender, and puree. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place pork chops in the skillet, season with nutmeg and pepper, and sprinkle with Worcestershire sauce. Cook about 4 minutes, then mix in onion and garlic. Continue cooking 4 minutes, or to desired doneness. Mix sun-dried tomatoes, broccoli, and red bell pepper into the skillet. Continue cooking until broccoli is tender. Stir in the apple mixture, and cook until heated through. Serve over the cooked pasta.
