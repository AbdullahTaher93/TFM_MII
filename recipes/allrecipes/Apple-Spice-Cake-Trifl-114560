In a mixing bowl, combine dry cake mix, applesauce, eggs and oil; beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Pour into greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. In a saucepan, cook pie filling, butter and 1 teaspoon cinnamon until butter is melted; stir until well blended. Cool. In a mixing bowl, combine milk, pudding mix, topping mix and remaining cinnamon. Beat in high until thickened, about 5 minutes; set aside. Spread a third of the whipped topping in a 6-qt. bowl. Cut cake into cubes; place half over topping. Top with half of the fruit mixture, walnuts and pudding mixture. Repeat layers. Spread with remaining whipped topping. Sprinkle with toffee bits. Cover and chill for at least 2 hours.
