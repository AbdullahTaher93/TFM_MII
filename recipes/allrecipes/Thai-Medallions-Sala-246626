Combine malt vinegar, onion, water, sugar, chile pepper, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger in a saucepan. Bring to a boil; cook, uncovered, until thickened, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Brush hake fillets with olive oil on both sides and place on the baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until flesh flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes. Cool until easily handled, about 10 minutes. Break into chunks. Mix salad greens, cucumber, carrot, red bell pepper, and snow peas on a large serving plate. Top with chunks of hake. Spoon dressing over salad.
