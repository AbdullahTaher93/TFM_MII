Put the noodles in a bowl and pour plenty of boiling water over; set aside to soak 4 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the peanut oil in a large saucepan. Add the ginger and mushrooms and cook to soften slightly, about 2 minutes. Add the stock, sherry, and soy sauce, and bring to a boil. Halve the scallops if they are large. Add the mixed seafood to the boiling stock together with the cabbage, scallions, and bean sprouts. Bring back to a boil and cook until the seafood is heated through, about 1 minute. Drain the noodles and add to the soup. Bring back to a boil, then ladle into large soup bowls. Scatter a few fresh cilantro leaves over and serve with chile sauce, to be added to taste.
