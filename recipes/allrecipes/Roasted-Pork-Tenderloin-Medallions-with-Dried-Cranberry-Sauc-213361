Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. To prepare pork, combine first 4 ingredients; rub evenly over pork. Heat a large ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Coat pan with cooking spray. Add pork; cook 4 minutes on each side or until browned. Place pan in oven; cook pork at 400 degrees F for 12 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers 160 degrees F (slightly pink). Place pork on a cutting board; keep warm. To prepare sauce, add broth, dried cranberries, and juice to pan; bring to a boil, scraping pan to loosen browned bits. Stir in jelly; cook 8 minutes or until mixture is slightly thick, stirring occasionally. Cut pork into (1/2-inch) slices. Serve with sauce.
