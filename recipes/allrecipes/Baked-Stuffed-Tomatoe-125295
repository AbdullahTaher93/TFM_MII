Cut a thin slice off the top of each tomato. Leaving a 1/2-in.-thick shell, scoop out and reserve pulp. Invert tomatoes onto paper towels to drain. Meanwhile, in a skillet, brown beef; drain. Add tomato pulp, chili powder, sugar, salt, pepper and oregano; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer 45 to 50 minutes or until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally. Add rice; mix well. Simmer 5 to 6 minutes longer or until rice is tender. Stuff tomatoes and place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Combine bread crumbs and butter; sprinkle over tomatoes. Add water to baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes or until crumbs are lightly browned.
