In a large bowl, stir together the melted butter, melted lard, white sugar, brown sugar, and eggs. Mix until well blended. Stir in the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and almonds. Roll the dough into 2 logs about 2 1/2 inches in diameter; refrigerate overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Let the dough logs thaw for about 5 minutes. Slice dough into slices about 1/4 inch thick. Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes. Alternative: You can use a cookie stamp, mold or press for these cookies-after you have chilled the dough, roll out the dough to 1/2" thick and press down on the down to 1/4" thickness.
