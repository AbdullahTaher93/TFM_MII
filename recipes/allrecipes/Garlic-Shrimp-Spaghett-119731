Cook spaghetti according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the cornstarch, water and broth until smooth; set aside. In a large skillet, saute garlic and cayenne in oil until tender. Stir broth mixture and add to the pan. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Reduce heat; add shrimp, lemon juice, peel and parsley. Cook for 2-4 minutes or until heated through. Drain spaghetti and place in a large bowl. Add shrimp mixture and toss to coat.
