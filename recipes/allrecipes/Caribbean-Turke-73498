Preheat broiler or preheat grill to medium heat. In food processor or blender, combine all ingredients except cooking spray and tenderloins. Coat a broiler rack and pan or grill rack with cooking spray. Arrange tenderloins on rack and spoon 1/3 of the puree evenly over the tenderloins. Broil or grill 6 minutes. Turn over; brush with 1/3 of the puree and return to broiler or grill for about 5 minutes. Brush with remaining puree and broil for another 4 to 5 minutes until turkey is no longer pink in center.
