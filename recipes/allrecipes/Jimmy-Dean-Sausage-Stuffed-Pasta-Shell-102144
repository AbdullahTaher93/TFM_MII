Preheat oven to 350 F. Cook shells according to package directions until just tender; rinse with cool water and set aside. Cook sausage, onions, peppers and garlic over medium-high heat, stirring frequently until meat is thoroughly cooked and no longer pink. Remove from heat and stir in beaten eggs, ricotta cheese, salt, oregano and parsley. Fill each cooked shell with mixture. Spoon half the sauce into shallow 3 qt. casserole. Place filled shells in single layer and pour remaining sauce over shells. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Cover and bake for 45 minutes.
