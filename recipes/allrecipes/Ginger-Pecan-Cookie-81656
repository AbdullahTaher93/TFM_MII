Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, mix together the whey, Splenda, flax, ginger and baking powder. Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender or two knives or your fingers, blend the butter into the dry mixture keeping it light and fluffy. (I prefer using my fingers, smashing the pieces of butter until well incorporated until no noticeable pieces of butter are remaining.) Run the pecans through the food processor for a minute to get a medium grind. Add the pecans to the mixture. Lightly beat the egg with the salt and molasses. Pour into the mixing bowl. Stir until well blended. Using lightly buttered hands, rolls batter into 20 balls with each just a bit more than a tablespoon. Place 10 to 12 on a parchment lined cookie sheet. Flatten just slightly. The flatter they are the more crispy they become. Bake for 10 minutes. Transfer to a cookie rack and then repeat with the remaining batter.
