Season beef with salt and pepper. Shape into 4 equal-size patties 3/4- to 1-inch thick. Lightly oil a barbecue grill and place over a solid bed of medium-hot coals (you can hold your hand at grill level 3 to 4 seconds). Place patties on grill. Cook, turning once, until done to your liking, 10 to 15 minutes for medium-rare; cut to test. Spread top side of each patty with 1/2 tablespoon of the oyster sauce. Turn and cook, sauce side down, just until glazed, about 30 seconds. Spread tops of patties with remaining sauce; turn and cook to glaze, about 30 more seconds. Lay bread slices on grill; cook, turning once, until lightly toasted on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes. Place one slice of bread on each of four dinner plates. Spread each slice with equal amounts of remaining oyster sauce and mustard to taste. Top with a lettuce leaf and a patty. Offer additional oyster sauce and mustard.
