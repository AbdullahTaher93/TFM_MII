Place chicken in a small skillet or saucepan and add enough water to cover; bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, reduce to low and simmer gently until cooked through and no longer pink in the middle, about 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and use two forks to shred into bite-size pieces. Chill in a medium bowl in the refrigerator while preparing the rest of the salad. Place 2 tablespoons mango, lime zest and juice, oil, rum, hot sauce, mint, garlic and salt in a blender or food processor; process until smooth. Add spinach, shrimp and the remaining mango to the cooked chicken. Add the dressing and toss gently to combine.
