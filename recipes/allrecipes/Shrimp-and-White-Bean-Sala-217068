Toss the shrimp, cannellini beans, cherry tomatoes, and diced red onion together in a bowl. Whisk the olive oil, red wine vinegar, Italian seasoning, and garlic salt together in a small bowl until well blended; drizzle over the shrimp mixture and toss to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator 4 hours to overnight. Put the salad greens in a salad bowl, and top with the chilled shrimp mixture to serve.
