Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly grease a 13- by 9-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Unroll pizza dough and press evenly over bottom and about 1-inch up sides of prepared pan. Brush dough with olive oil; sprinkle with garlic and basil. Cover with drained tomatoes, artichoke hearts and mushrooms. Sprinkle with feta cheese and sliced bell pepper. Bake pizza about 20 minutes until crust is golden brown.
