Pour into greased 9-in. square or 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until cake tests done. Cool completely. For frosting, melt butter in a saucepan. Stir in brown sugar; cook and stir until bubbly. Remove from the heat and stir in milk. Gradually add confectioners' sugar; beat by hand until frosting is of spreading consistency. Immediately frost cake.
