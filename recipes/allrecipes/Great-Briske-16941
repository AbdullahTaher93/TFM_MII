To marinate, mix the apple juice and orange juice in a nonporous glass bowl. Add the brisket, toss to coat and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate to marinate for 4 to 6 hours. Remove brisket from the bowl, discard any remaining marinade and cover brisket with the rub. Wrap the meat in plastic and refrigerate from 8 hours to overnight. Preheat oven to 170 degrees F (80 degrees C). Bake brisket in preheated oven for 8 to 10 hours. Slice across the grain of the meat.
