Heat oil in a large skillet over low heat. Mix salt, pepper, ginger, coriander, cumin, cinnamon, and cloves in a small bowl. Break up turkey in a medium bowl. Add spinach, spices, and jalapeno; mix lightly with a fork to combine. Divide mixture into four portions and form into patties. Increase heat under skillet to medium-high. Cook burgers until well browned, about 4 to 6 minutes each side. Reduce heat to low and continue to cook, partially covered, until burgers are cooked through, about 5 minutes longer. To serve, place a burger in each of the 4 pitas. Top each with chutney. Serve immediately.
