Cut the beef into bite-sized cubes. Trim away any extra fat. In a large pan over medium-high heat, add the butter and brown the beef. Add the garlic, stir and cook another minute or so (don't burn the garlic). Add the wine and the bouquet garni. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover and cook for 2 hours. If the mushrooms are very small they can be left whole, otherwise quarter them. Add the mushrooms, onions, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce and salt and pepper. Stir and cook on simmer for another 30 minutes. Remove and discard the bouquet garni before serving.
