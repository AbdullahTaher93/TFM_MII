Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Separate dough into 12 biscuits; press or roll each to 1/4-inch thickness. Mix sugar and cinnamon in shallow dish. Dip cream cheese cubes in melted butter, then roll in the cinnamon sugar. Place 1 cheese cube in center of each dough circle; gather up sides of dough to enclose filling. Press edges of dough together to seal. Place, seam sides up, in lightly greased muffin pan. Drizzle with any remaining butter; sprinkle with any remaining cinnamon sugar. Bake 15 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
