Soak the tomatoes in the boiling water for 5 minutes, or until softened. Drain. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch (22.5 cm) round baking pan. Dust the interior with the cornmeal. In a food processor fitted with a steel blade, combine the semolina flour, 1/2 cup of the unbleached flour, the cornmeal, baking powder, oregano, basil, baking soda, and salt. Pulse for 20 seconds to combine. Add the drained tomatoes, the tomato juice, and oil. Pulse a few seconds to form a dough, adding enough of the remaining unbleached flour to form a soft, moist dough. With lightly floured hands, press the dough into the pan. Bake for 30 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool on a rack for 5 minutes before serving.
