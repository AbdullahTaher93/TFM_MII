Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the turkey bacon in the hot oil until almost crisp. Add the parsnips, onion, and chopped pecans. Cook and stir until the parsnips are almost tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the sugar and vinegar; continue to cook until the parsnips are tender, 3 to 4 minutes more.
