Preheat grill to medium heat. Mix meat, 3 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese and the garlic. Shape into four patties. Grill 6 minutes on each side or until burgers are cooked through (160 degrees F). Top with cheese slices. Continue grilling 1 minute or until cheese begins to melt. Toss lettuce with 2 tablespoons of the dressing and the remaining 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese. Spoon evenly onto bottom halves of buns; top with patties and remaining 4 tablespoons dressing. Cover with tops of buns.
