Make simple syrup: Bring sugar and water to a boil in a small saucepan. Simmer, stirring, until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat; let cool. Refrigerate until ready to use. Rub rims of glasses with a lime wedge; dip rims in a dish of salt. In a large pitcher, combine lime juice, tequila, and triple sec or Grand Marnier. Add chilled sugar syrup, and stir to combine. Add ice cubes, and serve in prepared glasses.
