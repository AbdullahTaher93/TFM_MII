Pour olive oil into a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. When pan is hot, add lamb, onion, and garlic. Stir often, crumbling meat as you go, until it is well browned, about 12 minutes; drain off and discard any fat in pan. In a small bowl, mix together sherry, broth, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, sesame oil, cornstarch, and hot chili oil until well blended. Add this mixture to lamb along with 1/4 cup mint and 1/4 cup basil. Stir until boiling; remove from heat. Mound rice equally on 4 dinner plates, then top each with equal portions of lamb mixture. Sprinkle equally with remaining mint and basil. Arrange lettuce leaves decoratively, cupped side up, around lamb and rice. To eat, scoop lamb and rice onto lettuce leaves and pick up.
