In a small saucepan, bring 2/3 cup salted water to a boil. Add rice, cover and remove from heat. Let stand 5 minutes or until water is absorbed. Spray a large skillet with vegetable coating spray and place over high heat until hot. Season beef with salt and pepper and crumble into skillet. Stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, breaking up any large pieces, until no longer pink and cooked through. Remove from heat. Add cooked rice, green onions, Honey Garlic Sauce and Tabasco, if using. Stir until blended. To serve, spoon 3 to 4 tablespoons beef mixture on lettuce leaf. Roll up and eat.
