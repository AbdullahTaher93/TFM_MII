Cook spinach according to package directions. Cool under running water in colander. Squeeze the liquid from the spinach. In a small mixing bowl, mix the spinach with the bread crumbs and Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper. Assemble the sandwiches by spreading the spinach mixture on the bread then topping with the mozzarella and red peppers. Top with remaining slices and grill in a skillet or sandwich press coated with butter until golden brown.
