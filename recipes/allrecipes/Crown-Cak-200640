Bake the cake mix in two 8-inch layers, according to the directions on the package. Freeze one layer for another time. Place 2 tablespoons of frosting into a resealable plastic bag. Snip 1/4 inch off one corner. Set aside. Tint the remaining frosting with a few drops of yellow food coloring. Spread the cake layer with the yellow frosting; set aside. Trim the sugar cones as follows: Using a serrated knife, trim 1 inch off two cones; then trim 1-1/2 inches off two cones. Keep one cone untouched. Cover the cones with a thin layer of yellow frosting; then roll them in the yellow decorators sugar. To make the crown: Using the picture as a guide, place the cones on the edge of the cake. Begin by placing the uncut cone on the cake. Then, on either side of it, place the cones cut 1-1/2 inch, and finally place the cones cut 1 inch. Pipe a ring of white frosting around the bottom of the cones. Press the SKITTLES(R) Bite Size Candies along the entire bottom edge of the cake. Unwrap the STARBURST(R) Fruit Chews. Press them into the side of the cake, turning them so that they look like a diamond. Dab the SKITTLES(R) Bite Size Candies with frosting, and dot them around the sides of the cake. Dab the SKITTLES(R) Bite Size Candies with frosting, and place one on each point. * 12. Tip: This recipe makes a 'golden' crown. For a pink one, use red food coloring in steps 2-5 and pink decorators sugar in step 5.
