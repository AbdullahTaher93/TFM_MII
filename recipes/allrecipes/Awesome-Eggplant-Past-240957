Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until translucent, about 10 minutes. Add tomatoes and fresh basil and bring to a simmer. Heat remaining olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; cook and stir eggplant, mushroom, and red bell pepper until softened, about 10 minutes. Add tomato mixture to eggplant mixture and simmer for 30 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain. Toss pasta, mozzarella cheese, and tomato sauce together in a bowl.
