In a small glass or stainless-steel bowl, whisk together the mustard and water. Let sit for 10 minutes. Whisk in the mayonnaise, honey, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon dill. Heat the broiler. Rub the salmon on both sides with the oil. Put the pieces in a broiler pan or on a baking sheet, skin-side down, about 2 inches apart. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon dill, and the pepper. Broil the fish until golden brown and just barely done (the fish should still be translucent in the center), about 6 minutes for a 1-inch-thick fillet. Serve the salmon with the sauce alongside.
