Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Mix baking mix, skim milk, egg, raspberries, honey, lemon juice, and cream cheese in a bowl to make a slightly thick batter. Let stand for 5 minutes. Spread 1/4 cup batter in the preheated waffle iron. Cook until browned and the iron stops steaming, 3 to 6 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
