Whisk lemon juice, olive oil, ginger, garlic, sugar, and coriander together in a bowl. Combine water, bulgur, and salt in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Cover saucepan, reduce heat, and simmer until water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and fluff with a fork. Bring a separate saucepan of water to a boil; add lima beans and garlic salt. Cook until lima beans are tender, 5 to 7 minutes; drain. Mix bulgur, lima beans, tomato, cucumber, green onion, and mint together in a large bowl; drizzle dressing over bulgur mixture. Toss to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate to blend flavors, 2 hours to overnight.
