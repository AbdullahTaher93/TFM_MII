Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken thighs in a large bowl; season with black pepper, cumin, and 1 teaspoon salt. Set aside. Stuff each cherry pepper generously with Italian sausage. Set aside. Heat olive oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Place chicken thighs, skin-side down, in pan and brown, about 5 minutes. Turn chicken over and brown other side, about 1 minute. Remove chicken from pan. Cook onion in the Dutch oven with pinch of salt over medium-high heat; cook and stir until caramelized, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; stir in garlic, herbes de Provence, and crushed red pepper. Stir in pepperoncini and juices; cook until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Place chicken, skin-side up, in a single layer on top of the onions and pepperoncinis in the Dutch oven. Pour stock into the pan until almost covering the chicken. Sprinkle artichoke hearts, olives, and stuffed cherry peppers over top of chicken. Return to medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Cover and roast in preheated oven until sausage is cooked through and liquid is bubbling, about 1 hour. Garnish with chopped basil, oregano, and marjoram.
