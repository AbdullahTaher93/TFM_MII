Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place 1/4 cup of sugar and the vanilla bean in a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Pulse to chop the bean, then add walnuts. Pulse again until finely chopped. Remove from food processor. Add the butter and flour. Mix until well blended. Pinch off 1 inch square pieces of dough and shape into balls. Shape the balls into crescents, about 2 inches long. Place about 1/2 inch apart on cookie sheets. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F and bake for additional 10 to 15 minutes, until cookies are dry. Let cool on wire racks.
