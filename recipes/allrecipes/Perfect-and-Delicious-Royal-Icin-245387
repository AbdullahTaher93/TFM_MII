Whip water and meringue powder on high speed in a large bowl using an electric mixer until fluffy and soft peaks form, 7 to 10 minutes. Gradually add confectioners' sugar, corn syrup, shortening, and vanilla extract while mixing on low speed. Increase speed back to high and beat until well-combined and smooth, about 3 minutes.
