Place lentils and water in a pot. Bring water to boil, reduce to simmer. Cook for 30 minutes or until tender. Cook the turkey in a skillet over medium heat until no longer pink, 8 to 12 minutes. Stir the cooked lentils, 1 cup of water, and the taco seasoning mix into the turkey. Bring mixture to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer until liquid is nearly gone, about 5 minutes. Combine the lettuce, avocado, tomatoes, olives, kidney beans, lentil-and-turkey mixture, and Catalina dressing in a large bowl and toss until combined.
