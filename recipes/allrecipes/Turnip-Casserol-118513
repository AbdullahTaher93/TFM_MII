Place turnips in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and cook for 15 minutes or until tender and drain. Transfer turnips to a bowl and mash. Add the egg, sugar, butter and salt; mix well. Transfer to a greased 1-qt. baking dish; sprinkle with cinnamon. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a thermometer reads 160 degrees F and turnip mixture is heated through.
