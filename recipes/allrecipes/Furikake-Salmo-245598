Season salmon with garlic salt and black pepper. Combine mayonnaise and honey in a small bowl and spread on top side of salmon steaks. Place furikake in a shallow bowl. Dip top side of each salmon steak in furikake; press down lightly for coating to stick. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place salmon coated-side down and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Turn over and continue cooking until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes more.
