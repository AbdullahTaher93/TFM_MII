Heat 12 inch skillet over medium high heat. Add 2 tablespoons oil and chicken; saute for 3 to 5 minutes or until chicken is done. Remove chicken and set aside. To same skillet, add remaining 2 tablespoons oil, mushrooms, and onion. Cook 5 minutes, or until browned and caramelized. Return chicken to skillet. Add cooking wine, and red pepper flakes, if desired. Continue cooking until wine is reduced by half, about 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Add sour cream, Parmesan cheese and black pepper. Stir until heated through, being careful not to boil. Cook broccoli in microwave 2 to 3 minutes until tender crisp. Place cooked pasta on dinner plates. Top each plate with broccoli and pour chicken stroganoff over top.
