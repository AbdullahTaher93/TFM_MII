Bring chicken stock, potatoes, garlic, and saffron to a boil in a large pot; cover and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain potatoes and return to the pot; reserve cooking stock for another use, if desired. Add milk, olive oil, salt, and black pepper to potatoes. Mash potatoes with a potato masher until smooth.
