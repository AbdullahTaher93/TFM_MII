Combine chicken broth, lettuce, mushrooms, and onion in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Add ramen noodles to the boiling liquid and cook until softened, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. Drizzle egg substitute into the broth while stirring continually until the substitute solidified, about 30 seconds. Remove saucepan from heat; stir soy sauce and sesame oil into the soup.
