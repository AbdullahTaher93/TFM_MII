Microwave chocolate in large microwaveable bowl on HIGH 2 minutes or until chocolate is almost melted. Stir with wire whisk until chocolate is completely melted. Add cream cheese; stir until cream cheese is completely melted and mixture is well blended. Cool to room temperature. Gently stir in whipped topping. Refrigerate 2 hours or until mixture is firm enough to handle. Scoop chocolate mixture into 1-inch balls with melon baller; place on waxed paper-covered baking sheets. Refrigerate at least 1 hour. Roll in suggested coatings, working with a few truffles at a time. (Truffles do not need to be perfectly round and smooth--a slightly rough appearance is considered typical.) Store in tightly covered container in refrigerator.
