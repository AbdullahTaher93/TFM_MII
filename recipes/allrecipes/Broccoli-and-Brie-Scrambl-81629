Chop the broccoli and scallions, keeping them separate. Cut the Brie into cubes or thin slices. I like to use some of the rind on the brie, but I also cut some of it away. In a bowl, beat the eggs, cream, garlic power and a pinch of salt and fresh ground pepper. Beat well. In a heavy skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter and add the chopped broccoli. Stir occasionally. Cook until the broccoli starts to take on some color (about 3 minutes). Then add the chopped scallions and cook another full minute. Add the beaten eggs to the skillet and scrape and flip frequently with a spatula. Just before the eggs are completely set add the brie. Scrape, flip and turn off the heat; letting the heat in the skillet finish off the cooking without over cooking the eggs. Serve immediately.
