In a mixing bowl, combine 3/4 cup flour, sugar, yeast, garlic salt, Italian seasoning and parsley. In a saucepan, heat milk, water and 1 tablespoon butter to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat just until moistened. Add egg, 4 tablespoons Parmesan cheese and enough remaining flour to form a soft dough; beat until smooth. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 15 minutes. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into thirds; shape into loaves. Place in three greased 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 25 minutes. Melt remaining butter; brush over dough. Sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks.
