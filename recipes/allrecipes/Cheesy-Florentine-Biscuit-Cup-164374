Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 8 jumbo muffin cups or 8 (6-ounce) glass custard cups with CRISCO(R) Original No-Stick Cooking Spray. In 10-inch skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Stir in spinach, salt and pepper. Cook 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally and breaking up spinach if necessary, until spinach is hot. Remove from heat; set aside. Separate dough into 8 biscuits. Place 1 biscuit in each muffin cup, pressing dough 3/4 of the way up sides of cups. Place heaping 1 tablespoon bacon on dough in bottom of each cup. Top each with spinach mixture. Using finger or end of wooden spoon handle, make 1 1/2-inch-wide indentation in center of each cup. Break 1 egg into each cup. Top each egg with 1/4 cup cheese (cups will be full). (If using custard cups, place on large cookie sheet with sides.) Bake 20 to 25 minutes or centers feel firm when touched and biscuits are golden brown. Cool 5 minutes. Remove from pan to serving plates. Serve warm.
