In a large bowl, mix together the Mann's Broccoli Cole Slaw, eggs, flour, teriyaki glaze and the 2 1/2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. On a griddle or in large skillet, warm 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Using a 1/4-cup measure, drop batter onto the hot griddle and flatten with the back of a spatula. Cook, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes total. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining batter, adding more oil to the grill if necessary. Serve warm.
