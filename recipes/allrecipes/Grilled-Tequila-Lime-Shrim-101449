In large resealable plastic bag, pour 1/2 cup Lawry's(R) Tequila Lime Marinade With Lime Juice over shrimp; turn to coat. Close bag and marinate in refrigerator 30 minutes. Soak wooden skewers in water 15 minutes. Remove shrimp from Marinade, discarding Marinade. On skewers, alternately thread shrimp, yellow pepper, onion and tomatoes. Grill, turning once and brushing frequently with remaining 1/2 cup Marinade, until shrimp turn pink. Serve, if desired, with lime wedges over hot cooked linguine, rice or orzo.
