In a large bowl, combine fruits and extract; toss to coat. In another bowl, combine sugar, tapioca, nutmeg and salt. Add to fruit; stir gently. Let stand for 15 minutes. Line a 9-in, pie plate with bottom crust; trim pastry even with edge. Stir lemon juice into fruit mixture; spoon into the crust. Roll out remaining pastry; make a lattice crust. Seal and flute edges. Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees; bake 30 minutes longer or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.
