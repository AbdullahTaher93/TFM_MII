Prepare instant long grain and wild rice according to package directions. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place ground pork sausage and ground sage pork sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, and set aside. Cook and stir celery, onion, mushrooms, and water chestnuts in the skillet until browned and tender. Season with garlic powder. Mix prepared rice, sausage, celery mixture, and eggs in the prepared baking dish. Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned.
