In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium heat, stir prosciutto and oil until meat is browned, about 4 minutes. With a slotted spoon, lift prosciutto onto paper towels. Add almonds to pan. Stir until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Lift nuts from pan onto towels, and set aside. Discard oil in pan. Stir juice, vinegar, cornstarch, and grated orange peel until smooth. Pour into pan; stir over high heat until bubbling, about 1 minute. Pour into a small bowl; keep warm. Rinse pan. Place asparagus in pan with 1/2 cup water. Cover tightly, and simmer over medium heat until tender-crisp to bite, 2 to 4 minutes, stirring halfway through cooking. Drain, and arrange on a platter. Pour orange sauce over asparagus, then scatter prosciutto and almonds on top. Season to taste with pepper, and garnish with orange-peel twist.
