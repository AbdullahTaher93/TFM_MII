Place the quinoa into a saucepan over medium-high heat, and toast the quinoa in the dry pan, shaking the pan frequently, until the quinoa is dry and giving off a roasted fragrance, 2 to 5 minutes. Stir in water and a pinch of salt, bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer the quinoa for about 10 minutes. Stir in the edamame, mango, bell pepper, and serrano chile, cover, and simmer the mixture until the water has been absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy, about 5 more minutes. Stir in the green onions, almonds, cranberries, coconut, cilantro, lime juice, balsamic vinegar, and salt and pepper. Bring the mixture back to a simmer, and serve hot.
