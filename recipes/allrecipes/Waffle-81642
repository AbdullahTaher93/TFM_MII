In a large mixing bowl mix together all the dry mix ingredients until thoroughly mixed. This dry mix will keep in an airtight jar for about 1 month if kept in the refrigerator. Whip eggs in a mixing bowl. Add the water, cream and vanilla and whip again. Add the dry mix and blend well. Follow the directions of your waffle machine for preheating. I like to oil mine with butter which adds color and flavor. But it needs to be added just before the batter, so that it doesn't burn. Ladle the batter into the center of each waffle in the waffle iron. Depending on the individual waffle size of your waffle iron, this should yield 8 to 12 waffles with 2 to 3 waffles per serving.
