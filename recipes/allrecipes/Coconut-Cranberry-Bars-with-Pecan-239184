Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with parchment paper or grease. Mix graham cracker crumbs and butter together in a bowl; press into the prepared baking dish. Stir cranberries, sweetened condensed milk, pecans, coconut, white chocolate chips, and bittersweet chocolate chips together in a bowl; gently spread over the graham cracker crust. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, 25 to 28 minutes; cool on a wire rack.
