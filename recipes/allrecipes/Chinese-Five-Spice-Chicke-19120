Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry. Sprinkle with five-spice powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Wrap tightly in aluminum foil and refrigerate to 'marinate' for at least 2 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove wrapping from chicken breasts and place them in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Drizzle with olive oil and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes, or until cooked through and juices run clear.
