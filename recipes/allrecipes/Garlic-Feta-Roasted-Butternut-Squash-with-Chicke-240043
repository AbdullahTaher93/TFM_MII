Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix butternut squash, chicken, red onion, feta cheese, olive oil, garlic, pepper, and sea salt together in a roasting pan. Roast in preheated oven, stirring every ten minutes or so, until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the squash cubes are tender, 30 to 40 minutes.
