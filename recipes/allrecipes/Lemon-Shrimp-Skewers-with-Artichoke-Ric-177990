In a shallow pan, soak ten 10-inch wooden skewers at least 20 minutes. Meanwhile, drain 2 tablespoons artichoke marinade into a bowl. Add 1 teaspoon lemon peel and shrimp; mix to coat. Let stand about 20 minutes, stirring shrimp occasionally. Thread 4 to 5 shrimp onto 1 skewer, then use second skewer to thread other end of shrimp (skewers should be parallel). Repeat with all shrimp. Discard marinade from shrimp. Prepare rice according to package directions, adding bell pepper to boiling water with rice. Reserve 2 more tablespoons marinade. Stir artichokes and the remaining marinade into cooked rice with remaining lemon peel, peas, and lemon juice. Lay shrimp on a barbecue grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning once, until shrimp are opaque in thickest part (cut to test), about 3 minutes. To store: Let ingredients cool; seal in separate resealable containers. Also package reserved artichoke marinade. Chill up to 1 day.
