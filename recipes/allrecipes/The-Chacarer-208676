In medium bowl or deep plate, combine garlic, olive oil, paprika, cumin and oregano. Add beef slices and marinate. Set aside for 30 minutes. (Refrigerate if marinating longer.) In large skillet or on griddle over high heat, cook beef slices until just done. Cut avocados in half, remove the pit and peel. Mash with Merken and salt in a small bowl. Toast the hamburger buns, then spread with avocado mixture. Top with beef slices, green beans and a few slices of the pepper. Cover with top of bun and serve at once.
