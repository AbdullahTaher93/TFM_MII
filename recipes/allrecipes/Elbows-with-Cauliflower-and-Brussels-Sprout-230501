Bring a large pot of water to a boil. In a large skillet saute onions in olive oil for 2-3 minutes or until slightly opaque. Add the butter. Add the carrots, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts and brown well, season with salt and pepper. Deglaze with wine and reduce until nearly dry. Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup of cooking water. Once pasta is cooked, add the pasta to the sauce and toss to combine. Add enough cooking water to make the sauce come together. Remove from heat and add Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. Toss to combine. Top with parsley and serve.
