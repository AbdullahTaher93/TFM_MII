Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, and stir in mushrooms, onion, celery, and garlic. Saute until tender. Mix barley and vegetable broth into the saucepan. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat. Simmer 45 to 50 minutes, until barley is tender. Stir white beans into the barley mixture. Continue cooking about 5 minutes, until beans are heated.
