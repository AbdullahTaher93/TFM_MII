Place bulgur in a casserole dish, and cover it with 3 cups boiling water. Cover. Let stand 30 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed. Fluff bulgur with a fork. Add tomatoes, parsley, green onions, mint, olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper; stir to combine. Cover, and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. Serve either chilled or at room temperature.
