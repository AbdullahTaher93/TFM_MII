Heat the oil in a 6-quart saucepot over medium heat. Add the fennel, garlic and red pepper and cook and stir for 2 minutes. Add the stock and wine and heat to a boil. Increase the heat to medium-high. Add the clams to the saucepot. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the clams open. Discard any clams that do not open. Sprinkle with the parsley. Serve with the bread for dipping.
