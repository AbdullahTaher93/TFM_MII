In a mixing bowl, cream butter and brown sugar. Add extracts. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine flour and salt; add to creamed mixture and mix well. Stir in pecans. Divide batter in half; stir chocolate into one portion. Alternately spoon plain and chocolate batters into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Swirl with a knife (the batter will be thick). Bake at 350 degrees F for 16-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool completely. For icing, cream butter and confectioners' sugar in a mixing bowl. Add milk and vanilla; mix until smooth. Spread over bars. For glaze, melt chocolate chips and shortening in a microwave or double boiler. Drizzle over bars. Let stand until chocolate is completely set before cutting.
