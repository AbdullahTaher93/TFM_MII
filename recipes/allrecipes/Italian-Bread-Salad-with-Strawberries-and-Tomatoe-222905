Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Toss bread cubes with 2 tablespoons olive oil, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper on a large baking sheet until evenly coated; spread mixture into a single layer. Bake in preheated oven until toasted, about 10 minutes. Transfer toasted bread to a large bowl and mix with strawberries, tomatoes, feta cheese, and onion. Whisk 1/4 cup olive oil, red wine vinegar, and honey in a small bowl; drizzle over bread and tomato salad. Toss to coat.
