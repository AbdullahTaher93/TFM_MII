Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Stir in the rice and boil until almost tender, about 10 minutes. Drain. Coat the salmon with the soy sauce and sesame oil. In a large pot, combine the cooked rice, the cilantro stems, the ginger, salt, broth, and water. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Add the salmon to the pot. Simmer, covered, until the salmon is just done, about 5 minutes. Remove the cilantro stems. Serve the soup garnished with the cilantro leaves and scallions.
