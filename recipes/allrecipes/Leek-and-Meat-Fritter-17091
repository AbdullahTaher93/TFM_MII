Cut the white part of the leek stalks into 4 to 5 pieces each and cook uncovered in water until tender; drain. Grind, preferable in a meat grinder. In a large bowl, mix ground leeks with lamb and add eggs; mix well. Add matzo meal until mixture is stable but not too hard. If you added too much matzo meal, add another egg. Add salt, pepper and garlic. Form small patties and arrange on a tray to fry; optimal size of patties is bite size. In a large skillet, heat oil and pan fry until golden; serve hot or at room temperature.
