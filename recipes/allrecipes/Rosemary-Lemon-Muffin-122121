In a saucepan, combine the milk, rosemary and lemon peel. Bring to a simmer; cook and stir over low heat for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat; cool slightly. In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt; set aside. In another bowl, whisk the eggs until foamy. Stir in butter, sugar and milk mixture until combined. Stir into the dry ingredients just until moistened. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-22 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
