About one hour before smoking, make the dry rub. Combine all ingredients in small bowl; mix well. Pat ribs dry with paper towels; generously coat both sides of ribs with rub. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Combine all ingredients in medium saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes until slightly thickened, stirring frequently. Cool to room temperature; cover and refrigerate. Heat charcoal or gas grill for indirect cooking at 250 to 300 degrees F. Add drained wood chips, if using. Place the ribs, meaty side up, over a drip pan and cook for 2 hours. Add about 12 coals to a charcoal grill every 45 minutes or so to maintain the heat. Continue cooking ribs for 1 to 2 hours more over indirect heat, until very tender, spraying with tamarind juice every 20 to 30 minutes. Add more coals as needed to maintain temperature for a charcoal grill. Place ribs over direct heat on grill and brush with sauce. Cook for about 5 minutes until the sauce is set. Turn ribs and repeat with more sauce. Serve ribs with remaining sauce.
