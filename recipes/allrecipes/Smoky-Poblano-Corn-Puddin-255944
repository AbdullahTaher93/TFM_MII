Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place poblano peppers on a baking sheet. Roast peppers in the preheated oven until slumped and charred, about 30 minutes. Remove the stems, seeds, and the charred skin and roughly chop peppers. Lower oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and butter a 1 1/2-quart baking dish. Whisk milk, cream, eggs, sugar, flour, butter, and salt together in a bowl; stir in corn, Cheddar cheese, and roasted peppers. Pour corn mixture into the prepared dish. Bake in the oven until slightly puffed, golden around the edges, and set, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Garnish corn pudding with chopped chives.
