Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Combine zucchinis, green bell peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, and onion in a large bowl. Pour olive oil over vegetables and toss to evenly coat. Season with salt and pepper. Grill vegetables on preheated grill until lightly charred, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
