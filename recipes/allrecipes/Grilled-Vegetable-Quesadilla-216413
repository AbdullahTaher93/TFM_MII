Combine oil and chilies. Set aside 1 tablespoon of the mixture. Brush remaining mixture over both sides of vegetables. Grill vegetables over medium coals 10 minutes or until tender, turning occasionally. Cut bell peppers and zucchini crosswise into 1/4-inch slices. Sprinkle half of cheese over four tortillas; drizzle reserved oil mixture over cheese. Top with grilled vegetables, cilantro, remaining cheese and tortillas. Grill quesadillas over medium-low coals 3 minutes per side or until cheese is melted and tortillas are lightly toasted. Cut into wedges and garnish with sour cream, salsa and guacamole, if desired.
