Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Soak matzo farfel in boiling water in a bowl for 5 minutes; drain and transfer to a large bowl. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook and stir mushrooms, onions, rosemary, garlic, and salt until onions are soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir mushroom mixture into moistened farfel and mix in beaten eggs. Pour farfel mixture into prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until set and top is lightly browned, about 1 hour.
