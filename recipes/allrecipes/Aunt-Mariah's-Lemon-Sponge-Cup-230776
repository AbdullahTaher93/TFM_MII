Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Beat butter in a large bowl until smooth and creamy; stir sugar, flour, lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt into butter. Beat egg yolks in a separate bowl until smooth; stir milk into egg yolks. Slowly mix egg yolk mixture into lemon mixture until thoroughly combined. Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks. Gently fold egg whites into batter. Spoon batter into 6 individual ramekins or souffle cups. Place filled cups into a large baking dish and pour enough hot water into dish to reach partway up the ramekins. Bake in the preheated oven until desserts separate into a custard layer on bottom and a lightly browned sponge cake layer on top, about 45 minutes. Let stand about 10 minutes before serving.
