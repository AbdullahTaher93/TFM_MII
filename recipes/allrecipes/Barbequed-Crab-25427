Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil grate. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Mix in garlic powder, seasoning salt and Worcestershire sauce. Remove legs from crab bodies. Pull apart shells and remove meat. Loosely wrap crabmeat and legs in aluminum foil, and place on the prepared grill. Unwrap slightly, and coat with the butter mixture. Cook until pink and flaky, 15 to 20 minutes.
