In small bowl, combine leeks, red pepper strips, Morton(R) Kosher Salt and white pepper. Place chicken in single layer in shallow baking pan. Top chicken evenly with leek/pepper mixture. Drizzle with melted butter or margarine. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 to 30 minutes or until juices run clear and chicken is cooked through. (**Internal temperature for chicken breast pieces is 170 degrees F). Vegetables will be crisp-tender. Let rest 10 minutes; serve with rice or roasted potatoes.
