Combine tomatoes, sugar, lime juice, ginger, cumin, salt, cinnamon, cloves, and cayenne pepper in a large, heavy-bottomed pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer uncovered until tomatoes are broken down into a thick sauce, about 1 hour and 30 minutes. Pour into sterilized jars; tightly screw on lids. Turn jars upside down to stand on their lids; cool completely. Refrigerate.
