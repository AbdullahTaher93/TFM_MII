In a 9- by 13-inch baking dish or a large bowl, mix onion, chipotle chiles with adobo sauce, garlic, cumin, salt, chili powder, paprika, and oil. Add beef (cut in half if too big to fit) and rub marinade onto both sides. Cover and let stand at room temperature 25 minutes. Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above the cooking grate only 2 to 3 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). Place steak on oiled cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook, turning once with a wide spatula, until browned on the outside and done to your liking in the center (cut to test), about 6 minutes total for rare (reddish pink), or 8 to 10 minutes total for medium-rare (pink). Transfer meat to a cutting board, loosely tent with foil, and let rest 10 minutes. Slice the steak across the grain into thin strips and serve with fajitas fixings.
