Let refrigerated pie crust stand at room temperature according to package directions. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. On a floured surface, roll pie crust from center to edge, forming a circle about 12 inches in diameter. Ease pastry into 11-inch tart pan with removable bottom. Trim pastry even with the rim of the pan. Combine eggs, EAGLE BRAND(R) and butter. Stir in nuts and 3/4 cup chocolate chips. Place pastry-lined tart pan on a baking sheet. Carefully pour filling into pan. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until a knife inserted near center comes out clean. Cool. Before serving, in small saucepan, melt remaining chocolate chips and shortening over low heat. Drizzle over tart. Store leftovers covered in refrigerator.
