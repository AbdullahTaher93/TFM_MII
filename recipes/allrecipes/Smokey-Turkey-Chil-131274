Put a large nonstick soup pot on medium-high heat. When heated, add oil and turkey. Using the back of a spatula, flatten the turkey so it covers the bottom of the pan. When it's no longer pink on the bottom (about 1 to 2 minutes), flip the turkey. Break it up into large chunks with a wooden spoon. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are tender, turkey is no longer pink through, and no excess liquid is left in the pan (about 5 minutes). Add remaining ingredients except salt, pepper, and cheese. Stir, then cover the pot and cook over low heat for at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper. Let cool slightly, then remove bay leaf and divide evenly among four microwave-safe containers. Pack one. Spoon oz cheese into a baggie. Pack. Refrigerate the remaining servings for later meals. At work Microwave the chili on low for 1 minute. If not hot enough, continue to heat in 30-second intervals. Top with cheese. Serve immediately with carrots on the side.
