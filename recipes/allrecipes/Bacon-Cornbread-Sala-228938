Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch pan. Mix corn bread mix, eggs, and milk together in a bowl until combined with a few lumps; pour into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool and crumble into a large bowl. Layer 3/4 cup crumbled bacon, tomatoes, green onions, 1/2 cup pickles, 3/4 cup mayonnaise, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup pickle juice over crumbled corn bread; gently stir to combine. Whisk 1 cup mayonnaise, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup pickle juice, and lemon juice together in a separate bowl until sugar dissolves. Transfer cornbread mixture to a serving dish; top with mayonnaise dressing. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup crumbled bacon and chives. Chill until ready to serve.
