In a small pan, combine soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger, garlic, and oil. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened (about 3 minutes). Pour through a fine wire strainer into a small bowl. Set aside. Rinse fish, pat dry, and arrange on a rack in a broiler pan. Broil about 4 inches below heat for 3 minutes; brush generously with teriyaki sauce, then broil for 3 more minutes. Turn fish over and broil for 3 more minutes; again brush generously with teriyaki sauce. Then continue to broil until fish is just opaque but still moist in thickest part; cut to test (about 3 more minutes). Brush with any remaining teriyaki sauce.
