Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan. Mix together the broccoli, cottage cheese, onion, melted butter, and eggs in a large bowl. Stir the cornbread mixture into the broccoli mixture until it is thoroughly combined. Spread the batter into the prepared baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until the top of the cornbread is lightly browned.
