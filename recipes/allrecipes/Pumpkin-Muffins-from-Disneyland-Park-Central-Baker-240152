Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a muffin pan with paper liners. Set aside. Sift together cake flour, bread flour (or all-purpose flour), baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg into a large bowl. Set aside. Beat together sugar and eggs until pale yellow in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Blend in oil and pumpkin puree until mixture is smooth. Blend half of flour mixture into egg mixture until just combined. Scrape sides of bowl, then stir in raisins. Add remaining flour mixture to batter, mixing just until combined. Scoop batter into prepared muffin pan, filling about 3/4 full. For streusel: Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl. Mash butter with a fork until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle about 1 teaspoon streusel on each muffin. Bake 18 minutes, then lower oven temperature to 325 degrees F and bake 5 minutes more, or until golden brown.
