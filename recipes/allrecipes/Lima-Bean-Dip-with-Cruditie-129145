Place the lima beans, sour cream, garlic, tomato paste, Tabasco sauce, and lemon juice in a food processor or blender. Reserve one basil leaf for garnishing, and add the rest to the food processor or blender. Blend to a smooth puree, scraping down the sides of the container once or twice. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon into a bowl and garnish with the reserved basil leaf. Cover and chill while preparing the crudities. Heat the broiler. Prepare all the vegetables and arrange them on a large serving platter. Warm the pitas under the broiler 1 to 2 minutes, then cut into wedges. Add to the vegetable platter with the sesame breadsticks. Serve with the dip.
