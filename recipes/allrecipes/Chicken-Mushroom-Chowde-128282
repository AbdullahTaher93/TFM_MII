In a 4-quart (4-L) covered pot, simmer chicken in broth until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer chicken to a bowl. Add carrots, celery, onion, mushrooms, parsley, and rosemary to broth; bring to a boil. Lower heat; cover and simmer until vegetables are tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer half of the vegetable mixture to a food processor. Puree. Then return pureed vegetables to pot. In a small saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Stir in flour until smooth. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Gradually add milk and cook until thickened, stirring constantly. Stir milk mixture, chicken, and peas into vegetable mixture. Heat through.
