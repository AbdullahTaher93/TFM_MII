Combine broccoli, strawberries, and Colby-Monterey Jack cheese in a large bowl. Whisk mayonnaise, sugar, and vinegar together in another bowl until blended; pour over broccoli mixture. Sprinkle almonds over broccoli salad and gently toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, 1 to 2 hours.
