PREP: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. CLEAN: Wash hands. Discard giblets or freeze for later use in gravies or as desired. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper to taste, inside and out. Truss chicken by tying string around drumsticks. Fold wing tips under wings and tuck wings under back. Spray shallow baking pan with nonstick cooking spray. Place chicken, breast side up, in pan. CLEAN: Wash hands. Combine apricot preserves, ketchup, mustard, vinegar, horseradish and cinnamon. Reserve two-thirds of mixture for sauce and use remaining third to baste chicken during baking. COOK: Bake chicken at 350 degrees F for 1 hour or until internal juices of chicken run clear. (Or insert instant-read meat thermometer in thickest part of chicken. Temperature should read 180 degrees F.) Baste several times with barbecue mixture during last 30 minutes of baking. SERVE: Remove chicken to warm platter. Let stand 10 minutes before carving. Heat reserved barbecue sauce to serve with chicken. CHILL: Refrigerate leftovers immediately.
