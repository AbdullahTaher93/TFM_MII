Slice off top 1/4 of garlic bulb. Place in center of a piece of foil. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Fold foil around garlic to seal. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F oven for 1 hour; cool. Squeeze bulb to release roasted garlic. Place flat bread on baking sheet and brush with remaining olive oil. Evenly spread roasted garlic over oiled bread. Top with tomato slices, cheese slices and desired amount of whole oregano leaves. Sprinkle with sea salt and cracked pepper to taste. Bake in a preheated 450 degrees F oven for 5 to 7 minutes or until crust is crisp and cheese is melted.
