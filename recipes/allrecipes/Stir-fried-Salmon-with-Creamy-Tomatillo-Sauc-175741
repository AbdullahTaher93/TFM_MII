In a blender or food processor, combine tomatillos, onion, garlic, lime peel, lime juice, sugar, and salt. Whirl until smooth. In a separate bowl, blend together the yogurt and cornstarch. By hand, stir the yogurt mixture into the tomatillo mixture just until combined; do not overbeat or sauce will separate. Set aside. Brush tortillas lightly with hot water; then stack, wrap in foil, and heat in a 350 degrees F oven until warm (10 to 12 minutes). Meanwhile, melt butter in a wide nonstick frying pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add fish and stir-fry gently until just opaque but still moist in thickest part; cut to test (about 4 minutes). Remove from pan and keep warm. Wipe pan clean. Add yogurt-tomatillo sauce to pan. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently, stirring constantly, until sauce is slightly thickened (2 to 3 minutes); do not boil. Divide sauce among 4 individual rimmed plates; spread sauce out evenly, then top equally with fish. Sprinkle with tomato and cilantro leaves, garnish with lime wedges, and season to taste with white pepper. Serve with tortillas.
