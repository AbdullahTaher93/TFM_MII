Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry chicken pieces in the hot oil until browned on all sides. Add the garlic, and continue to cook until the chicken is no longer pink in the middle. Stir in the cilantro and lime juice, and season with salt and pepper. Cook just until heated through. Serve with rice.
