Place the diced tomatoes with juice and water in a large pot, and bring to a boil. Mix in the rice and carrots, and season with cumin, chili powder, red pepper, salt, and black pepper. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 25 minutes, or until rice and carrots are tender. Mix the garbanzo beans into the pot, and continue cooking 5 minutes, until heated through.
