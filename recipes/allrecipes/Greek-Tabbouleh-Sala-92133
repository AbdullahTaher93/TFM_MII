In a 1- to 2-quart pan, bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil over high heat. Stir in bulgur; cover and simmer over low heat until tender to bite, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, drain marinade from artichokes into a small bowl. Add vinegar, mint, oil, and 2 tablespoons water. Pour bulgur into a fine wire strainer to drain, rinse with cold water until cool, and drain well. Mix 1/3 cup vinegar-mint dressing with garbanzos, cucumber, artichoke hearts, and salad greens. Mound salad equally on 3 dinner plates. Mix remaining dressing with bulgur. Mound equally onto greens. Sprinkle with cheese; add salt and pepper to taste.
