Brush up edges slightly. Brush the dough lightly with reserved marinade. Combine the basil, oregano and thyme; sprinkle over marinade. Sprinkle with 1 cup Monterey Jack cheese, ham, artichokes, tomatoes, olives and feta cheese. Sprinkle with remaining Monterey Jack cheese. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until crust and cheese are lightly browned.
