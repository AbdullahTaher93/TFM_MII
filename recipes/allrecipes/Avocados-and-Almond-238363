Arrange avocado slices on a platter or several appetizer plates. Melt butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat until butter begins to bubble and foam. Cook and stir chopped almonds in hot butter until golden and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer almonds to a paper towel-lined plate to cool. Top each avocado slice with almonds and sea salt.
