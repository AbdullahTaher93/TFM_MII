In a large bowl, combine the first five ingredients. In another bowl, combine the eggs, applesauce, oil and vanilla. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened (batter will be thick). Stir in carrots, apple, pineapple, coconut, raisins and nuts. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 350 degrees for 20-24 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
