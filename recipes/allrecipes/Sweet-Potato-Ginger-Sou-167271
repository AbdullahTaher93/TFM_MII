Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and carrots and cook until softened, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the ginger, sweet potatoes, cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. Stir well and cook 1 to 2 minutes, coating potatoes with spices. Add chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Simmer over medium heat 50 to 60 minutes or until potatoes are very soft. Remove soup from heat. Blend soup using a hand-held immersion blender, or puree in several small batches using a conventional blender. Return soup to the stove. Add LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, brown sugar and salt. Bring up to a simmer and serve.
