In a shallow bowl, combine the cornstarch and salt. Add the shrimp. Toss to coat. Warm the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Remove the shrimp from the cornstarch mixture and place in the pan. Cook for 1 1/2 minutes per side, or until just opaque. Add the scallions, bell pepper, cilantro or parsley, garlic, and chile pepper. Cook, stirring often, for 1 minute. Add the lime juice, 3 tablespoons (45 mL) water, sugar, and peppercorns. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute, or until the shrimp are opaque.
