Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta shells in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Pour vinegar over pasta. Mix black-eyed peas, corn, celery, vegetable oil, green bell pepper, olives, green onions, mayonnaise, pimentos, green olives, green chile peppers, salt, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and hot pepper sauce into pasta mixture and stir well. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 1 to 3 days.
