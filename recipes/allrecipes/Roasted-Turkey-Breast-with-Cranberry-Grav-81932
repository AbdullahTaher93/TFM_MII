Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Rinse the turkey and place in roasting pan. In a small bowl, add the butter, paprika, thyme and black pepper. Zap in microwave for a few seconds to melt the butter. Using a basting brush, coat the top of the turkey with the butter and herbs. Cut the stalk of celery in half (just so it fits in the pan better) and place on each side of the turkey. To the pan, add the shallots, bay leaf and chicken stock. Cover the pan with aluminum foil in a tent fashion, not contacting the turkey too much (you can omit this step if cooking a turkey with the skin still on). Place in oven, reduce heat to 350 degrees F, and roast for 30 minutes. Remove foil (save the foil for later), add cranberries and roast another 30 minutes or until turkey has an internal temperature of 175 degrees F. When turkey is done, remove from oven and transfer to a platter and cover with foil to rest for 10 minutes while you make the gravy. Remove and discard the celery and bay leaf. Pour juices into a gravy separator or otherwise skim off the fat. In a blender, add the vinegar, Kitchen Bouquet and Splenda. Pulse to blend. Add the guar gum and pulse again. Add about 1/2 cup of the pan juices and blend. Add the rest of the juices and cranberries and puree. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. It will probably need salt if you used home-made stock. Use more Splenda if your cranberries were extra tart. Slice the turkey and serve with the gravy on the side or drizzled over the turkey slices.
