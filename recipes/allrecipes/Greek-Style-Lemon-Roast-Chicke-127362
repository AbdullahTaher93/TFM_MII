Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Rinse chicken and pat dry with paper towel. Sprinkle inside and out with salt and pepper. Place in a 13x9-inch baking dish. Squeeze the juice from lemon and mix with dressing in a small bowl. Place the squeezed lemon halves inside the cavity of chicken. Drizzle dressing mixture over chicken. Insert meat thermometer into thickest part of one of the chicken's thighs. Bake 1-1/2 hours or until chicken is cooked through (reaches an internal temperature of 180 degrees F), basting occasionally.
