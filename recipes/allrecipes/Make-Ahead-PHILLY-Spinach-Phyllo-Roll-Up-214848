Combine all ingredients except phyllo and butter. Place 1 phyllo sheet on clean work surface; brush lightly with butter. Top with 2 more phyllo sheets, brushing some of the remaining butter between each layer. Place remaining phyllo between sheets of plastic wrap; set aside. Spread 1/5 of the spinach mixture along one short side of phyllo stack to within 1 inch of ends. Fold in long sides of phyllo; roll up from one short side to make log. Brush with some of the remaining butter. Repeat with remaining phyllo sheets, spinach mixture and butter. To prevent phyllo from cracking, score logs at 1-inch intervals. Place in large freezer-weight resealable plastic bags. (Or wrap tightly in plastic wrap until ready to bake.) Remove from freezer 30 minutes before baking. Let stand at room temperature while heating oven to 375 degrees F. Place on baking sheet. Bake 25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool 5 minutes. Transfer to cutting board. Use serrated knife to cut each log into 6 slices to serve.
