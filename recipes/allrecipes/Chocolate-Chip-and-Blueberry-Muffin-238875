Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners. Mix flour, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl. Whisk cream, sugar, chocolate chips, eggs, oats, and blueberries together in a separate bowl until well mixed. Stir flour mixture into cream mixture until batter is well mixed; pour into the prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool muffins in muffin tin for 10 minutes before removing to wire rack to cool completely.
