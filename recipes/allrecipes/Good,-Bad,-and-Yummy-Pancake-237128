Whisk all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, white sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour milk and vanilla extract into the well; add beaten eggs. Mix wet and dry ingredients together until smooth. Grease a skillet with oil and heat over medium heat. Pour 1/4 cup of batter per pancake into the hot skillet; cook until bottom is golden brown and there are many small pinholes in the top of the pancake, about 2 minutes. Flip pancake and continue cooking until golden brown and the middle of the pancake is set, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter, greasing skillet with oil between pancakes as needed.
