Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Toast walnuts in oven for 5 to 8 minutes until the walnuts are lightly toasted. In a food processor, pulse together bread crumbs, walnuts and zest from 1 lemon until well-blended. Pour walnut mixture into a medium dish and toss with parsley and a pinch of salt. Set aside. Prepare Barilla(R) PLUS(R) Penne according to package directions. Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup (250ml) of the pasta cooking liquid. Return pasta to cooking pot. Pour olive oil into a large saute pan while the pasta is cooking. Add leeks and asparagus, and saute over medium heat for about 4 minutes until they start to soften. Add peas and zucchini; saute for another 5 minutes until all of the vegetables are slightly softened; season with salt and black pepper. Add zest of second lemon and reserved cooking liquid; stir gently until combined. Add vegetables to pasta; toss to combine. Gently stir in mint and basil. Taste and adjust seasoning, if needed. Serve 1 cup of pasta mixture into individual serving bowls. Top with 2 tablespoons of the walnut mixture.
