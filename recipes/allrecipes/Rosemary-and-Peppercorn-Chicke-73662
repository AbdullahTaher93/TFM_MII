Mix together the pink and green peppercorns. Spread over the both sides of the chicken breasts. Pound the chicken with a tenderizing mallet until it is half as thick as it was before. Melt half of the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Fry chicken breasts for about 5 minutes per side, or until nicely browned and no longer pink in the center. Remove chicken to a serving dish, and keep warm. Stir the remaining butter, heavy cream, garlic and rosemary into the skillet, mixing into the juices from the chicken. Simmer, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Pour sauce over the chicken, and serve.
