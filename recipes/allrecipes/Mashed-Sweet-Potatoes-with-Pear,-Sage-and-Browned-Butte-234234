Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Scrub sweet potatoes thoroughly and prick with a fork. Bake for 40 to 60 minutes or until tender. Meanwhile, for browned butter, melt butter over medium-low heat in a large saucepan. Cook, swirling pan occasionally, for 10 to 12 minutes or until lightly browned and fragrant. Remove pan from heat. Carefully halve potatoes and scoop out pulp. Mash to desired consistency in a large mixing bowl. Stir mashed potatoes, canned pears and sage into the browned butter in saucepan. Cook and stir until heated through. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
