Bring black-eyed peas and 6 cups water to a boil in a large pot for 3 to 4 minutes. Drain and return black-eyed peas to the pot. Pour chicken broth into the black-eyed peas; simmer over medium heat until black-eyed peas are tender, about 40 minutes. Drain and rinse black-eyed peas; transfer to a large bowl. Drizzle reserved artichoke marinade over black-eyed peas. Mix artichoke hearts, celery, radishes, and green onions into black-eyed peas. Whisk vegetable oil, white vinegar, 3 tablespoons water, and dry Italian dressing mix in a bowl. Pour dressing over black-eyed peas salad and toss to combine.
