Whisk 2 1/2 cups flour and salt together in a large bowl. Add butter and mix into the flour mixture with a fork or pastry blender until the pieces of butter are the size of small peas. Mix shortening into flour mixture with a fork or pastry blender until the pieces of shortening are the size of small peas. Stir ice water into flour mixture with fork, adding more as needed, until dough holds together when pinched. Divide dough in half; shape each into a ball, flatten slightly, and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour. Lightly dust a work surface and a rolling pin with 1/4 cup flour. Unwrap 1 dough ball and place on the floured work surface; roll from the center of the dough out towards the edge. Turn a quarter turn. Dust dough with more flour as needed. Continue rolling until the crust is about 13 inches across and 1/8-inch thick. Roll dough onto the rolling pin and transfer to the pie pan. Lightly press dough into the pan, trimming any edges that hang over.
