In a blender or food processor, mix the orange segments, vinegar, and brown sugar. Transfer to a large resealable plastic bag, and mix in the reserved mandarin orange liquid and oil. Place the turkey drumsticks in the bag, seal, and marinate in the refrigerator 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place the marinated turkey drumsticks on the baking sheet, and season with salt. Cover, and bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove cover, and continue baking 1 hour, basting often with the remaining orange mixture, to an internal temperature of 180 degrees F (80 degrees C).
