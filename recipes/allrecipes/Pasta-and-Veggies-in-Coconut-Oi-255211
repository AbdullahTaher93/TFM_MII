Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add elbow macaroni; cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly softened, about 3 minutes. Add frozen vegetables; cook and stir until tender yet firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain into a bowl. Place coconut oil in the warm pot. Add macaroni mixture, garlic powder, sea salt, and pepper; toss until combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Top with Parmesan cheese.
