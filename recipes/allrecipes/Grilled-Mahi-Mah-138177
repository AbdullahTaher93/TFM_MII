Make marinade: Combine olive oil, lime juice, garlic, cumin seeds, pepper, and herbs in a large resealable plastic bag or airtight plastic container. Shake well to combine. Add fish, and shake gently to coat well with the marinade. Refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. Heat grill or grill pan. Remove fish from marinade, letting excess drip off; grill until it is browned on the outside and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Serve hot or at room temperature.
