Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Lay a chicken breast onto a work surface and place the palm of your hand down on the meat. With a sharp knife, carefully slice the chicken breast half horizontally, without cutting all the way through, and open up the sliced chicken breast like a book. Repeat with the other two chicken breasts. Place each sliced, opened out chicken breast between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound the chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of about 1/2 inch. To stuff the chicken breasts, lay out a flattened breast and place a skewer on the meat, in the center. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of chili over the skewer and top the chili with about a teaspoon of pepperjack cheese. Roll the chicken breast around the skewer and secure with toothpicks. Wrap each chicken roll with 2 slices of bacon and secure with toothpicks. Pour about 1/2 cup of barbecue sauce into a bowl, and brush each roll with sauce. Discard any leftover sauce. Cook on the preheated grill, turning often and spraying the grill with water occasionally to prevent flare-ups, until the chicken is no longer pink in the middle, the juices run clear, and the bacon is browned, about 15 minutes. Pour more barbecue sauce into a clean bowl and brush the rolls again before removing from the grill. Let rest about 5 minutes before pulling out the toothpicks and skewers for serving.
