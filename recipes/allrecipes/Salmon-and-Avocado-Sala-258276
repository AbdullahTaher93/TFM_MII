Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; place salmon fillet on top. Bake salmon in the preheated oven until easily flaked with a fork, about 15 minutes. Let cool, about 10 minutes. Flake into bite-sized pieces with a fork. Combine cooled salmon, avocados, grape tomatoes, red bell pepper, and green onions in a large bowl. Drizzle lime juice and olive oil on top. Add kosher salt, black pepper, and chili powder; toss gently distribute evenly. Chill salad until flavors combine, 2 hours to overnight.
