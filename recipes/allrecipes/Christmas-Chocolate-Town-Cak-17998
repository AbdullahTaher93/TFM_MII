Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 - 9 inch pans. Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside. Combine cocoa and boiling water in small bowl to form a smooth paste. Cool slightly. In a large bowl, cream together the shortening, sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk, mixing just until incorporated. Blend in cocoa paste. Divide batter into 2 prepared 9 inch pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes in pans then turn out onto wire rack and cool completely.
