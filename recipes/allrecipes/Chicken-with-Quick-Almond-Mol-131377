Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Saute chicken breasts, turning once, until chicken is golden brown and cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove chicken to a plate. Lower heat to medium, and add garlic to pan. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chicken broth, almond butter, chile powder and cocoa. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until sauce is slightly thickened, about 3 to 4 minutes. Meanwhile, cut chicken into strips. When sauce is thickened, return chicken to pan and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more, stirring, until chicken is coated with sauce and warmed through. Serve chicken and sauce over rice, accompanied with lime wedges.
