Drain juices from turkey; dry turkey with paper towels. Fill neck cavity with part of the stuffing. Turn wings back to hold neck skin against back of turkey. Fill body cavity with remaining stuffing. Place turkey, breast up, on flat roasting rack in shallow roasting pan. Brush with oil. Bake 4 to 4-1/2 hours, or until meat thermometer reaches 160 degrees F when inserted in center of stuffing and reaches 180 degrees F when inserted in deep in thigh, covering breast and top of drumsticks with aluminum foil after 2-1/2 hours to prevent overcooking of the breast.
