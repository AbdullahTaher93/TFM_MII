Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place butternut squash and leek in a shallow roasting pan. Drizzle olive oil on top; season with salt and pepper. Roast in the preheated oven until butternut squash is tender and lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Broil on high until evenly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Cook and stir sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir into butternut squash and leek mixture.
