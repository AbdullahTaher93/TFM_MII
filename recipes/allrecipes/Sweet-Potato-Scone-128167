In a large bowl, whisk the flours, bran, cream of tartar, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Stir in the sweet potatoes and raisins. Add the buttermilk and canola oil. Turn out onto a floured bread board; with floured hands, knead the mixture for about 2 minutes. On the same board, roll the dough 1/4 inch (5 mm) thick. Cut out 1 1/2-inch (4-cm) rounds. Transfer to a lightly oiled baking sheet. Use all the dough by re-rolling leftovers. Bake at 475 degrees F (250 degrees C) for 6 to 8 minutes. Serve warm.
