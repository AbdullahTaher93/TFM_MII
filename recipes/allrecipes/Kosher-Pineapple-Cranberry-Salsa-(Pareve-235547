Cook and gently stir cranberries, sugar, and water in a large skillet over medium heat until the mixture begins to bubble. Reduce heat to low and cook until cranberries begin to soften and break down, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Combine pineapple, mango, cilantro, mandarin oranges, onion, and jalapeno together in a bowl; drizzle with orange juice. Stir cooled cranberries and pineapple mixture together. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.
