Trim greens and stems from beets. Thoroughly wash and chop greens and stems. Peel and cut beets into 1/2-inch cubes. Bring beets, chicken broth, leeks, celery root, carrots, and parsnips to a boil in a large pot. Add potatoes, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until vegetables are tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir beet greens and stems into soup and simmer until greens and stems are tender, about 5 minutes. Mix sugar, lemon juice, and salt into soup. Stir sour cream and flour together in a bowl until smooth and thickened. Whisk 1 cup soup into sour cream mixture until smooth; pour sour cream mixture into soup and stir. Simmer soup until thickened slightly, about 1 minute. Add dill and remove pot from heat. Ladle soup into serving bowls and arrange 4 egg quarters in each bowl.
