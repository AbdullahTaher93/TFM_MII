In a mixing bowl, cream butter and brown sugar. Combine flour, oats, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture with water. Beat until crumbly. Firmly press half into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan; set the remaining oat mixture aside. In a saucepan, combine the sugar, cornstarch and water until smooth; stir in raisins. Cook and stir over medium heat until thick and bubbly. Cool to room temperature; spread over crust. Top with reserved oat mixture and pat down. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. In a small bowl, combine confectioners; sugar and cinnamon; stir in enough milk to reach drizzling consistency. Drizzle over bars. Cut and store in an airtight container.
