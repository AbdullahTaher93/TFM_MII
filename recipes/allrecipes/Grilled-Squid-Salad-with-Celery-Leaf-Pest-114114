Light a grill. In a small skillet, toast the pine nuts over high heat until lightly browned. Transfer to a plate to cool. In a food processor, combine 1/2 cup of the parsley with the celery leaves, garlic and pine nuts and process until minced. Add the 6 tablespoons of olive oil and the Parmesan and process until smooth. Season the pesto with salt and pepper and transfer to a large bowl. Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the celery and blanch for 30 seconds; drain. Rinse under cold water and pat dry. Add the celery, butter beans, pickled peppers, onion and the remaining 1 cup of parsley to the pesto. In a medium bowl, toss the squid with a little olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the squid over high heat for 5 minutes, or until charred in spots. Cut the bodies into rings; leave the tentacles whole. Add the squid to the salad and toss. Season with salt and pepper, garnish with the basil and serve.
