In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs with the cream, salsa, cumin and a pinch of salt and pepper. In a non stick skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter and then scramble the eggs. Just before they are set, add the cheese and fold-in until it begins to melt. Lay the tortillas on a flat surface. Divide the eggs equally between the two and place on the bottom third of each tortilla. Fold the bottom third over tucking in. Fold in the two sides and then roll up. Serve.
