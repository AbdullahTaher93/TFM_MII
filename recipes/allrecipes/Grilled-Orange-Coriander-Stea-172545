Mix orange peel, juice, onion, garlic, vinegar, coriander, pepper, and basil. Cover and chill 1/2 cup of the mixture until serving. In a 9- by 13-inch pan, coat steaks with remaining marinade. Cover and chill, turning meat once, 4 hours or up to overnight. Lift steaks from marinade and place on a grill, 4 inches from heat, over a solid bed of hot coals or on a gas grill on medium-high (you can hold your hand at grill level for only 3 to 4 seconds). Cover gas grill. Cook, turning once, until browned on outside and pink inside (cut to test), 14 to 18 minutes total. Place steaks on warm plates. Garnish with watercress. Offer reserved marinade to spoon over each piece. Sprinkle with salt to taste.
