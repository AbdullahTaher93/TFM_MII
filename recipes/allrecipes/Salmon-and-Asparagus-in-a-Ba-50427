Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place asparagus and water in a covered, microwave-safe, and vented bowl; steam in the microwave for 5 minutes. Rub salmon with olive oil, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, dill weed, salt, and black pepper; place in a foil oven bag. Toss spinach, capers, red onion, and asparagus with salt, black pepper, and 1 tablespoon lemon juice in the foil oven bag. Place vegetables on top of salmon. Fold foil bag closed and place in a baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 30 minutes. Carefully split bag open with a knife to release steam.
