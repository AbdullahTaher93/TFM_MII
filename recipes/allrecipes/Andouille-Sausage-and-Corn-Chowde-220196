Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion, celery, green bell pepper, and red bell pepper in the hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir garlic, cayenne pepper, and diced andouille sausage into the onion mixture; continue to cook and stir until the sausage is hot, 1 to 2 minutes more. Fold corn kernels and bay leaves into the sausage mixture; season with thyme. Allow the mixture to simmer until the corn is warmed, about 1 minute. Pour chicken broth into the pot; bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes. Stir potatoes and heavy cream to the pot, place a cover on the pot, and continue cooking at a simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Season the chowder with salt and black pepper. Remove and discard the bay leaves. Garnish with cilantro to serve.
