Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove several outer layers of skin from garlic head, leaving a thin layer of skin attached. With a serrated knife, cut off top 1/2 inch of garlic head. Season with salt and pepper, wrap in foil, and put in a small baking dish. Bake until completely soft, about 1 1/2 hours. When garlic is cool enough to handle, squeeze pulp out onto a cutting board; smash to a puree with the side of a knife. Bring stock and garlic to a boil in a large saute pan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 5 minutes. Add dandelion greens; add salt and pepper to taste. Cook, tossing, until greens are slightly wilted, about 3 minutes. Add goat cheese, and cook, stirring, until cheese is melted and liquid is creamy, about 3 minutes. While dandelion greens are cooking, cook fettuccine in a large pot of rapidly boiling salted water until al dente, according to package directions. Drain in a colander. Add pasta and parsley to saute pan. Toss over low heat until heated through; season with salt and pepper, if necessary. Serve immediately.
