In a food processor or blender, combine the artichoke hearts, lemon juice, garlic and olive oil. Process until smooth and transfer to a medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Slice the sandwich rolls in half lengthwise, and pull out most of the soft bread from the top and bottom. Brush 1 tablespoon balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing on the top half of each roll; spread 1 tablespoon of artichoke paste on the bottom half of each roll. Layer salami, cheese, pepperoncini and arugula over sandwich bottoms; top with remaining bread half. Serve.
