Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Measure biscuit mix into a large bowl. Stir in milk and cheese until a soft dough forms. Drop 9 spoonfuls of the dough onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, until golden brown. While biscuits bake stir together butter and garlic powder. Remove biscuits from oven and brush with butter mixture.
