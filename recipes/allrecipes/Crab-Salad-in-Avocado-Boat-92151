In a bowl, mix sour cream, lemon peel, and 1/2 tablespoon of the lemon juice. Gently stir in crab, chopped chives, and bell pepper. Add salt and pepper to taste. Cut avocado in half lengthwise; remove pit. Brush entire cut surfaces of the avocado halves with remaining 1/2 tablespoon of the lemon juice. Set each avocado half, cut side up, on a salad plate; if necessary, cut a strip off the bottom of each, through peel, to balance. Mound crab salad equally in cavities. Garnish with anchovy fillets, lemon wedges, and whole chives. Add more salt and pepper to taste.
