Whisk together Egg Beaters and Reddi-wip in large shallow dish; set aside. Heat sausage in microwave according to package directions. Meanwhile, spread syrup evenly over bread. Top each of 4 bread slices with 1/4 of the apple and 2 sausage patties. Top with remaining 4 bread slices, syrup-side down, to make sandwiches. Melt 1 tablespoon Parkay in 12-inch nonstick skillet or large griddle over medium heat. Carefully dip 2 sandwiches, 1 at a time, in Egg Beaters mixture, coating both sides. Place in skillet; cook 2 to 3 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Repeat with remaining Parkay, Egg Beaters mixture and sandwiches. Cut each in half to serve. Top with additional syrup, if desired.
