Preheat oven to 300 degrees F and coat a cookie sheet with cooking spray. In a large bowl, mix oats, nuts, and seeds. In a separate bowl, stir honey, sugar, oil, juice, and salt together. Combine the two bowls and spread mixture on the cookie sheet. Bake about 20 minutes or until evenly browned. Let cool. Stir in apricots, then place granola in six airtight zip-lock bags for easy retrieval.
