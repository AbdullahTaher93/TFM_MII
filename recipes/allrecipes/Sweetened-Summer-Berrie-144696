Heat sugar and 2/3 cup water in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved, about 1 minute. Add berries and lemon juice; cook, stirring very gently, until berries begin to release their juices, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer berries to a medium bowl; set aside. Continue to cook liquid until it has been reduced by half, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat, and let cool slightly. Gently fold liquid into berries. Refrigerate 15 minutes. Divide berries and syrup among 4 serving bowls.
