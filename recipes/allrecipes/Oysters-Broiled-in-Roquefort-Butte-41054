Stir together butter, blue cheese, and pepper until nearly smooth. Cover and refrigerate up to 3 days until serving time. Place oyster shells, about half at a time, on rack in broiler pan. Top each oyster with a rounded teaspoon of the blue cheese mixture; broil 4 to 5 inches from the heat 3 to 5 minutes or until golden and edges of oysters curl. Serve immediately. If desired, line the serving platter with a bed of clean pearlized glass balls (available at garden supply and crafts stores).
