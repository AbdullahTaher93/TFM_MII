Mix chicken stock, soy sauce, cornstarch, and garlic in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Heat sesame oil in a large skill over medium-high heat until oil shimmers; cook and stir vegetables in hot oil until softened, about 4 minutes. Add shrimp; cook and stir until shrimp begin to turn pink, about 3 minutes. Stir chicken stock mixture into vegetable-shrimp mixture. Continue to cook and stir until vegetables and shrimp are coated and sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes more.
