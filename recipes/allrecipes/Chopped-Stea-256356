Place ground beef into a large bowl and break into smaller pieces. Cover with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, rosemary, mustard, paprika, and dill weed; knead thoroughly. Knead in onion, egg, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix in crackers until thoroughly incorporated. Shape beef mixture into 5-ounce, 1/2-inch thick patties. Preheat a grill pan over medium heat. Grill patties until an instant-read thermometer into the center reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 5 to 7 minutes per side.
