Stir together hot roll mix, water, garam masala and olive oil in a large mixing bowl until dough pulls away from sides of bowl. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead for 2 minutes. Shape dough into a ball and place in a bowl coated with nonstick cooking spray, turning to oil top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees F), free from drafts, 35 minutes or until doubled in size. Divide dough into 11 pieces; shape each piece into a ball, and place in an aluminum foil-lined 15x10-inch jellyroll pan coated with cooking spray. Cover and let stand 5 minutes. Stretch and shape each ball into a thin 6x4-inch rectangle. Grill flatbread, without grill lid, over medium heat (300 degrees F to 350 degrees F) 2 minutes on each side, brushing with butter. Sprinkle with coconut, and serve with Coconut Dipping Sauce. To make Coconut Dipping Sauce: In a food processor, process coconut milk, almonds, tomato sauce, honey, curry powder and ginger until nuts are finely ground, stopping to scrape down sides. Makes 1 1/3 cups.
