Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a casserole dish with cooking spray. Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion in the hot oil until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add soup and water; stir. Season the mixture with garlic salt and pepper. Layer chicken into the bottom of the prepared casserole dish; top with chow mein noodles and pimentos. Pour the mixture from the saucepan over the layers to cover. Bake in preheated oven until completely heated through, 20 to 30 minutes.
