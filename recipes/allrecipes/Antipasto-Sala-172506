In a small bowl, whisk vinegar, oil, capers, lemon juice, and black pepper to blend; set aside. Cut sliced meats into short strips about 1/4-inch wide (or cut each slice in half). In a shallow serving bowl, mix greens, bell pepper, and chopped basil. Drizzle three-fourths of the dressing over greens; mix well. Decoratively arrange meats, roasted peppers, cheese, and anchovies (if desired) over greens. Drizzle with remaining dressing. Garnish with basil sprigs.
