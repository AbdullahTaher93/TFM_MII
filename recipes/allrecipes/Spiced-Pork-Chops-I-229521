Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x14-inch baking dish. Mix flour, garlic powder, mustard, paprika, cayenne pepper, celery salt, ground ginger, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper together in a shallow dish. Dredge pork chops in the flour mixture to coat. Reserve remaining flour mixture. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook pork chops in hot oil until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer pork chops to prepared baking dish, reserving any drippings in the skillet. Stir sherry, water, and brown sugar together until sugar dissolves; pour over pork chops. Bake in preheated oven until tender and no longer pink in the center, 40 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Move pork chops to a plate and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Pour liquid from baking dish into the skillet with reserved drippings. Place skillet with drippings mixture to medium-low heat. Stir cream into the drippings. Cook and stir, gradually integrating reserved flour mixture, until the mixture begins to thicken. Serve as a gravy for the pork chops.
