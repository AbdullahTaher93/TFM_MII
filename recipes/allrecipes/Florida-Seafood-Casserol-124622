In a saucepan, saute onion in butter; blend in flour. Add milk and cream; cook and stir until thick and bubbly. Remove from the heat; stir in salt, pepper, pimiento, water chestnuts, lemon juice, parsley, crabmeat, shrimp, rice and half of the cheese. Spoon into a 2-1/2-qt. casserole. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes or until heated through. Sprinkle with remaining cheese just before serving.
