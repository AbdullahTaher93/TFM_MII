In a bowl, combine the orange juice, peanut butter and curry powder. Pour a third of the marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add chicken. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade. Drain and discard marinade from chicken. Grill chicken and peppers over medium heat for 8-10 minutes on each side or until chicken juices run clear and peppers are tender. Warm the reserved marinade. Cut chicken and peppers into 1/2-in. strips; sprinkle with coconut and currants. Serve with rice and reserved marinade.
