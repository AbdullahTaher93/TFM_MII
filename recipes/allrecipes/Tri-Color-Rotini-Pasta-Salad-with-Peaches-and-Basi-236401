Cook pasta according to package directions. Toss with 1 tablespoon olive oil; set aside. Grill peaches on barbecue grill or grill pan until lightly caramelized and browned. Cool, then slice. To make dressing, gently saute garlic in olive oil until yellow. Combine the olive oil and garlic with vinegar, sugar, chopped basil, curry powder, and salt and pepper. Mix well. Refrigerate until needed. To make salad, mix peaches, pasta and remaining ingredients together in a bowl. Add dressing. Stir to combine.
