Lightly coat a 2-quart oval or rectangular baking dish with cooking spray; set aside. In a large saucepan cook potatoes, covered, in boiling salted water about 8 minutes or just until tender. Drain and transfer to a very large bowl; set aside. For sauce, cook onion and garlic in 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat about 5 minutes or just until tender. Stir in flour, parsley, basil, salt, and black pepper. Stir in LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk all at once. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Add spinach and sweet pepper to potatoes. Toss gently to combine. Pour sauce over potato mixture. Stir gently until coated. Spoon potato mixture into prepared baking dish. In a small bowl stir together the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and bread crumbs; toss to coat. Sprinkle over potato mixture. Bake, uncovered, in a 375 degree F oven about 20 minutes or until edges are bubbly and crumbs are golden.
