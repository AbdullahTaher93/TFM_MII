Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two baking sheets. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, salt and baking soda. Stir in honey, shortening and water. Mix dough until it is smooth and well developed. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 8 minutes. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into loaves. Place loaves on prepared baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden.
