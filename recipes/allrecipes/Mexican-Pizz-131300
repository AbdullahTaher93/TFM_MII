Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place tortilla on nonstick baking sheet (large enough so that it lays flat.) Bake 3 to 5 minutes per side or until it begins to brown and get crispy. (If large air pockets begin to form as it bakes, poke to remove them). In a small bowl, stir water into seasoning. Preheat a small nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add meat, breaking it into chunks with a wooden spoon as it cooks. When meat is no longer pink, stir in seasoning. When no liquid remains, remove pan from heat. Leave crisped tortilla on baking sheet and spread evenly (except for the outer 1/2-inch) with picante sauce. Add the beef, cheese, and tomatoes, and sprinkle cilantro over the top. Bake pizza 5 to 7 minutes or until cheese melts. Transfer to serving plate and cut into 4 wedges. Serve immediately.
