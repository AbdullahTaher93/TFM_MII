Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir green onions and garlic until onions are tender, about 4 minutes. Add artichokes, tomatoes, capers, and chipotle chile powder; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer. Place shrimp into sauce; cook and stir until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 5 minutes. Divide pasta evenly into 4 bowls and top with shrimp and tomato sauce. Scatter goat cheese over sauce.
