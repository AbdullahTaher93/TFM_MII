Combine dill, capers, mayonnaise, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; set aside. Season fish with salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Wrap three slices of bacon around each salmon filet (wash hands). Preheat large saute pan on medium-high 2-3 minutes. Place salmon in pan; cook 4-5 minutes on each side or until bacon is crisp and salmon is 145 degrees F (or flesh separates easily). Spread 2 teaspoons mayonnaise mixture on each bread slice; top with spinach and tomato. Add salmon and assemble sandwiches; serve.
