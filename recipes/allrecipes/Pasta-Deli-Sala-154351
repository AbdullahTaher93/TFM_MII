Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil over high heat. Cook the pasta in boiling water, until the pasta has cooked through but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain. Combine the pasta and the Italian dressing in a large bowl. Add the salami, provolone, red onions, bell peppers, Parmesan, and pepperoni; stir until well combined. Cover, and chill 2 hours or overnight.
