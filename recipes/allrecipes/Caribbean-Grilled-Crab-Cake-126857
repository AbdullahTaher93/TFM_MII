Drain the crabmeat. In a large bowl, mix the crabmeat, bread crumbs, mayonnaise, egg, green onions, hot sauce, and salt and pepper until combined. Shape the mixture into 16 small cakes. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl combine the diced mango, onion, basil, cilantro, lime juice, jalapeno (if using), and salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to use. To grill: Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate or a grill basket. Grill about 8 minutes, turning once. To pan-fry: Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook crab cake patties until crisp and golden brown on both sides, about 4 minutes per side. Top crab cakes with mango salsa and enjoy.
