Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Drain canned peaches, reserving 2 tablespoons of the syrup. Lightly sprinkle chicken breasts with salt and black pepper; brush with reserved peach syrup. Combine panko and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the cumin in a shallow dish. Coat chicken with the panko mixture and place on a greased baking sheet. Drizzle with melted butter. Bake for 18 to 22 minutes or until no pink remains (165 degrees F). Meanwhile, for the Chipotle Peach Salsa, chop the drained peach slices. Combine chopped peaches, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon cumin, the bell pepper, onion, chipotle pepper and the 1/4 teaspoon salt in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high (100% power) for 1 to 2 minutes or until heated through, stirring once. Serve with the chicken.
