Bring chicken broth to a boil in a 2-quart saucepan. Stir in quinoa. Reduce heat to low; simmer, covered, until broth is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in corn. Cover and let stand until corn is warmed through, about 5 minutes. Whisk lime juice, red wine vinegar, lime zest, and cumin together in a large bowl. Whisk in avocado oil. Add black beans, red bell pepper, red onion, and cilantro. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in quinoa and corn.
