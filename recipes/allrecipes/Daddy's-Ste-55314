In a skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef and onions until beef is evenly brown and onions are tender. Drain grease. In a pot, mix the beef and onions, minestrone soup, pinto beans with jalapeno peppers, and diced tomatoes and green chiles. Season with garlic powder, seasoned salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer 1 hour.
