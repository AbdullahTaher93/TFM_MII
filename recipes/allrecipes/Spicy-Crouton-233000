Lay bread slices onto a flat surface. Cut circles out of the middle of each slice using a drinking glass; discard bread remainders. Sprinkle about 3/4 teaspoon chili pepper and 3/4 teaspoon garlic and herb seasoning over each side of each bread circle. Lightly grease a skillet with oil and place over medium heat. Cook bread circles in skillet until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
