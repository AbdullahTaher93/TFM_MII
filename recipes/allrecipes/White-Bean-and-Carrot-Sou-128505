Place the potatoes and 2 cups of the broth in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until tender. Remove from the heat. Using a fork, potato masher, or handheld immersion blender, mash until free of lumps. Set aside. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until golden. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the beans, carrots, and the remaining 4 cups broth. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the carrots are tender. Stir in the potatoes, milk, parsley, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until heated through.
