In a small bowl, whisk together 1/3 cup of the oil, vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon each of the salt and pepper. Add olives and red bell pepper; mix well. Let stand while preparing steaks. In another small bowl, combine remaining 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, thyme, oregano, paprika and cayenne pepper; mix well. Sprinkle over both sides of steaks. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add steaks; cook for 3 to 4 minutes per side or until well-browned and medium rare. Transfer to a carving board; tent with foil and let stand 5 minutes. Arrange salad greens and tomatoes on four serving plates. Carve steaks crosswise into 1/4 inch thick slices; arrange over greens. Spoon olive mixture over steak and greens; garnish with cilantro.
