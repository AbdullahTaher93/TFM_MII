Place peaches, red bell peppers, and banana pepper in a large pot. Add vinegar, salt, and lemon halves; cook and stir over medium heat, stirring frequently, until peaches and peppers soften, about 30 minutes. Remove lemon halves with a slotted spoon; stir in sugar. Simmer until sugar dissolves and relish is slightly reduced, another 30 minutes.
