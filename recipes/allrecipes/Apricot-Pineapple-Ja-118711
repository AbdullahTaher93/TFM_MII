In a large saucepan, bring apricots and water to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 15 minutes or until apricots are very tender. Mash. Add pineapple, grapefruit juice and sugar. Simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour or until thick and translucent, stirring frequently. Pour into jars or freezer containers; cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Cover and let stand overnight or until set, but no longer than 24 hours. Refrigerate for up to 3 weeks or freeze for up to 1 year.
