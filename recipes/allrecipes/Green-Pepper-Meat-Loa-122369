In a large bowl, combine eggs, green peppers, onion, celery leaves, parsley and soup mix. Crumble beef and sausage over the mixture and mix well. Shape into a 12-in. x 4-in. loaf. Place on a rack in a shallow baking pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1 hour. Place bacon strips over top if desired. Bake 45-60 minutes longer or until no pink remains and a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F.
