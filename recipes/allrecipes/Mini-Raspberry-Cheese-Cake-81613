Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Mix together the almond meal, Splenda and cinnamon. Mix in the butter. Using a fork or whisk, mix together the water with the powdered egg whites until all dissolved and frothy. Add to the almonds. Mix well. Spoon out 1 tsp of the crust mixture into each of the muffin mold and press down firmly. Bake at 325 degrees F for 5 minutes. Remove and let cool. Meanwhile, beat together the softened cream cheese and sour cream until smooth with no lumps. This can be done in a food processor, with an electric mixer or by hand. Add the Splenda and lemon extract. If using an electric mixer or food processor then add one egg at a time. If mixing by hand then beat the eggs well, then add to the cream cheese mixture a little at a time and mix until well blended. Repeat 2 or 3 times. Add a single raspberry to each muffin mold. Spoon in 1 scant Tbsp each. Bake at 325 degrees F for 20 minutes or until the mini cakes have risen above the edges and no longer jiggle. Remove from oven and allow to cool for 15 minutes. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes (or 24 hours). Using a thin bladed knife or tooth pick, go around the edge of each mini cake to loosen it. Turn over onto paper towels. Arrange on a platter and serve.
