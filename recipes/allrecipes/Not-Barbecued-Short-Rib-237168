Spread onion into the bottom of the crock of your slow cooker. Season short ribs with salt and pepper; place atop the onion. Mix water, pineapple chunks with juice, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, garlic, sage, thyme, and mustard together in a bowl; pour over the ribs. Cook on High for 4 hours (on on Low for 6 to 8 hours).
