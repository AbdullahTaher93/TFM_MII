Set aside. In a small glass or stainless-steel bowl, combine the fish sauce, the remaining 1 tablespoon lemon juice, garlic, and 2 teaspoons sugar, the water, vinegar, and red-pepper flakes. In a large glass or stainless-steel bowl, combine the romaine, carrots, cucumber, cilantro, and mint. Light the grill or heat the broiler. Thread the steak onto eight skewers.
