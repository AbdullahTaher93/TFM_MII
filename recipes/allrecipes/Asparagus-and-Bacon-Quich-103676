Adjust oven rack to lowest and highest positions and preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Toss asparagus with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast asparagus on highest rack until tender-crisp and bright green, about 8 minutes. Remove and set aside. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add bacon and shallots, stirring frequently until crisp and golden brown, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. While asparagus and bacon cook, beat eggs, milk, nutmeg, salt and ground black pepper in a medium bowl. In the following order, sprinkle half of the cheese, bacon, and asparagus in each pie shell. Pour half of the egg mixture over each. Bake on bottom oven rack until crust is golden brown and custard is set, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes, cut into wedges and serve.
