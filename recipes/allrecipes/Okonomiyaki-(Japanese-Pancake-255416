Mix flour and water together in a bowl until smooth. Stir in cabbage, bacon, eggs, sausage, green onions, shrimp, cheese, and tenkasu. Preheat a griddle to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C); coat with oil. Pour in flour mixture in the shape of a pancake. Cook until golden brown, about 6 minutes per side. Transfer to a serving plate. Mix soy sauce, ketchup, and vinegar together in a small bowl to make okonomiyaki sauce. Drizzle over pancake. Garnish with panko and mayonnaise.
