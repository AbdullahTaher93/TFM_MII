In a medium bowl, mix jumbo black olives, green olives, celery, red onion, garlic, basil, parsley, olive oil, oregano, salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cover and chill in the refrigerator until using. Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Sprinkle pizza crust with olive oil, salt and garlic powder. Place the crust directly on the oven rack. Bake for about 5 minutes. Do not allow crust to become overly browned or crisp. Remove from heat and allow to cool. In a medium bowl, mix together mozzarella cheese, Provolone cheese, Parmesan cheese, hard salami, mortadella and prosciutto. Stir in the olive mixture. Preheat the broiler. Spread the cheese and vegetable mixture over the baked pizza crust. Broil 5 minutes, or until cheeses are melted and meats are lightly browned. Cut into 3 inch squares and serve immediately.
