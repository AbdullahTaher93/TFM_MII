In a large skillet, cook chicken and onion in oil until onion is tender; remove and keep warm. Add tomatoes, broth, basil and pepper to the skillet. Bring to a boil; stir in spaghetti. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes. Return chicken to pan; cook until juices run clear and spaghetti is tender. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
