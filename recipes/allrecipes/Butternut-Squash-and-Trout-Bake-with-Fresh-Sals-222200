Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil. Combine tomatoes, red onion, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a bowl. Place squash halves on a baking sheet. Fill butternut squash cavities with tomato salsa mixture, reserving about 2 tablespoons of salsa for garnish. Brush cut surfaces of squash with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Sprinkle squash with 2 tablespoons of dill. Bake squash in the preheated oven until almost tender, about 45 minutes. Remove baking sheet from oven; place trout fillets onto baking sheet, brush with 1 teaspoon olive oil, and sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons dill. Return to oven and bake until trout fillets are opaque and fish flakes easily with a fork, about 15 more minutes. Serve fillets on top of squash halves, served with reserved salsa.
