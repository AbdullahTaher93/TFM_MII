Place one tortilla on a sheet of waxed paper sized to fit in your microwave. Spoon 2 tablespoons each of Cheddar and Mozzarella cheeses over the tortilla. Cover the cheese with turkey slices. Spread 1 tablespoon of pizza sauce over the turkey, and top with 1 tablespoon each tomatoes, black olives, and green peppers. Sprinkle with remaining Cheddar and Mozzarella cheeses, and place second tortilla on top. Place on a microwave-safe plate, and cover with a sheet of waxed paper. Cook on High in microwave until the cheese melts, about 1 1/2 minutes. Allow to cool 2 minutes before cutting into wedges.
