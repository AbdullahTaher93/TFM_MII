Place the chopped bacon in a large saucepan, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned and crisp, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove the bacon and set aside. Drain the grease from the pan. Stir the vinegar, white sugar, and brown sugar into the pan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Drain 2 cans of green beans and add them to the vinegar mixture. Pour 2 undrained cans of beans into the mixture, and stir the bacon back into the beans. Stir lightly to combine. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the sauce is thickened and the flavors have blended, about 20 minutes.
