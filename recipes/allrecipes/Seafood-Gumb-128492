Prepare the rice according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, combine the oil and flour. Cook over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until the mixture turns dark brown. Add the onions, bell pepper, and celery. Cook, stirring, for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the vegetables begin to soften. Add the tomatoes and okra and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the haddock, shrimp, scallops, and oysters. Simmer, covered, for 5 minutes, or until the fish, shrimp, scallops, and oysters are opaque. Remove from the heat and stir in the hot-pepper sauce and file powder. Serve over hot rice.
