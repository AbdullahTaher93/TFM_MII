Combine turkey, salt, garlic powder, chili powder, smoked and sweet paprika, cumin, coriander, oregano, chipotle pepper, cinnamon, cloves, and apple cider vinegar in a mixing bowl. Mix well. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour for flavors to blend. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Cut squash in half lengthwise, scoop out seeds and brush cut sides with olive oil. Place squash cut-side down on prepared baking sheet. Roast in preheated oven until squash is soft, 40 to 45 minutes. Set aside and keep warm. Heat a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add chilled chorizo mixture. Cook and stir, breaking up lumps, until cooked through and browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add onion and cook for an additional 5 minutes, or until onion becomes translucent, stirring constantly. Add garlic and cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in chili powder, salt, and cumin. Stir in beans, corn, diced green chilies, and tomatoes; cover and simmer 4 to 5 minutes. Fluff spaghetti squash strands with a fork, keeping them in the shells. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Divide sauce among 4 squash halves. Top each half with 1/4 cup of cheese. Return to baking sheet and bake until cheese is melted 5 to 6 minutes. Garnish with fresh cilantro.
