Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat a baking dish with melted butter and arrange asparagus in a single layer. Sprinkle onion, celery, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, oregano, and thyme over asparagus; top with tomato slices. Bake in the preheated oven until asparagus is tender and top is golden brown, about 45 minutes.
