Preheat oven broiler. Place short ribs on rack in broiler pan so surface of beef is 3 to 4 inches from heat. Broil about 20 minutes or until well-browned, turning as needed. Place in Dutch oven. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Add tomato juice, onion, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, cinnamon, cloves, and pepper to ribs; bring to a boil. Cover tightly and cook in oven 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until beef is fork-tender. Remove ribs. Skim fat from sauce. Serve sauce with ribs.
