Stir oil, garlic, bay leaf and crushed red pepper (or chile) in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until garlic just begins to color, about 30 seconds. Add shrimp and season with salt. Stir until shrimp turn pink, 2 to 4 minutes. Stir in wine and lemon juice. Adjust seasonings. Transfer to a platter and sprinkle with parsley. Serve immediately.
