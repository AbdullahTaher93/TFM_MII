To roast the beet preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Scrub the beet and cut off the root tail. On the stem end leave about 2 inches of stem (this will assist with slicing after it has been roasted). Coat the beet in canola oil and place on a foil lined sheet pan. Roast at 400 degrees F for about 25 minutes or until fork can piece through without too much resistance. Once it has cooled enough to handle, cut slices (hold the stems and start slicing from the root end - handy huh). Then julienne each slice. While the beet is roasting, make the dressing. In a bowl or jar, mix together the sour cream, lemon juice, minced scallions and the fresh dill. Set aside. Julienne the pepper and slice the cucumbers. I like to cut each cucumber slice in half, making half moons. Divide the greens between two plates and top with beets, peppers and cucumbers. Drizzle the dressing over the salad at the last minute and then serve.
