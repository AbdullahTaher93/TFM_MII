Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In medium bowl, whisk together flours, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, and salt. Set aside. In large bowl, whisk together pumpkin, milk, brown sugar, egg, and oil until smooth. Add dry ingredients to pumpkin mixture in 2 batches, stirring until just incorporated (a few lumps are fine). Stir in seeds. Lightly coat cups of nonstick 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray. Divide batter evenly among cups (each should be about 2/3 full). Bake until toothpick inserted in center of muffin comes out clean and tops are just turning golden brown, about 25 minutes. (If using silicone, reduce baking time slightly.) Let cool for 10 minutes before removing from tin.
