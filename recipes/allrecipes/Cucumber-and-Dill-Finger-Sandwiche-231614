Combine goat cheese, lemon juice and zest, olive oil, dill and grated garlic in a large bowl and fold together thoroughly with a rubber spatula. Spread the soft cheese mixture evenly on all eight pieces of bread. Lay a thin layer of sliced cucumbers on four of the slices. Sprinkle sliced shallot over the cucumber layers and top with the other piece of bread. Cut each sandwich into three rectangular little tea sandwiches and serve immediately. And you don't have to eat them with your pinkies raised up in the air. But you can. It's kinda fun.
