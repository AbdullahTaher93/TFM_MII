Place Persian cucumbers in a bowl; add salt and mix well. Let sit until cucumbers release their juices, about 10 minutes. Squeeze excess juice from cucumbers and drain. Whisk rice vinegar, white sugar, soy sauce, and sesame oil together in a bowl until sugar is dissolved; pour over cucumbers. Marinate for 30 minutes. Garnish with sesame seeds.
