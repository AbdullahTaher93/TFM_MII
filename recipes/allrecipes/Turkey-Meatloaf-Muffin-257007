Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin with cooking spray. Combine ground turkey, Cheddar cheese, onion, bread crumbs, milk, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix well with your hands. Drop scoops of the turkey mixture into the muffin tin using a large ice cream scoop. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 45 minutes.
