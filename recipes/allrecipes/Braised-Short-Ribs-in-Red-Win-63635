Pour the wine into a large saucepan, set over medium heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the volume by half then remove from heat. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in large, heavy, ovenproof pot over medium heat. Sprinkle ribs with salt and pepper. Working in batches, dredge ribs in flour and allspice mixture; add ribs to the pot and brown well, turning often, about 8 minutes per batch. Using tongs, transfer ribs to large bowl. Reserve remaining flour coating mixture. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons drippings from pot, add chopped vegetables and saute until vegetables begin to brown and become tender (about 10 minutes). Add garlic, thyme, rosemary, Savory Market flavors and white ground pepper. Stir 1 minute; mix in tomatoes and bay leaves. Return ribs and accumulated juices to pot, arranging ribs in single layer. Add broth, water and wine, bring to boil. Cover pot and transfer to oven. Bake until tender, stirring occasionally, about 2 and 1/2 hours, or until ribs are very tender. Season with salt and pepper. Every 30 minutes skim and discard fat from surface. Use reserve flour as necessary to thicken gravy.
