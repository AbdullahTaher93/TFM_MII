Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large saucepan over medium heat cover squash with water and cook until tender, about 10 minutes; drain and mash. To the squash add eggs, margarine, sugar, onion, salt and pepper. Mix well and transfer to a 2 quart casserole dish. Sprinkle bread crumbs on top. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes.
