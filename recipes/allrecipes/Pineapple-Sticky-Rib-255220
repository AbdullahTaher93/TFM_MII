Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange ribs in a single layer in a roasting pan. Stir pineapple, jam, soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl; pour over ribs. Bake in the preheated oven, basting every 15 minutes, until ribs are glazed and pull away easily from the bone, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
