In a large skillet, saute the onion, celery and parsley in butter until vegetables are tender. In a bowl, combine the egg substitute, milk, sage, thyme and salt. Add bread cubes and vegetable mixture; toss to combine. From the cut end of the ham, cut five parallel wedges, about 1-1/2-in. apart, 1/2-in. wide and 1-1/2-in. deep. Repeat in the opposite direction, making diamond shapes. Spoon stuffing into slits. Place ham on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Cover loosely with a foil tent. Bake at 325 degrees F for 2-1/4 hours. In a saucepan, combine the glaze ingredients. Cook and stir over medium heat until sugar is dissolved. Remove foil from ham; drizzle glaze over top. Bake 30-45 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 140 degrees F. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
