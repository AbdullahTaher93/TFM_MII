Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine the ham, pork, eggs, bread crumbs, evaporated milk, salt and ground black pepper. Mix all together well and form into a loaf. Place loaf into a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 90 minutes. While the loaf is baking, combine the brown sugar, mustard powder and vinegar. Mix well and pour over the loaf in the final 15 minutes of baking.
