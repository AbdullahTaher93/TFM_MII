In a saucepan, combine the milk, heavy cream, and sugar. With a small, sharp knife, carefully split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. With the knife tip, scrape the seeds from inside each half into the pan; add the pod halves, too. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Turn off the heat and whisk in the ricotta. Place a heatproof bowl inside a larger bowl filled with ice. Pour the hot mixture through a strainer into the bowl. Discard the vanilla bean halves. Drain the gelatin and slowly whisk it into the cooling mixture. Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature. Gently fold in the whipped cream. Lastly, fold in the minced Sweet Preserved Lemon Peel. In the bottoms of each of 8 chilled martini glasses, arrange 1/4 cup of mixed berries. Divide the panna cotta mixture evenly among the 8 glasses. Smooth the tops and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Over the surface of each serving, pour about 2 ounces of the Fresh Raspberry Puree, covering the panna cotta completely. Refrigerate until the panna cottas are completely set, at least 1 hour more. Serve chilled.
