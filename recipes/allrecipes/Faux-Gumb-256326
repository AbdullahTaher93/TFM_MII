Heat oil in a 4-quart Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and salt; cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high. Add sausage and cook, stirring, until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir chicken broth, split peas, and bay leaves into the Dutch oven; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until split peas are tender and beginning to collapse, 25 to 30 minutes. Stir in zucchini and simmer until tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Discard bay leaves before serving.
