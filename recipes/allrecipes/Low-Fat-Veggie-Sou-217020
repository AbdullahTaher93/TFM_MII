Spray a large soup pot with cooking spray, and place over medium heat. Cook the onions, green pepper, garlic, and celery until the onions are translucent, stirring often, about 5 minutes; mix in the Italian seasoning, chili powder, dried parsley, garlic powder, salt and black pepper. Stir in the carrots, potatoes, green beans, and corn, mixing the vegetables with the seasonings, and add chicken broth and water. Bring the soup to a boil, and add tomato puree and Parmesan cheese; return to a boil, lower heat to a simmer, and cook until the green peppers, onions, and celery are tender, about 15 more minutes.
