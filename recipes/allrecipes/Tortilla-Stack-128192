Coat a 1 1/2-quart (1.5-L) round casserole with nonstick spray. Spread 1/4 cup (50 mL) of salsa in the bottom of the casserole. Layer 2 tortillas on top of the salsa, overlapping them to cover the bottom. Spread with another 1/4 cup (50 mL) of salsa and sprinkle with: 1/2 cup (125 mL) of vegetables, 1/4 cup (50 mL) of beans, and 1/2 cup (125 mL) of cheese. Repeat the layers twice more. Cover the casserole with foil and bake at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) for 15 minutes. Uncover and bake until the cheese is bubbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes. Cut into wedges.
