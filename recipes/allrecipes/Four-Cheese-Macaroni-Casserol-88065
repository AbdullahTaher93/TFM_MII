Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil over high heat. Add macaroni, and cook until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, and pour hot pasta into a casserole dish. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, stir together tomatoes, italian seasoning, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Stir into the hot pasta 1 cup of Cheddar, 1 cup of mozzarella, and 1/2 cup of Parmesan. Continue to stir until the cheeses have melted. Then stir in tomato and herb mixture. Sprinkle 1/2 cup Cheddar, 1/2 cup mozzarella, 1/4 cup Parmesan, and 1/4 cup feta over the top of the casserole. Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 25 minutes.
