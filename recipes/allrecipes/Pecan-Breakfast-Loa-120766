Separate crescent dough into 16 triangles. Spread each with butter. Combine sugar, chopped pecans and cinnamon; sprinkle over triangles. Beginning at the wide end, roll up each triangle. In a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan, place rolls, point side down, widthwise in two layers. Bake at 375 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Top with pecan halves. In a saucepan, combine glaze ingredients; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Cool for 5 minutes. Drizzle over warm bread.
