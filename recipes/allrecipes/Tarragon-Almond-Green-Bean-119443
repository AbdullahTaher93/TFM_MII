Place beans in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil; cook, uncovered, for 8-10 minutes or until tender. Meanwhile, in a nonstick skillet, saute onions and garlic in oil until onions are tender. Add the vinegar, sugar, tarragon and salt. Bring to a boil; cook until liquid is reduced by half. Drain beans; add to onion mixture. Cook and stir until heated through. Sprinkle with almonds.
