Pour milk into medium bowl. Add pudding mix. Beat with wire whisk or electric mixer on lowest speed about 2 minutes. Set aside. Line inside rim of a 9 inch (23 cm) springform pan with lady fingers sugared side out. Line bottom of pan with one piece of cake, ensuring a snug fit. In a small bowl, combine jam with lemon juice. Spread jam mixture over surface of cake. Top with half of the pudding mixture. Sprinkle with half of raspberries, top with remaining pudding. Place remaining cake layer over top, pressing gently. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 3 hours. Remove plastic wrap. Remove sides of springform pan and place cake on serving platter. Spread whipped topping over the top of the cake and garnish with remaining raspberries and chocolate shavings. Dust lightly with sifted icing sugar if desired.
