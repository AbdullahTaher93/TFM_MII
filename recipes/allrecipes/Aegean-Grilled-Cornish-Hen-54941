In small bowl, combine Greek seasoning, lemon peel, 1/2 tsp. salt, and pepper. Rinse hens with cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Split each hen down the backbone. Loosen skin surrounding the breast and thigh section by slipping your hand between the meat and the skin. Rub one-quarter of herb mixture between the skin and meat of each hen, spreading evenly. Sprinkle hens with 1/4 tsp. salt. Wash hands. In small bowl, combine lemon juice, oil, and remaining 1/2 tsp. salt. Preheat grill. Place hens, skin-side down, on grill. Cover and grill 25 minutes. Turn hens; cover and grill 25 minutes, until juices run clear when thickest part of hen is pierced or temperature on instant-read thermometer reaches 180 degrees F. Drizzle with lemon-oil mixture. (Refrigerate leftovers.)
