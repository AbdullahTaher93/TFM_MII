Prepare brownies according to package directions for cake-like brownies; fold in vanilla chips. Spread half of the batter in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. In a small mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in egg, flour and orange extract. Carefully spread cream cheese mixture over batter. Drop remaining brownie batter by tablespoonfuls over cream cheese layer. cut through batter with a knife to swirl. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out almost clean. Cool on a wire rack. For frosting, in a microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter and chocolate. Cool slightly; stir in confectioners' sugar and enough milk to achieve spreading consistency. Frost brownies.
