Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Prepare a bread pan with cooking spray. Mix eggs and vinegar together in a bowl; add bananas, coconut oil, honey, and vanilla extract and stir until blended. Sift flour, cinnamon, baking powder, nutmeg and salt together in a large bowl; stir into banana mixture until well blended. Pour batter into prepared bread pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
