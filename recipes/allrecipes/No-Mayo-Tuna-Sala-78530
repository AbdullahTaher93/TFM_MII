Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water and cool under cold running water. Peel. Place the eggs and pickles into a food processor; pulse until roughly chopped. Transfer to a medium bowl and stir in tuna and celery. Season with salt and pepper, and stir in the pickle juice until thoroughly blended.
