Cut cauliflower into very finely chopped pieces similar to real couscous or rice. Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion has softened, about 2 minutes. Add cauliflower and cook on medium heat for about 40 minutes. Stir every 5 minutes until entire batch is golden and nutty. Mix kalamata olives, parsley, salt, and lemon zest into cauliflower.
