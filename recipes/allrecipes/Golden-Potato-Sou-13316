In a large stock pot add potatoes, celery, onion, chicken bouillon, water and parsley flakes. Season with salt and pepper and simmer until vegetables become tender. In a separate bowl mix flour and milk. Once it is well blended, add to soup mixture and cook until soup becomes thick. Stir in cheese, cooked ham or hamburger and simmer until cheese is melted.
