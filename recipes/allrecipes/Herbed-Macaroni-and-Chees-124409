Cook macaroni and drain well; place in a 1-1/2-qt. casserole and set aside. In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Stir in flour and seasonings; gradually add milk. Cook and stir until thickened. Remove pan from heat; add sour cream, 1/2 cup cheddar cheese and all the Havarti or Muenster. Stir until melted. Pour sauce over macaroni and mix well. Combine Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs and remaining cheddar cheese; sprinkle over casserole. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes.
