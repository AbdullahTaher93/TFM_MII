Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place a rack in a roasting pan. In a cup, combine the sage, salt, and pepper. Gently loosen the skin on the turkey breast, working your hand underneath it from the bottom of the breast. Rub some of the herb mixture under the turkey skin. Rub the remainder all over the turkey. Place the turkey breast on the rack in the roasting pan. In a cup, combine the orange juice and oil. Roast the turkey breast, basting with the juice mixture and the pan juices every 15 minutes, for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until a thermometer inserted in the thickest part (not touching the bone) registers 170 degrees F. Remove the turkey from the oven and place on a cutting board. Let stand for 15 minutes. Add 1 cup of the water to the roasting pan and stir to loosen browned bits from the pan. Strain the pan juices into a measuring cup. Let settle for 10 minutes, then skim off the fat that rises to the surface. Pour the pan juices and the broth into the roasting pan. Place on the stove top and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes. In a cup, combine the cornstarch with the remaining 2 tablespoons water. Add the mixture to the pan and bring to a boil, stirring constantly, until the sauce is thickened. Whisk in the butter until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and stir in the vinegar and orange peel. Pour into a gravy boat. Slice the turkey and serve with the gravy.
