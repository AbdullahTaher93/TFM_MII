Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Layer filo sheets on a baking sheet, brushing each filo sheet lightly with melted butter, or coating with butter-flavored cooking oil spray. Lay the salmon fillet down length of dough 1 inch from a long edge. Spread cream cheese evenly over the salmon, then spread pesto evenly over cheese. Fold the 1 inch of dough over salmon and trim excess dough at the narrow ends of the fish with scissors, moistening filo with butter so that it sticks to fish. Fold the other half of the filo over the salmon and trim ends again to fit fish. Turn the filo-wrapped fish over; brush with butter or coat with cooking oil spray. Slice the filo-wrapped fish into 6 equal pieces; leave in place on pan. Bake until filo is golden and fish is barely opaque in thickest part (cut to test), about 20 minutes. Transfer to a serving plate. Add salt and lemon to taste.
