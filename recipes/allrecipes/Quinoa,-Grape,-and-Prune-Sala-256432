Rinse quinoa in a fine mesh strainer; drain well. Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a medium saucepan; reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 12 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes, then fluff with a fork and let cool. Place in a large bowl with remaining salad ingredients. Whisk together all dressing ingredients and pour over salad; toss well to coat. Cover and chill for at least 1 hour.
