Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until well browned, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir the vegetables, picante sauce and soy sauce in the skillet. Cook until the vegetables are tender-crisp and the chicken is cooked through, stirring occasionally. Sprinkle with the peanuts.
