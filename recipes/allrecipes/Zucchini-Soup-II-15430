In a large pot over medium high heat, saute the sausage for about 8 minutes, or until browned. Drain excess fat. Add the celery and continue to cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the zucchini, onions, tomatoes, oregano, Italian-style seasoning, sugar, and the garlic powder. Reduce heat to medium low. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove cover and add the bell peppers. Continue to simmer for about 10 minutes. Serve and enjoy.
