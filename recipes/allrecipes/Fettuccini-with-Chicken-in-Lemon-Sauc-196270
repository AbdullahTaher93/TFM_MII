Season chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt and fresh ground pepper to taste. Set aside. Cook chicken. Heat about 2 cups water in a medium size frying pan and bring to a simmer. Carefully add seasoned chicken. Cover, reduce heat and simmer until cooked through, about 12 minutes. Turn chicken breasts over after about 6 minutes of cooking. Remove chicken when cooked and set on cutting board. Set aside until cool enough to handle. Cut breasts into 1/2 inch strips. Cook fettuccine following package directions. Drain well. Prepare sauce. Melt butter in a medium size sauce pan. Stir in flour and cook 40-50 seconds. Remove from heat. Slowly add 1 cup of the LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk. Stir using a wire whisk to prevent lumps. Add remaining milk and return to heat. Simmer until sauce begins to thicken. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt, fresh ground black pepper to taste, lemon juice and lemon zest. Stir well. Toss pasta, chicken, sauce, parmesan, capers and 1 tablespoon of the chives together in large serving bowl. Sprinkle remaining chives on top of pasta just before serving.
