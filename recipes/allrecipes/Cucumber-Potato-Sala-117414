Place potatoes in a large kettle; cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes or until tender. Drain and cool. Cut potatoes into small cubes. In a large serving bowl, combine the potatoes, celery, onions, dill and salt. In a small bowl, whisk mayonnaise and salad dressing until blended. Pour over potato mixture and stir gently to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours before serving.
