Season chicken with salt and black pepper. Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add chicken and kimchi; cook and stir until chicken is browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Pour in water; bring to a boil. Remove from heat and add curry sauce mix, stirring until it is completely dissolved. Return to heat and simmer until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.
