Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft but not browned, about 5 minutes. Crumble in the saffron; add the fennel seeds and the red pepper flakes. Cook for 1 minute. Add the Classico sauce, seafood stock and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Bring to a boil; reduce the heat to low and simmer until the onion is tender, about 20 minutes. Place the fish in a bowl and sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and the rosemary, thyme, and marjoram. Add the shrimp and the remaining tablespoon oil. Toss gently to coat. Place the fish and shrimp into the tomato base mixture. Cook over medium-low heat until the shrimp is opaque throughout and the fish begins to flake apart, about 5 minutes.
