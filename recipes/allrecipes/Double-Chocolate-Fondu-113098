Put the milk and semisweet chocolates and the heavy cream in a medium bowl set over a pot of simmering water. Stir the mixture until it's melted and smooth. Pour the chocolate fondue into a microwavable bowl (for easy reheating) and serve. Place the marshmallows in another bowl, for dipping into the fondue.
