In a shallow dish or bowl, combine 4 tablespoons flour, paprika, 1 teaspoon salt and pepper. Coat chicken breasts with the flour mixture. In a large skillet, brown the coated chicken in 1/4 cup of butter or margarine. Add the water, cover and let simmer covered for 25 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). When chicken breasts are done simmering, remove from the skillet and place in a 9x13 inch baking dish; save drippings. Combine remaining 2 tablespoons flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and half-and-half. Mix together and stir mixture into reserved drippings in skillet. Bring to a simmer, stirring, and cook until thick and bubbly. Add mushrooms and lemon juice and stir together. Pour sauce over chicken and bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 30 minutes Sprinkle with cheese and bake 3-5 minutes more until cheese melts.
