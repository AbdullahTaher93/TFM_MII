Combine olive oil, thyme, and black pepper in a large bowl. Cut the potatoes into half-inch wedges and toss them in the oil mixture. Coat a baking pan with nonstick spray and place the potatoes in it in a single layer. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, at 475 degrees F, turning them once, until they're light brown.
