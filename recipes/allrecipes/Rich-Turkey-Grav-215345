In a skillet over medium heat, whisk the flour with turkey drippings until smooth, then reduce heat to low and cook, stirring frequently, until dark brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in the water and bouillon cubes, and simmer until the cubes have dissolved and the gravy is thickened and smooth, about 10 minutes.
