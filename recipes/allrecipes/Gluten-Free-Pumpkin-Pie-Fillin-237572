Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Blend pumpkin puree, coconut milk, and banana together in a large bowl. Mix sugar, xanthan gum, cinnamon, salt, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves together in a small bowl; add to pumpkin mixture and blend. Pour the pumpkin mixture into a casserole dish. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 45 minutes more.
