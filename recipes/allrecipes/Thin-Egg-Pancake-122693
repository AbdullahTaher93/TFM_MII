In a bowl, beat eggs until foamy. Add milk. Stir in flour and sugar just until blended. Add butter, salt and pepper. Pour 1/4 cup of batter into a hot greased 8-in. skillet. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side or until lightly browned. Remove and keep warm. Repeat; stack pancakes with waxed paper or paper towel in between.
