Whisk together the chile bean sauce, rice wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, ginger root, green onion, and sugar. Place chicken strips in a large bowl and pour sauce over; refrigerate and allow to marinate for 30 to 40 minutes. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large wok to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Remove the chicken strips from the marinade and sprinkle with the flour. Deep fry chicken strips until crispy and no longer pink in the center, about 8 minutes. Drain cooked chicken on paper towels; serve hot.
