Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until onion is tender but not brown. Cool. Combine cooled onion, parsley, pimento, mayonnaise, eggs, 1 cup cracker meal, Cajun seasoning, Dijon mustard, and lemon zest and mix well. Very gently, fold in the crab meat. Take care to avoid over mixing. Cover and refrigerate for at least two hours. This will help hold the mixture together. Place 2 cups cracker meal into a shallow dish. Using an ice cream scoop, portion out the crab mixture and firmly shape into cakes 2/3 inch thick. One at time, place cakes into cracker meal and coat evenly. Place 1/4 cup of canola oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. When oil is hot, add the cakes one at a time. Do not crowd. Turn after 4 to 5 minutes. Cakes should be golden brown on both sides.
