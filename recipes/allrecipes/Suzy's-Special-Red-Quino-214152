Place the water, butter, five-spice powder, ginger, black pepper, and beef bouillon cube into a saucepan over medium heat, and bring to a boil. Stir the mixture to dissolve the bouillon cube, then add the quinoa. Reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook until all the water is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
