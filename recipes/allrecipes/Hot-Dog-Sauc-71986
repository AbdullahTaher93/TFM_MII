Brown beef and onion in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drain fat; cool mixture slightly. Place in food processor; pulse until mixture is finely crumbled, about 5 or 6 pulses. Return meat to skillet; stir in garlic. Cook for 3 minutes. Pour the ketchup and barbeque sauce into the skillet. Stir in the chili powder, mustard, pepper, salt, cumin, Worcestershire sauce, red pepper flakes, and water. Cook, uncovered, until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Season sauce with additional salt, if necessary.
