In a 4- to 5-quart pan, combine broth and 2 1/2 cups water over high heat. Bring to a boil then add penne. Boil, stirring often, until liquid is absorbed and pasta is tender, 13 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, combine oil and onion in a 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Stir often until onion is browned and softened, about 7 minutes. Cut eggplant into 1/2-inch-thick slices, then cut slices in half crosswise. Add eggplant and garlic to onion along with remaining 1/2 cup water. Cover frying pan and simmer until eggplant begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Uncover pan and stir often until eggplant is well browned, 3 to 5 minutes more. When penne is done, stir in eggplant mixture and basil; mix well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon pasta and eggplant into a serving dish or individual bowls and offer feta cheese to add to taste.
