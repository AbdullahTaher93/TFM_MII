In a small bowl, mix together basil, thyme, salt, and white pepper. Mix in 5 teaspoons olive oil to make a spreadable paste. Spread paste on cut side of each tomato half. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in small skillet over medium-low heat. Place tomatoes herb-side down in skillet, and cover. Simmer for 5 minutes; tomatoes should be hot but not stewed. Serve immediately.
