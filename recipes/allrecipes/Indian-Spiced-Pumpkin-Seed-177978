Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Place pumpkin seeds in a colander and rinse well; discard any pumpkin bits or strings. Slide seeds onto paper towels and pat dry. Spread in a single layer in a large rimmed baking sheet and let air dry for about 10 minutes. Combine salt, cardamom, cumin, curry powder, cinnamon, and sugar in a small bowl. Drizzle seeds with oil then with spices, mixing with fingers to coat evenly. Bake seeds, stirring occasionally, until toasted and crisp, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool slightly and serve. Or cool completely and store airtight up to 3 days.
