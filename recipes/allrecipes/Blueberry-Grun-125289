In a skillet, combine blueberries, sugar, and water; bring to a boil. Simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. In a bowl, combine the next six ingredients; stir in milk just until moistened (dough will be stiff). Drop by tablespoonfuls over blueberries. Cover and cook 10-15 minutes or until dumplings are puffed and test done. Serve warm with cream if desired.
