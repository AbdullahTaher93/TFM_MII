Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease bottom only of 13x9 inch pan with shortening. Prepare brownie mix according to the package instructions. Spread in pan. Bake for 28 to 30 minutes, or until toothpick inserted comes out almost clean. Remove pan from oven. Immediately sprinkle marshmallows evenly over warm brownies. Return to oven and bake an additional 1 to 2 minutes, or until marshmallows just begin to puff. Remove from oven and cool while making topping. In 3-quart saucepan, mix brown sugar and corn syrup. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until mixture boils. Remove from heat. Stir in peanut butter until well blended. Stir in cereal, peanuts and candy corn until coated. Immediately spoon warm topping over marshmallow layer, spreading to cover. Cool completely, for about 11/4 hours.
