In a medium bowl, combine all ingredients except bread and cream cheese; mix well. Cover; chill at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours before assembling sandwiches. Cut crusts from bread forming 4-inch squares; reserve crusts for another use. Spread cream cheese over bread. Spread olive mixture over 6 slices bread; close sandwiches with remaining bread, pressing lightly. Cut diagonally in half or lengthwise into rectangles.
