In a small bowl, combine the first five ingredients; rub over roast. Place roast fat side up in a Dutch oven. Combine sauerkraut and sugar if desired. Spoon sauerkraut and sausage over and around roast. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 2-1/4 to 2-3/4 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let stand for 15 minutes before slicing.
