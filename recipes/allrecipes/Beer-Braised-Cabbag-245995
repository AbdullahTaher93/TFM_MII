Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in beer, mustard, and thyme. Lower heat and simmer until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Add cabbage and vinegar. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until cabbage is wilted and tender, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
