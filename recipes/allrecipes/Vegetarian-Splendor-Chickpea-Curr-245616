Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add cumin seeds and cloves; saute until cumin seeds swell, about 30 seconds. Discard cloves. Add onion to the pot and saute until lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Combine tomato paste, curry powder, flour, turmeric, garlic powder, ginger, basil, allspice, and salt together in a bowl. Stir in 1 cup warm water. Pour tomato mixture over onion in the pot; stir until combined and thick. Stir in additional water until curry reaches a saucy consistency. Stir in garbanzo beans and bell pepper. Reduce heat and simmer curry, 5 minutes. Add green beans and peas; season with rice wine vinegar, salt, and black pepper. Simmer curry, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Add additional water if curry appears too thick.
