Heat the vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the onions, and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the lamb, salt, pepper, and turmeric; cook and stir until the lamb is no longer pink on the outside, about 3 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, water, and garlic. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the lamb is tender, about 25 minutes. Once the lamb is tender, stir in the asparagus, and continue cooking until the asparagus is tender, about 3 minutes.
