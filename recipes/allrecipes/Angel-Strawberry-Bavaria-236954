Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare, bake and cool cake as directed on package. Cut cake into 1-inch cubes. Drain thawed strawberries, reserving juice. Combine gelatin and boiling water in small bowl. Stir until gelatin is dissolved. Add enough water to strawberry juice to measure 1 cup; stir into gelatin. Refrigerate until gelatin is slightly thickened. Beat gelatin until foamy. Fold together 1 container whipped topping, gelatin and strawberries. Alternate layers of cake cubes and strawberry mixture into 10-inch tube pan. Press lightly. Cover and refrigerate 4 hours. Unmold cake onto serving plate. Frost sides and top of cake with remaining whipped topping. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Garnish with fresh strawberries and mint leaves.
