In a large saucepan, combine the potatoes, water, carrots, onion, salt and pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 25 minutes or until tender. Add the remaining ingredients. Cover and simmer 30 minutes longer or until heated through, stirring occasionally. Discard bay leaves before serving.
