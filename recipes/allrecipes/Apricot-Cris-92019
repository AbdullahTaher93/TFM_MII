Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly coat a 7- by 11-inch baking dish with oil or cooking oil spray. In a medium-size bowl, stir together apricots, jam, lemon juice, vanilla, nutmeg, and brandy, if using. Pour into prepared baking dish. In another medium-size bowl combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Make a well in the center and add the beaten egg. Stir together ingredients with a fork. Mixture will be crumbly. Sprinkle over top of fruit. Pour melted butter over. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until fruit is bubbling and topping is lightly browned. Cool slightly before serving.
