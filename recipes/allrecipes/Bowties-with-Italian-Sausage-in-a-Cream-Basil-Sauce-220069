Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta for 8-10 minutes, or until al dente, drain and rinse with cold water. Set aside. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add decased sausage to skillet and crumble with a wooden spoon as it cooks. Add red pepper flakes and continue sauteing until sausage is no longer pink. Add onion and garlic to skillet and continue until onion softens. Stir in tomatoes and salt, (if using fresh tomatoes saute them for 3 minutes until softened) then add light cream and parmesan cheese; simmer gently until mixture thickens (about 5 minutes). Stir in the cooked pasta and basil and heat through, about 3 minutes.
