Preheat the broiler. Peel the membrane from the underside of the ribs and place them, skinned side up, on 2 rimmed baking sheets. Broil the ribs 6 inches from the heat, turning once, until browned on both sides, 8 to 10 minutes per sheet. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl, mix the lemon zest with 2 tablespoons of the parsley and the chives, tarragon and thyme. Brush the ribs with some of the Ham Hock Stock over the ribs and sprinkle with half of the herb mixture. Season the ribs with salt and pepper and bake for about 1 hour, without turning, until very tender; baste the ribs with the stock and sprinkle with the herb mixture several times while baking. Transfer the ribs to a cutting board and cut into individual ribs. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the oil with the vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Add the cabbage, apples and the remaining 2 tablespoons of chopped parsley and toss to coat. Serve with the ribs.
