Heat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat four 10-ounce (300 mL) custard cups with nonstick spray. Combine shrimp, bread crumbs, corn, egg substitute, onion, red peppers, snipped dill, and hot-pepper sauce. Spoon into cups. Set cups in a baking pan filled with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of boiling water. Bake until timbales are set, about 15 minutes. Run a knife around inside edges of cups to unmold. Top each with a tomato slice and dill sprigs.
