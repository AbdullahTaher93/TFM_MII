Mix potatoes, flour, cereal, eggs, egg yolks, and salt together in a bowl using your hands until the mixture comes together into a workable dough. Roll dough into 4- to 5-inch long logs with the diameter of a quarter. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add the dough logs, and cook until the dumplings float, about 15 minutes.
