Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, Sriracha hot sauce, cumin, garlic powder, steak seasoning, and coriander together in a bowl. Place cauliflower on the prepared baking sheet and brush olive oil mixture (or use your hands) over the entire cauliflower. Roast in the preheated oven until cauliflower is lightly browned and dry, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool cauliflower for 5 to 10 minutes. Cut cauliflower into wedges and sprinkle Parmesan cheese over each.
