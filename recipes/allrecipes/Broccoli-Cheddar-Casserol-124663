In a skillet over medium heat, saute broccoli and onion in butter until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes; set aside. In a bowl, beat eggs. Add cream and 1-3/4 cups of cheese; mix well. Stir in the broccoli mixture, salt and pepper. Pour into a greased 3-qt. baking dish; set in a large pan filled with 1 in. of hot water. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
