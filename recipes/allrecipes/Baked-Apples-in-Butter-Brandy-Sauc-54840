Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place apples in a shallow baking dish. Mix together the brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, allspice and nutmeg; pack the mixture into the cores of the apples and pile the remaining on the tops. The tops of the apples should be covered. Place 1 tablespoon of butter on top of each apple. Pour the brandy into the dish, drizzling over the apples. Cover the dish with aluminum foil. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until apples can be sliced with a spoon. Serve in a bowl with some ice cream, and spoon sauce over. The sauce will be slightly runny.
