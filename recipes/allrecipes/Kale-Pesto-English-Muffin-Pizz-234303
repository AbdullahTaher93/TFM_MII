Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook kale and garlic in the boiling water until kale is softened, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse kale and garlic under cold water, reserving the boiling water. Blend kale, garlic, Parmesan cheese, and about 1 tablespoon of the boiling water in a blender until smooth; add more water as needed to thin the pesto. Spoon about 1 tablespoon pesto onto each English muffin half; sprinkle with chicken and top with mozzarella cheese. Arrange pizzas on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until mozzarella cheese is melted and lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
