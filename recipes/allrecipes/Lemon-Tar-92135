To make pastry, in a food processor or bowl mix flour, granulated sugar, and grated lemon peel. Add butter; whirl or rub with your fingers until fine crumbs form. Add egg; whirl or stir with a fork until dough holds together. Pat into a smooth ball. Press pastry evenly over the bottom and sides of a 10 1/2- to 11-inch tart pan with removable rim. Bake in 325 degrees F oven until pale gold, about 25 minutes. To make filling, in a small bowl, beat eggs with a mixer at high speed until foamy. Gradually add granulated sugar, beating until mixture is thick and lighter in color. Add the lemon juice, baking powder, lemon peel, and flour; beat until smooth. Pour mixture into baked crust. Bake in a 325 degrees F oven until filling no longer jiggles when gently shaken, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool on a rack. If making ahead, cover when cool and keep refrigerated up to 1 day. Remove pan rim and lightly sift powdered sugar onto tart. Place lemon slices on top of the tart along the edge of the crust. Cut tart into wedges; wipe knife blade clean after each cut.
