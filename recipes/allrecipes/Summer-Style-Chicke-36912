Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. Arrange chicken in the prepared baking dish, and top with the stewed tomatoes. Arrange squash and zucchini slices around the chicken. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
