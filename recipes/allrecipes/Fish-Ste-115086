For the Fish Stock: Put all ingredients in a 6- to 8-quart pot. Cover with 2 3/4 quarts cold water. Bring to boil over medium heat; simmer slowly for about 1 hour, periodically skimming away scum that rises to surface. Strain stock through double thickness of cheesecloth, pressing out as much liquid as possible with back of a spoon. Reserve 4 1/2 cups for this recipe, reserve the remainder for future use. (Stock can be cooled and refrigerated up to three days or frozen up to three months.) For the Fish Stew Base: Heat oil in a large soup kettle. Add onions, celery, carrot, and garlic; cook over medium heat until softened, about 10 minutes. Add wine; simmer until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Add remaining ingredients and bring to boil; simmer until thickened to a tomato sauce consistency, 15 to 20 minutes. Adjust seasonings. (Base can be cooled and refrigerated up to three days or frozen up to three months.) For the Stew: Mix base and fish stock; bring to boil. Reduce heat to simmer and adjust seasonings with salt, pepper, and cayenne to taste. Add firmer fish pieces; simmer for 2 minutes. Add smaller, more delicate fish; simmer, stirring gently to ensure even cooking, until fish is almost cooked through, about 3 minutes longer. Remove kettle from heat; cover and let stand until fish is just cooked, about 5 minutes. Put soup in a tureen or ladle into individual soup plates. Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately.
