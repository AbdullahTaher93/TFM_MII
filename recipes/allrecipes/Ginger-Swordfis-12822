In a large saucepan combine teriyaki sauce, sherry, garlic, ginger, and sesame oil. Bring to a boil. Set the marinade aside to cool for 10 minutes. Place fish in a shallow baking dish. Pour 1/2 of the marinade over the fish. Flip the fish over and pour the remaining marinade on the fish. Coat entire fish with marinade. Refrigerate the fish for 1 1/2 hours, turning the fish over often. Grill the fish over medium-high heat for 4 minutes. Flip the fish over and grill it another 4 minutes. Fish should flake easily with a fork when done. Serve hot!
