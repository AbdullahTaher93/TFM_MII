Heat 3 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms, onion, and celery until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle flour over mushroom mixture and stir to coat. Mix milk, cream cheese, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and nutmeg into mushroom mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until cream cheese is melted and sauce is warmed, 5 to 10 minutes. Add turkey and peas to sauce. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and mix noodles into turkey mixture; pour into the prepared baking dish. Combine Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, and 3 tablespoons melted butter together in a bowl until crumbly; sprinkle over noodle mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until top is browned and sauce is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
