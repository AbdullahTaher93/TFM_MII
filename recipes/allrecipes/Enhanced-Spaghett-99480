Pour the water into a large pot. Season with paprika, garlic powder, beef bouillon and salt. Bring to a rolling boil. Add spaghetti, stir and boil for 4 minutes. Turn off the heat, cover and let stand for 4 more minutes. Drain and, if you wish, rise but don't overdo it. Serve with your favorite sauce.
