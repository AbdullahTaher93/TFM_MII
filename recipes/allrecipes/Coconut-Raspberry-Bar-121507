Press three-fourths of the dough into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Spread with preserves. Sprinkle with chips and remaining coconut. Crumble remaining dough over the top; press lightly. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. Cut into squares.
