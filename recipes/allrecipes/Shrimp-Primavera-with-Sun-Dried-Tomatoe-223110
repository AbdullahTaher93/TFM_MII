Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain. Meanwhile, dissolve chicken bouillon in 2 cups boiling water in a large bowl. Add sun-dried tomatoes and soak for 5 minutes. Remove tomatoes and chop coarsely, reserving liquid. Melt butter in olive oil over medium heat; add garlic and cook and stir until it begins to brown. Stir in sun-dried tomatoes, reserved soaking liquid, stewed tomatoes, artichokes, salt, oregano, basil, hot pepper sauce, and black pepper; bring to a boil. Add shrimp; cook and stir until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 5 minutes. Serve shrimp and tomato sauce over angel hair pasta. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
