Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir minced garlic until lightly browned. Add shrimp; season with garlic salt and garlic powder. Pour lemon juice over shrimp. Continue to cook and stir until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, 5 to 10 minutes.
