In a large heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and water. Cook over medium heat, without stirring, until a candy thermometer reads 250 degrees F (hard-ball stage). Remove from the heat; stir in marshmallow cream, vanilla and pecans. Continue stirring until candy cools and begins to hold its shape when dropped from a spoon. Quickly drop by heaping teaspoonfuls onto waxed paper-lined baking sheet. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.
