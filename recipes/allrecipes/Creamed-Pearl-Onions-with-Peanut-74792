Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a saucepan over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter, and stir in the flour, salt, paprika, and pepper until smooth. Gradually blend the milk into the saucepan until thickened. Place the onions and nuts in a medium casserole dish. Pour the sauce over the onions and nuts, and toss to coat. In a separate saucepan, melt the remaining butter, and toss with the bread crumbs to coat. Sprinkle over the casserole. Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly and lightly browned.
