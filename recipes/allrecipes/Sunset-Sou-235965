Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place butternut squash, carrots, sweet potatoes, apple, and onion on a baking sheet. Drizzle olive oil over vegetable mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and soft, about 45 minutes. Blend vegetable mixture in a blender or food processor until smooth; transfer to a large saucepan. Pour vegetable broth into pureed vegetables and season with coriander, turmeric, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Cook soup over low heat until heated through, 10 to 15 minutes.
