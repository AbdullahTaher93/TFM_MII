Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin pan. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. In a large bowl, stir together the buttermilk, oil, brown sugar, and egg. Stir in the flour mixture until just combined. Do not overmix. Stir in the apples and raisins (if using). Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups, filling them about two-thirds full. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Cool on a rack for 5 minutes. Remove to the rack to cool completely.
