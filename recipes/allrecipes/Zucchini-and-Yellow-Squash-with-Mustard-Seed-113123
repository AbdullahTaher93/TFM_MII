In a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil. Add the mustard seeds and cook over medium-high heat until they begin to pop. After half a minute, add the onion and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the zucchini, squash, cumin, turmeric, cayenne and salt and cook until softened, about 8 minutes. Garnish with the cilantro.
