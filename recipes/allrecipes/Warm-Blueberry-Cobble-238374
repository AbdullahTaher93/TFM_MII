Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place blueberries in a 6x10-inch baking dish. Sprinkle lemon juice over blueberries. Whisk flour, sugar, and egg together in a bowl until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; spread over blueberries. Drizzle butter over flour mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until cobbler is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
