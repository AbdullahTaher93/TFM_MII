Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add filets to pan, skin side down and cook for about 2 minutes, or until bottom half of filets turns opaque. Turn and cook for 2 to 3 minutes longer, or until opaque all the way through. Remove from pan and place on serving plate, sesame crust side up.
