Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet or line it with parchment paper. Combine cream and poppy seeds in a small saucepan. Heat mixture over medium heat until mixture is hot; do not boil. Remove from heat and allow to cool. In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking soda and cinnamon. Stir in butter, lemon juice and syrup. Mix well and add cooled poppy seed mixture. Drop by small spoonfuls onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
