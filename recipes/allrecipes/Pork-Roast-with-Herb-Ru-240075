Whisk salt, garlic powder, celery salt, ginger, mustard, black pepper, basil, oregano, and thyme together in a small bowl. Cut 1/4-inch deep slits in the fat-side of the roast about 1 1/2-inches apart. Rub spice mixture all over prepared roast to cover completely. Place roast in a slow cooker, pour wine over the top and drizzle with honey. Cook on High until tender, 3 to 4 hours.
