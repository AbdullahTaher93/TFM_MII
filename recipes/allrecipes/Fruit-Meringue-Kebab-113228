Preheat the broiler and position a rack in the lower third of the oven. In a large stainless steel bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer, beat the egg whites at medium speed until soft peaks form. Beat in the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time and beating thoroughly between additions. Increase the speed to high and beat the whites until they are glossy and hold firm peaks, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Arrange the apple halves on a sturdy baking sheet, cut sides down. Slide 2 of the strawberries and 2 pieces of the pineapple, mango and banana onto each of 4 wooden skewers. Using a butter knife or a small offset spatula, spread the meringue evenly over the fruit in a thick layer. Stick the skewers into the apple halves to keep the kebabs upright; don't let the kebabs touch each other. Broil the kebabs for about 30 seconds, turning the pan as necessary, until the meringue is golden and caramelized in spots. Alternatively, brown the meringue with a small blowtorch. Serve the fruit kebabs right away.
