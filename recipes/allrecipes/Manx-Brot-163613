Bring the water to a boil in a large pot. Add the beef shank, barley, carrot, turnip, leek and celery. Season with thyme, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then simmer gently over medium heat for 2 hours. Remove the shank from the pot and cut the meat into small pieces. Return the meat to the pot, and discard the bone. Return to a boil and then stir in the parsley. Serve very hot.
