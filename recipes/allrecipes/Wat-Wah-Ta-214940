Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the green onions, garlic, and garlic scape; cook and stir until the vegetables have softened, about 30 seconds. Stir in the toru, black beans, mushroom oyster sauce, and half of the water. Cover, and bring to a boil. Cook 3 minutes. Stir in the remaining water, rice vinegar, tamari sauce, and ginger. Add the mushrooms (the mushrooms will reconstitute in the sauce while cooking) and top with spinach. Recover, and turn the heat to low. Simmer until the spinach has wilted and the mushrooms are tender, about 10 minutes.
