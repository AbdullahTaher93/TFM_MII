Stir sweet potatoes, coconut milk, onion, basil, chili powder, and cumin together in a slow cooker. Cook on High for 6 hours (or on Low for 8 hours). Pour soup into a blender no more than half-full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth.
