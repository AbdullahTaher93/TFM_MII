Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Make pie crust as directed on box for One-Crust Baked Shell using 9-inch glass pie pan; do not prick crust. Bake 9 to 11 minutes or until light golden brown. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Meanwhile, in medium bowl, mix pie filling, cranberries and cinnamon. In small bowl, mix flour and brown sugar. With pastry blender or fork, cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Spoon pie filling mixture into warm baked shell. Sprinkle crumb mixture evenly over filling. Bake 35 to 45 minutes or until topping is golden brown and filling bubbles. After 5 to 10 minutes of baking, cover crust edge with strips of foil to prevent excessive browning. Cool at least 30 minutes before serving.
