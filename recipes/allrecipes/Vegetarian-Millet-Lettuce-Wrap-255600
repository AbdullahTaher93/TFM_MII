Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; add millet and cook until toasted and fragrant, 4 to 5 minutes. Add water, cover, and simmer until most of the water is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Stir onion, lime juice, garlic, cilantro, and salt into millet; cook and stir until heated through and liquid is completely absorbed, about 5 minutes more. Cool millet mixture for 3 minutes. Divide chopped carrot among butter lettuce leaves. Spoon millet mixture over carrots.
