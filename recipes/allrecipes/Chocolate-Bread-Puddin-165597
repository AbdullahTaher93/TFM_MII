Place bread in a greased 13x9-inch baking pan; sprinkle with chocolate chips. Set aside. In a large bowl, combine soymilk, eggs, sugar, cocoa and vanilla. Whisk until well combined. Pour mixture over bread. Let stand 30 minutes or until bread has soaked up most of the liquid; stirring occasionally. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F oven 50-60 minutes or until set and knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
