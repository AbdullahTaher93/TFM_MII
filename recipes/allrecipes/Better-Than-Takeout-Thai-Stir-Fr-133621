Bring the chicken broth to a boil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, onion, and broccoli; cover, and steam until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in tamari, peanut butter, and pepper flakes until smooth. Add the coleslaw mix, bean sprouts, and chicken; cook until heated through. Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds to garnish.
