Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir in ravioli and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until ravioli float to the top and filling is hot, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain. Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add crabmeat and thyme; cook and stir until thyme is fragrant, about 2 minutes. Pour in cream. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring, until cream begins to steam, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat and add Parmesan cheese; stir until melted, about 2 minutes. Ladle cream sauce into the bottom of a serving dish; top with ravioli.
