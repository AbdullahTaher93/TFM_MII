In a medium saucepan, bring broth to a boil. Add orzo. Lower heat and simmer until tender, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together egg and lemon juice. Remove pot from heat and, using a strainer, measure out 1/2 cup hot broth. Pour broth slowly into the egg-lemon mixture, whisking to keep eggs from scrambling. Pour egg mixture back into soup pot, whisking constantly. Add spinach and return to burner over very low heat, stirring until spinach wilts, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
