Combine tahini, lemon juice, chipotle sauce, garlic, cumin, turmeric, lemon zest, pepper, and salt in a blender; blend until thoroughly combined. Pour half of the garbanzo beans and half of the olive oil into the blender; blend, adding some of the reserved garbanzo bean liquid, until mixture is the consistency of pudding. Add remaining garbanzo beans and olive oil; blend, adding more of the liquid, until mixture is the consistency of a very thick paste. Continue blending until smooth, about 3 minutes.
