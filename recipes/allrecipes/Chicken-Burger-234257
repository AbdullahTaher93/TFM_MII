Process bread in a food processor until you have fine bread crumbs. Stir bread crumbs, oats, salt, mustard, celery seed, and cumin together in a bowl. Mix chicken, onion, and egg together in a separate bowl; add bread crumb mixture to chicken mixture and mix. Divide and shape mixture into 7 patties. Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in hot oil until browned each side and no longer pink the center, about 5 minutes per side.
