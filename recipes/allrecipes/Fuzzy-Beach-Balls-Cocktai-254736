Place cantaloupe balls in a small bowl. Pour in enough grain alcohol to cover them halfway. Let infuse, turning occasionally, 4 hours to overnight. Fill a cocktail shaker with ice. Add pineapple juice, orange juice, raspberry vodka, and coconut rum. Cover and shake until outside of the shaker is frosted. Strain into a glass. Add spiked cantaloupe balls and grenadine syrup.
