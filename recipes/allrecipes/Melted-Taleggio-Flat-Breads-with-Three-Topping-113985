Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly brush the flat breads on both sides with olive oil. Toast them directly on the oven rack for 6 minutes, or until golden. Brush the jalapenos lightly with olive oil. Roast them over a gas flame or under the broiler until softened and blackened in spots, about 4 minutes. Transfer the jalapenos to a bowl, cover with plastic and let cool. Peel, seed and cut the jalapenos into thin strips. Spread the Taleggio on the breads, leaving a 1-inch border all around. Top 4 of the breads with the jalapeno strips, 4 with the artichoke hearts and 4 with a mix of the olives and almonds. Just before serving, bake the flat breads directly on the oven racks for 5 minutes, or until crisp on the bottom and the cheese is melted. Cut into wedges and serve.
