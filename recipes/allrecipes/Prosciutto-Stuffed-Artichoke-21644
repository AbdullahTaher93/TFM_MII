Remove any discolored leaves and the small leaves at base of each artichoke; trim stem even with base of artichoke. Cutting straight across, slice 1 inch off top; discard top. Snip off points of remaining leaves with scissors. Rinse artichokes under cold water. Mix 1 quart water and the lemon juice; invert artichokes in mixture to prevent discoloration. Mix prosciutto, bread crumbs, onion, garlic, parsley and pepper. Spread artichoke leaves open; dig out the fuzzy purple choke of each artichoke with the point of a knife or a pointed spoon. Discard choke. Spoon prosciutto mixture into center of each artichoke. Place artichokes upright in 4-quart Dutch oven. Pour wine over artichokes; drizzle with oil. Heat to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer about 1 hour or until bottoms of artichokes are tender when pierced with a knife. Spoon liquid over each artichoke before serving.
