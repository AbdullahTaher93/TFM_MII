In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the chili powder, and the salt. Add the beef, seal the bag, and toss to coat well. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook, stirring occasionally, for 7 minutes, or until browned. Add the onions, garlic, and oregano. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes. Add the broth, tomatoes, sugar, red-pepper flakes, and the remaining 2 1/2 teaspoons chili powder. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 2 hours, or until the beef is almost tender, stirring occasionally. Add the potatoes and carrots. Cook, covered, for 30 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.
