Cook pasta in boiling water according to package directions; drain. Return to pan; keep warm. Meanwhile, in a medium skillet cook the nuts in butter and olive oil until toasted and butter begins to brown, stirring frequently. Add nut mixture to pasta; add Gorgonzola or blue cheese, Parmesan cheese, and snipped basil. Toss gently to coat. Transfer to a serving platter. If desired, garnish with fresh basil.
