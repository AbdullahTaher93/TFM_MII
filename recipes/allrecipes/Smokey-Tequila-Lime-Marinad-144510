Place the garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and cayenne pepper into a mixing bowl. Whisk in the liquid smoke, lime juice, tequila, vegetable oil, and cilantro until evenly blended. To use the marinade, pour into a resealable plastic bag, and add 1 1/2 to 2 pounds of meat. Squeeze out the excess air, seal, and marinate in the refrigerator 4 to 6 hours before cooking as desired. Grilling over charcoal is best, but a gas grill will do fine as well.
