Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute the white parts of the green onions with the jalapenos for 5 minutes; do not brown. Stir in the sherry, rice, salt and pepper. Pour in the broth and water; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Fluff with a fork and stir in cilantro, parsley and tops of green onions. Transfer to a warm serving dish and serve immediately.
