Mix ground beef, onion, green pepper, egg, ketchup, and sea salt together in a bowl; mix in the white bread pieces until evenly distributed. Form the mixture into 4 patties. Spray a large skillet with olive oil cooking spray and set over medium heat. Cook the burgers until well-browned on the bottoms, about 10 minutes; flip the burgers and cook until the meat is no longer pink and the juices run clear, 8 to 10 more minutes.
