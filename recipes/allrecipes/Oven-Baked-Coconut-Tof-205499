Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread coconut on a plate. Set aside. Whisk together soy sauce, mirin, maple syrup, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes in a bowl. Dip the tofu in the soy sauce mixture, then dredge in the coconut until evenly coated. Place tofu on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.
