Blend blue cheese, cream, 1/4 cup slivered almonds and red bell pepper in a food processor. Sprinkle countertop with flour and unroll the two pie crusts. Cut 8 (2x3-inch) rectangles out of each crust. Place 1 tablespoon filling each on 8 rectangles. Cover them with the remaining 8 rectangles. Pinch small points in the corners, middle and ends to seal the edges. The packet will have 8 small points. Press the remaining 2 tablespoons almonds onto the top of the fritters. Heat oil to 350 degrees F and fry the fritters one at a time for about 1 minute or until they are golden. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels.
