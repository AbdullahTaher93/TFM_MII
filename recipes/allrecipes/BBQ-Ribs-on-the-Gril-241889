Preheat grill for low heat. Cut ribs in half and season with steak seasoning. Place ribs, bone-side down, in a foil pan; add water. Cover pan with a sheet of aluminum foil. Cook ribs on the preheated grill, adding water every hour if liquid has evaporated, 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours. Add barbeque sauce to ribs and continue cooking for 30 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
