Cut the chicken on the diagonal into strips about 1/2 inch thick. Heat half the oil in a wok or heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken, onion, and garlic and saute, stirring constantly, until the chicken turns white with golden brown flecks, 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and add the cumin, coriander, and cinnamon stick. Saute, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Stir in the zucchini, then add the tomatoes with their juice and the stock. Simmer 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, put the couscous in a saucepan and pour the boiling water over. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Stir well, cover, and leave to soak, off the heat, 5 minutes. Add the sugar-snap peas and chickpeas to the chicken mixture. Simmer 5 minutes longer, stirring frequently. Stir the butter into the couscous and simmer over medium heat 3 minutes, using a fork to separate and fluff the grains. Pile the couscous onto a serving platter. Spoon the chicken on top and garnish with chopped cilantro.
