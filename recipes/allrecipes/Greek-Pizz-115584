Position rack at lowest level of oven; preheat to 450 degrees F. Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to the size of the baking sheet. Transfer to the baking sheet and brush with oil. Bake until puffed and beginning to color, 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, place lamb in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until the meat is browned, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towel. Arrange spinach, basil and tomato slices over the crust. Top with the lamb, onion, artichoke hearts and feta, spreading to the edges. Bake until the crust is crispy and golden, 11 to 13 minutes. Slice and serve.
