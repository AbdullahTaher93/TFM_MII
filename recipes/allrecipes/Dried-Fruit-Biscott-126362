Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat baking sheet with canola cooking spray. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, dried fruit or almonds, baking powder and salt. In a small bowl, combined canola oil, almond extract, vanilla extract and eggs. Add to flour mixture, stirring well until blended. (Dough will be dry and crumbly). Place dough on lightly floured surface and knead lightly 8 to 10 times. Divide dough into half. Shape each portion into an 8-inch long roll. Place rolls 4 inches apart on baking sheet. Flatten rolls to 1-inch thickness. Bake for 35 minutes. Remove rolls from baking sheet and cool on rack for 10 minutes. Cut each roll diagonally into 15 slices. Place slices cut side down on baking sheet. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Remove from baking sheet and cool completely on wire rack.
