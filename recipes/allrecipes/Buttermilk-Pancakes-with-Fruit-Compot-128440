To make the compote: In a small saucepan, combine the peaches or nectarines, apricot nectar or orange juice, preserves, ginger, and cinnamon. Cook over medium heat for 5 minutes, or until the fruit is soft. Add the blackberries and cook for another 2 minutes. Keep warm over very low heat. To make the buttermilk pancakes: In a large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt until well-combined. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg and egg white until very foamy. Whisk in the buttermilk, vanilla, and oil. Stir into the flour mixture just until the batter is combined and pourable. Place a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Coat with nonstick spray. Pour 1/3 cup (75 mL) batter into the skillet to form a 4-inch pancake. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the underside is browned. Turn and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until golden brown. Transfer to a warm oven. Repeat to make a total of 12 pancakes. Serve the pancakes with the warm compote.
