Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brown turkey in a large skillet until no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes; drain. Add garlic, pepper, bell pepper and onion to browned turkey meat; stir together and saute until onion becomes transparent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in soup and let cook for 2 minutes, then stir in spaghetti and mix until well blended. Transfer mixture into a 2 1/2 liter casserole dish and place in oven. Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes. Remove from oven, sprinkle bread crumbs on top and bake for another 10 minutes.
