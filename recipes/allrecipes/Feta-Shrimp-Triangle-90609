Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Slip knife into edge of pita breads and divide them in half horizontally. Cut each half into 5 to 6 triangles. (If bread is large, cut it into 8 to 10 triangles.) Place triangles on baking sheet and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until lightly browned. Stir shrimp, garlic, mayonnaise, chili powder, cumin, and mint with a fork until blended. Spread generously on toasted triangles. Sprinkle tops with sesame seeds and dust with paprika. Place on baking sheet and broil until tops are brown and bubbly. Watch carefully. They burn easily.
