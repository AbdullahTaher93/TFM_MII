Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Sift together the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda and salt, set aside. In a medium bowl, cream the butter and almond extract until smooth. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Carefully stir in the cherry pie filling, then fold in the dry ingredients. Spread batter evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Frost with a chocolate frosting of your choice.
