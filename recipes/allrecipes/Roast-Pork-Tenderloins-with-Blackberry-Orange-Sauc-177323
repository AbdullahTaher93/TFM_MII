Place a 10- to 12-inch nonstick, ovenproof frying pan over high heat. When pan is hot, add pork and brown well on all sides (4 to 5 minutes). Transfer pan to a 450 degrees F oven and bake, turning meat over once, until a meat thermometer inserted in thickest part registers 150 degrees F (12 to 15 minutes). Cut to test; meat should no longer be pink in center of thickest part. Using a wide spatula, transfer meat to a warm platter and keep warm while preparing sauce. Place frying pan with drippings over high heat. Add broth, jam, vinegar, orange peel, and horseradish. Bring to a boil; then cook, stirring, until mixture is reduced to about 2/3 cup (about 8 minutes). Slice meat, stirring any accumulated juices into sauce. Spoon sauce over meat to taste. Garnish with orange slices, if desired.
