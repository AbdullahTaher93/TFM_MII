Mix marmalade, soy sauce and brown sugar. Bake ham as directed on label, brushing with 1/4 cup of the marmalade mixture for the last 20 minutes of the ham baking time. Place remaining marmalade mixture in small saucepan; bring to boil on medium heat, stirring occasionally. Stir in walnuts. Cut ham into slices. Serve with the marmalade sauce.
