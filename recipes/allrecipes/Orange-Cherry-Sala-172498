Arrange 1 cup of romaine leaves on each of 4 salad plates. Divide shredded carrots between plates and sprinkle on top. Cut cucumber in half crosswise, reserving one half for another use. Cut the remaining half lengthwise down the center, then slice into half moons. Arrange 8 to 10 slices around each plate. Sprinkle equal amounts of onions, dried cherries, and chopped walnuts over each salad. Using a paring knife, slice the ends off the oranges. With the tip of the knife, slice lengthwise through the orange rind. Gently peel the orange, and remove as much of the white pulp as possible. Slice each orange in half from end to end, then slice each half into thin half moons. Add orange segments and avocado slices to salad plates. Drizzle dressing equally over salad.
