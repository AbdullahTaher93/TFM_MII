In 2 very large nonstick skillets, heat the oil until shimmering. Working in batches, fry the plantains in a single layer over moderate heat, turning occasionally, until deep golden and tender, 7 to 8 minutes per batch. Drain the plantains on a paper towel-lined rack and, if desired, sprinkle lightly with salt. Serve warm.
