Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix tomato sauce, Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, Cheddar cheese, garlic, rosemary, basil, red pepper flakes, oregano, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Lay tortillas onto a baking sheet; top with tomato sauce mixture. Arrange 2 salami slices into each pizza. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is golden brown, 9 to 12 minutes.
