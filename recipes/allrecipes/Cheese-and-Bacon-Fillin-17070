Fry the bacon in a large skillet over medium high heat for 10 minutes, or to desired crispiness. Drain excess fat, crumble bacon and set aside. Melt the butter or margarine in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour, stirring constantly, to form a roux. Slowly add the milk, stirring often to avoid lumps. Then stir in the salt and pepper to taste, mustard powder and the cheese. Let simmer for 1 minute, allowing cheese to melt some, remove from heat, add the bacon and stir well.
