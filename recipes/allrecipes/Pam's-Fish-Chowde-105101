In a large saucepan or stockpot, melt butter over medium heat. Stir in onions and celery and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. In a microwave-safe dish, heat clam juice on HIGH until very hot, about 2-3 minutes. Add the hot clam juice and potatoes to the stockpot; simmer partially covered for 8 minutes. Stir in fish and continue to simmer, partially covered and stirring frequently to flake fish. Continue to cook until potatoes are tender, about 5 minutes. Add seasoning and milk; bring to a simmer. Mix flour with 1/2 cup water until smooth and whisk into chowder. Continue to simmer until chowder thickens slightly. Season with salt and pepper and serve.
