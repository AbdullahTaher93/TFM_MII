In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups flour, sugar, yeast, aniseed and salt. In a small saucepan, heat the milk, butter and water to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat just until moistened. Add 1 egg; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a firm dough (dough will be sticky). Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a bowl coated with nonstick cooking spray, turning once to coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Divide each portion into thirds. Shape each into a 14-in. rope. Place three ropes on a baking sheet coated with nonstick cooking spray and braid; pinch ends to seal and tuck under. Repeat with remaining dough. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Beat remaining egg; brush over braids. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
