Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 9 inch X 5 inch loaf pan with cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine the pastry flour, soy flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt. In a medium bowl, using a wire whisk, beat the eggs, brown sugar, yogurt, oil, and vanilla extract until smooth. Stir in the zucchini and chocolate chips. Add to the flour mixture and stir just until blended. Place in the prepared loaf pan. Bake for 40 minutes, or until the cake is springy to the touch and a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan on a rack for 30 minutes. Remove from the pan and cool completely on the rack.
