Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Discard the first 2 inches of the green scallion tops. Cut the scallions in half crosswise and thinly slice them lengthwise into strips. In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil. Add the scallions and crushed red pepper and cook over moderate heat until the scallions are tender and beginning to brown, about 4 minutes. Season the bass with salt and pepper and transfer the fillets to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Top with the scallions and sprinkle with the lemon zest. Dot each fillet with a piece of the butter. Pour the orange juice over or around the fish. Cover tightly with foil and bake for about 16 minutes, until the fish is just opaque. Just before serving, in a medium bowl, whisk the walnut oil with the lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Add the herbs and toss to coat. Transfer the fish to plates and spoon the juices on top. Serve the herb salad alongside.
