Combine rosemary, mint, chile pepper, garlic, the juice from 2 of the limes, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Add the lamb and coat well with the marinade; marinate at least 1 hour and up to overnight in the refrigerator. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine the eggplant, red and yellow peppers, and onions with 3 tablespoons olive oil; toss to coat. Place vegetables on a large baking sheet in a single layer and roast until tender, about 20 minutes. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in skillet over medium heat. Remove lamb from marinade (discard marinade); cook and stir until no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add couscous; stir briefly to coat well. Add water; cook and stir until just boiling. Cover; set aside until all the water is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork, and stir in the juice of 1 lime. Serve lamb and vegetables over couscous.
