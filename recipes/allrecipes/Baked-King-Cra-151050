Cut crab legs into 2- to 3-inch pieces. Whisk together the garlic, butter, parsley, lemon juice and Tabasco and brush over the crab. Place crab legs, shell-side down on broiler pan. Broil about 4 inches from heat until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Brush occasionally with Tabasco or other favorite sauce while broiling.
