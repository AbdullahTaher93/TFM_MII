Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the pork tenderloin in a deep baking dish. Mix together the garlic, onion, parsley, mustard, wine, yogurt, olive oil, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, oregano, basil, thyme, bouillon, and lemon juice in a bowl; pour over the pork. Cover the entire dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until internal temperature has reached 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 1 hour 30 minutes. Remove the tenderloin from the dish and cover with aluminum foil on a cutting board. Allow to rest for 20 minutes before slicing. Reserve the sauce from the dish and serve on the side.
