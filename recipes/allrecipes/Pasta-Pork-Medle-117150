In a small bowl, combine the first five ingredients. Place pork in a large resealable plastic bag; add the marinade. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate overnight. Drain and discard marinade. Place pork on a rack coated with nonstick cooking spray in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Cover with foil; let stand for 10 minutes before cutting into thin slices. Place 5 qts. water in a soup kettle; bring to a boil. Add pasta; cook, uncovered, in boiling water for 10 minutes. Add snow peas; cook 1-2 minutes longer or until pasta and peas are tender; drain. In a large nonstick skillet, whisk the broth, peanut butter, vinegar, oil, ginger, soy sauce and pepper flakes until blended. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer for 2-3 minutes. Add the pasta mixture and tomatoes; heat through. Arrange sliced pork over pasta mixture. Sprinkle with onions. Serve immediately.
