Add the bay leaf, onion, and mushroom to the slow cooker. Pour in the beef broth, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Set slow cooker on Low, and cook for 8 to 10 hours. Add the noodles, and water or additional beef broth if needed. Cover and cook for 30 minutes. Once the noodles are done, stir in the sour cream and serve.
