Tear off 4 sheets of aluminum foil, large enough to wrap each steak. Grease one side of each piece of foil. Place one salmon filet on each and drizzle a little olive oil on top of each piece of salmon. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and dill weed to taste. Drizzle a bit of the lemon juice over each piece of salmon. Wrap up the steaks, carefully sealing each foil packet. Test each packet by pressing on it. If air escapes, re-wrap it. Put on the top rack of the dishwasher and run for a full cycle, with heated drying. Salmon will be done when the dishwasher runs the full cycle.
