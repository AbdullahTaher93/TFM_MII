Whisk lemon zest, mustard powder, seafood seasoning, onion powder, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Add black-eyed peas to lemon zest mixture and smash with a fork until mixture is crumbly. Stir egg and mayonnaise into pea mixture; gently fold in crab meat and Parmesan cheese until combined. Form pea mixture into 5-ounce patties. Pour bread crumbs into a shallow bowl and press patties into bread crumbs, coating both sides. Place patties on a plate and refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; fry patties until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side.
