Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Mix flour and baking powder in large bowl. Cut in cream cheese with pastry blender or 2 knives until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in shredded cheese. Add milk; stir until mixture forms soft dough. Pat dough to 3/4-inch thickness on floured surface. Cut into 14 rounds with 2-inch fluted biscuit cutter, rerolling scraps as necessary. Place, 2 inches apart, on baking sheet. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.
