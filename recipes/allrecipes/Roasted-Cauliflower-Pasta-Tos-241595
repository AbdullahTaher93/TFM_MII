Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Trim cauliflower and separate into small florets. Toss cauliflower with melted butter, garlic and half each salt and pepper. Spread on a parchment paper-lined, rimmed baking sheet. Roast, stirring once, for 30 to 40 minutes or until golden and browned. Transfer 1 cup (250 mL) cauliflower to a food processor. Add sour cream, Parmesan cheese and remaining salt and pepper; pulse until smooth. Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water. Reserve 1 1/2 cups (375 mL) cooking water before draining. Toss hot cooked pasta with sour cream mixture, remaining roasted cauliflower, sun-dried tomatoes and basil; add enough reserved pasta water to make pasta moist and saucy. Serve immediately with additional Parmesan cheese at the table.
