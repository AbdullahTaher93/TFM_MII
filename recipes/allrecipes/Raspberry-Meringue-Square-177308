Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9- by 13-inch baking pan with heavy foil, allowing 2 inches to hang over two sides for handles. Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray. In a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter, sugar, and salt until blended. Add yolks and mix until incorporated. Mix in flour, blending until dough begins to hold together. Press into bottom of prepared pan. Bake 15 to 19 minutes until golden. Remove from oven and cool 5 minutes. Leave oven on. Strain the jam through a medium-mesh strainer; discard seeds. Spread over crust. In a medium mixing bowl with electric mixer on medium speed, beat egg whites and vinegar until foamy. Increase speed to high and continue beating until soft peaks form. Beating continuously, add sugar 1 tablespoon at a time, until peaks are stiff and glossy. Fold in nuts. Spread over jam. Bake at 350 for 20 minutes or until top is lightly golden. Cool 10 minutes and cut into approximately 1 3/4-inch squares. Leave in pan until cool. Using foil handles, lift cookies out of pan and place on cutting board. Remove cookies from foil with a spatula.
