Place ribs in a shallow roasting pan. Cover and bake at 325 degrees F for 1-1/4 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour 1 cup sauce over ribs, turn to coat. Let stand for 15 minutes. Grill ribs, uncovered, over medium heat for 10-12 minutes, basting with 1 cup sauce and turning occasionally. Serve with remaining sauce.
