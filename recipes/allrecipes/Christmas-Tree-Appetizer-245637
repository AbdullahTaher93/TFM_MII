Break pretzel sticks in half and poke each through the rounded side of each pita bread triangle for the "tree trunk". Spread guacamole on each pita triangle and sprinkle red bell pepper in a zigzag pattern over guacamole layer creating a decorated "tree". Cut yellow bell pepper into small star shapes using a small star-shaped cookie cutter. Place yellow star on top of each "tree".
