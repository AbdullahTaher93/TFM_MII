Cut or snap off tough ends of the asparagus and discard them. Asparagus may then be left whole or cut into bite size pieces. The whole spear has a nicer presentation. Cook asparagus just until tender but still has a crunch to it; do not over cook. If steaming, cook approximately 4 minutes. If boiling, approximately 3 minutes. The spears can also be grilled or broiled. Drain and immediately immerse in cold or iced water to stop the cooking process. When cool, drain. Meanwhile, make the dressing by mixing together the olive oil, vinegar, mustard, tarragon and the salt & pepper. Set aside for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. I usually put the dressing ingredients in a jar and shake it to mix. Arrange the radicchio (use either whole leaves or slivered) on a serving platter or on 4 individual salad plates. Top with the asparagus. This can be refrigerated (covered) until 15 minutes before time to serve. Just before serving, mix the dressing again and drizzle over the asparagus.
