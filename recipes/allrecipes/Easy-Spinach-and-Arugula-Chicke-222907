Stuff spinach leaves, arugula, and garlic under the skin of the chicken thigh and place on a baking dish. Sprinkle with seasoned salt. Bake chicken thigh in the oven set at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
