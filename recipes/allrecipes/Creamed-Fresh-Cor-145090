Using a long, sharp knife, slice the kernels from the ears of corn, and set aside. Holding the cobs over a large bowl, scrape the cobs with the spikes of a meat pounder or the back of a heavy chef's knife to remove remaining bits of kernels and corn milk; set aside. In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add scallions, and cook until just softened, about 1 minute. Add the corn kernels, scrapings, and cream, and cook, stirring occasionally until cream has thickened, about 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in tarragon, and serve.
