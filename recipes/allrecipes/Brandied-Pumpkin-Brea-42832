Combine flour, yeast, sugar, pumpkin pie spice, salt, butter, pumpkin puree, water, and brandy in the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select the Sweet or Basic/White cycle using the Light crust setting and start the machine. (To make the bread without a bread machine, see Editor's Note.) When the bread is done baking, remove it from the pan and allow to cool on a wire rack.
