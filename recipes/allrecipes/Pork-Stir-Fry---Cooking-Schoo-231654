Whisk soy sauce, water, garlic, ginger, brown sugar, and cornstarch together in a bowl. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir pork in hot oil, stirring every few seconds, until browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer pork to a plate and loosely cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in the same wok over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion, mushrooms, and red bell pepper in the hot oil, until soft, 1 to 2 minutes. Return pork to the wok, add soy sauce mixture; cook until garlic and ginger are tender and sauce is thick, about 1 minute.
