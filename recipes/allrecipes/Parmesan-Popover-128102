Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat 8 custard cups or popover-pan cups with nonstick spray. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg substitute. Add the flour, milk and margarine, and whisk until the ingredients are combined. Stir in the Parmesan. Divide the batter evenly among the cups. Place the cups on a large baking sheet. Bake until the popovers are puffed and golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove the popovers from the cups and serve while they're steaming hot.
