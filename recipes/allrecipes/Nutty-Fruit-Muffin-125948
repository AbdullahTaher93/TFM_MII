Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a 12-cup muffin pan with cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt. In a medium bowl, combine the yogurt, brown sugar, egg, oil, and vanilla extract. Stir into the flour mixture just until blended. Stir in the pineapple, currants or raisins, carrots, and walnuts. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups. Bake for 20 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Cool on a rack for 5 minutes. Remove to the rack to cool completely.
