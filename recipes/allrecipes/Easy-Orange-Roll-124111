In a saucepan, combine sugar, butter, orange juice and peel. Heat until sugar is dissolved and butter is melted. Pour into a greased 10-in. fluted tube pan. Place 12 biscuits on their sides in a ring around the outer edge, overlapping slightly. Arrange remaining biscuits in the same manner, creating two more rings (one of 10 biscuits and one of eight). Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Immediately turn upside down onto serving platter. Serve warm.
