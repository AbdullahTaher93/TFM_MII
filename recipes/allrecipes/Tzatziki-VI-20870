Place the yogurt in a large square of double cheesecloth. Tie the cheesecloth at the top and let any excess liquid drain for about 4 hours. Peel cucumbers; remove seeds with a spoon. Shred the cucumbers, then squeeze to drain excess liquid. Peel and mince garlic. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, dill, salt and pepper. Add yogurt, cucumbers and garlic and stir until evenly combined. Refrigerate until ready to use.
