Heat olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat; cook and stir pancetta and onion in the hot oil until pancetta is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir peas, white wine, thyme, salt, and pepper into pancetta mixture; bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until peas are tender and liquid is slightly reduced, 3 to 5 minutes.
