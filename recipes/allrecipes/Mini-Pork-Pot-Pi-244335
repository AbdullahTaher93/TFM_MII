Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Separate biscuits and press with hands into a 5- to 6-inch circle. Place 1 round in each of 8 regular-size muffin cups. Firmly press in bottom and up sides, forming 1/2-inch rim. Combine remaining ingredients; mix well. Spoon filling into each biscuit crust, pushing into crust and mounding on top. If desired, sprinkle top of each with 1 tablespoon shredded cheese. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25 to 30 minutes until biscuits are golden brown. Cool in pan 5 minutes before removing to serve.
