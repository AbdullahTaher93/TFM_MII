Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate. Stir the white Zinfandel wine, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Place the mahi mahi fillets in the bowl and turn to coat with the wine mixture; allow to marinate for 10 minutes. Remove the fillets from the marinade, shaking off any excess moisture from the fish. Discard the marinade. Grill the fillets on the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 4 to 5 minutes per side.
