In a large mixing bowl, cream sugar and shortening. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Blend in bananas and vanilla. Sift flour; then sift together with baking powder, soda and salt. Add alternately with buttermilk to the creamed mixture. Stir in nuts. Pour into two greased and floured 9-in. round cake pans. Sprinkle coconut on top of each cake. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until cakes test done. Cool in pans 10 minutes; remove and cool completely. For filling, combine sugar, flour, cream and butter in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat until thick. Add nuts, salt and vanilla; cool. Spread filling on one cake layer with coconut side up. Place second layer, coconut side up, on top. For frosting, beat egg white, shortening, butter and vanilla until smooth and creamy. Add sugar and beat until light and fluffy. Frost sides of cake only. If desired, cake can be made without frosting.
