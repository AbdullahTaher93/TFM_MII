Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Remove chicken from marinade and drain. Place on hot grill and cook for 6 to 8 minutes on each side, or until juices run clear. In a large bowl, combine Romaine, celery, onion, peas, tomatoes and toss with enough vinaigrette to coat. In a food processor, add the crumbled feta and mayonnaise. Blend until smooth. Place the tossed salad on a dinner plate and top with the feta mixture and grilled chicken or beef.
