Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels and crumble. Combine pasta sauce and lemon juice together in a saucepan over medium-low heat; simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is reduced by half, about 45 minutes. Stir bacon into reduced tomato sauce.
