Combine crumbs, butter and sugar; press into the bottom of a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake at 325 degrees F for 10 minutes; cool. Pour evaporated milk into a metal mixing bowl. Add the mixer beaters. Cover and chill bowl and beaters for at least 2 hours. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, dissolve gelatin in water; chill until syrupy, about 30 minutes. Remove milk from refrigerator and beat until stiff peaks form. In a large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Add gelatin; mix well. Stir in pineapple and 3/4 cup walnuts. Fold in milk. Pour over crust. Chill for at least 3 hours or overnight. Sprinkle remaining walnuts over the top before filling is completely firm.
