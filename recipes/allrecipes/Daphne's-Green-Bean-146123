Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until bacon is crisp, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove bacon to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Reserve 1 tablespoon of the bacon fat from the skillet, discarding the rest. Return the reserved bacon fat to the skillet and heat. Cook and stir the onion, garlic, and chipotle pepper in the heated bacon fat until the garlic is fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the adobo sauce and tomatoes; cook another 2 minutes. Stir in the green beans, water, honey, seasoned salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, cover the pan, lower the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the green beans are tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Crumble the bacon. Sprinkle the bacon pieces and lemon juice over the green beans. Serve immediately.
