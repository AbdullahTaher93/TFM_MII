Snip the ends off of the pea pods and cut into halves with a diagonal slice. Also slice the scallions diagonally. Slice the bell pepper into thin slivers. I use a food processor to shred the cabbage but a good knife works just as well and there's less to clean up. In a large bowl, toss the cabbage, snow pea pods, bell peppers and scallions. To make the dressing. Finely grate the fresh ginger root (if using dried ground ginger then use 1/2 tsp). In a small bowl, add the soy sauce and whisk in the tahini until well combined. Add the lime juice, ginger and Splenda. Whisk well. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss well.
