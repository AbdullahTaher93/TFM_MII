Line a baking sheet with waxed paper or parchment paper. Melt white chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, 5 to 15 minutes. Insert a fork into the filling of each cookie and dip cookie into the melted chocolate, allowing excess chocolate to drip back into the bowl. Transfer coated cookies to the lined baking sheet. Immediately place 2 black sprinkles onto the top portion of the cookie for the "eyes" and 4 black sprinkles for the "smile" and 1 orange sprinkle for the "nose" while the chocolate is still warm on the cookie. Arrange 3 of the multicolored sprinkles down the center of the cookie for the "buttons". Cool cookies completely. Using the decorating gel, draw a thin line around the "neck" of each snowman creating a scarf. Allow gel to dry.
