Wash the kale but do not pat it dry. Coarsely chop it. In a 12-inch (30-cm) nonstick skillet or wok, warm the oils over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and ginger root, and saute until the garlic is lightly browned. Add the kale with the water that clings to it and saute it, sprinkling with water as needed until it is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the kale to a bowl and toss with the tamari or soy sauce, sesame seeds, and ground red pepper.
