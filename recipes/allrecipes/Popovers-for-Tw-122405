Let milk and egg stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl; beat just until smooth. Pour into four greased 6-oz. custard cups; place on a baking sheet. Bake at 425 degrees F for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (do not open door). Bake 15-20 minutes longer or until popovers are deep golden brown (do not underbake). Serve warm.
