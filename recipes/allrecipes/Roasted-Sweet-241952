Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spoon coconut oil onto a baking sheet; add sweet potatoes, onion, apple, and garlic. Sprinkle cinnamon, chipotle pepper, and salt over sweet potato mixture. Roast in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until sweet potatoes are tender, 20 to 30 minutes.
