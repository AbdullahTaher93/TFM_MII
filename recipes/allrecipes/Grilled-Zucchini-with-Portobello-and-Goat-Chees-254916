Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Pour marinade into a shallow bowl. Add zucchini, gold zucchini, and mushrooms. Let marinate, flipping occasionally, 10 to 15 minutes. Grill zucchini and gold zucchini, turning occasionally and brushing with marinade, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Repeat with mushrooms. Transfer to a serving plate. Place pine nuts in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Toast, tossing occasionally, until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Heat oil in a large oven-safe skillet. Add shallot; cook and stir until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and basil; cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; add grilled zucchini, gold zucchini, and mushrooms. Coat with goat cheese. Transfer skillet to the preheated oven; broil, keeping oven door open, until goat cheese is golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle toasted pine nuts and chives over goat cheese.
