Mix beer, onion, red pepper flakes, parsley, salt, butter, garlic, pickling spice, oregano, and bay leaves in a saucepan; add enough cold water to fill the saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil. Drop shrimp into the boiling liquid, let the mixture return to a boil, and cook until shrimp are bright pink and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 5 minutes; drain.
