Mix cream cheese and pineapple together in a bowl; form into a ball. Roll ball in walnut pieces until ball is completely coated. Set ball on a piece of plastic wrap. Wrap plastic wrap tightly around ball and place in a small bowl. Refrigerate ball to allow flavors to blend, at least 30 minutes. Serve cheese ball on a bed of chopped parsley.
