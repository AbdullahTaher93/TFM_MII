Place rhubarb in a colander and pour water over it; set aside. In a bowl, combine sugar, flour and tapioca; mix well. Add drained rhubarb; toss to coat. Let stand for 15 minutes. Beat egg and water; add to rhubarb mixture and mix well. Line a 9-in. pie plate with bottom pastry. Add filling. Dot with butter. Cover with remaining pastry; flute edges. Cut slits in top crust. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F; bake 40-50 minutes longer or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly.
