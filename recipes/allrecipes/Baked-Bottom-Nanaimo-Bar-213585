Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter an 8x8-inch square baking pan. In a large mixing bowl, beat unsalted butter with sugar with an electric mixer until very creamy, about 1 minute. Add the egg and cocoa powder, and beat until the ingredients are well mixed. Pour in the graham cracker crumbs, 1 cup coconut, and almonds, and beat on low speed until the ingredients are thoroughly combined. Press the mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 12 minutes, and let the crust cool. Melt chocolate chips with 3 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan over very low heat, stirring until well blended. Remove from the heat, allow to cool for several minutes, then spread the chocolate mixture over the crust in a smooth layer. Refrigerate the dish while you make the next layer. Beat the pudding mix and milk in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until the pudding is thick and smooth, about 2 minutes. Spread the pudding over the chocolate layer; sprinkle the dish with 1/4 cup coconut, cover loosely, and refrigerate until chilled and set, at least 1 hour.
