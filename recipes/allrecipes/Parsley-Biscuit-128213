Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder and baking soda. Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut in cheese and margarine until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Add broth and parsley. Stir until mixture forms a soft dough. Place dough on a well-floured surface and knead it 10 to 12 times. Pat dough into an 8-inch (20-cm) square. With a floured knife, cut dough into 2-inch (5-cm) squares. Place squares, 2 inches (5 cm) apart, on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until tops and bottoms are golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Serve with fruit spread.
