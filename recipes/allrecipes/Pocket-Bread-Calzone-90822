Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a wide nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic, and mushrooms. Cover and cook until mushrooms give off juice (about 2 minutes). Uncover and continue cooking, stirring often, until mushrooms are browned (3 to 5 more minutes). Meanwhile, in a bowl, stir together ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, ham, parsley, and oregano; set aside. Carefully slit each pocket bread horizontally along edge so that pita is about one-third open. Stir mushroom mixture into cheese mixture. Gently spoon a sixth of the filling into each pocket. Arrange calzones in a single layer on a large baking sheet; brush with remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Bake until toasted (12 to 15 minutes).
