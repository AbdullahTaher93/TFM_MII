Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Combine beef, Parmesan cheese, parsley, egg and 1 teaspoon garlic in medium bowl. Divide mixture into 12 portions; shape into meatballs and place on aluminum foil-lined shallow baking pan. Bake 15 minutes or until done (160 degrees F). Meanwhile, heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook 3 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Add remaining 2 teaspoons garlic, cook 1 minute more or until fragrant. Stir in undrained tomatoes, tomato sauce, oregano and salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes or until sauce has thickened, stirring occasionally. Place open buns on baking sheet. Spoon sauce on bottom of each bun; place 1 meatball on each bun and more sauce, if desired. Top each with mozzarella cheese. Bake 5 minutes or until cheese melts and bun tops are lightly crisped. Close with tops of buns.
