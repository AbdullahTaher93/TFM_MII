Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Combine rice, coconut milk, sugar, and salt in a large saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until pudding is thick and creamy, 18 to 20 minutes. Stir milk and eggs into pudding, stirring constantly to keep pudding from sticking, at least 2 minutes. Remove pudding from heat and stir butter, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg into pudding until thoroughly mixed. Fold peaches and raisins into pudding.
