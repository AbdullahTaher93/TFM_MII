Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease the bottom and 1/2 inch up sides of four 5 3/4x3x2-inch loaf pans or two 8x4x2-inch loaf pans; set aside. In a very large mixing bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Make a well in the center of dry mixture; set aside. In another bowl, combine the eggs, LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, cooking oil, poppy seeds, vanilla, and almond extract. Add egg mixture all at once to the dry mixture. Stir just until moistened. Spoon batter into the prepared pans. Bake in a 325 degree F oven for 50 to 55 minutes for the 5 3/4-inch loaf pans or for 60 to 70 minutes for the 8-inch loaf pans or until a toothpick inserted near the centers comes out clean. Cool in pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove loaves from pans. Cool completely on wire rack. If desired, wrap and store overnight for easier slicing.
