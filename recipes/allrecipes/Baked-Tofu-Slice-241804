Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Arrange tofu slices onto a baking sheet. Brush olive oil over the top of each slice. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the tofu. Bake tofu in preheated oven until lightly browned on top, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir soy sauce, Sriracha, sesame oil, chile-garlic sauce, sesame seeds, garlic, and green onion together in a bowl; spoon atop the tofu slices. Return baking sheet to oven and continue baking tofu until topping is warmed, 3 to 5 minutes more.
