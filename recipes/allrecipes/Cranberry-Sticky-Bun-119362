In a mixing bowl, combine 2 cups flour and yeast. In a saucepan, heat sugar, butter, salt and milk to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat on low speed for 30 seconds. Add eggs; beat on high for 3 minutes. Beat in remaining flour. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. In a saucepan, combine the first four topping ingredients; cook and stir over low heat until brown sugar is dissolved and butter is melted. Stir in walnuts. Spread into two greased 9-in. square baking pans; set aside. Punch dough down; divide in half. Roll each portion into an 18-in. x 6-in. rectangle; brush with butter. Combine filling ingredients; sprinkle over dough to within 1/2 in. of edges. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch seam to seal. Cut each roll into nine slices; place cut side down over topping and flatten slightly. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
