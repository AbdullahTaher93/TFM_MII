Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain. Meanwhile, in a saucepan over medium-low heat, mix together the pesto and basil tomato sauce. Bring to a simmer, and season with salt to taste. Microwave instructions: cook on high for one minute. Place pasta in a large serving bowl. Toss with pesto-tomato sauce. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.
