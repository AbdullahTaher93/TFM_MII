With a sharp knife, cut shrimp in half so that the meat is exposed in the shell. In a small saucepan, heat olive oil and lightly fry the garlic until just softened. Add butter and Oregano. Heat until butter has melted. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil grate. Lay shrimp out on a tray and brush generously with the butter mixture. Grill shrimp until lightly golden.
