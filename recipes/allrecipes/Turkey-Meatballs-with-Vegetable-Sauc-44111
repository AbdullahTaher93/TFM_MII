In a large bowl, combine ground turkey, bread crumbs and egg. Mix well, and shape into balls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Preheat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook meatballs until evenly brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Stir in condensed soup and evaporated milk. Cook over medium heat until meatballs are no longer pink, approximately 15 minutes.
