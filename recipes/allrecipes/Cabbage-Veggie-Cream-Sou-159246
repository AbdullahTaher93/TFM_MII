Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the sausage in the hot pot until crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease; reserve the browned sausage. Pour the olive oil into the pot; stir in the garlic, ginger, onion, butternut squash, beets, red potatoes, carrots, and cabbage. Cook and stir for 10 minutes. Season with hot pepper sauce, dill, sage, thyme, salt, and pepper. Add the browned sausage, chicken broth, cream of mushroom soup, and vinegar. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until all of the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.
