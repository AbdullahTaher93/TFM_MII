Cover the bottom of a skillet with the olive oil and place over medium heat. Place the garlic, onion, and cayenne pepper in the skillet and stir until fragrant. Stir in the green pepper. Cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the frozen okra and allow to cook for 5 minutes more. Stir in both the diced and the stewed tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until all vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
