Cook noodles according to package directions; drain. Add butter; toss to coat. In a large skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Spread a fourth of the spaghetti sauce into an ungreased 5-qt. slow cooker. Layer with a third of the noodles, a third of the beef, a third of the remaining sauce and a third of the cheeses. Repeat layers twice. Cover and cook on low for 4 hours or until cheese is melted and lasagna is heated through.
