In a medium bowl combine the tomatoes and soup and mix together. Set aside. In a lightly greased 2 quart microwave-safe casserole dish layer 1/3 of the tortilla chips, 1/2 of the chicken, 1/2 of the tomato/soup mixture and 1/3 of the cheese. Repeat layers, then top with the remaining tortilla chips and cheese. Microwave: Cover dish with lid or wax paper. Microwave for 7 minutes. Remove lid long enough to release steam, then microwave for another 4 minutes. Conventional Oven: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cover dish with lid or aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
