To prepare the salad: Place 1 tablespoon oil and a pinch of salt in a large bowl. Add the greens and carrot. Toss the salad. Place the salad on dinner plates. Set aside. Warm 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over high heat. Season the fish lightly with salt on both sides. Cut the steaks in half if needed to create equal portions. Place in the pan. Cook 2 to 4 minutes each side over high heat, or until browned and cooked to the desired degree of doneness. Add the vinegar, water, and currants. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil. Swirl or spoon the sauce over the fish. Place the tuna over the reserved salads. Spoon the sauce and currants over all.
