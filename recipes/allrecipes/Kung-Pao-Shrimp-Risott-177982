Rinse and drain shrimp. In 2- to 3-quart pan, add 2 tablespoons oil over high heat, stir in shrimp, and cook until pink (about 2 minutes). Remove from pan and set aside. To same pan, add remaining oil, diced bell pepper, ginger, and chilies. Cook and stir until vegetables begin to soften (less than a minute). Add rice and continue to cook, stirring, until centers of grains turn opaque (about 1 minute). Add sherry and 1 cup broth; cook over medium heat until liquid is absorbed. Continue to add hot broth, 1/2 cup at a time, until all broth is used and rice is tender to bite, about 15 minutes. Remove and discard chilies (or reserve to use for garnish, if desired). Return shrimp to pan and stir just until hot (about 1 minute). Gently mix in sesame oil. Spoon risotto into 4 warm, wide bowls or onto warm dinner plates. Garnish with slivered bell pepper, peanuts, and, if desired, reserved chilies. Season to taste with soy sauce.
