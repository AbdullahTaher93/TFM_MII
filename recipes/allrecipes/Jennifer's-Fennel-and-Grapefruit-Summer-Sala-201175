Place grapefruit slices and any leftover juices in a bowl. Stir in onion, fennel, and hearts of palm, coating with the grapefruit juice. Pour mixture into another bowl, leaving a small amount of juice in the first bowl. Whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, and garlic powder in the original bowl. Toss lettuce with the vinaigrette. Divide lettuce onto 4 plates. Evenly distribute the grapefruit mixture on top of the lettuce and top with the Gorgonzola cheese. Place avocado slices on each salad and serve.
