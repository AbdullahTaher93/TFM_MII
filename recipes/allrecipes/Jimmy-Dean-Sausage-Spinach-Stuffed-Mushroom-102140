Preheat oven to 350 F. Remove stems from mushrooms; reserve for another use. Place mushrooms rounded side down in two greased 9 inches X 13 inches baking dishes. Drain and press spinach to remove excess liquid. In a large bowl, combine cooked sausage, spinach, Parmesan cheese and olive oil; mix well. Stuff sausage mixture into mushroom caps. Sprinkle with bread crumbs; drizzle with melted butter. Bake 30 minutes or until topping is brown and bubbly.
