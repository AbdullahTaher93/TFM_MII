Cut each potato into five slices. Place onion between slices and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Reassemble each potato; place on a double layer of heavy-duty foil (about 12 in. square) Pour 2-4 tablespoons of salad dressing over each potato. Wrap foil around potatoes and seal tightly. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 50-60 minutes or until the potatoes are tender.
