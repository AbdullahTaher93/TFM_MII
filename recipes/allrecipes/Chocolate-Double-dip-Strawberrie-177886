Rinse strawberries; do not remove stems. Drain on towels. Place semisweet chocolate in a double boiler top or bowl nested over hot (not simmering) water; stir occasionally until chocolate is smoothly melted, about 8 minutes. (Or heat for 15-second intervals in a microwave-safe bowl in a microwave oven; stir often.) Remove pan top from heat. Dip strawberries, tips down, into semisweet chocolate. Rotate each berry to coat about 2/3 of the tip end. Set well apart on a 12- by 15-inch waxed-paper-lined baking sheet (or embed toothpicks well apart in a piece of plastic foam, then impale each berry, tip up, on a toothpick). Chill until chocolate is firm, about 15 minutes. In another bowl or pan, melt white chocolate as directed for semisweet chocolate. Dip each strawberry tip into white chocolate, rotating to coat about half the dark chocolate at strawberry tip. Chill at least 10 minutes or up to 8 hours. To eat, hold by the stems.
