Heat cannellini beans on low heat in a saucepan. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in red onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon maple syrup; reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking and stirring until the onion is very tender and dark brown, about 15 minutes more. Remove from skillet and add to beans. Heat 1 more tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add butternut squash; cook and stir until tender, about 8 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon maple syrup; cook and stir to coat, about 5 minutes. Remove from skillet and add squash to bean mixture. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add baby broccoli; cook and stir until tender and bright green, about 7 minutes. Add broccoli to bean mixture. Pour chicken stock into bean mixture, increase heat to medium-low, and stir remaining 1 tablespoon maple syrup and thyme to the mixture. Bring to a simmer and cook until heated through, stirring gently to combine. Top with crumbled bacon before serving.
