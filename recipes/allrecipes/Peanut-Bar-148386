Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 x 13 inch baking dish. Whisk the flour, sugar, and baking powder in a bowl. Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl. Gradually add the white sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape. Add the flour mixture alternately with the milk and the 1/2 cup melted margarine, stirring just to combine. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, 30 to 45 minutes; cut into about 20 squares. In a bowl beat 1 cup margarine until fluffy. Gradually add 2 cups of the confectioners' sugar, beating well. Slowly beat in the coffee and egg yolks. Then, slowly beat in remaining sugar until you get the desired consistency for spreading. Frost cake squares on all sides with frosting. Spread the ground peanuts into the bottom of a large dish; roll the frosted squares in the ground peanuts to coat. Store covered in refrigerator.
