Pour sesame seeds into a small frying pan. Stir over medium heat until pale gold (2 to 3 minutes). Pour out of pan and set aside. In a small bowl, stir together ginger, sugar, lemon peel, red pepper flakes, soy sauce, and oil. Place pea pods in a colander; set colander in the sink. Drain clams, reserving liquid. In a 4- to 5-quart pan, bring about 2 quarts water to a boil over high heat; stir in reserved clam liquid and pasta and cook, uncovered, until pasta is just tender to bite (1 to 2 minutes), or cook pasta according to package directions. Pour pasta and its cooking water into colander over pea pods and drain well. Return pasta and pea pods to pan and set over low heat. Add clams, ginger mixture, and onions. Mix well with 2 forks, then pour onto a platter or individual plates and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
