Combine sugar, cream of tartar, salt, and water in a small saucepan. Cook to the soft ball stage, 234 - 240 degrees F (112 - 115 degrees C). Cool to lukewarm. Gradually beat in enough confectioners' sugar to make mixture thick enough to almost hold its shape. Stir in flavoring. Divide into 4 parts. Leave one part white and tint other portions pink, yellow, and green. To ice petits fours, place them on a cooling rack and spoon the icing/frosting over the top until covered.
