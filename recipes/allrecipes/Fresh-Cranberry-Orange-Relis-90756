Sort cranberries, discarding any bruised or decayed fruit. Rinse berries. Rinse orange and cut into 1-inch chunks; discard any seeds. In a blender or food processor, whirl orange, including peel, 2 cups of the cranberries, and sugar until pureed. Pour puree into a 2- to 3-quart pan over high heat. Stir until mixture is boiling rapidly and begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Add remaining 3 cups cranberries and stir just until they begin to pop, about 5 minutes longer. Pour into a bowl. Serve warm or cool. To transport, if desired, cover and carry at room temperature.
