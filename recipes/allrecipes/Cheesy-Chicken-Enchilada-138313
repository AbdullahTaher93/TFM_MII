Make the sauce: In a medium saucepan, warm oil over medium low heat. Add onion, garlic, jalapeno, and chili powder. Cook until onions are translucent, about 8 minutes. Add tomatoes and 1/2 cup water. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, crushing tomatoes lightly with the back of a spoon. Cook until tomatoes are tender and sauce is slightly chunky, 15 to 20 minutes. Add lime juice, and season with salt and pepper. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Make the enchiladas: In a medium skillet over medium high heat, warm tortillas, 10 to 15 seconds per side. Working with one tortilla at a time, top with 2 ounces of chicken, 1 ounce of cheese, and pickled jalapenos, if using; roll tightly. Place enchiladas, seam-side down, in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Pour sauce over tortillas, and top with remaining cheese. Bake until cheese has melted, 5 to 7 minutes. If desired, place under broiler for 1 to 2 minutes for a crispier top. Serve with sour cream and fresh cilantro, if desired.
