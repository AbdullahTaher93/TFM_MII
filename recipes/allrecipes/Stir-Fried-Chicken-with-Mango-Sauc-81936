Slice mango on either side of its large seed. Cut into strips. Then with a thin knife, slice off the skin by having each strip skin side down on a cutting board and running the knife horizontally as close to the skin as you can. Be sure to cut off the flesh around the edge of the seed too. Dice into cubes about the size of a grape. Set aside 2/3 cups (save the rest for some other recipe). In a bowl, mix together the salt, lemon pepper and garlic power. Toss in the chicken breast strips. Set aside. Wash your hands, knife and work surface. Cut the rib out of the bok choy leaves and dice it. Shred or chop the leaves. Mince the scallions. In a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter and add the chicken and stir fry for about 3 minutes. Add the diced bok choy ribs and cook for 1 minute. Add the scallions and the bok choy leaves, toss, and cook for about 2-3 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl mix together the water, soy sauce, vinegar, and grated ginger. Mix well. Add guar gum, stir enough to dissolve and immediately add to the wok. Stir well. Reduce heat to a simmer, add the mangos. Let simmer for 3 -5 minutes.
