In a medium bowl, toss salmon fillets in pesto to coat. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter, and saute shallots until tender. Stir in rice, fish stock, and wine. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer 15 minutes. Without stirring rice, place salmon in the saucepan. Cover, and continue cooking 25 to 30 minutes, until rice is tender and salmon is easily flaked with a fork.
