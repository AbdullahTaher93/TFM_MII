Toss the romaine lettuce, cucumber, green onions, yellow bell pepper, red bell pepper, and carrot together in a large bowl. Arrange the apple slice atop the vegetable mixture. Scatter the blueberries, walnuts, and feta cheese over the top of the salad. Whisk the apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, honey, onion powder, and salt together in a small bowl. Slowly drizzle the grapeseed oil into the mixture, whisking constantly until combined. Stir the poppy seeds into the dressing; drizzle over the salad to serve.
