Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Pour vinegar and beer into a large roasting pan. Add the celery, carrots, peppers, garlic, and onion. Rub the venison ribs with Cajun seasoning, salt and pepper to taste. Place ribs in roasting pan and cover with a tight fitting lid or aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 18 hours, or until the meat is falling off of the bone.
