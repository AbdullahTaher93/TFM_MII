Whisk jalapeno pepper jelly, orange juice, and tequila together in a bowl until smooth; pour into a large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken wings, coat with the marinade, squeeze to remove excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 4 hours to overnight. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Remove chicken wings from the marinade and shake to remove excess moisture. Blot wings dry with paper towel. Discard the remaining marinade. Fry chicken wings in batches in hot oil until golden brown on the outside and no longer pink on the inside, 10 to 15 minutes per batch. Drain on a wire baking rack. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir chili sauce into the melted butter until the color is consistent; pour into a large stainless steel bowl. Add chicken wings and toss to coat in the sauce.
