Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir shallots in the hot butter until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir jalapeno peppers into shallots and cook until fragrant, about 2 more minutes. Stir cranberry jelly into the shallots and peppers until melted. Mix shredded turkey with jalapeno-cranberry jelly mixture in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Arrange tortilla chips on the prepared baking sheet and fill each chip with 1 tablespoon turkey mix. Top each chip with 1/2 teaspoon of white Cheddar cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese topping is melted and the chips are golden, about 10 minutes.
