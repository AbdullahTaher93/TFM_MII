Preheat grill for medium high heat. Combine ground turkey, onion, 1/4 cup barbeque sauce, bread crumbs, salt and pepper. Mix until thoroughly combined and form into 6 patties. Coat cold grill rack with cooking spray and place over hot coals. Cook patties 10-12 minutes, turning frequently for even cooking and browning. Baste with remaining barbeque sauce and serve on toasted buns.
