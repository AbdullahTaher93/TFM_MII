Pour warm water into the pan of bread machine and stir honey into warm water until dissolved. Add yeast to the mixture and let stand until yeast begins to foam, about 10 minutes. Add flour, olive oil, and salt to the bread pan in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select soft setting if machine has that option; otherwise select regular setting and start the machine. Let finished bread cool before slicing.
