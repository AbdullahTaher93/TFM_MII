Preheat grill to high (about 500 degrees F). To prepare the peach relish, spray peach quarters liberally with non-stick cooking spray. Place peaches, cut side down, onto grill. Grill for 6 to 8 minutes, turning once, until peaches are lightly charred and tender. Remove from grill and allow to cool slightly. Carefully peel skin from peaches (it should come off easily) and dice into large chunks. Place peeled peaches in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add cider vinegar, orange juice, Morton(R) Nature's Seasons(R) Seasoning Blend and honey. Stir to combine. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 10 minutes or until relish is thick. Remove grilled peach relish from heat and cool slightly. Stir in fresh basil. Transfer sauce to bowl. Cool; cover and refrigerate until needed. To prepare the sandwich, fry bacon according to package instructions until crisp. Pat dry with paper towel to remove excess fat and set aside. Heat grill to medium-high (about 450 degrees F). Place turkey filets in a large glass dish and season with Morton(R) Nature's Seasons(R) Seasoning Blend, turning to coat and gently pressing the spices into the meat to adhere. Place seasoned turkey filets onto grill and grill for 5 to 6 minutes, per side, turning once until fully cooked. (An instant read thermometer should read 175 degrees F). Remove turkey filets from grill and allow to cool slightly. To assemble the sandwich, lay submarine or torpedo bun, cut side up, onto a flat surface. Layer 2 slices of leaf lettuce, 3 to 4 slices of tomato, and 3 slices of bacon onto bottom bun. Thinly slice each grilled turkey filet and fan a sliced filet onto bottom bun. Top with 2 tablespoons of grilled peach relish and top of bun. Slice in half. Repeat with remaining buns and turkey filets. Serve with extra grilled peach relish.
