Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk mayonnaise, garlic, rosemary, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Spread mayonnaise mixture evenly over each piece of chicken. Spread rice out into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour water over rice. Place chicken pieces on top of rice and top with Parmesan cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 35 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
