Whisk together raspberry preserves, pineapple juice concentrate, soy sauce, and rice vinegar. Stir in chili powder, curry powder, and garlic powder; pour over chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag. Marinate chicken in refrigerator at least 4 hours to overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken into a baking dish, and pour remaining marinade overtop. Cover the dish with a lid or aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven until the chicken juices run clear, 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter and garnish with fresh raspberries.
