Heat the olive oil in a large stock pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the squash and potatoes to the onions and cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in the tomato, celery, carrots, and garbanzo beans with their liquid; cook for 5 minutes. Pour in the water and bring the soup to a boil, stirring occasionally. Stir in the hawaij and vegetable bouillon powder. Reduce heat and simmer until the vegetables are tender about 15 minutes. Season to taste.
