Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Flatten the center of each slice of bread using the back of a large spoon; do not flatten the crusts. Arrange bread in a single layer on foil-lined baking sheet. Bake 5 to 6 minutes or until lightly toasted. Spoon 1 tablespoon pizza sauce into the center of each slice of bread, spreading to cover the center area evenly. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon Parmesan over the sauce. Top with about 2 tablespoons shredded Mozzarella cheese. Bake 5 minutes or until cheese is melted.
