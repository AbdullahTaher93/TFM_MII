Mix apples, water, lemon juice, and agave nectar in a pot over medium heat; season with cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and black pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring frequently, and cook until the apples soften, about 15 minutes. Use a potato masher or a large fork to mash apples to desired consistency. Remove pot from heat and allow applesauce to cool. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until cold.
