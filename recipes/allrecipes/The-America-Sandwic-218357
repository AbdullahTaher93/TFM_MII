Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Cut a slit down the center of a loaf of bread, and use a spoon to scoop out the interior, leaving a pocket in the loaf. Line the pocket with 2 slices of processed cheese food. Divide the cooked bacon slices in 4, and stuff each bread loaf with 1/4 of the bacon. Place sliced roast beef and ham onto microwave-safe plates, and top slices with a pat of butter. Cook in microwave oven set on High until the butter has melted, about 30 seconds. Lightly stuff each loaf with 1/4 of the buttered meat slices. Top with sliced American cheese, and stuff a couple of pats of butter into the top of each loaf. Use remaining butter to spread over the outside of each loaf. Generously drizzle dollops of Dijon mustard and mayonnaise over the top of the stuffing. Place loaves on a baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven until the bread is toasted and the filling is hot and melted, about 30 minutes. Watch carefully to avoid burning bread. Heat the gravy to a simmer over low heat; remove sandwiches from oven, slice into serving portions, and top each serving with a generous helping of hot gravy.
