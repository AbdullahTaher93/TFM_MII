Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. In a blender or food processor, blend the diced tomatoes, fresh tomatoes, basil, garlic, olive oil, and pepper just until chunky. In a bowl, gently toss the cooked pasta and tomato mixture. Sprinkle lemon juice over the pasta and top with goat cheese just before serving.
