In 1-quart saucepan, stir together preserves, onion, water, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Heat over medium-high heat until mixture begins to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook 1 minute, stirring frequently. Remove from heat; set aside. Unroll crescent dough. Divide into 4 rectangles; press perforations to seal. Spread 1 tablespoon cream cheese over each rectangle, to within 1/2 inch of edge of 1 short end of rectangle. Stir vinegar into cooled chutney. Spread 1/4 of chutney (about 1 tablespoon) over cream cheese on each rectangle. Starting at short end covered with cream cheese, gently roll up each rectangle. Pinch seam to seal. Place rolls on cutting board or large plate; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 20 minutes for easier slicing. Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 cookie sheets with foil; spray foil with CRISCO(R) Original No-Stick Cooking Spray. Cut each roll into 8 slices, using serrated knife. Place on cookie sheets. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Immediately remove from cookie sheets. Serve warm.
