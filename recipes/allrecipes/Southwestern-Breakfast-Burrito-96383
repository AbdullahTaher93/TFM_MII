In 10-inch nonstick skillet cook sausage over medium heat for 12 to 15 minutes, turning occasionally, until lightly browned. Remove sausage from pan; drain. Cool sausages slightly; slice into inch pieces. In small bowl whisk together eggs, water and chili powder until well beaten. Add egg mixture to skillet; cook over low heat. Once egg begins to set top with sliced sausage, corn, black beans and green chiles. Using spatula, lift edges of eggs as they cook, letting uncooked part run underneath until egg is set. Top with cheese and cilantro. To serve spoon egg mixture into warmed tortillas. Roll up tortilla to enclose filling.
