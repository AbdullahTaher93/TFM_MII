Heat olive oil in a 10- to 12-inch nonstick ovenproof frying pan over medium-high heat; add onion and saute until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add potatoes, water, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook, gently stirring to keep bottom from burning, until potatoes are tender, about 10 to 12 minutes (test for desired doneness; may take longer depending on type of potato you use). Discard any remaining liquid in pan; set unwashed pan aside. Preheat broiler. In a large bowl, beat eggs to blend with remaining salt and pepper. Gently stir in potato mixture. Return unwashed frying pan to the stove over medium-high heat; when hot, pour in the potato mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until eggs begin to set and bottom is lightly browned (check by lifting omelet gently with a spatula), 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer pan to oven and broil omelet about 6 inches from heat until top is set, 3 to 5 minutes. Invert warm omelet onto a plate to remove from pan. Cut into narrow wedges. Serve warm or at room temperature.
