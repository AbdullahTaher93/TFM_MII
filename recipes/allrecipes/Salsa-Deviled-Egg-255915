Cut eggs in half lengthwise. Remove egg yolks; place yolks into bowl. Mash yolks with fork. Add 3 tablespoons salsa and sour cream; mix well. Spoon about 1 tablespoon egg yolk mixture into each egg white half. Top each with about 1/2 teaspoon salsa and garnish with cilantro, if desired. Cover and refrigerate until serving time or up to 24 hours.
