In a large bowl, toss together the cabbage, carrot, green pepper and onion. In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar and salt. Pour over the cabbage mixture, and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight. Place the bacon in a large deep skillet. Cook over medium heat until evenly browned, turning occasionally. Drain, cool and crumble. Toss crumbled bacon with salad just before serving.
