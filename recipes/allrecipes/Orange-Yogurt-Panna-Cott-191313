In a small bowl sprinkle gelatin over water and let stand 5 to 10 minutes. In a saucepan heat orange juice, peel and sugar until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and add gelatin mixture. Stir to blend. Whisk together yogurt and cream in a bowl. Slowly whisk in dissolved gelatin mixture. Divide mixture among 8 3/4-cup custard cups. Cover and chill at least 3 hours (or overnight). Cut around each panna cotta to loosen and invert onto a dessert plate. Serve with fresh berries.
