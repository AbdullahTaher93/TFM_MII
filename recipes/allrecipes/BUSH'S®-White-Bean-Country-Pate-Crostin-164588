Open the can of beans and drain off most liquid. Place the beans in a large mixing bowl and mash with a fork until you have a rough mixture. Heat the chopped sage in olive oil and add to the beans. Slowly add in the chicken stock, folding the mixture together without breaking up all of the beans. You will want most of the beans to remain whole, as shown in the accompanying photograph. Using a spoon, place a mound of bean paste on each of the crostini, leaving one end bare for guests to hold, as shown. Cut your Crostinis on an angle, as shown. Serve on a large platter.
