In a 2- to 3-quart pan, combine rhubarb, orange juice, and 2 tablespoons of the sugar. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until rhubarb is tender to bite, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. Meanwhile, in a large bowl with an electric mixer, beat eggs until blended. Add oil, remaining sugar, and vanilla; beat until thick and foamy. Drain rhubarb and add to batter along with zucchini; stir to mix well. In another bowl, mix flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, baking powder, and nuts. Stir into batter just until evenly moistened. Spoon batter equally into 2 greased and flour-dusted 5- by 9-inch loaf pans. Bake in a 350 degree F oven until a slender wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean and top feels firm when lightly touched, about 45 minutes. Let cool in pans for 10 minutes, then turn out on a rack to cool completely.
