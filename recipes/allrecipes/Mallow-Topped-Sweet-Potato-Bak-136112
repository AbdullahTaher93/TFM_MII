Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place 6 of the marshmallows, butter, cinnamon and salt in medium saucepan; cook on low heat until marshmallows are completely melted and mixture is well blended, stirring frequently. Place in large bowl of electric mixer. Add sweet potatoes; beat with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Spoon into lightly greased 1-1/2-quart baking dish; top with remaining marshmallows. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until sweet potato mixture is heated through and marshmallows are lightly browned.
