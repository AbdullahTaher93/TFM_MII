Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place pork in the skillet, and cook until evenly brown. Pour in the salsa, and continue cooking 5 minutes, until heated through. Place tortillas 1 or 2 at a time on a microwave-safe dish. Cook in the microwave 1 minute on High, until warm. Place equal amounts of pork strips and salsa in the center of each warm tortilla, and roll. Top with sour cream and garnish with green onions to serve.
