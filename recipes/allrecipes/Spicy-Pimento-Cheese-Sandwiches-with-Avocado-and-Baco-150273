Place bacon into a skillet over medium heat, and cook until crisp. Remove, and drain on paper towels. Place the cream cheese in a bowl, and beat until light and fluffy. Stir in the Cheddar cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, mayonnaise, salt, pepper, garlic powder, pimentos, onion, jalapeno, and cayenne pepper until well blended. Spread two bread slices with the cream cheese mixture. Top each slice with avocado and bacon, divided evenly. Top with two remaining bread slices to make a sandwich. Cut each sandwich in half to serve.
