Place chopped apples, lemon, and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until fruit is very soft and collapsed, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat. Strain through a fine sieve into a bowl to separate the liquid from the pulp and seeds. Press with the back of a wooden spoon or spatula to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard pulp and seeds. You should have about 1 1/2 cups pectin puree. A bit more or less will work fine. Place hulled strawberries in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until berries are pureed, about 1 minute. Transfer to a saucepan. Add strained pectin puree to strawberries. Stir in 1 cup sugar. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium; simmer for about 15 minutes. Skim off foam. Adjust heat, if necessary, to ensure mixture is always simmering without boiling over. Stir in remaining 1 1/4 cup sugar. Cook, stirring often, until mixture reaches 220 degrees F (105 degrees C), 50 to 60 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk in lemon juice. Ladle into sterilized canning jars while still hot. Allow to cool to room temperature uncovered. Cover and refrigerate 1 or 2 days before serving to allow sugar and pectin to thicken up the jam.
