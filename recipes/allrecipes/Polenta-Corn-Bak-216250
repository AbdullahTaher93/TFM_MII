Stir the Cheddar cheese and Parmesan cheese in a small bowl. Spread 1/2 cup sauce in the bottom of an 8-inch square shallow baking dish. Layer 4 slices polenta, 1/2 cup corn, 1/2 cup sauce and 3/4 cup cheese mixture in the baking dish. Repeat the layers. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes or until the polenta is golden brown and the cheese is melted. Sprinkle with the parsley. Heat the remaining sauce in a 1-quart saucepan over medium-high heat until hot and bubbling, stirring occasionally. Serve the sauce with the polenta.
