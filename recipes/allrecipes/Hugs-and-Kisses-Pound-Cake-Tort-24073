Remove wrappers from chocolate pieces. Combine 46 chocolate pieces and 1/3 cup whipping cream in small saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until smooth. Remove from heat. Stir in butter and vanilla until smooth; transfer to medium bowl. Refrigerate until firm enough to spread, about 1 hour. Slice cake horizontally to make 3 layers. Arrange bottom layer on serving plate. Evenly spread 1/3 cup KISSES filling over layer; top with second layer and spread with 1/3 cup filling. Place remaining layer on top. Beat 1/2 cup whipping cream until thickened; fold in remaining filling. Refrigerate a few minutes if a more firm consistency is desired. Frost top, sides and ends of torte. Refrigerate about 6 hours. Remove wrappers from remaining chocolates. Garnish torte before serving. Cover; refrigerate leftover torte.
