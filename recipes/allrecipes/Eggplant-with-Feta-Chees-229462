Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Brush eggplant slices on one side with olive oil; arrange onto a baking sheet with oiled side facing up. Cook eggplant under broiler until lightly browned, about 5 minutes; remove from oven. Turn oven heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Turn slices and brush other side with olive oil. Sprinkle feta cheese over eggplant. Bake until the cheese is bubbly and the eggplant is soft, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle basil over the eggplant slices and serve hot.
