Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Mix dressing and flour in medium saucepan with wire whisk until well blended. Gradually add milk, stirring until well blended. Cook and stir on medium heat until sauce comes to a boil and thickens. Stir in half of the cheese. Reserve 1 cup of the prepared sauce. Add chicken, salsa and parsley to remaining sauce; stir until well blended. Spoon 1/3 cup of the sauce mixture down center of each tortilla; roll up. Place 8 of the roll-ups, seam sides down, in each of two (11x8-inch) baking dishes; top evenly with reserved sauce and remaining cheese. Bake 25 min.
