Cook bacon in a large pot over medium heat until browned and crisp; drain on paper towels and crumble when cool enough to handle. Reserve 2 tablespoons bacon drippings. Saute chicken, onion, bell pepper and garlic in hot bacon drippings; cook 3 to 5 minutes until chicken is no longer pink and onion begins to soften. Add chicken broth, frozen corn and cream-style corn. Combine corn starch with milk and stir into soup. Heat to boiling over medium heat, stirring constantly; reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes. Add salt, pepper and cheese; stir until cheese is melted. Ladle soup into bowls; sprinkle bacon over individual servings.
