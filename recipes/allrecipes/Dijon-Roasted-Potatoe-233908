Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a roasting pan. Stir olive oil, Dijon mustard, garlic, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; add potatoes and toss to coat. Transfer potatoes to prepared roasting pan. Roast in preheated oven, turning occasionally, until tender in the middle, 40 to 45 minutes.
