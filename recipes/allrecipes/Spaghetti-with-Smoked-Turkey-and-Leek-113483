In a large frying pan, melt the butter over moderate heat. Add the leeks and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the leeks are tender, about 10 minutes. Add the broth, increase the heat to moderately high, and simmer until the liquid is reduced to about 1/4 cup. Stir in the cream and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat and simmer until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the turkey, parsley, and pepper. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the spaghetti until just done, about 12 minutes. Drain and toss with the sauce.
