Mix ground chicken, bread crumbs, egg, and wing sauce together in a large bowl. Add enough water to the chicken mixture so it is a little sticky; shape into patties about 3 inches in diameter. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties in hot skillet until burgers are hot and no longer pink in the middle, about 4 minutes per side. Serve on buns.
