In a medium bowl, combine JIF(R), water, ketchup, soy sauce, garlic powder, and vinegar. Whisk until smooth and well blended. Set aside. Cook the pasta twists according to the package directions. Drain well. Put the drained pasta back in the pot it was cooked in and add the sauce. Gently toss until the pasta twists are evenly coated. Serve and sprinkle with the red bell pepper. Enjoy!
