Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat an 8x8 inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Place shrimp in the work bowl of a food processor; pulse until shrimp forms a thick paste. Mix eggs, mayonnaise, mustard, hot pepper sauce, seafood seasoning, dried tarragon, and salt and pepper in a large bowl. Stir in shrimp; carefully fold in crab. Spoon into prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned and heated through, about 30 minutes.
