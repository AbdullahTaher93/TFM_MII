Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with olive oil. Stir seasoned salt into crackers in a bowl. Pour ranch dressing in a separate bowl. Dip chicken chunks into ranch dressing and press into cracker mixture until coated. Spread chicken in prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes.
