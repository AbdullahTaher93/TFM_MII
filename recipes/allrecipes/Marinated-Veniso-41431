Pound venison flat, and cut into 1 inch strips; place in a large bowl. Pour in Worcestershire sauce and beer. Cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour or more. In a shallow bowl, combine flour, onion salt and garlic powder. Drag soaked meat through the flour mixture. Heat oil in a large heavy skillet, and fry meat until golden brown.
