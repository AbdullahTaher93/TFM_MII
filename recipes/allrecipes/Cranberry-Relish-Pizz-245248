Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Unroll crescent roll dough triangles and overlap slightly on a baking sheet, pinching the seams to join. Sprinkle lightly with sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Set aside until completely cool. Chop cranberries, orange pieces, and walnuts in a food processor; sprinkle in sugar. Beat cream cheese, yogurt, honey, lemon juice, and vanilla extract in a large bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy. Spread cream cheese mixture evenly over the crust; smooth cranberry mixture on top. Cover with plastic wrap and chill until the cream cheese layer is firmer, about 30 minutes.
