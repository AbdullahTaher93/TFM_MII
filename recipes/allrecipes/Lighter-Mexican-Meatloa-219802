Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. In a large bowl, mix together the ground turkey, ground chicken, black beans, corn, green chiles, salsa, taco seasoning, bread crumbs, and egg whites until thoroughly combined. Form the mixture into a loaf shape and place into the prepared baking dish. Pour half the enchilada sauce over the meatloaf. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove from oven and pour the remaining sauce over the loaf. Return to oven and cook until the meatloaf is no longer pink inside and the juices run clear, another 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the meat loaf should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Slice and serve with pan sauce spooned over the slices.
