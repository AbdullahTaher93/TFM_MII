Drain pineapple, reserving juice. Cut pineapple slices in half if desired; place on top of loaf. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 45 minutes longer or until lightly browned and a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), basting occasionally with pan drippings. For sauce, combine the sugar, cornstarch, salt and water in a saucepan; stir until smooth. Add the raisins. bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat; stir in butter and vanilla. Serve warm with ham loaf. Garnish with a cherry if desired.
