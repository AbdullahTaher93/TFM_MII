Separate cornbread dough into 8 sticks, pinching short ends together to seal. Roll or press each piece into 14-inch rope. Insert wooden sticks lengthwise into wieners, leaving 1 inch of each stick exposed. Wrap each cornbread rope in spiral fashion around each wiener, pressing ends of dough to seal. Wrap 1 or 2 bacon slices in spiral fashion around each cornbread-covered wiener; press bacon into cornbread. Place on cookie sheet sprayed with no stick cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes or until cornbread is golden brown. Serve with catsup, KRAFT Pure Prepared Mustard or honey.
