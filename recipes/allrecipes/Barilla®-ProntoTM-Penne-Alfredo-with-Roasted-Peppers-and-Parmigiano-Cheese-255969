POUR the whole box of pasta into a large skillet (approximately 12 inches in diameter). POUR 3 cups of cold water into the skillet, ensuring that the liquid covers the pasta. Turn on the burner to high, then set your timer for 10 minutes. Optional: add about 1/2 teaspoon of salt to taste. COOK on high, stirring occasionally, until 3/4 of the liquid has evaporated. ADD Alfredo sauce and continue to cook for approximately 2 minutes. ADD roasted red peppers and let them heat through. REMOVE skillet from the heat and garnish with parsley and cheese, serve immediately.
