In a large pot over medium heat, cook ground beef until evenly brown. Stir in onions, and saute until soft and translucent. Season with chili powder, and cook for about 2 minutes. Add potatoes, carrots, hominy, tomatoes and chilies. Pour in beef broth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Reduce heat, and simmer 2 hours, or until potatoes and carrots are tender.
