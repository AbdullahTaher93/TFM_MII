Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place pork chops in the skillet, and top with garlic and onion. Sprinkle with seasoned salt. Cook chops 5 minutes on each side, or until done. Drain grease, and transfer chops to the prepared baking dish. Top each chop with a tomato slice and 2 slices cheese. Cover and bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Garnish with parsley to serve.
