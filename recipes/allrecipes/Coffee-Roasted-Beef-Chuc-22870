In a large pot, heat the butter and oil over medium/high heat. Place the roast in the pot and sear it on all sides until well browned. Remove the roast and set aside. In the same pot, saute the onions for 5 minutes, scraping loose the brown roast bits on the bottom of the pot. Add the garlic and pepper and saute for 1 minute. Return the meat to the pot and pour in the coffee and add the mushrooms. Over high heat, bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 hours, turning the meat over halfway through the cooking time. A slow cooker may be used for cooking the roast, if desired. To make the gravy: When the roast is done, remove it from the pot. Take 1/2 cup of the coffee sauce mixture from the pot and stir in the cornstarch to make a slurry. Mix well. Return the slurry to the pot, stirring until the sauce thickens slightly. Stir in the sour cream then salt to taste.
