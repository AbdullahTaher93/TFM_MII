Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together pecans, sugar, and flour. Stir in melted butter or margarine. Reserve 1/2 of the mixture for topping the pie, then press the rest evenly into a 9 inch pie pan. Bake in preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until golden brown. Allow crust to cool before filling.
