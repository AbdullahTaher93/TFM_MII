Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and poultry seasoning and cook for 5 minutes. Add the broth, water, and tomatoes (with juice) and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the chicken, green beans, cabbage, pasta, sage, pepper, and salt. Simmer, covered, for 8 minutes, or until the vegetables and pasta are tender.
