In medium microwave-safe bowl, melt chocolate chips on high for 1 minute. Stir and return to microwave for 10 seconds at a time, until they are melted and smooth. Stir frosting into chocolate. Refrigerate 10 to 15 minutes or until just stiff enough to shape. If mixture is too hard, let it stand at room temperature until softened. Roll fudge into 1-inch balls. Roll each in desired topping. Wrap each truffle in a 4-inch square of cellophane. Tie with a ribbon. If desired hang with an ornament hook.
