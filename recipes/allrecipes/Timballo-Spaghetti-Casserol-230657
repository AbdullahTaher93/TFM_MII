Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread olive oil into the bottom of a cast-iron skillet or large baking dish. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Stir spaghetti, marinara sauce, diced chicken, onion, pepperoni, green pepper, mushroom pieces, and black olives together in a large bowl; transfer into the prepared cast-iron skillet. Top with mozzarella cheese in a layer and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling, chicken is cooked through, and the cheese topping is lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
