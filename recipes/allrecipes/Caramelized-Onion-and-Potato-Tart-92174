Peel potato and, using a vegetable slicer or a mandoline, cut lengthwise into even slices no more than 1/16 inch thick; they must be flexible enough to bend without breaking. Bring about 2 quarts water to a boil in a 5- to 6-quart pan. Add potato, stir to separate slices, and cook about 1 minute. Drain potato and immerse in cold water, rubbing gently to separate slices and remove sticky starch coating. Drain and immerse again in cold water to keep pieces from sticking. Put onions, broth, and cream in pan. Place over high heat, cover, and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat and simmer until onions are limp, about 7 minutes, stirring often. Uncover, turn heat to high, and stir often until onions are golden brown and taste sweet, about 20 minutes. If mixture sticks to pan, add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and stir to release browned bits. Meanwhile, melt butter. Brush interiors of 6 ramekins or souffle cups (2/3-cup size) generously with melted butter. Drain potato. Line ramekins equally with the largest potato slices, overlapping to cover container interiors, with ends of potato slices extending over ramekin rims by at least 1 1/2 inches. Mix onions with parsley, pepper, and salt to taste. Spoon mixture equally into potato-lined ramekins. Fold extended edges of potatoes over filling and pat level. Brush tops with remaining melted butter. Bake in a 375 degrees F oven until potato slices are well browned, 40 to 50 minutes (45 to 55 minutes if chilled). Run a knife between tarts and sides of ramekins; invert tarts onto plates.
