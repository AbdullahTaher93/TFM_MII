Heat sugar and water together in a small saucepan. Cook sugar over medium heat until the mixture starts to caramelize (turning a deep golden brown), about 15 to 17 minutes. Do not stir until the sugar starts to brown. Carefully stir the sugar until the desired color is reached. Pour caramel into a 1 quart baking dish. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix eggs, LACTAID(R) Milk, condensed milk, cream cheese, and vanilla in a food processor or blender. Pour mixture into pan with caramel. Place the flan dish into a larger baking dish. Make a water bath by pouring enough warm water into the larger pan so that the water is at least 1 1/2 inches deep. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes. Remove from water bath and chill in the refrigerator for a minimum of three hours or until cool. Flan is best when served the day after it is made. Run knife around the edge of the pan to loosen. Place serving plate on top of pan. Hold firmly and flip pan over. Remove pan and scrape any remaining caramel sauce onto flan. Flan should have loosened and dropped down onto the serving plate. Slice and serve or refrigerate until ready to serve.
