Bring the water to a boil in a saucepan with the chicken bouillon and the butter; pour over the couscous in a large bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the couscous to absorb the moisture entirely, 5 to 7 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Set aside. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Cook the red, yellow, and orange bell pepper with onion in the hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes; season with the garlic powder. Add the chicken to the skillet and continue cooking until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes. Stir the couscous, tomatoes, black beans, and white wine into the mixture; continue cooking and stirring until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Top with the cheese to serve.
