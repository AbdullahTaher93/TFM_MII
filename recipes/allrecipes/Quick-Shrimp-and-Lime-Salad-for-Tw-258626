Marinate shrimp in 3 tablespoons of lime juice in a bowl, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard lime juice. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir shrimp until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 3 minutes per side. Combine 1/4 cup olive oil with 1 tablespoon lime juice in a bowl. Add onion, olives, garlic, pepper, and salt; stir dressing to combine. Divide greens, shrimp, avocados, tomatoes, and dressing between 2 large bowls; toss lightly.
