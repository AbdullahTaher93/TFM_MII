Set a vegetable steamer in a medium saucepan. Fill with water to just below the steamer. Place the potatoes on the steamer. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-high. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until tender. Transfer to a large bowl and allow to cool for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium nonstick skillet set over medium heat, cook the bacon for 3 minutes. Add the onion and garlic. Cook, stirring, for 3 minutes, or until the onion is soft and the bacon is crisp. Reduce the heat to low. Add the vinegar, apple juice, mustard, parsley, and salt. Cook for 2 minutes, or until heated through. Pour over the potatoes. Toss to evenly coat.
