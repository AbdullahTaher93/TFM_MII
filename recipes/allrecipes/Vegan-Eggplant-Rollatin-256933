Place cashews in a large bowl and cover with water; let soak for 7 hours. Drain. Combine cashews, red wine vinegar, miso, sugar, and salt in a high-speed blender; blend until mixture is thick and creamy. Combine basil leaves, walnuts, 1/4 cup olive oil, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, and garlic in a food processor; blend until pesto is smooth. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Toss eggplant with 1 1/2 tablespoon oil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Arrange eggplant on the baking sheet. Broil eggplant until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread 3/4 cup marinara sauce in the bottom of a baking dish. Place 1 tablespoon cashew mixture and 1 tablespoon pesto on the end of an eggplant slice; roll up. Place seam-side down in the sauce. Repeat with remaining cashew mixture, pesto, and eggplant slices. Dot the eggplant with remaining marinara sauce. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is heated through, about 10 minutes.
