Rinse fish and pat dry. Mix the pepper, onion salt and paprika. Sprinkle herbs over both sides of fillets. Lightly pat to be sure herbs stick to the fish. In a large nonstick skillet, melt 1/2 of the butter over medium-high heat. Add fillets and saute for 1-2 minutes then turn over. Fish should be cook for a total of about 4 minutes per 1/2 inch thickness (at the thickest part). Transfer fish to a platter and cover. Pour off any liquids from the skillet. Add remaining butter and shallots. Heat until shallots are starting to soften (about 1 minute). Add vinegar to deglaze pan. Add fresh tarragon, stir. Add cream and heat through. Return fish to skillet for just a minute. Then transfer back to the platter and pour the sauce over the fish.
