Spread 2 tablespoons butter over both sides of bread. Place on a baking sheet; bake at 400 degrees F for about 3 minutes on each side or until lightly toasted. Cut into 1-in. cubes. Reduce heat to 350*. In a skillet, saute green pepper, onion and garlic in remaining butter until tender. In a large bowl, lightly beat the eggs. Stir in bread cubes, vegetable mixture, bacon, sugar, salt, oregano and pepper. Transfer to a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Cut each tomato into four thick slices; arrange over the top. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
