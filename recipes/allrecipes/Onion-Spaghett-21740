Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook onions and garlic in oil until soft. Stir in tomato paste, tomatoes, salt, pepper, basil and water. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 20 minutes, until thickened. While sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Toss sauce with hot pasta.
