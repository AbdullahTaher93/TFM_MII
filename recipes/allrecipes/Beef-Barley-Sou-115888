Heat butter and oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Season beef with salt and pepper. Sear meat in two batches on all sides until well browned, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove meat with a slotted spoon, and set aside. Add onions, and cook, stirring constantly, until well caramelized, about 5 to 7 minutes. Return meat to pot, and add stock. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for 1 hour. Add bouquet garni, barley, and vegetables, and simmer for 1 hour, adding more stock if necessary. Adjust seasonings.
