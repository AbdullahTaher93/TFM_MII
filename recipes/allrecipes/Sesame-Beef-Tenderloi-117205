In a large resealable bag, combine the first five ingredients. Add tenderloin; seal bag and turn to coat. Refrigerate for 2 hours, turning several times. Drain and discard marinade. Brush the beef with honey; sprinkle with sesame seeds. Place in a shallow roasting pan. Bake at 400 degrees F for 25 minutes. Cover with foil. Bake 30-35 minutes longer or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F). Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
