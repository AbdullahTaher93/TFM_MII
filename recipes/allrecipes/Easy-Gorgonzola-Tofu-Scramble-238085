Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir tofu, onion, and garlic until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook and stir until mushrooms are tender and tofu is lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. Mix spinach and Gorgonzola cheese into tofu mixture until spinach begins to wilt and the cheese melts from the heat of the tofu mixture.
