Preheat your oven's broiler. Combine the lunch meat, eggs, cheese and onion in a food processor, or run them through a grinder. Once everything is minced, stir in enough of the mayonnaise to hold it together. Spoon equal amounts of the mixture onto open buns, and place two pieces of bacon on top of each one. Broil a few inches from the heat for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the bacon is crisp. Watch carefully so the burgers do not burn.
