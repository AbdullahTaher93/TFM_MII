In a saucepan, cook the apricots and water over low heat for 45 minutes or until the water is absorbed and apricots are soft. Cool sightly; transfer to a blender or food processor. Cover and process until smooth. Add sugar; cover and process until blended. Set aside. In a large saucepan over low heat, melt shortening and milk. Remove from the heat; stir in sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, whisking well after each addition. Stir in extract. Combine flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to the saucepan. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or until easy to handle. On a lightly floured surface, roll out to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut with a 3-in. round cookie cutter dipped in flour. Place 1 teaspoon apricot filling in the center of each. Bring three edges together over filling, overlapping slightly (a small portion of filling will show in the center); pinch edges gently. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 400 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks to cool.
