Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a jelly roll pan. Beat pumpkin puree, egg, butter, honey, and molasses together in a large bowl. Stir rolled oats, sunflower seeds, wheat germ, coconut, ground flax, orange zest, and cinnamon into the pumpkin mixture; spread into the prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 40 minutes. Cut into bars while still warm.
