Whisk together yogurt, ginger, garlic, lime juice, lime zest, honey, oil, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Place salmon in a shallow glass dish and pour the marinade over it, turning the salmon to coat on all sides. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes, turning once or twice. Meanwhile, prepare a charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill. (Do not use a grill pan--salmon will stick.) Make Watercress & Pickled Ginger Salad: Mash garlic with salt with the side of a chefs knife. Place in a small bowl or a jar with a tight-fitting lid. Add ginger liquid, lime juice (or vinegar), oil, honey and pepper; whisk or shake until blended. Place watercress, scallions and pickled ginger in a large bowl. Chill until just before serving. Oil the grill rack (see tip). Place the salmon, skin-side up, on the grill. Cook for 5 minutes. Using 2 metal spatulas, carefully turn the salmon pieces over and cook just until opaque in the center, 4 to 6 minutes longer. Remove the salmon from the grill. Slip off the skin. Just before serving, toss Watercress & Pickled Ginger Salad with dressing and divide among 4 plates. Top with a piece of grilled salmon. Garnish with lime wedges. Serve immediately.
