Combine orange juice, lemon juice, honey, soy sauce, oil, dry mustard, orange peel, and lemon peel in a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan. Bring to a boil over high heat; then boil, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until mixture is reduced to about 1/2 cup Meanwhile, rinse chicken and pat dry. Place chicken on a lightly oiled rack in a foil-lined 12- by 15-inch broiler pan. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Bake chicken in a 400 degrees F oven for 10 minutes. After chicken has baked 10 minutes, brush equally with reduced citrus mixture. Continue baking until chicken is no longer pink in thickest part (cut to test), about 15 minutes more. Transfer chicken to individual plates; spoon any glaze in pan over chicken and serve.
