Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut a thin slice off the top of each tomato, and gently scoop out pulp and seeds, leaving a 1/2 inch wall. Finely dice 1/2 cup of the pulp and set aside. Season the inside of each hollowed tomato with pinches of salt and pepper. Mix reserved diced tomato pulp, goat cheese, mascarpone cheese, tuna, red onion, cucumber, mushrooms, red pepper, celery, garlic, and sesame seeds in a large bowl. Scoop mixture into tomato shells up to the top of each tomato. Place on a foil-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle each tomato with sunflower seeds, Parmesan cheese, garlic salt, onion powder, salt, and pepper. If desired, sprinkle each tomato with parsley flakes and Worcestershire sauce. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes, then broil right before serving until tops are lightly browned, about 1 to 2 minutes.
