Brush mushrooms and onion slices with oil; sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper. Heat large skillet or grill pan over medium heat until hot. Add mushrooms; cook until tender, 8 to 10 minutes, turning once. Transfer mushrooms to plate, cavity side up; cover to keep warm. In same skillet, cook onion slices until golden, about 8 minutes, turning occasionally. Meanwhile, combine in small bowl, 1/2 of the Avocado, yogurt, garlic and remaining 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper; mash until smooth. Spoon onions and roasted peppers into mushroom cavities, divided equally. Spread smooth Avocado mixture on bottom of each bun; top each with stuffed mushrooms. Top with remaining sliced Avocado. Cover with tops of buns.
