Slice polenta into twelve 1/2-inch-thick slices. Cut each slice into half circles to make 24 pieces. Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add polenta pieces; cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until light golden brown. Turn polenta pieces over; reduce heat to low. Top each piece with 1 heaping teaspoon bruschetta and 1/2 teaspoon cheese. Cover; cook for 1 minute or until cheese begins to melt. Arrange on serving platter or individual plates. Top with oregano leaves.
