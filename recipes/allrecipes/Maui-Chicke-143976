Combine the chicken, soy sauce, and 1 can of pineapple tidbits with juice in a bowl. Allow chicken to marinate for 20 minutes. Remove the chicken from the marinade; strain the marinade in a colander, reserving the juice. Discard the pineapple. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the red bell pepper, orange bell pepper, mushrooms, garlic, and ginger. Cook and stir the vegetable mixture until the garlic is fragrant and the peppers begin to soften. Stir in the chicken and cook until the juices from the chicken run clear, about 15 minutes. Pour in the reserved chicken marinade, 1 can of pineapple tidbits with juice, black bean sauce, and crushed red pepper; season with salt and pepper; simmer 5 minutes.
