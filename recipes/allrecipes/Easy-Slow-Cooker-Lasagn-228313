Mix diced tomatoes, garlic, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a bowl. Mix ricotta cheese, parsley, Parmesan cheese, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a separate bowl. Spoon about 1/3 the tomato mixture into the bottom of a slow cooker. Top with a single layer of lasagna noodles, breaking them as needed to fit the shape of the crock. Layer about half the Swiss chard atop the noodles. Dollop about 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture atop the chard and spread another 1/3 the tomato mixture over the ricotta. Sprinkle about 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese over the tomato mixture. Repeat layering of lasagna noodles, Swiss chard, ricotta mixture, tomato mixture, and mozzarella cheese, respectively. Cook on Low until the lasagna noodles are tender, 2 to 3 hours.
