Mix together shortening and confectioner's sugar and water. Stir in flour, salt, vanilla and almonds. Mix well. Form dough with hands into 3 inch lengths about pencil thin. Bake on ungreased sheet in a preheated 300 degrees F oven (150 degrees C) for 20 minutes. While cookies cool, melt chocolate chips in a double boiler or in a bowl in the microwave. When cookies are completely cool, dip one half in melted chocolate.
