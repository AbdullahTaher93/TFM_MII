Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat. Add beef and cook 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until very brown. Stir in remaining ingredients. Simmer, uncovered, 1 hour, stirring occasionally, or until beef is tender. Ladle chili into bowls and top with sour cream and shredded Cheddar cheese, if you like.
