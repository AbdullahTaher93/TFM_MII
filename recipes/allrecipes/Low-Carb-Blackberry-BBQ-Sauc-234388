Pour blackberries into a saucepan and cook over medium heat until they begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir ketchup, tomato sauce, brown sugar replacement, garlic, ginger, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper into the blackberries; cook at a simmer until blackberries are completely tender, about 20 minutes. Pour sauce into a blender no more than half full. Put lid on blender and hold in place with a towel. Pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth.
