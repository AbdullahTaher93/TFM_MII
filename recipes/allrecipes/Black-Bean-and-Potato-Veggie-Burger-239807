Mash potatoes and black beans together in a large bowl, removing any large pieces of potato skin if desired. Mix onion, carrot, green pepper, mushrooms, and garlic into potato mixture with a fork, mashing until well-mixed. Stir Worcestershire sauce, cumin, chili powder, hot sauce, salt, and black pepper into potato mixture. Form mixture into 8 patties. Working in batches, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties in hot oil until golden and set on the bottom, 4 to 5 minutes; flip each burger and cook until golden and hot throughout, about 4 minutes more.
