Combine strawberry preserves and water in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until warm, about 10 seconds. Stir in mango. Mix cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sugar together in a bowl until creamy and blended. Stir in pineapple and coconut. Tear crepe gently in half. Lay halves on a flat work surface with cut sides facing away from you. Spoon half of the cottage cheese mixture into the center of each half; fold in sides, top, and bottom like an envelope. Place seam-side down on a plate. Microwave preserves mixture to reheat, about 20 seconds. Stir and spoon over filled crepes.
