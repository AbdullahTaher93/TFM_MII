Grind nutmeg and cloves into a fine powder in a blender, 2 to 3 minutes. Add onions, chile peppers, macadamia nuts, garlic, ginger, galangal, and turmeric; blend into a smooth paste, thinning slightly with water if needed. Place beef in a 12-inch skillet or wok. Mix in paste and coat beef thoroughly. Add coconut milk, lemongrass knots, cinnamon, lime leaves, cardamom, and star anise to form a sauce. Bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered, stirring with a spatula every 15 minutes, until sauce has reduced and thickened, about 1 hour. Continue cooking, stirring frequently to prevent sticking and scorching, until sauce turns a dark caramel color and coats the beef, about 2 hours. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand, about 30 minutes. Discard lemongrass, cinnamon stick, lime leaves, cardamom, and star anise before serving.
