Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan. Whisk pumpkin puree, milk, eggs, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, salt, and cloves together in a bowl; pour into the prepared pan. Drizzle butter on top. Sprinkle cake mix over butter and top with pecans. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 1 hour.
