Using an electric mixer, beat the eggnog, vanilla, chai powder and brandy. On a small plate, stir together the brown sugar and the 1 1/2 teaspoons water. Place the crushed gingersnaps on another small plate. Coat the rims of four rocks glasses with the brown-sugar syrup, then the gingersnap crumbs. Fill the glasses with the chai eggnog.
