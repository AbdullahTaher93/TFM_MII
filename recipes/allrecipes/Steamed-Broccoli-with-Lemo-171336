Peel broccoli stems with a small knife or vegetable peeler. Cut broccoli lengthwise into pieces about 2 inches wide. Pour 1/2 inch water into a medium saucepan and add broccoli. Cover pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer just until broccoli is tender-crisp to the bite, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain broccoli and return to pan. Gently mix in lemon zest and butter until butter melts. Add salt and pepper, if you like. Spoon broccoli into a serving dish.
