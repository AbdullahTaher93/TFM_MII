Heat the oil in a large saucepot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the lamb and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until browned. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the broth, water, barley, thyme, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 hour. Add the carrots, mushrooms, and tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, for 45 minutes, or until the barley is tender. Add the peas during the last 5 minutes.
