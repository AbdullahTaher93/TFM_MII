Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Combine the ginger, chili powder, cinnamon, turmeric, and pepper; stir into the hot oil and cook for 5 seconds. Add the onion and garlic; stir and cook until onions become transparent, about 7 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and chicken, and cook until chicken is no longer pink, 5 to 8 minutes. Combine the chicken stock with the chicken-onion mixture; stir and cook 3 minutes. Stir in the almonds, cream, and yogurt; continue cooking 2 to 4 minutes.
