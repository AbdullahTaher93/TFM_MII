Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. In a stockpot or large saucepan, combine the water, cabbage, carrot, potatoes, celery and green beans. Bring to a boil and let simmer for 20 minutes. Stir together the milk and flour, pour into the soup and mix well. Simmer for another half an hour or until thick. Serve warm with biscuits.
