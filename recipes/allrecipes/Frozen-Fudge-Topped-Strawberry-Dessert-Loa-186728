Line 9x5x3-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving 2-inch overhang on all sides. Tear half the cake into 1-inch pieces. (Reserve remaining cake for another use.) Fold cake into softened ice cream just until barely mixed. Immediately spoon into loaf pan. Fold overhanging plastic wrap over loaf and freeze 3 hours or until ready to serve. Use plastic wrap to lift loaf from pan. Slice into 1/2-inch thick slices. Serve topped with fresh berries and fudge sauce.
