Place black-eyed peas into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain and set aside. Cook pork necks and bacon in a Dutch oven over medium heat until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in onion, celery, and carrot; cook and stir until softened, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook 1 minute. Pour cold water and black-eyed peas into pork mixture; increase heat to high. Stir in bay leaf, thyme, cumin, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Bring mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and salt. Simmer uncovered until beans are tender, about 40 minutes. Remove neck bones from mixture; separate any meat from bones, return meat to Dutch oven, and discard bones. Stir in diced ham and kale; cook until greens are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve over rice.
