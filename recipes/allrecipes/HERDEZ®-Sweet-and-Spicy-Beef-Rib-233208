Place broth in a large pot; add beef ribs and onion. Pour in enough water to cover beef. Bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until the meat pulls away from the bones, 3 to 4 hours. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Remove beef ribs from broth mixture and place in a baking dish. Mix cooking sauce and brown sugar in a bowl; pour over meat. Bake in the preheated oven until beef and sauce are hot, about 15 minutes. Serve sprinkled with chopped cilantro to garnish.
