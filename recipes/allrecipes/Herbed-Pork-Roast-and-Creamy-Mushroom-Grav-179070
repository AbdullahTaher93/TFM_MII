Stir together the rosemary, parsley, thyme and garlic in a small bowl. Cut small slits into the surface of the roast with a knife. Stuff the herb mixture into the slits. Place the roast in a roasting pan. Bake at 325 degrees F for 1 hour 30 minutes or until cooked through but slightly pink in center. Remove the roast from the pan and let stand 10 minutes. Stir the soup into the pan drippings in the roasting pan. Gradually stir in the water. Cook and stir over medium heat until the mixture is hot and bubbly. Serve the pork with the gravy.
