Bring water and bouillon to a boil in a saucepan. Add quinoa, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Transfer quinoa to a bowl and cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir spinach into quinoa and refrigerate until completely cooled, at least 30 minutes. Whisk almond oil, olive oil, vinegar, thyme, basil, garlic, and salt together in a bowl until dressing is smooth. Stir tomatoes, 1/2 of the feta cheese, and dressing into cooled quinoa until evenly coated; top with remaining feta cheese and ground black pepper.
