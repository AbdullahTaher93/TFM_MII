Preheat oven to 450 degrees. With a food processor or knife, finely chop mushrooms. Put mushrooms and butter in a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat. Cover and stir occasionally until juicy, about 3 minutes. Uncover and stir often over high heat until mushrooms are lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Add broth and couscous to mushrooms; stir, cover tightly, and remove from heat. Let stand until couscous is tender to bite and liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Stir couscous and season to taste with salt. While couscous stands, in a bowl with a mixer on high speed, whip cream until it holds soft peaks. When couscous mixture is ready, spoon it equally into 4 lightly buttered ramekins (about 3 inches wide and 2 inches deep). Spoon cream equally over couscous. Break 2 eggs onto cream in each ramekin, then sprinkle equally with cheese. If desired, sprinkle nutmeg lightly over cheese. Set ramekins slightly apart in a rimmed and foil-lined baking pan (9 by 13 inches or 10 by 15 inches). Bake until yolks are softly set (press gently with the tip of a spoon to test), 12 to 14 minutes, or until firm, 16 to 20 minutes. Eat with spoons; add salt to taste.
