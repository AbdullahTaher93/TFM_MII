Combine the tapioca and skim milk and refrigerate overnight. About 4 hours before serving, in a medium saucepan over low heat, combine the soaked tapioca and its milk with the coconut milk, whole milk, 1/3 cup of sugar, the lemongrass, cinnamon stick, vanilla and ginger. Cook, stirring often, until translucent and soft, about 45 minutes. Add sugar to taste and chill for at least 3 hours. Remove the lemongrass, cinnamon and ginger, and serve the pudding on spoons topped with the mango, kiwi and peanuts.
