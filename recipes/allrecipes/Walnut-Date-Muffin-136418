Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a 12-cup standard muffin tin with paper liners. In a large bowl, whisk together the flours, brown sugar, pumpkin-pie spice, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl combine milk, molasses, oil, and eggs; stir into dry ingredients, mixing just until moistened. Fold in walnuts and dates. Divide batter evenly among muffin cups. Bake until a toothpick inserted in center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 23 minutes. Cool 5 minutes in pan, and then remove and cool to room temperature.
