Cook noodles as directed on package. Heat oil in wok or large skillet on medium-high heat. Add egg, cook and stir 30 seconds (egg will not be fully cooked). Stir in cooked noodles and remaining ingredients, except bean sprouts. Cook and stir until most of the liquid has been absorbed by the noodles, about 1 minute. Stir in bean sprouts. Serve with crushed peanuts, sliced green onions and lime wedges, if desired.
