Prepare grill to medium heat. Lightly season chicken breasts with chili powder; salt and pepper to taste. Place chicken on grill; grill, turning once, 15-20 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 170 degrees F on an instant read thermometer. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine remaining ingredients. Generously brush both sides of chicken with salsa mixture in the last 5 minutes of grilling.
