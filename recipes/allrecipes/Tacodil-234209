Cook taco shells according to package instructions. Spread refried beans inside the top and bottom part of one taco shell. This will be to hold the onions in place for the teeth. Fill taco shell with 1/4 cup cooked taco meat and top with 1/2 cup shredded lettuce and 1/2 of the tomatoes. Stick onions into the refried beans to form the tacodile teeth. Place sour cream in a pastry bag or plastic sandwich bag with the end cut off and squirt sour cream in between the onion teeth. Spread a small amount of refried beans on top of the taco shell and stick the olive slice in to form the eye. This will complete the formation of the tacodile face. Fill the second taco shell with the rest of the taco meat, shredded lettuce and tomatoes. This forms the tacodile body. Create the complete tacodile by propping the tacodile face, lying flat, on a folded paper napkin. Place the taco body behind the face, holding it up with two red mini peppers on each side. These act as the two back legs. Place the green poblano pepper in the back of the taco body for the tail. Put last two peppers on the sides of the face taco to act as the two front legs.
