Combine the water, pineapple juice, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce and brown sugar in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil. Stir in the lemon juice, coconut, onion, pineapple and cayenne pepper. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for about 40 to 60 minutes, or until the mixture is syrupy and has reduced by about 1/2. Make sure it doesn't boil over. Use a dipping or basting sauce.
