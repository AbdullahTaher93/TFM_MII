Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes; drain. Bring a second pot of water to a boil. Cook asparagus until bright green, about 3 minutes. Remove asparagus using tongs and immediately dunk in cold water. Mix oregano, basil, thyme, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Spray chicken breasts with cooking spray; rub herb mixture into chicken. Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook chicken in the hot oil until lightly browned and no longer pink in the center, about 3 minutes per side. Heat remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir red bell pepper and garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir buttermilk, wine, and flour into red bell pepper mixture; cook and stir until sauce is thickened, 2 to 4 minutes. Add spinach; cook until spinach wilts, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until melted. Run hot water over asparagus to warm. Evenly divide linguine among serving plates; top with sauce, asparagus, and chicken.
