Stir the honey, orange zest, garlic, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, pepper, and water together in a bowl. Add the green beans and toss to coat. Allow to soak for 20 minutes, mixing every 5 minutes. Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over low heat; add the green beans to the hot oil and cover the saucepan. Pour the green beans and sauce into the pan and cook, shaking the pan regularly, until the beans are slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes to the green beans, replace the cover, and continue cooking until the green beans are cooked though yet slightly crispy, about 5 minutes more.
