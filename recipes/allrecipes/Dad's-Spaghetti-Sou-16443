In a large pot over medium high heat, add the ground beef and saute for 5 to 10 minutes, or until well browned. Add the onion and garlic and saute for 2 more minutes. Then add the tomatoes, corn and water. Bring to a boil and add the spaghetti. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the spaghetti is tender.
