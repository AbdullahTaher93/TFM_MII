Place ribs in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours or until no longer pink. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, saute the onion and garlic in oil until tender. Stir in the remaining ingredients; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Set aside. Drain ribs. Grill, covered, over indirect low heat for 45 minutes, turning once. Baste with barbecue sauce. Grill 15 minutes longer or until meat is tender, turning and basting frequently.
