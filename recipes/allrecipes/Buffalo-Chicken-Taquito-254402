Place chicken breasts into slow cooker; pour in chicken broth. Season with paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook on Low until chicken is tender, about 4 hours. Drain broth; shred chicken with 2 forks in the slow cooker. Add Buffalo sauce, cream cheese, and ranch dressing mix; stir until well mixed. Cook on low until flavors are blended, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spoon chicken onto the tortillas and sprinkle cheese on top. Roll up and place seam-side down on a nonstick baking sheet. Brush all sides of taquitos with oil. Bake in the preheated oven, turning every 5 minutes, until slightly browned, about 15 minutes.
