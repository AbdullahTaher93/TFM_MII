Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8 inch baking dish. Mix the green beans with the mushroom soup, Cheddar cheese, garlic, and garlic and herb seasoning blend. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon the bean mixture into the prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until bubbly, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven, and sprinkle the top with French fried onions. Return to oven, and bake until onions are golden brown, about 5 minutes more.
