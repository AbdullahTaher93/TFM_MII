In a bowl, combine 2 cups flour, 1/3 cup sugar, baking powder, lemon peel, orange peel, baking soda, and salt. With a pastry blender or your fingers, cut or rub in butter until coarse crumbs form. In another bowl, mix egg yolks, buttermilk, and chocolate to blend. Add to flour mixture; stir with a fork until evenly moistened. Scrape dough onto a floured board. With floured hands, knead just until smooth, 15 to 20 turns, adding more flour as required to prevent sticking. Pat dough 1 inch thick. With a floured 2 1/2-inch-wide cutter, cut dough into rounds. Transfer each to a 12- by 15-inch baking sheet, spacing evenly. Gather dough scraps into a ball, knead briefly, pat 1 inch thick, cut more rounds, and add to baking sheet. Bake shortcakes in a 400 degrees F oven (375 degrees F in a convection oven) until browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cook at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile, slice strawberries. In a bowl, gently mix strawberries with 2 to 4 tablespoons sugar to taste. Let stand at room temperature up to 1 hour. In a bowl with a mixer on high speed, whip cream until it holds soft peaks; add about 2 tablespoons sugar to taste. Split shortcakes in half horizontally. Place bottoms on plates. Cover equally with strawberry mixture and whipped cream. Set tops in place.
