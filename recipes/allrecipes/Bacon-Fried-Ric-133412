In a medium saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, cover the rice with water; swish the rice through the water with your fingers or stir with a wooden spoon until the water becomes cloudy, then drain the rice through a fine-mesh strainer. Repeat the process 2 more times. Return the rice to the saucepan and add 1 cups of water, cover and cook over medium-low heat until the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked, about 22 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside, covered, for 10 minutes to finish cooking, then fluff with a fork. Meanwhile, in a large, deep skillet, cook the bacon over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp, about 15 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate and discard the bacon fat. Return the skillet to the stove and turn the heat to medium high. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil, the onion and the white and light green scallion slices, and cook for 2 minutes. Add the garlic, 1 tablespoon of the oil and the cooked rice and stir to coat. Add the peas and stir again. Make a large well in the rice and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of the oil and the eggs. Let the eggs set for 1 to 2 minutes, then scramble them with a fork and cook for 2 minutes more. Stir the eggs into the rice, breaking them up into small pieces. Turn off the heat. Add the bacon, half of the dark green scallion slices and the sesame oil and stir. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer the fried rice to a serving platter and top with the remaining scallions.
