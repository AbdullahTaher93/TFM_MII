Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place the chicken pieces into the prepared baking dish. Pour the mushroom soup (undiluted), milk, and sour cream over the chicken. Season with onion soup mix and dill. No need to stir. Bake for 1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven, or until the chicken is falling off the bone. The longer you can cook it, the better it will taste.
