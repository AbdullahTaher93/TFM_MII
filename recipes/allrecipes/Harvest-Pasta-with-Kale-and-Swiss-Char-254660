Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain, reserving some of the cooking liquid. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and kale; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, hot pepper, and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, red bell pepper, shrimp, Swiss chard, and green beans. Cook until shrimp is opaque, about 5 minutes. Stir spaghetti into the skillet, pouring in some of the reserved cooking liquid if mixture is too dry. Add balsamic vinegar, thyme, salt, and black pepper. Cook until flavors combine, 3 to 5 minutes.
