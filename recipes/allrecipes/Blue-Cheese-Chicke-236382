Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir cream cheese and blue cheese together in a bowl. Beat egg in a separate bowl. Pour bread crumbs into a third shallow bowl. Spread cheese mixture over each chicken piece. Roll each piece of chicken around filling; dip into egg and press into bread crumbs until coated. Arrange chicken rolls on a baking sheet or baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cheese mixture will start to run out when done. Serve chicken over cooked rice.
