Place tortillas on work surface. Spread 3 tablespoons cranberry sauce over half of each tortilla. Top each with 1/2 cup chicken and 8 slices of cheese. Fold tortilla over filling. Brush tops of tortillas with oil. Spray 12-inch skillet with nonstick cooking spray. Heat over medium-low heat until hot. Place 2 quesadillas oil side down in skillet; brush top side with oil. Cook about 4 minutes or until bottom is golden brown. Flip and cook an additional 4 minutes, or until golden brown and cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Serve with additional cranberry sauce, if desired. Tip: Tortillas can also be grilled on a George Forman grill or panini grill. Follow instructions above except total cook time will be 4 minutes.
