Take out and thinly slice 1 pear half. Reserve to use as garnish. In food processor, puree pears with yogurt and lemon juice. Add enough reserved juice or syrup to make a thick soup, up to about 1/2 cup. Add spice and/or liqueur, and process just to blend. Pour into bowl, and place in freezer for 20 minutes, or refrigerate about 1 hour until chilled. Ladle into shallow soup bowls, and garnish with reserved sliced pear and mint, if desired.
