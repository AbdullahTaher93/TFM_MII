Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat an 8 inch square baking pan with cooking spray. In a medium saucepan, heat cherries and juice to a simmer and cook until liquid has evaporated. Remove from heat. Cool slightly. Place in a food processor and process until pureed. Remove from processor and set aside. Wash and wipe dry processor bowl and blade. Place oats, all-purpose and whole wheat flours, Splenda(R), ginger, and soda in a food processor and process until oats are finely ground. Pour in butter and pulse just until mixture begins to cling together. Reserve 1 1/4 cups crumb mixture for topping. Pour remaining mixture into the bottom of the baking pan and pat down firmly. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12 minutes. Remove from oven and spread pureed cherries on evenly over top of crust.* Sprinkle reserved oat mixture evenly over cherry layer and pat down firmly. Return to oven and bake for an additional 20 minutes or until slightly golden and topping appears set. Remove from oven. Cool and cut into 12 bars.
