Whisk soy sauce, sherry, honey, and cornstarch together in a small bowl. Add pork slices, coat evenly, and set aside. Pour Swanson(R) Unsalted Chicken Broth into a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, simmer until reduced to one and one half cups. Set aside. Heat oil in a large, non-stick skillet over medium high heat. Add ginger and garlic; stir until ginger and garlic are lightly browned and fragrant, 1 or 2 minutes. Remove with slotted spoon and discard. Transfer pork mixture to skillet over medium-high heat, constantly stirring and separating pork slices into a single layer, 3 or 4 minutes. Add reduced broth, stirring quickly to blend with the sauce, about 1 minute. Stir in chili garlic sauce and sesame oil. Add broccoli slaw, water chestnuts, and snow peas, stirring to coat with sauce. Cook to desired crispness, 1 or 2 more minutes. Serve over hot steamed rice, and garnish with sesame seeds.
