Preheat grill to medium high (400 degrees F). Meanwhile, place pork on platter; drizzle with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil on each side. Brush to coat; set aside. In small bowl, mix together tarragon, lemon zest, garlic pepper blend, onion powder and salt. Rub about 11/2 teaspoons of mixture over side of pork chops. Place pork chops on preheated grill. Close lid; cook for 4 to 6 minutes* per side (depending on thickness of chop) or until internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F. Serve and garnish with slice of lemon, if desired.
