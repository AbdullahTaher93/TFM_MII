Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a bowl, stir together paprika, salt, and pepper. Sprinkle seasoning over chicken pieces. Dip pieces in egg, then dredge in bread crumbs. Arrange chicken pieces in a single layer in an aluminum foil-lined 15x10-inch jelly roll pan. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, turning once. In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stir together SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, lemon juice, and curry powder, stirring until sweetener dissolves, about 5 minutes. Drizzle lemon sauce over chicken, return to oven, and bake 5 minutes more.
