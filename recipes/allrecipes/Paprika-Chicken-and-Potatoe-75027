Place the potato in a saucepan, and add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook for about 20 minutes, until potato is tender. Drain, and cut the potato into chunks. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Rub chicken with 1/2 teaspoon of paprika, salt, and pepper. Fry in butter, turning as needed, until chicken is cooked through. Remove chicken from the pan, and cut into bite size pieces. Set aside. Pour the olive oil into the skillet, and add the onion. Cook and stir until onion is translucent. Stir in the half-and-half, white wine, and potato. Simmer for about 10 minutes to blend the flavors. Return the chicken to skillet, and cook until heated through. Season with remaining paprika, and serve.
