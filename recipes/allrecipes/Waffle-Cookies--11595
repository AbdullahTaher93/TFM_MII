Preheat the waffle iron on medium setting. In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Stir in the vanilla and salt. Add eggs one at a time, mixing after each addition. Then stir in the flour. Drop the batter by heaping soupspoonful onto the waffle grid. Close the cover and bake for about 3 minutes and 20 seconds. Every waffle iron is a little different so you may want to test it on the first couple of cookies. Place finished cookies onto a wire rack to cool.
