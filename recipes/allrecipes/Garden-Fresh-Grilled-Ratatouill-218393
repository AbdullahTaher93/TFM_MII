Heat grill to medium heat. Combine eggplant, zucchini, red pepper, onion slices and tomato halves in extra large bowl. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, tossing to coat. Grill eggplant, zucchini, red pepper and onion over direct heat 5 to 8 minutes, removing from grill when crisp-tender and lightly charred. Grill tomatoes over indirect heat about 5 minutes or until softened. Cool vegetables. Chop into 3/4-inch pieces. Combine vinegar, oregano, garlic and remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in large bowl; mix well. Add grilled vegetables, basil and parsley; toss to coat. Serve at room temperature, sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.
