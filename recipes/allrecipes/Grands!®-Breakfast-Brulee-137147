Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray 8 (6-oz.) ramekins or custard cups with cooking spray; place on cookie sheet with sides. In medium bowl, beat eggs, cream, nutmeg and yogurt with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Separate dough into 8 biscuits; separate each evenly into 2 layers, making 16 dough rounds. Place sugar in shallow dish. Brush both sides of each dough round with melted butter; coat both sides with sugar. Place 1 dough round in bottom of each sprayed ramekin. Spoon 1/4 cup yogurt mixture over dough round in each ramekin. Top with remaining dough rounds. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20 to 26 minutes or until tops are deep golden brown. Cool 15 minutes before serving.
