Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat until a piece of garlic dropped into the oil slowly bubbles. Add the garlic, and cook and stir until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove garlic from the oil with a slotted spoon and set aside; reserve oil. To serve, place the pasta onto individual serving dishes and sprinkle with fried garlic. Drizzle with a little of the frying oil and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Reserve remaining garlic-flavored oil for another use.
