Sprinkle cheese, 1/2 teaspoon crushed rosemary, and basil over crust. Arrange tomato slices in a circular pattern over cheese. Mix remaining 1 teaspoon rosemary, garlic salt, and pepper. Sprinkle over tomatoes. Fold about 1/2 inch of pie crust edge over tomatoes. Bake 20 minutes or until crust is golden brown.
