In a small bowl, whisk together the milk, egg substitute, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Dip the bread in the milk mixture, flipping the pieces to coat both sides. Coat a large skillet with nonstick spray. Heat the pan over medium-high heat. Pour in 1 teaspoon of the oil. Add half of the bread and brown the pieces on both sides, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining oil and bread. Top with the peach slices and raspberries.
