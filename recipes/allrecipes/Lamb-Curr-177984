Into a wide nonstick frying pan, crumble lamb; add onion. Cook over high heat, stirring often, until lamb and onion are browned (about 6 minutes). Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir together cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of the broth; set aside. Spoon off and discard any fat from pan. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add garlic, curry powder, ginger, cumin, carrot, apple, bell pepper, and remaining broth. Bring to a simmer; then simmer, uncovered, until all vegetables are tender to bite (about 12 minutes). Stir in cornstarch mixture; simmer, stirring often, until sauce is thickened. Season to taste with salt and red pepper. Serve over rice; offer chutney and yogurt to add to taste.
