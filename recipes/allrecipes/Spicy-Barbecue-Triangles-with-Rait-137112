Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease 2 cookie sheets with shortening or spray with cooking spray. In medium bowl, mix barbecue sauce with shredded chicken, garam masala, cumin and ground red pepper. Unroll both cans of dough. Separate into 8 rectangles; firmly press perforations to seal. Press or roll each into 8x4-inch rectangle. Cut each in half crosswise to form 16 squares. Spoon about 1 tablespoon chicken mixture onto center of each square; fold dough in half over filling to form a triangle. Place on greased cookie sheets. Press edges with fork to seal. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12 to 18 minutes or until golden brown, switching position of cookie sheets in oven halfway through baking. Meanwhile, in small bowl, mix raita ingredients. Remove triangles from cookie sheets. Serve warm with raita.
