In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the beef, celery and onion until meat is no longer pink and celery is tender; drain. Stir in the flour, salt, oregano and pepper until blended. Add tomato sauce and peas; simmer for 5 minutes. Transfer to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Separate biscuits; arrange over beef mixture. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes or until biscuits are golden and cheese is melted.
