Bring a large pot of water to a boil. And prepare a large bowl with iced water. Meanwhile, trim off the stem and root ends of the turnip. Cut the turnip in half then slice in 1/4 inch thick slices. Trim the ends of the green beans. Put the green beans in the boiling water and cook for 2 minutes, uncovered. Using a slotted spoon, remove the green beans and plunge them into the ice water bath. Let them soak for 2 or 3 minutes and transfer to a paper towel. Let the boiling water re-boil and then put the turnips in the boiling water and cook for 5 minutes, uncovered. Using a slotted spoon, remove the turnips and plunge them into the ice water bath, replenish ice if needed. Let them soak for 2 or 3 minutes and transfer to a paper towel. Line a platter or individual plates with the romaine lettuce leaves. Tear up the Bibb lettuce into bite-sized pieces and place in a large bowl. Pour a little dressing over the lettuce to lightly coat. Place the lettuce evenly over the romaine. Arrange the sliced eggs along one side of the platter (or plates). In the same bowl used for the lettuce, toss the turnips with a bit of dressing and then arrange the slices on the opposite edge from the eggs. Then toss the green beans with a little bit of dressing and arrange in the center of the platter. Drain the tuna and lightly toss with a touch of the dressing and sprinkle over the green beans. Sprinkle the halved tomatoes and olives over the salad. Serve at once. If you need to store the salad in the refrigerator before serving them do not toss the lettuce and veggies with the dressing before hand. Simply drizzle the dressing over the entire salad just before serving.
