Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut baguette into thin slices; you will need about 36 slices. Arrange on rimmed baking sheet. Brush tops lightly with olive oil. Bake until lightly golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Spread about 1 teaspoon pesto sauce on each toast, making sure it covers edges. Top with a slice of tomato, cutting in half to fit, if necessary. Sprinkle with Parmesan. Broil about 3 inches from heat until cheese melts. Serve warm or at room temperature.
