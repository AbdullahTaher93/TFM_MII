Cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling water until al dente, 10 to 12 minutes, or according to package directions. Add the green beans for the last 3 minutes of the cooking time; drain well. While the pasta is cooking, heat the oil and butter in a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium heat until the butter starts to sizzle. Add the scallions and stir-fry until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Blend together the sour cream, mustard, and lemon zest, and add to the pan or wok. Stir in the ham or pork and the kidney and cannellini beans. Stir-fry until piping hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the pasta and green beans, and stir to mix. Sprinkle the parsley on top.
