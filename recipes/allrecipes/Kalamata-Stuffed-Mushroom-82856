Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray. In a food processor, process bread to make small crumbs. Remove stems from mushrooms. Set aside caps. Finely chop stems. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the chopped stems, green onions, red bell pepper, kalamata olives, and garlic; cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Stir in balsamic vinegar, bread, egg, red pepper flakes and 1/4 cup feta cheese. Thoroughly blend the mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stuff mushroom caps generously with the green onion and olive mixture. Brush the outside of the caps with remaining olive oil, and arrange in pan. Top with remaining cheese. Pour wine into the pan around the mushrooms. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven 15 to 20 minutes, until cheese is melted and lightly browned. Serve warm.
