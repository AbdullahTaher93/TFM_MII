Pop popcorn according to package instructions, and place in a large bowl. Remove unpopped kernels. In large saucepan, melt marshmallows and butter over low heat, stirring constantly. Pour marshmallow mixture over popcorn folding gently to coat evenly. Mix in chocolate candies. Let cool for 5 minutes. With buttered hands, form into 21/2" balls. Serve immediately, or wrap tightly in plastic wrap.
