Prepare cake mix according to package directions. Pour batter into a greased and floured 10-in. fluted tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Cool completely. Slice top fourth off cake; set aside. Using a sharp knife, carefully hollow out bottom, leaving a 1-in. shell (save removed cake for another use). Place cake shell in freezer for 1 hour. Fill tunnel with ice cream; replace cake top. Cover and freeze for at least 6 hours. Just before serving, melt chips and corn syrup in a microwave; stir until smooth. Stir in cream and vanilla. Spoon over cake.
