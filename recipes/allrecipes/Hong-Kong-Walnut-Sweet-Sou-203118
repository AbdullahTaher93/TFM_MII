Soak rice in water for an hour, then drain. Place rice and walnuts into a blender with 1 1/4 cup of milk and blend until smooth. Pour the walnut mixture into a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Slowly stir in the remaining 3 cups of milk, adding more milk if the soup becomes too thick. Stir in the sweetened condensed milk.
