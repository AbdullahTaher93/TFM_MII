Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the almonds in a skillet over medium heat, and cook 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until lightly toasted. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat, and saute the onion until tender. In a bowl, mix the onion, eggs, mayonnaise, cream of mushroom soup, and broccoli. Season with salt and pepper. Scoop 1/3 of the mixture into the pumpkin. Layer with 1 cup cheese and 1/3 stuffing, and drizzle with 1/3 melted butter. Sprinkle with 1/3 toasted almonds. Repeat layers. Place pumpkin on a baking sheet. Bake pumpkin 1 hour, or until filling is hot and bubbly. Cover pumpkin with aluminum foil if it begins to brown.
