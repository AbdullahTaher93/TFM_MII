Boil potatoes in stockpot of water until just soft, about 20 minutes. Drain and mash roughly. Set aside. Heat oil in stockpot over medium heat. Add onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in broth and then add potatoes back to pot. Stir and break up potatoes into broth to reach a slightly chunky consistency. (The idea is to create a textured soup, not a baby-food-smooth one.) Add dill, paprika, celery seeds, salt, nutmeg, and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Pour in milk and combine to just heat through, 2 to 5 minutes. Do not boil.
