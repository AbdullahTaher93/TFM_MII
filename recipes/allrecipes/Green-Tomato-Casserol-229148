Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix green tomatoes, celery, green onions, and cilantro together in a 2-quart casserole dish. Whisk soy sauce, olive oil, brown sugar, vinegar, black pepper, salt, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl; pour over vegetable mixture. Toss to coat. Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes; stir about 20 minutes into cooking to redistribute sauce.
