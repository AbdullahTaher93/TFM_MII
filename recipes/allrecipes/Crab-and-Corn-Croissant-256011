Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Cut crabmeat into a large bowl using kitchen shears. Add cream cheese, mayonnaise, corn, green onion, and parsley; mix until thoroughly combined. Place crescent dough triangles on the baking sheet. Place 1 heaping tablespoon of the crab mixture on the thick end of each triangle. Roll the thin end of the triangle over the crab mixture and stick it to the other side of the dough. Transfer crescents to the baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
