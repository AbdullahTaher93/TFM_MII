In a medium bowl, blend the cheese with brown sugar, allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon Spread 4 slices bread with the cream cheese mixture, and top with remaining bread slices, creating sandwiches. Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Mix egg substitute and fat free half-and-half in a shallow bowl. Dip sandwiches in the bowl to coat, and place in the skillet. Cook sandwiches 2 to 4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.
