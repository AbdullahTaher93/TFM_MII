Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dip pork chops into eggs then into the bread crumbs, coating evenly. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place coated pork chops in the skillet in a single layer, and cook until golden brown on each side, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Cook them in batches if skillet isn't large enough. Place the pork chops in a large baking dish in a single layer. In a saucepan, bring to a boil the tomato juice, brown sugar, vinegar, cloves, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered for 5 minutes. Pour mixture evenly over the pork chops. Bake in preheated oven uncovered for one hour.
