Cut each biscuit into 8 pieces; toss with salsa to coat. Spread in sprayed 8-inch square (2-quart) glass baking dish; sprinkle with remaining ingredients. Bake at 375 degrees F 35 to 40 minutes or until edges are deep golden brown and center biscuit pieces are no longer doughy. Let stand 15 minutes. Serve with additional salsa, if desired.
