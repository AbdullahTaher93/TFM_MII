Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork chops and cook until the chops are well browned on both sides. Remove the pork chops and set them aside. Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining oil. Add the onion. Cook and stir until the onion is tender-crisp. Stir the pasta sauce and spinach into the skillet. Heat to a boil. Return the pork chops to the skillet and reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook until the chops are cooked through but slightly pink in center.* Sprinkle with cheese.
