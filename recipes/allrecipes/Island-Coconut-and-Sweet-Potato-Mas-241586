Pierce sweet potatoes several times with a fork or paring knife. Microwave on high for 10 to 12 minutes or until very soft. Cool just until easy to handle. Scrape potato flesh from skins into a bowl; discard skins. Mash well with a fork. Stir in lime juice, onion, cumin, salt, cinnamon and pepper. Fold coconut whipped cream into sweet potato mixture until combined. Serve immediately.
