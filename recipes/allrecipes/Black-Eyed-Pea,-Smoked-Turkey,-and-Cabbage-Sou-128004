In a large stockpot, bring broth and 4 cups water to a boil. Score turkey legs 4 times; place in pot with bay leaf, thyme, and onion; return to a boil. Lower heat and simmer 20 minutes, skimming away foam and fat as it rises. Add peas and simmer an additional 30 minutes. Add garlic and potatoes and cook 5 minutes. Add cabbage and parsley; cook 5 to 10 minutes more, until potatoes are soft. Remove turkey legs from pot. Slice meat from bones and chop into pieces; discard bones. Return turkey to pot and season to taste with salt and pepper; discard bay leaf and thyme sprig. Serve in large bowls with toasted garlic bread, if desired.
