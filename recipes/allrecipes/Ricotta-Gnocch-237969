Prepare the sauce. In a large frying pan or skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, add a small amount of salt, add some pepper, and brown for a few minutes. Add the prosciutto cubes, pepper and garlic and continue cooking for a few minutes. Pour in the tomato sauce, cover, and simmer on low heat for 10 minutes. Add the cream, the Parmesan, green onion, and basil. Reheat and serve with the gnocchi. Place all ingredients, except for the flour and olive oil, in the bowl of a food processor and mix until smooth. Add the flour and pulse just enough to mix everything up. Place the dough on a floured work surface and gently work the dough. Shape into balls the size of a marble. Using a fork, press the balls while rolling slightly; flour the fork if it gets too sticky. In a pot of boiling salted water, cook half of the gnocchi at a time for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and continue with the 2nd half. Serve immediately or sprinkle with a bit of olive oil.
