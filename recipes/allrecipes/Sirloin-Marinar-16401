Heat the oil in a 10 inch skillet over medium high heat. Add the onions and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the steak strips, turning so that all sides get browned, about 10 minutes. Add the tomato sauce, garlic and red wine. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the steak is cooked through.
