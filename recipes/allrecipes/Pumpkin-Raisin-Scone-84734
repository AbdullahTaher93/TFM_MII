Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 baking sheets. In a large bowl, stir together all-purpose and whole wheat flours, baking powder, and baking soda. Mix in ginger, allspice, cinnamon, cloves, and salt. Set aside. In a separate large bowl, cream butter until fluffy. Mix in applesauce, then slowly stir in 2 1/4 cups sugar until well blended. Mix in the eggs and pumpkin. Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Then stir in pecans and raisins. Drop by heaping tablespoonfuls onto cookie sheets, leaving 2 inches between scones. Flatten scones with the back of the spoon. In a small bowl, stir together 3 tablespoons of sugar and cinnamon, and sprinkle on top of scones. Bake in a preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 to 14 minutes. Remove, and let cool on cookie sheets 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool.
