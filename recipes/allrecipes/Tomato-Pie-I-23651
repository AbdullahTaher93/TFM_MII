Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.) Bring a pot of water to boil and blanch the tomatoes for 1 minute. Peel and slice the tomatoes and drain on paper towels. Place sliced tomatoes in the pie shell, sprinkle with Italian seasoning, then place the sliced onions on top. In a small bowl, mix the mayonnaise and cheese together. Spread on top of the tomatoes and onions. Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes. Remove from oven and let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
