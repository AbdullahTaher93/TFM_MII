In a large saucepan, bring chicken broth and water to a boil. Stir in chicken, and season with oregano and pepper. Add rice, and reduce heat. Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, and saute garlic, onion, carrot, and mushrooms until tender. Thoroughly mix in the flour. Transfer to the broth mixture. Stir milk into the mixture, and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 30 minutes.
