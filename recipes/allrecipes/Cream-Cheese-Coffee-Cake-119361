In a saucepan, melt butter over low heat. Remove from the heat. Stir in sour cream, sugar and salt; cool to 110 degrees F-115 degrees F. In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the eggs, sour cream mixture and 2 cups flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a stiff dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. In a mixing bowl, beat filling ingredients until smooth; set aside. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into four portions. Roll each into a 12-in. x 10-in. rectangle; spread with filling. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch seam to seal and tuck ends under. Place seam side down on greased baking sheets. With a scissors, cut two-thirds of the way through dough at 1-in. intervals. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool. Combine glaze ingredients; drizzle over coffee cakes.
