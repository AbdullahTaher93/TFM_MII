Pat the steaks dry, season with salt and pepper on both sides and let stand for about 10 minutes. In a medium skillet, heat 3 tablespoons EVOO, 3 turns of the pan, over medium-high heat until very hot. Add the fresh peppers and garlic, season with salt and pepper and cook, tossing often, until the peppers begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover and keep warm. On a large nonstick griddle, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon EVOO, 1 turn of the pan, over medium-high heat until smoking hot. Add the steaks and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare and for 5 minutes on each side for medium. Let rest. In a small saucepan, bring the chicken broth, butter and cinnamon to a boil. Add the couscous and cover the pan. Turn off the heat, let stand for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork and stir in the nuts. Add the Peppadew peppers and pickled yellow peppers to the sauteed peppers, warm briefly and mix in the parsley and mint. Serve the peppers on top of the steaks with the couscous alongside.
