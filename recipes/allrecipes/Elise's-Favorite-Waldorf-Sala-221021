Combine apples, celery, and pecans in a bowl. Whisk mayonnaise, sugar, lemon juice, and cinnamon together in a separate bowl until well combined. Whip heavy cream with an electric mixer until soft peaks form; fold into mayonnaise mixture to form a creamy dressing. Fold apple mixture into the dressing until coated; chill in refrigerator for about 1 hour.
