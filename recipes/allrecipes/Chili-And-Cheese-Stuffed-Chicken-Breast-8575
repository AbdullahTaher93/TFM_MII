Mix together rice, chili, cheese, onion, and cumin. Rinse chicken thoroughly, and pat dry. Cut a slit in each breast to create a pouch that is open on one side only. Stuff each chicken breast with rice filling. Coat each stuffed breast with beaten egg, then coat in potato flakes and place in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 40 minutes, or until juices run clear. If the breasts dry out too quickly, cover loosely with a piece of foil.
