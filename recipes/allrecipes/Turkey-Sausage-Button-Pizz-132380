Split pizza dough into two equal portions and let rise at room temperature for 1 1/2 -2 hours. Preheat oven and pizza stone to 400 degrees. In a large skillet, brown the sausages according to package directions. Remove sausages from the skillet, let cool slightly and cut diagonally into 1/4 inch slices. Lightly flour a wooden pizza board. Stretch one pizza dough to desired shape and spread with 1/4 cup marinara sauce. Evenly sprinkle 1 cup mozzarella and top with bell pepper strips, onion wedges and half of the sliced sausage buttons. Slide the pizza onto the pizza stone and bake for 10-15 minutes or until cheese is melted.
