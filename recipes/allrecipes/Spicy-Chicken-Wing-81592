Cut the wings at the joints. Discard the point sections or save them in the freezer for when you next make stock. Add to a food processor or a blender all ingredients except for the chicken wings. Pulse until it forms a paste. Place the chicken wings in a large bowl, pour the marinade over the chicken. Toss until each wing is coated completely. Cover and refrigerate for at least one hour but preferably overnight. Toss the wings a few times while they marinade. Use an oiled rack over a roasting pan. Arrange the wings in a single layer, spoon the marinade over them. Bake them in a preheated 400 degrees F oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until they are cooked through.
