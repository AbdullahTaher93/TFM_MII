In a medium saucepan, cover 7 eggs with water. Bring to a boil; cook, uncovered, 2 minutes. Cover and remove from heat; let stand 10 minutes. Place eggs in bowl under cold running water until cool. Peel eggs. Slice 2 eggs with an egg slicer or a knife. Set aside 8 of the slices for eyes. Place remaining pieces in a bowl; add unsliced eggs. Mash with a fork. Add mayonnaise, mustard, and salt and ground pepper; stir to combine. Spread a thin layer of mayonnaise over each of 4 slices of bread; cover with egg salad or 1 slice ham. Make faces, using egg slices, egg salad, and suggested toppings, as desired (see note, below). Serve immediately.
