Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a loaf pan with Spectrum Canola Oil Baking Spray. In a large bowl, combine the Arrowhead Mills Organic Stone Ground Whole Wheat Flour, Arrowhead Mills Organic Enriched Unbleached White Flour, Hain Pure Foods Organic Sugar, Hain Pure Foods Iodized Sea Salt, cinnamon and Hain Pure Foods Gluten Free Featherweight Baking Powder. Add the egg, cranberry sauce and walnuts, and mix just until moistened (mixture will be dry and take effort to mix). Pour into the prepared pan. Bake for 1 hour, or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes in the pan. Remove to a rack, and cool completely.
