Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, stir together all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda and salt. Mix in molasses and buttermilk. Stir in raisins or currants. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until a tester inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.
