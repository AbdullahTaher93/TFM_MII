Cook your pasta of choice such as linguine according to recipe directions. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a small-medium ovenproof casserole dish with cooking spray. Slice squash and onion; set aside. Rinse fish and pat dry. Spread tomato sauce in the bottom of the casserole dish; add fish and top with squash, onions and basil. Cover dish tightly with foil, and bake 15 to 20 minutes or until fish flakes easily. Serve fish over cooked pasta and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
