Preheat grill for high heat. In a blender or food processor, blend the oil, lemon juice, onion, salt, thyme, marjoram, and garlic until thick and smooth. Coat the grill grate with aluminum foil. Poke holes in the foil and spray with cooking spray. Arrange chicken on grate, and cook 15 minutes, turning once and brushing constantly with the sauce, until juices run clear.
