Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch pan with aluminum foil and grease. Stir oats, flour, raisins, almonds, sunflower seeds, steel-cut oats, flax seeds, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk agave nectar, honey, coconut oil, egg, and egg white together in a separate bowl. Stir agave nectar mixture into oats mixture until well combined. Spread mixture into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until browned on the edges, 25 to 30 minutes.
