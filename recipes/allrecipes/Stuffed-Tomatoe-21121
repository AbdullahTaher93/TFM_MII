Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut the tops off of the tomatoes and use a knife to cut around the inside, separating the flesh from the skin. Scoop out the flesh. Place the tomatoes in a small baking dish. In a small bowl combine the canned tomatoes with the bread crumbs, 1/3 cup of cheese and the sausage; mix well. Spoon the mixture into the tomato skins and top with the remaining 1/3 cup of cheese. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes.
