In a bowl, combine pork, salt, pepper and garlic; mix well. Shape into 16 patties, about 3/8 in. thick. Spoon tablespoon sauerkraut in the center of eight patties; top each with a second patty and press edges to seal. Grill, uncovered, over medium heat for 6-8 minutes on each side or until juices run clear. Top with cheese. Serve on buns.
