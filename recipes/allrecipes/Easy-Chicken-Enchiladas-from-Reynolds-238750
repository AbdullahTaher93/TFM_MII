Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 2-quart rectangular baking dish with Reynolds Wrap(R) Pan Lining Paper, parchment side up. No need to grease dish. Combine the undrained tomatoes, salsa, and chili powder in a medium saucepan. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, about 10 minutes or until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally and mashing with the back of a spoon. Stack tortillas; wrap tightly in Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil. Bake tortillas about 10 minutes or until warm. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add squash, onion, and garlic; cook and stir for 8 to 10 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Remove from heat. Stir in half of the tomato mixture, the black beans, chicken, and 3/4 cup of the cheese. Divide the black bean mixture among the warm tortillas; roll up the tortillas. Arrange the rolled tortillas, seam sides down, in the prepared baking dish. Spoon the remaining tomato mixture over the tortillas. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Bake, uncovered, about 20 minutes or until heated through.
