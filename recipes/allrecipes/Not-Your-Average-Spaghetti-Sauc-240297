Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir spaghetti sauce and peach preserves with the sausage to coat. Pour water into the sauce jar and swirl it around to collect any extra sauce from the sides of the jar; pour into the skillet and stir. Bring mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the sauce thickens slightly, adding more water as needed to keep sauce from becoming too sticky, about 10 minutes.
