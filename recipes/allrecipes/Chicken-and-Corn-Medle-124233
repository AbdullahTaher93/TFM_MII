Saute chicken until browned; remove and set aside. In the drippings, saute onion until tender. Toss mushrooms with lemon juice. Add mushrooms and garlic to the skillet; cook and stir for 4 minutes or until tender. Add the broth, remaining salt and pepper, mustard, basil, oregano, cayenne pepper and chicken. Simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Stir in the corn, tomatoes and green pepper; simmer for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley. Serve over noodles or rice if desired.
