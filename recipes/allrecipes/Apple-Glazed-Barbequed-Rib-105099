Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Brush the bone side of the ribs with half the oil and garlic powder and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Turn ribs over and repeat with remaining oil, garlic powder and salt and pepper. Leaving only one grill burner on and turning it to medium, place ribs meat side up on grill rack over turned off burner(s). Cover and barbeque, brushing the ribs with apple juice concentrate every 20 minutes. Rotate the ribs from back to front every 45 minutes, making sure the grill temperature stays between 250-300 degrees F (120-150 degrees C) until ribs are fork-tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Turn all burners to high and brush meat side of ribs with barbeque sauce. Turn the ribs over and brush bone side with sauce. Turn meat side up and continue to grill covered until ribs are glazed, 5 to 6 minutes longer. Remove from grill and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
