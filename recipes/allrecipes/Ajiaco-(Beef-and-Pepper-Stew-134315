Heat the canola oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in shallots, garlic, and red pepper; cook until the shallot has softened and turned translucent, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle in the chipotle powder and cumin; cook 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the roast beef and red potatoes, pour in the water and beef broth. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Stir in the oregano, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in chopped parsley before serving. Garnish each bowl with a few slices of hard-cooked egg.
