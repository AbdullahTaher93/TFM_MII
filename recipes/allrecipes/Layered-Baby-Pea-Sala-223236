Layer the butter lettuce in the bottom of a 9x11-inch deep casserole dish. Follow with separate layers of green bell pepper, red onion, celery, and baby peas. Whisk mayonnaise with seasoned salt in a bowl and spread in a layer over the peas; sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over the salad and serve immediately or chill.
