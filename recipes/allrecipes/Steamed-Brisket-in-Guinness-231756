Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Mix salt, black pepper, paprika, basil, oregano, garlic powder, and onion powder in a bowl; rub spice mixture over brisket. Arrange onion rings in the bottom of a roasting pan; lay brisket, fat-side up, atop onions. Scatter bay leaves around brisket. Pour beer over brisket. Cover roasting pan with an oven-proof lid or aluminum foil. Cook in the preheated oven for 8 hours. An instant-read thermometer should read an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (65 degrees C). Remove from oven and let rest for 1 hour before slicing.
