In a small saucepan, combine the apple, cider, onions, honey, rosemary and garlic; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Place pork roast in a large resealable plastic bag; add half of the marinade. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate overnight, turning occasionally. Transfer the remaining marinade to a bowl; cover and refrigerate. Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill. Prepare grill for indirect heat, using a drip pan. Drain and discard marinade from pork. Grill roast, covered, over indirect medium heat for 1-1/4 to 1-3/4 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), turning occasionally. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing. Heat reserved marinade; serve with pork.
