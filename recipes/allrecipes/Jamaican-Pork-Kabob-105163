Cut corn crosswise into 1-inch pieces. In medium saucepan cook corn pieces in small amount of boiling water for 3 minutes; drain and rinse with cold water. Meanwhile, cut tenderloin into 1-inch-thick slices. For kabobs, on long metal skewers alternately thread tenderloin, onion, squash or tomatillos, and corn. In small bowl combine chutney, Pickapeppa sauce, oil, and water; set aside. Grill kabobs on the rack of an uncovered grill directly over medium heat for 12 to 14 minutes or until no pink remains in the pork and the vegetables are tender, turning once and brushing with the chutney mixture during the last 5 minutes of grilling.
