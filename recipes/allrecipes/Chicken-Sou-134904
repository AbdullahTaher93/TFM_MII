Warm the oil in a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the chicken, and brown on each side. Add the apples, mushrooms, apple juice, vinegar, and broth. Bring to a slow boil and remove any froth. Lower the heat, and simmer (covered) for 15 minutes. Whip in the yogurt; and it's done. Store it for up to five days in the fridge.
