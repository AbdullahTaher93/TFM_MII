Grease and flour the bundt pan, and set aside. Combine the flour, baking powder, soda and salt in a mixing bowl, and set aside. Melt 1 3/4 cups dark chocolate in microwave (about 1-1/2 minutes), stop and stir occasionally. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl, beat the shortening, sugar and orange zest until fluffy; then add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. In another mixing bowl, combine the milk and sour cream. With the electric mixer on low, alternately add the flour mixture and the milk mixture into the shortening mixture, beating until smooth. Stir 1 cup of cake batter with melted chocolate, and set aside. Spoon half of remaining plain batter into the bottom of the bundt pan. Cover it with the chocolate batter, and top with remaining plain batter. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F for 55-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Transfer to a wire rack and cool completely. For the glaze: set aside 8 dark chocolates. Melt remaining dark chocolate with Karo syrup and heavy cream in the microwave for 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently until smooth. Cool slightly (about 3 minutes). Remove cake from pan, and place it on a wire rack. Place wire rack over a sheet pan. Spoon glaze over the cake. Decorate top with the reserved dark chocolates.
