In a small mixing bowl, combine broth and cornstarch and stir until cornstarch is completely dissolved. Add broth mixture, parsley, sugar, thyme, salt and pepper to mushrooms. Bring to a boil; stir until thickened. Remove from heat and cover to keep warm. Brush filets lightly with vegetable oil and place on rack over medium hot grill.
