Preheat oven to 450 degrees F or preheat grill to Medium. Center each salmon fillet on a 12 x 18-inch foil sheet. Combine tomatoes, garlic, salt and pepper; divide among the 6 fillets. Top each fillet with bell pepper, onion, zucchini and olives. Fold over fish and vegetables; double fold edges to seal. Bake 18 to 20 minutes on a baking pan or grill 15 to 20 minutes or until fish flakes easily with fork.
