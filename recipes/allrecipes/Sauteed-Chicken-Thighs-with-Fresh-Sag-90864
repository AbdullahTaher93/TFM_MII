Rinse chicken and pat dry. Place each piece between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. With a heavy, flat-sided mallet, pound meat firmly but gently all over to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Sprinkle one side of each piece with minced sage, pressing into meat. Heat a wide nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add 2 teaspoons oil and swirl to coat pan bottom. Fill pan with meat, sage sides down, without crowding. Cook until golden on bottom (about 1 1/2 minutes). Turn pieces and cook until no longer pink in center; cut to test (30 seconds to 1 minute). Repeat until all chicken is cooked, adding more oil if needed to prevent sticking. Season chicken to taste with salt and pepper. Garnish with sage sprigs, if desired, and lemon wedges.
