Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. For stuffing, in a medium saucepan combine onion, celery, carrot, raisins, water, bouillon granules, and pepper. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Drain. Stir in the apple. Spoon stuffing into 4 mounds on the bottom of a greased 13x9x2-inch baking dish. Place hen halves, cut side down, over the vegetable mounds. Bake, loosely covered, for 1 hour. Uncover hens; brush with some of the Apple-Brandy Sauce. Bake, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes more or until hens are tender and an instant-read thermometer registers 180 degrees F, brushing once or twice with more sauce. Using a wide spatula, transfer hens with stuffing to dinner plates. Sprinkle with almonds. Heat remaining sauce until bubbly and pass at the table. Makes 4 main-dish servings. Apple-Brandy Sauce: In a small saucepan combine 1 cup apple juice, 4 tsp. cornstarch, 1 Tbsp. brown sugar, and 1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat. Stir in 4 tsp. brandy, if desired. Set aside.
