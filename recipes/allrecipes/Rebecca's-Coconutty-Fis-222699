Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly coat the bottom of a 13x9-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Drizzle lime juice over one side of each tilapia fillet; place the fillets with the juiced-side down into the prepared baking dish. Spread a thin layer of yogurt atop each fillet. Mix pecans and coconut in a bowl. Divide equally between the tilapia fillets and lightly press mixture into the yogurt layer. Bake in preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes.
