Place fish in oven proof shallow baking dish. Brush each fillet with 1 tablespoon oil. Squeeze juice from one fresh lemon over fillets. Season with 1/2 teaspoon Morton(R) Kosher Salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in medium skillet. Add bread crumbs and 4 cloves minced garlic; cook and stir until crumbs are light golden brown. Season with 1/2 teaspoon Morton(R) Kosher Salt. Cover and reserve until needed. Drain fish fillets of any marinade; discard marinade. Top each fillet evenly with garlic crumb crust. Bake fish at 350 degrees F for 20 to 30 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. In large skillet, saute remaining 4 minced garlic cloves in remaining 2 tablespoons oil until garlic is soft and aromatic. Add spinach; cook and stir until spinach is wilted. Season spinach with remaining fresh lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon Morton(R) Kosher Salt. Serve fish immediately on bed of sauteed spinach.
