Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dissolve the baking soda in the coffee. Cream the shortening with the white sugar. Beat in the eggs, coffee mixture, molasses, vinegar, 1/2 cup of the cocoa powder, spices, and flour. Dough should be thick and slightly sticky. Drop rounded spoonfuls of dough onto a greased cookie sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes. Let cookies cool, then glaze. To Make Glaze: Combine the confectioner's sugar, 1/4 cup cocoa, and enough water to achieve a desired spreading consistency. Beat until smooth.
