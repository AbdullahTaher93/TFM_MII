To make the pavlova: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Whip the egg whites with an electric mixer until foamy. Add the cream of tartar, if you are using it. Whip on high speed until soft peaks form. Add the sugar in a slow steady stream. Continue to whip until the whites are very stiff and the sugar is almost dissolved, about 3 minutes. Fold in the cocoa powder and the vinegar, if you are using it. The cocoa powder does not have to be completely incorporated, some streaks are fine. With a rubber spatula spread the meringue into a 7 inch circle on a parchment lined baking sheet. Make a slight indentation in the center 5 inches. This will make a raised edge and give a place to put the cream after baking. Bake for 25 minutes. Turn off the oven. Leave in the oven for 50 minutes to continue to dry out. Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature. To make the milk chocolate chip cream: Whip the cream, sugar, vanilla extract and espresso powder until soft peaks form. Fold in 1/2 cup of the milk chocolate chips. Spread the cream in the center of the pavlova. Sprinkle the remaining milk chocolate chips on top. Serve immediately.
