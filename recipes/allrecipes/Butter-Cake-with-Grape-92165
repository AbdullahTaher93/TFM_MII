Butter and flour an 11-inch tart pan with removable rim. In a bowl with a mixer, beat 1/2 cup butter with 1/2 cup granulated sugar until smooth. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition. Beat in lemon peel and vanilla. Add 1 cup flour and mix well. Spread batter evenly in tart pan. Rinse grapes, cut in half, and seed. Arrange grapes, cut side up, evenly over batter. Sprinkle with about 1 tablespoon granulated sugar. Bake in a 375 degrees F oven until cake feels firm in the center when lightly pressed, 30 to 35 minutes (about 20 minutes in a convection oven). Cool on a rack at least 30 minutes. Remove pan rim. Sift powdered sugar generously over warm or cool cake just before cutting.
