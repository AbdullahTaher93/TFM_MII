Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together creamy salad dressing, plain yogurt, chopped spinach, green chile peppers, Swiss cheese, Parmesan cheese, garlic, salt and ground black pepper. Transfer the mixture to a 9 inch pie pan. Bake in the preheated oven 25 to 30 minutes, until bubbly and lightly browned. Sprinkle with tomato before serving.
