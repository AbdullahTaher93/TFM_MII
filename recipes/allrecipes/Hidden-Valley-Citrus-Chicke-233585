Heat the oil in a medium skillet. Add the chicken breasts and cook until brown on both sides. In a small bowl, mix the seasoning mix, broth and marmalade, and stir until smooth. Pour the liquid into the skillet with the chicken. Reduce the heat and continue to cook until most of the liquid has reduced, chicken is nicely glazed, and an internal temperature of 165 degrees F is reached. Serve immediately.
