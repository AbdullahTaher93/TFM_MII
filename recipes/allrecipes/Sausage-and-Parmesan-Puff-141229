Preheat oven 400 degrees F. Cut each pastry sheet into 3 strips lengthwise. In small bowl, beat egg with milk until well blended. Brush top of each pastry strip with the egg/milk mixture and sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon of cheese. Divide the uncooked sausage into 6 equal portions. Shape each portion into a log the same length as the pastry strips. Place one sausage log in the middle of each pastry strip. Fold edges of the pastry up to enclose sausage and pinch together tightly. Brush tops with remaining egg glaze. Chill 15 minutes. Place a sheet of brown paper bag on a baking sheet. Cut each pastry roll into 1 inch slices and place on top of the brown paper. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until sausage is cooked and pastry is lightly browned. Refrigerate leftovers.
