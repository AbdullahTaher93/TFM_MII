Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until hot. Spoon into shallow 2-1/2-quart baking dish. Top with remaining corn, reserved tomatoes and cheese. Bake at 350 degrees F, 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted. Garnish with green onions and cilantro, if desired. Serve warm with tortilla chips.
