Heat 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add Simply Potatoes(R) and red pepper. Spread in an even layer; press down lightly with spatula. Cook for 6 to 7 minutes or until golden brown on bottom. Drizzle Simply Potatoes(R) with 1 tablespoon oil. Turn Simply Potatoes(R) over with spatula (do this in sections). Continue cooking 6 to 8 minutes or until golden brown and tender, turning once more if necessary. Remove Simply Potatoes(R) from skillet; cover to keep warm. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add butter to skillet; heat until melted. Add Better’n Eggs(R), cook 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until Better’n Eggs(R) are set but still moist. Return Simply Potatoes(R) to skillet; gently mix with Better’n Eggs(R). Sprinkle with cilantro and cheese. Heat until cheese is melted. Top with salsa and sour cream.
