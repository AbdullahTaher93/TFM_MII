Add enough water to reserved juice to make 3/4 cup (175 ml). Bring 1/2 cup (125 ml) juice, apples, maple syrup, and cinnamon to a boil. Reduce heat. Cover and simmer until apples are tender, 5 minutes. Stir in cherries. Whisk cornstarch into remaining cherry juice, then stir into fruit mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture boils and thickens. Serve warm or chilled over frozen yogurt.
