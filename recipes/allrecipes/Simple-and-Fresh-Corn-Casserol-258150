Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cut the kernels from the corn cobs. Mix corn and eggs together in a bowl until smooth; add milk, sugar, salt, and pepper and mix well. Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish and dot with butter. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 1 hour.
