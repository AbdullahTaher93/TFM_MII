Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook tortellini at a boil, stirring occasionally, until the pasta floats to the top and the filling is hot, 6 to 8 minutes; drain. Rinse tortellini with cold water until completely cooled; drain and transfer to a large bowl. Stir pepperoni, provolone cheese, artichoke hearts, black olives, Italian-style salad dressing, dry Italian dressing mix, and black pepper with the tortellini. Add more Italian dressing just before serving, if desired.
