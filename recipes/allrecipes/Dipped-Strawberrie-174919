Line baking sheet with wax paper. Microwave chocolate and shortening in medium, uncovered, microwave-safe bowl on High (100%) power for 1 minute; stir. If pieces retain some of their original shape, microwave at additional 10- to 15-second intervals, stirring just until melted. Hold strawberry by the stem or with a wooden pick and dip into melted chocolate; shake off excess. Place on prepared baking sheet; refrigerate until set, about 15 minutes.
