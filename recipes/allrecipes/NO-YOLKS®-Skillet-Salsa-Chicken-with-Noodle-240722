Prepare the noodles according to package directions. Meanwhile, brown the chicken with the onion, green pepper, corn, chili powder, cumin, salt and pepper in a large, deep nonstick skillet set over medium-high heat. Add the salsa, black beans, and broth to the skillet. Bring to a boil; simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in the cooked noodles until coated. Serve with shredded Cheddar cheese, green onions, sour cream and additional salsa to garnish individual bowls at the table.
