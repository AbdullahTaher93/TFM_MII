Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Return pasta to the pot and stir in spinach. The heat from the pasta will wilt the spinach. Cover and keep warm. Meanwhile, microwave milk and vegetable broth in a 1 quart heat-resistant measuring cup until steamy. Melt butter in a large saucepan. Whisk in flour, then milk mixture and bring to a boil. Whisk in 1 cup of the Parmesan cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, capers and oregano; simmer to blend flavors, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off heat, cover, and set aside. Stir smoked salmon into sauce and toss with warm pasta and spinach. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with remaining Parmesan cheese.
