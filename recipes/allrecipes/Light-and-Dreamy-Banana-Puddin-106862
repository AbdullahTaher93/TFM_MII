Combine milk, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, cornstarch, egg, and salt in a medium saucepan; whisk until smooth. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until mixture comes to a boil and thickens, 5 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in butter and vanilla. Place 2 vanilla wafers in each of 4 (1-cup) dessert cups; divide half of the banana slices among cups. Top bananas with 1/4 cup of the hot pudding. Repeat layering with 2 more of the wafers per cup, remaining banana slices, and remaining pudding. (Cover bananas with the pudding to prevent browning.) Cover surface of each pudding with plastic wrap; refrigerate 2 hours or until chilled. Insert 2 of the remaining vanilla wafers into each pudding; top with whipped topping.
