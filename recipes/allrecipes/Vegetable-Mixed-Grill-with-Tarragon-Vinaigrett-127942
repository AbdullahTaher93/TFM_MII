Whisk together olive oil, vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. Add eggplants, yellow squash, zucchini, fennel, and onion. Toss gently. Preheat the grill to medium heat. Place vegetables on grill, reserving remaining dressing in bowl. Cook until just tender, turning occasionally, 10 to 20 minutes. Remove each vegetable to a serving platter as it is done. When all the vegetables are cooked, drizzle with remaining dressing that rests in the bottom of the bowl. Sprinkle with parsley and tarragon, and season with additional salt and freshly ground pepper.
