To Make White Sauce: Melt butter in a small skillet over medium low heat; stir in flour, then milk. Cook until thickened and season with salt and pepper. Spread 1/2 of the browned bread crumbs in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Add layers of asparagus and chopped egg, alternately. Pour White Sauce over all and top with remaining bread crumbs. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
