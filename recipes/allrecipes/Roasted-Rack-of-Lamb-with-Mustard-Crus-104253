In a small bowl, combine the garlic, mustard seeds, Morton(R) Kosher Salt, and black pepper. Rub the mixture all over the rack of lamb; press mustard seeds to adhere to meat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Let stand at room temperature for at least 15 minutes before cooking. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Add the rack of lamb to the skillet, fat side down, and sear over high heat until browned all over, about 3 minutes per side. Spread horseradish/Dijon mustard over top of rack. Transfer to the oven and roast for about 18 minutes, or until an instant read thermometer reaches 140 degrees F, for medium meat. Transfer the lamb to a carving board and let stand for 5 minutes. Carve the rack and serve 2 chops per person with roasted vegetables, double-stuffed potatoes and additional horseradish/Dijon mustard, if desired.
