Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan with aluminum foil. Mix ground beef, bread crumbs, eggs, blue cheese, onion, pepper, and salt together in a bowl; shape into 22 meatballs and arrange onto prepared pan. Bake meatballs until they are very firm, hot, and grey in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
