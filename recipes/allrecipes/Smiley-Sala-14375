Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. Place lettuce in 4 small serving bowls, sprinkle with bacon and cheese. Circle the bowl with croutons. Place three croutons on the cheese to represent the eyes and nose of a face. With 1/4 of the tomato, cut a wedge to represent a smiling mouth. Place at bottom of bowl. Drizzle with favorite salad dressing.
