In a large bowl, toss together the chicken, apple, celery, onion, and walnuts. In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar and oil and pour over the salad. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Let rest 10 to 15 minutes, mix again and chill. Spoon generous amounts of chicken salad onto 6 slices of bread, top with lettuce and remaining slices of bread.
