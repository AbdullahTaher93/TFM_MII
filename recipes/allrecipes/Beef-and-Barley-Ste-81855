Cut the beef into bite sized cubes. Season with salt and pepper. In a large soup pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat. In batches sear the beef on all sides until browned (about 5 minutes per batch). Remove each batch to another bowl while cooking the other batches. After the last batch add the onion and cook until it starts to brown. Then add the stock, Worcestershire sauce and the beef (with any juices that may have gathered in the bottom of the bowl). Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a low simmer and cook for 1 hour with the lid balanced to the side. Stir occasionally and be sure it is not boiling again. Meanwhile; dice the celery, turnips, and mushrooms. After 1 hour, add the barley, celery, turnips, mushroom and the herbs. Stir well and cook 35-45 minutes, until the barley is tender. Remove bay leaf. Taste and adjust seasoning as desired. Add more stock if needed. Serve at your leisure.
