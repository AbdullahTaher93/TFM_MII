Butter each slice of bread on one side. Place the cheese in the middle of the bread between the two unbuttered sides. Place in a skillet on medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes on each side. Place julienne sweet potato on a cookie sheet and dash with olive oil. Throw in a teaspoon of kosher salt, if handy. Place in a 450 degrees F oven for 30 minutes.
