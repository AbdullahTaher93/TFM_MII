Crumble beef into a 5- to 6-quart nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring often, until browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain off and discard all but 2 tablespoons fat. To pan, add mushrooms, onion, bell pepper, and oregano. Cook, stirring often, until onion is soft and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low, add barbecue sauce, and gently simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. While sauce cooks, heat 3 quarts of water to boiling in another 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat. Add spaghetti and cook until pasta is tender to bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain well. Transfer sauce to a serving bowl and sprinkle with parsley, if desired. Transfer spaghetti to another serving bowl. Allow diners to serve themselves pasta, sauce, and cheese as desired.
