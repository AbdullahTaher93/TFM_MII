Mix sugar, soy sauce, and oyster sauce together in a resealable gallon-size bag. Add luncheon meat, seal bag, and turn to coat, gently squeezing to coat luncheon meat. Marinate for at least 1 hour. Bring water to a boil; add rice. Return water to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat; add luncheon meat and marinade. Cook, stirring frequently, until luncheon meat is browned and marinade is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Stir rice vinegar into rice until combined. Stir rice and seaweed together in a bowl; add luncheon meat and mix well.
