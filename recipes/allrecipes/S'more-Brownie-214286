Line 13x9-inch pan with foil; grease foil. Place 15 grahams in pan, with sides overlapping slightly. Break remaining grahams into pieces. Microwave butter and chocolate squares in large microwaveable bowl on HIGH 2 minutes; stir until chocolate is completely melted. Add sugar, eggs and vanilla; mix well. Stir in flour. Pour over grahams in pan. Bake 30 to 32 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out with fudgy crumbs. (Do not overbake.) Sprinkle with marshmallows and chocolate chunks. Bake 3 to 5 min. or until marshmallows begin to puff. Press reserved graham pieces gently into marshmallows. Cool. Use foil to remove brownies from pan before cutting to serve.
