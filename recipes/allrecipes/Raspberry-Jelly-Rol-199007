Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 17 X 12-inch rimmed baking sheet with foil and coat foil with non-stick cooking spray. Whisk together egg yolks and half of SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend (about 2 1/2 tablespoons) 1 minute, or until well blended. Add vanilla and whisk another minute or until mixture is light. In bowl of electric mixer, whip egg whites and salt on medium speed 1 to 2 minutes, or until egg whites hold soft peaks when beaters are turned off and lifted. Gradually add remaining SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend and whip 1 to 2 minutes more on medium-high speed, or until egg whites hold firm peaks. Using rubber spatula, fold yolk mixture into whites. In a small bowl, combine flour and baking powder then sprinkle over egg mixture and gently fold in until combined. Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth it evenly into a thin layer. Bake 10 to 15 minutes or until center springs back lightly when pressed. While cake bakes, cut a length of paper towel about 25 inches long. Dust evenly with 1 teaspoon of confectioner's sugar. Cool cake 1 minute in pan. Loosen edges of cake and immediately invert onto sugared towel. Starting at a short end, roll up cake, rolling towel into cake. Remove to wire racks. When completely cool, carefully unroll cake and remove towel. Stir all-fruit spread until smooth then drop in small dollops all over inside of cake. Spread into a thin, even layer, then re-roll cake. Wrap in plastic wrap or foil and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours. Unwrap cake and set on a platter. Dust with remaining 1 teaspoon confectioner's sugar and cut crosswise into slices 3/4-inch thick.
