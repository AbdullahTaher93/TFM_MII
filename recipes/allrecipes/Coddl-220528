Cook bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes; transfer to a large pot, reserving the drippings in the skillet. Cook sausages in the hot bacon drippings until evenly browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side; add to the pot with the bacon. Cook and stir onion and garlic cloves in the bacon drippings until tender, 5 to 7 minutes; transfer to the pot with the bacon and sausages. Place the caraway seeds, rosemary, sage, thyme, and bay leaf onto the center of a 8-inch square piece of cheesecloth. Gather together the edges of the cheesecloth and tie with kitchen twine to secure. Layer the potatoes and carrots atop the mixture so the spice satchel rests in the middle of the ingredients. Pour enough apple cider into the pot to cover the ingredients completely. Place the pot over medium heat; bring to a simmer and cook, taking care to not boil, about 90 minutes. Garnish with parsley to serve.
