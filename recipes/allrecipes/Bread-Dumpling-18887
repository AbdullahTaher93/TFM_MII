Slice rolls finely and soak in milk, until moist but not soggy. Melt butter in a small skillet and saute ham with onion and parsley. Fill a large saucepan with salted water and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, add eggs, salt, pepper and nutmeg to bread/milk mixture and combine with ham/onion saute. Mix well and shape into dumplings. Cook in salted water for 20 minutes and serve immediately.
