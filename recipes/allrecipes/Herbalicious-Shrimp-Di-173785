Add shrimp, green onions, onion, tarragon, parsley, rosemary, chili powder, and lemon juice to the jar of a blender or food processor; process the mixture until shrimp are finely chopped. Scrape the chopped shrimp mixture into a bowl and stir in the carrot, mayonnaise, and sour cream, mixing until well blended. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Chill at least 1 hour before serving.
