Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place cauliflower in a food processor or blender; pulse until broken down into grains the size of rice. Spread on a baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven until soft, about 10 minutes. Transfer softened cauliflower to a large bowl; add almond flour, eggs, oregano, thyme, and rosemary. Stir well until dough pulls into a ball. Dust a pizza pan with flour; spread dough on the pan with a spatula to form the crust. Bake crust in the preheated oven until golden brown and edges are crispy, about 20 minutes.
