In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the next eight ingredients; mix well. Stir in enough all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch the dough down; divide into 18 pieces. Shape each into a ball. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Beat egg; brush over rolls. Sprinkle with dried onion. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks to cool.
