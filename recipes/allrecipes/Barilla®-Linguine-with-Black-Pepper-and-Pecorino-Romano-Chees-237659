Bring a large pot of water to a boil; season with sea salt. Add black pepper to a 12- to 14-inch skillet and toast over medium heat, stirring until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Add olive oil and butter; stir occasionally until the butter has melted. Remove from heat. Cook pasta according to the package directions. Drain, reserving about 1/2 cup (125ml) of the pasta cooking water. Add 1/4 cup (50ml) of the reserved pasta cooking water to the olive oil and butter mixture; add linguine and stir. Stir in the pecorino Romano cheese and Parmigiano-Romano cheese; add a splash or two more of the reserved pasta cooking water if necessary to loosen the sauce. Serve immediately.
