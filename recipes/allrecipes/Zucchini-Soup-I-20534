In a large saucepan or stockpot, cook the ground beef in the butter until brown. Stir in the tomato and onion; simmer for a minute or so then add zucchini, hot pepper sauce and salt and pepper to taste. Cover the pot and cook over medium heat until zucchini is tender. Serve hot with a generous helping of Romano cheese and a fresh loaf of crusty bread for soaking up the tasty juices.
