Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour chicken broth into saucepan; add chicken. Place a lid on the saucepan and cook until the chicken pieces are no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Put chopped chipotle peppers in a bowl with about half the reserved adobo sauce; stir. Mix tomatoes and cilantro together in a separate bowl. Stir chipotle mixture into the broth mixture a spoonful at a time, stirring and tasting between each addition, until the level of spiciness is to your liking. Remove saucepan from heat and stir tomatoes with cilantro into the soup.
