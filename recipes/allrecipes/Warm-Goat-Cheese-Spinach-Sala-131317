Slice goat cheese into four equal rounds. In a small bowl, beat egg whites with a fork until frothy. Spread bread crumbs on a small plate. Dip goat cheese rounds in egg white. Dredge in bread crumbs until rounds are thoroughly coated. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a small skillet. Cook goat cheese rounds, turning once, until golden brown on each side. Meanwhile, toss spinach with remaining oil, vinegar, and salt and pepper. Divide spinach salad onto two plates and top each with two goat cheese rounds. Best if served immediately.
