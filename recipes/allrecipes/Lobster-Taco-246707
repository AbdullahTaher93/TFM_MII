Preheat a lightly oiled grill pan over medium-high heat. Cut lobster tails in half lengthwise along the spine. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Grill until slightly charred and shells are bright in color, about 5 minutes. Remove lobster meat from the shells and chop coarsely. Combine chile sauce, 1/2 the tomato, and green onions in a large bowl. Mix in chopped lobster meat. Divide Colby-Monterey Jack cheese evenly among tortillas. Top each tortilla with some of the lobster mixture. Fold tacos over and grill until cheese melts and tortillas are lightly charred, about 1 minute per side. Garnish with remaining tomato, avocado, and shredded lettuce.
