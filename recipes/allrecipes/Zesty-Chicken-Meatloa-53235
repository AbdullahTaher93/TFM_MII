Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x4 inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, mix together the ground chicken, eggs, bread crumbs, salsa, salad dressing, and taco seasoning mix. Pack into the prepared loaf pan. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven. Top with cheese, and serve with sour cream.
