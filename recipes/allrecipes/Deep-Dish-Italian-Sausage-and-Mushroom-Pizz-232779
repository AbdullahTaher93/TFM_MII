For Dough: Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a small bowl; let stand 5 minutes. Mix flour and salt in a food processor. Add yeast mixture and pulse just until moistened. With machine running, pour oil through feed tube and process until dough begins to leave sides of bowl and forms a ball. Take dough out of processor and knead by hand for 1 minute on a lightly floured surface. Place ball of dough in an oiled small bowl, turning to oil top. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise for 30 minutes or until double in size. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly oil a 10-inch deep dish pizza pan or oven-safe skillet. Press dough along bottom and about 1 inch up sides of skillet to a make raised edge. Bake for 10 minutes or until lightly browned. While crust bakes, cook sausage over medium heat in a large skillet for 8 to 10 minutes or until sausage is fully cooked, stirring frequently. Drain off any fat. Set aside until ready to use. [Cleaning tip: Once the stove top is cool, wipe up any oil splatters with Clorox(R) Disinfecting Wipes*. Rinse hands once complete.] Remove crust from oven and prick any air bubbles with a fork. Spoon pizza sauce over crust, spreading evenly. Top with cooked sausage, mushrooms, and mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Bake pizza for 15 minutes more or until edge of crust is golden and cheese is melted. Cut into 8 wedges to serve.
