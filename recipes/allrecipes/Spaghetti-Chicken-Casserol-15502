Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Put spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water and cook about 8 to 10 minutes, until it is al dente. Drain. In a large bowl combine the chicken, cooked spaghetti, pimento, bell pepper, onion, soup, wine, 1 1/2 cups of the shredded cheese, salt and pepper. Mix all together and spread into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Top with the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese and bake another 15 minutes.
