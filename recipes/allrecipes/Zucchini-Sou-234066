Combine zucchini, onions, garlic, and 2 tablespoons water in a non-stick pan over medium heat; cook until zucchini are softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add remaining water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool. Pour zucchini mixture into a food processor no more than half full. Cover and pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Season soup with salt and garnish with chives.
