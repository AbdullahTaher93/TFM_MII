Lightly grease 13x9-inch baking pan; line with parchment paper with 2 ends extending over edge of pan. Place butter, oil, sugar, corn syrup, honey, and salt in medium saucepan. Bring to boil over medium-high heat, stirring frequently; reduce heat and simmer 5 min. Meanwhile combine remaining ingredients in large bowl. Drizzle liquid mixture over top, stirring constantly until well coated. Transfer to prepared pan; pat down evenly. Bake at 325 degrees F 15 min. Cool in pan 20 min. Holding both ends of parchment paper, lift from pan and place on rack to cool completely before cutting into squares.
