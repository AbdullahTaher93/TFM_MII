Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook shrimp in hot butter until mostly pink, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour white wine, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce over the shrimp mixture; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle tomatoes and parsley over the shrimp mixture; cook until the tomatoes are warmed, about 1 minute. Divide pasta between 2 bowls; top each portion with about half the shrimp and sauce. Garnish with Parmesan cheese.
