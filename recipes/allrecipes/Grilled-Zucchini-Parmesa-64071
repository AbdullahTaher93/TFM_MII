Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Mix the Savory Market Parmesan Cheese Flavor with the olive oil. Place zucchini on large baking sheet; brush all over with olive oil and flavor mixture. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill vegetables until tender and brown, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes. Transfer to plate and cool. Cut vegetables diagonally into 1-inch-wide pieces. Place in large bowl. Add basil, balsamic vinegar and remaining 2 tablespoons oil and toss to blend. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.
