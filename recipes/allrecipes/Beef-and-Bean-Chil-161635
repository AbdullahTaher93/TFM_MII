In a medium heavy bottom pot, brown the beef in the oil on MEDIUM-HIGH heat and cook until the water evaporates and the beef starts to caramelize, about 15 minutes. Add the pepper stir fry and cook for 3 minutes. Add the garlic and the spices and cook for 1 minute more. Add the tomatoes and water and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 30 minutes to develop the flavor of the spices. Add the drained beans and cook for 10 minutes more. You may need to adjust the consistency with water and the seasoning to your liking. If you want the chili spicier, add more chili powder or cayenne. Serve with traditional accompaniments such as cheese, sour cream, grilled flour tortillas and jalapenos.
