In a medium saucepan, bring the broth and 1 teaspoon of the salt to a boil. Stir in the couscous. Cover, remove from the heat, and let stand 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and let cool. Add the tomato, peas, mint, 4 tablespoons of the oil, the lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper to the couscous. In a large nonstick frying pan, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil over moderately high heat. Add the shrimp, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Cook turning, until just done, about 3 minutes in all. Serve the couscous salad topped with the shrimp.
