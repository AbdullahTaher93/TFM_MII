To make sauce, in a microwave-safe bowl, combine vinegar, apricots, and sugar. Heat in a microwave oven at full power (100%) until vinegar is boiling, about 3 minutes. Pour mixture into a blender or food processor and whirl until smooth. Scrape into a small bowl; set aside. To make kabobs, in a bowl, mix turkey, beef, bread crumbs, onion, egg yolk, salt, and pepper. Divide meat mixture into 4 equal portions. Pat each portion around a metal skewer (flat ones are easiest to handle) to form a log 1 inch thick and 7 to 8 inches long. Lay skewers on a lightly oiled barbecue grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Rotating skewers to brown meat evenly, cook until kabobs are no longer pink in center (cut to test), 7 to 10 minutes. About 1 minute before meat is done, brush lightly with some of the apricot sauce. To serve, place kabobs on individual plates and offer additional apricot sauce to add to taste.
