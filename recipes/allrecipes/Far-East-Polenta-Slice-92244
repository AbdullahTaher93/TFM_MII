In a bowl, cover shiitakes with hot water and let stand at least 20 minutes. Gently rub mushrooms to release grit, then lift from water. Ladle out and save 3 tablespoons water; discard remainder. Discard stems, and finely chop the caps. In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat, stir bacon frequently until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Pour off and discard fat. To bacon, add 2 tablespoons broth, shiitakes, 3 tablespoons of the soaking water, and garlic. Stir often until liquid evaporates and mushrooms are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Slice polenta into 9 1/2-inch-thick rounds, then slice in half. Transfer to a lightly oiled 12- by 15-inch baking sheet. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven until polenta is warm and edges crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, mix remaining 6 tablespoons broth, vinegar, soy sauce, and cornstarch until smooth. Add to bacon mixture; stir over high heat until boiling. Add cilantro; keep warm until polenta is ready. Arrange polenta slices on a platter. Mound shiitake-bacon mixture equally over polenta pieces; sprinkle with onions.
