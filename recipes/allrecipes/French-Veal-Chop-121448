Sprinkle veal chops with salt and pepper. In a skillet, brown chops on both sides in oil. Sprinkle onion into a greased shallow baking dish; dot with 1 tablespoon butter. Top with chops; drizzle with broth. Melt remaining butter; toss with bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle over top. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until meat is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F.
