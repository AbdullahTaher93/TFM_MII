In a small bowl, combine the dressing mix, oil and vinegar and stir until emulsified. Place the chicken in a gallon-size Glad(R) Food Storage Bag together with the marinade and seal bag. Store chilled for 1 hour. Preheat the grill or broiler. Remove the chicken from the bag and discard the remaining marinade. Grill the chicken for 5 to 7 minutes on each side or until juices run clear. Let chicken stand covered for 5 minutes before serving.
