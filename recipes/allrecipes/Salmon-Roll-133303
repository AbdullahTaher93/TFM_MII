Preheat the broiler. In a large nonstick skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper and cook skin side down for 3 minutes. Flip the salmon and cook through, about 4 minutes. Spread the buns open slightly and toast under the broiler, about 2 minutes. Remove the skin from the salmon and discard. In a medium bowl, combine the fish with the celery, scallions, mayonnaise and lemon juice, breaking up the fish into small chunks. Fill the toasted buns with the salmon salad and serve with potato chips.
