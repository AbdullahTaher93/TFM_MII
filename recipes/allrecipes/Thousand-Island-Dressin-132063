Place the vinegar, egg, and salt and pepper to taste in a bowl or the bowl of your food processor fitted with the steel blade or whisk attachment. Begin beating the mixture and slowly drizzle in the oil. Continue to beat or run the machine until all of the oil has been added. When you have a thick mayonnaise, stop beating and stir or whisk in the remaining ingredients. Blend well and refrigerate in a jar or covered bowl until ready to use. It will keep for a week.
