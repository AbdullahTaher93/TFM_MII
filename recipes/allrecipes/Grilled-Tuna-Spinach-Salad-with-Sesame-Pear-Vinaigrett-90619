In a gallon-size resealable plastic food bag, combine soy sauce, sesame oil, and brown sugar. Add tuna, close bag, and shake gently to mix and coat fish evenly. Place bag in refrigerator and allow tuna to marinate at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours. In an 8 to 10 inch nonstick frying pan, melt butter over medium heat. Add almonds and cook, stirring often, until golden brown, about 4 minutes; watch carefully as they can scorch easily. Pour almonds from pan into a bowl and set aside to cool. Once tuna steaks have marinated at least 30 minutes, lightly oil and preheat barbecue grill. Remove tuna from bag; discard marinade. Place steaks on grid over a solid bed of hot coals (you can hold your hand at grill level only 1 to 2 seconds) or on a gas grill on high heat; close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning once, until browned on the surface and still red in the center (cut to test), 5 to 6 minutes total. Remove from grill and let stand for a few minutes to cool slightly. Combine spinach, red and yellow peppers, and the toasted almonds in a large bowl. Add vinaigrette and mix gently to coat evenly. Divide salad equally among 4 dinner plates. Top each with a warm tuna steak, sliced if desired, and serve immediately.
