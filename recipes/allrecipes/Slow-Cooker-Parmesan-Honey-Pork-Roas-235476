Prepare slow cooker crock with cooking spray. Lay pork roast into crock. Whisk Parmesan cheese, honey, soy sauce, basil, garlic, oil, and salt together in a small bowl; pour over the pork roast. Cook until roast is cooked completely through, 6 to 7 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove roast to a cutting board to rest a few minutes. Skim fat from the cooking juices; discard. Ladle remaining juice to a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Whisk cornstarch into cold water in a bowl until dissolved; pour into boiling liquid in saucepan. Cook the liquid, stirring frequently, until thickened into a gravy, about 2 minutes. Slice pork roast and serve with the gravy.
