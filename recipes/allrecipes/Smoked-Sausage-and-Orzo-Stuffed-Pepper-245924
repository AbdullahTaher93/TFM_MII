Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add smoked sausage, onion, garlic and Italian seasoning and cook for 6-9 minutes, stirring occasionally, until onions are soft and smoked sausage is brown. Stir in white wine vinegar, cooked orzo, salt, pepper and 1/4 cup mozzarella; remove from heat and set aside. Mix together the marinara sauce and cinnamon and stir 1/4 cup of the sauce into the skillet. Spoon remaining sauce into the bottom of a 9x9-inch baking dish. Cut the tops off of the peppers, remove the seeds, stuff them with the orzo-smoked sausage mixture and place in baking dish. Sprinkle with remaining mozzarella cheese and bake until heated through, 25 minutes.
