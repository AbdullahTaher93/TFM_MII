Place the marrow bone, tomato puree, onion, garlic, and bay leaves into a large pot. Pour in the water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, and simmer 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, stir in the potatoes, diced tomatoes, parsley, oregano, and rosemary. Cook, stirring occasionally until the potatoes are just tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce, baked beans, and spaghetti. Return to a simmer, and cook until the spaghetti is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.
