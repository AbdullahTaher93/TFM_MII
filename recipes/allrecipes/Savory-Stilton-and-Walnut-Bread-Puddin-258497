Place brioche cubes in a large bowl; cover with 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk. Let soak for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x11-inch baking dish with 1 teaspoon butter. Stir 1/4 cup melted butter and egg into the brioche mixture. Mix Stilton cheese, walnuts, sage, rosemary, Dijon mustard, mixed spice, salt, and pepper together in a separate bowl. Add to the brioche mixture; mash until mixture is smooth and no lumps remain. Spread mixture in the prepared baking dish. Grate some fresh nutmeg on top. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool, about 20 minutes. Cut into bite-sized pieces.
