In a 5- to 6-quart pan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Add leeks and cook about 7 minutes until soft. Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute. Whisk in broth and cook, stirring, until mixture begins to boil and thicken, about 5 minutes. Add potatoes, corn, sherry, onion powder, and cayenne; cook 5 minutes. Stir in half-and-half and salmon pieces. Heat until warmed through, about 3 minutes. Do not let chowder boil or it will separate and become grainy.
