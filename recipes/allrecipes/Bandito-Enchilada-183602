Preheat oven 425 degrees F. In a large skillet heat olive oil and saute onions, sirloin and sprinkle salt and pepper (just a dash). Cook hamburger and onions until brown over medium heat approximately for 10 minutes. Drain hamburger in a colander to get rid of excess oil. Return back into large skillet. Stir in 1 cup of Newman's Own Black Bean & Corn Salsa cook for 5 more minutes just to blend spices. In a 9 X 13 casserole dish add 1/3 cup of the Newman's Own All-Natural Bandito Salsa and water. Coat the pan with the salsa and water so enchiladas don't stick and cook nicely in sauce. Take a flour tortilla and 1/2 cup of meat and bean mixture and wrap. The pan fits approximately 6 tortillas, it matters how much mixture you put in tortilla. Add salsa on top of each tortilla and sprinkle cheese on top. Bake uncovered for 15 to 20 minutes or until cheese is bubbly. Serve with with shredded lettuce, more salsa, and sour cream on top of enchilada. Yummmmmy!!!!
