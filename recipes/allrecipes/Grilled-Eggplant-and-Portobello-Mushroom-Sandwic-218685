Preheat grill or grill pan to medium. Spray mushroom and eggplant slices with nonstick cooking spray. Place on grill and cook 2 to 3 minutes, turning once, until tender. Drizzle with Italian dressing. Layer cheese and roasted vegetables evenly between slices of bread, creating 2 sandwiches. Return sandwiches to grill. Cook on each side for 1 to 2 minutes or until golden brown and cheese is melted.
