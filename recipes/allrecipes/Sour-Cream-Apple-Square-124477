In a mixing bowl, combine flour, brown sugar and butter; blend at low speed until crumbly. Stir in nuts. Press about 2-3/4 cups into the bottom of an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. To the remaining crumb mixture, add cinnamon, baking soda, salt, sour cream, vanilla and egg. Beat until thoroughly combined. Stir in apples. Spoon evenly over bottom layer. Bake at 3507 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until cake tests done. Cool on a wire rack. Cut into squares. Garnish with whipped cream if desired.
