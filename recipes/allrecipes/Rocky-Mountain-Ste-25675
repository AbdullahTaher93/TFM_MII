In a large pot over medium heat, cook sirloin in oil until quite brown. Pour 1 cup of water over the meat and drippings and cook, stirring, 2 minutes, until a dark gravy forms. Stir in 3 cups water with the salt, lemon juice, paprika, garlic, sugar, Worcestershire and bay leaf. Cover, reduce heat and simmer 2 1/2 hours. Stir potatoes and carrots into simmering stew and cook until tender, 20 minutes. Stir in onions. In a small bowl, combine flour with remaining 1/3 cup water. Stir flour mixture into stew and cook until stew thickens. Top with peas just before serving.
