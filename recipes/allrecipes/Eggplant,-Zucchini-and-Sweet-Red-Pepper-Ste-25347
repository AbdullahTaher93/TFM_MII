Stir in garlic and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in rice, zucchini, red bell pepper, tomatoes, wine, water, salt and red pepper flakes. Cook over medium-high heat until mixture reaches a low boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes, or until vegetables are tender. Remove from heat and stir in basil, parsley and rosemary.
