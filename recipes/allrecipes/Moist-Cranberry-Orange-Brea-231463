Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a large loaf pan. Combine flour, 1 3/4 cup sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl. Add melted butter; stir until mixture is crumbly. Reserve about 1/4 cup cranberries and 1/4 cup mandarin oranges; stir remaining fruit into flour mixture. Beat eggs, milk, sour cream, vanilla extract, and orange extract in another bowl until smooth. Gradually stir egg mixture into flour mixture until batter is thoroughly incorporated. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan. Scatter reserved cranberries and mandarin oranges atop batter and sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake in preheated oven for 5 minutes; reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until center of bread springs back when touched, 35 to 40 minutes.
