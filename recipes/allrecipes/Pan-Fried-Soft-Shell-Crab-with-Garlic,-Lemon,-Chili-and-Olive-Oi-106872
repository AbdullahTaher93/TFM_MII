Place crabs, jalapeno, garlic, lemon zest and parsley in a large bowl. Add 5 tablespoons of olive oil and toss lightly. Marinate for 2 hours. In another large bowl pour the lemon juice and slowly add the extra virgin olive oil whisking constantly. Season with salt and pepper. Toss vinaigrette with lettuce leaves and divide between 4 plates. Place a large non-stick saute pan over high heat. Add remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil. Dust the crabs with a little flour and place in the hot pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side. Once crabs are crispy on the outside and cooked through, remove from the pan and serve over prepared salad.
