Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Arrange shrimp in a single layer in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Evenly pour olive oil over shrimp and top with bread crumbs, parsley, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until shrimp are cooked through, about 20 minutes. Combine butter, white wine, and hot sauce in a small bowl; pour over shrimp. Top shrimp with Parmesan-Romano cheese. Bake in the oven until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes more.
