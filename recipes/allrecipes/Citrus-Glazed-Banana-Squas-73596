Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add squash cubes and water. Cover, and cook for about 5 minutes, or until squash is tender. Stir occasionally, and add more water if necessary to prevent squash from sticking to the pan. Reduce heat to low, and stir in the orange juice, apricot preserves, cloves, salt and pepper. Cook and stir uncovered until squash is evenly glazed.
