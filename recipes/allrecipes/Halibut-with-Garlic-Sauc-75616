Season the halibut with salt, and dredge in the cornmeal to coat. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place the coated halibut in the skillet, and cook 5 minutes, until lightly browned on all sides. Mix the chicken broth, garlic, and bay leaf in a pot, and bring to a boil. Pour into the skillet with the halibut. Season with pepper. Continue cooking 5 minutes, or until fish is easily flaked with a fork.
