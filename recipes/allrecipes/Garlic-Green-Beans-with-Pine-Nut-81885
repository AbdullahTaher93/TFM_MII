To toast the pine nuts; add to a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Keep the pine nuts moving frequently by stirring or tossing, being sure that they are getting turned over. As soon as a bit of color is beginning to show, remove them to a paper towel and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Trim the green beans and slice the garlic. If it is easier to mince the garlic feel free to do so. Return the skillet to the heat and add the olive oil and garlic. Saute for 1 minute. Add the green beans and saute until tender (2-4 minutes). Add the wine and stir. Add the oregano and the butter. Saute for 1 minute. Transfer to serving platter and garnish with the toasted pine nuts.
