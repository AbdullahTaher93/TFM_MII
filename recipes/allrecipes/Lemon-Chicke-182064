Remove and set aside. Add broth to skillet and heat to a gentle simmer. Mix cornstarch with 2 tablespoons broth; add to skillet and stir to incorporate. Simmer until thickened (2-3 minutes). Return chicken to skillet and simmer until chicken is heated (2-3 minutes). Serve garnished with lemon zest and chopped parsley.
