Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium baking dish, mix the whole kernel corn, cream style corn, uncooked pasta, butter, and processed cheese. Bake, covered, for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove cover, stir, and continue baking 30 minutes, or until the pasta is tender but firm.
