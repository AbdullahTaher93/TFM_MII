Heat the canola oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the onion and red bell pepper in the hot oil until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes; season with cumin, salt, and cayenne pepper. Scrape into a mixing bowl; stir in the black beans, apples, lemon juice, and cilantro. Refrigerate until cold before serving.
