Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and reserve. In a large skillet over medium heat, warm oil and cook pumpkin for about 10 minutes or until it begins to break apart. Add tomato paste, sour cream and chili powder to taste; mix well. The mixture should be mushy and an even golden-orange color. Scoop spoonfuls of the pumpkin mixture over the pasta; mix well to coat and serve.
