In a 5- to 6-quart pan over medium-high heat, stir bacon often until browned and crisp, 6 to 8 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Discard all but 1 1/2 tablespoons fat in pan. Add onions to pan and stir often until they begin to brown and stick to bottom of pan, 7 to 9 minutes. Add beans and their liquid, catsup, brown sugar, dry mustard, and cooked bacon; mix well. Pour into a shallow 3-quart casserole. Bake, uncovered, in a 350 degrees F regular or convection oven until beans are bubbling in the center, 30 to 40 minutes. Serve hot.
