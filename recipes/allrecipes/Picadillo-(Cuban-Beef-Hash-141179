Heat a large pot over medium-high heat until hot. Add beef and garlic; cook and stir until the beef is crumbly and no longer pink. Place cooked beef in a mesh strainer to drain off the grease. Return beef to the pan and add the tomato sauce, green olives, and olive brine. Season with garlic salt, garlic powder, adobo seasoning, and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
