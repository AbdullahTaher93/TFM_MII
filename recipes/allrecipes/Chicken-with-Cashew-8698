In a skillet over medium-high heat, mix butter or margarine and vegetable oil until hot. Add chicken and saute, stirring often, until the chicken turns white. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. In the same skillet, saute onion and peppers. Add the cooked chicken and the cashews and season with salt and pepper, curry powder and sesame oil. Saute for another 2 minutes and serve.
