Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Combine bread cubes and parsley in a large bowl. Blend salt, rosemary, thyme, and sage; add to bread cube mixture and toss to mix. Melt CRISCO(R) Shortening or CRISCO(R) Shortening Stick in a skillet over medium heat. Mix in onion and celery; cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Toss with the bread mixture. Add chicken broth, mixing lightly until ingredients are thoroughly blended. Rinse turkey with cold water; pat dry, inside and out, with paper towels. Lightly fill body and neck cavities with the stuffing. Fasten neck skin to back with a skewer. Bring wing tips onto back of bird. Push drumsticks under band of skin at tail, if present, or tie to tail with cord. Place turkey breast-side-up on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Insert meat thermometer in the thickest part of the inner thigh muscle; be sure tip does not touch bone. Roast in 325 degree oven for 4 to 5 hours or until thermometer registers 180 to 185 degrees; baste frequently with melted CRISCO(R) Butter Flavor Shortening or CRISCO(R) Butter Flavor Stick during roasting. Remove stuffing immediately from bird. For easier carving, let stand 15 to 20 minutes after removing from oven.
