Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute broccoli and garlic until tender. In a large bowl, toss together broccoli, cooked pasta, and 1 1/2 packages of shredded mozzarella. Place in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle with remaining mozzarella. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until cheese is melted and lightly browned.
