In a small saucepan, boil 4 cups of water and add 1 cup of whole grain sorghum to make 3 cups of cooked sorghum. Cover with a tight-fitting lid, reduce heat to medium and simmer for 45 minutes or until tender. Fluff with a fork. Combine all salad ingredients in a large bowl. Whisk together all dressing ingredients. Drizzle dressing over salad and toss to coat. Sprinkle with additional furikake, if desired.
