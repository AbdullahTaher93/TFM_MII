Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, salt, water and oil. Knead on a lightly floured surface for about 10 minutes. Let it rest for a minute, then spread out onto a cookie sheet to 1 inch thickness. Poke holes in the dough using a fork. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bottom is golden when you lift up the bread to take a peek.
