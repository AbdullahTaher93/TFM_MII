Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray. Separate each biscuit into 4 pieces; roll into balls. Combine bacon and onion in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir with wooden spoon until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in biscuit balls, Gorgonzola cheese, and Parmesan cheese. Pour into the prepared tube pan and spread evenly. Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden and biscuits are cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes in the pan; invert onto a serving plate.
