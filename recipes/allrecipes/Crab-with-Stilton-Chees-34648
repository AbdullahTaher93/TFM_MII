Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat, add mushrooms and white wine. Cook stirring until mushrooms are slightly softened, and about 1/4 cup white wine remains. Remove the mushrooms, and set aside. Arrange the crabmeat in the bottom of a small baking dish. Layer with the mushrooms, green onions, and grapes. Drizzle with the butter and wine mixture, and top with Stilton cheese. Bake 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until the dish is heated through and bubbly.
