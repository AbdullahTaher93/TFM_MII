Place the snow peas and water in a large microwave-safe bowl. Cover with vented plastic wrap and microwave on high power for a total of 5 minutes, or until crisp-tender; stop and stir after 3 minutes. Drain. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the vinegar and brown sugar to a boil. Cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes, or until the mixture is reduced to 2 tablespoons. Remove from the heat. Warm the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the red peppers and garlic; cook for 2 minutes, or until crisp-tender. Add the snow peas, salt, black pepper, and the glaze. Toss to mix.
