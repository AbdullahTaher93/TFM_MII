Cook ham steak in a large skillet over medium heat until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Drain and remove ham. Heat butter in the same skillet until melted; stir in brown sugar. Return ham to skillet and cook over medium-low heat until heated through and brown sugar is dissolved, turning steak often, about 10 minutes.
