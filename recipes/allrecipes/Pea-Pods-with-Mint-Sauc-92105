Fill a 5- to 6-quart pan with about 2 inches of water; cover and place over high heat. When water boils, arrange pea pods on a steamer insert and place in pan. Steam until pods are tender-crisp to bite, about 3 to 5 minutes. When done, immediately remove pea pods to a colander and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking. While water boils, in a food processor or blender, whirl sour cream, mayonnaise, and mint leaves until mint is finely chopped. Transfer sauce to a small bowl. Arrange steamed peas on a platter around the bowl of sauce. Garnish sauce with mint sprigs. Serve immediately, or chill to serve cold.
