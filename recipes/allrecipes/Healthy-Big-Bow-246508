Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until potatoes are very soft, about 20 minutes. Drain. Place potatoes in a large bowl. Add milk, butter, and garlic. Blend potatoes until creamy with an electric mixer. Divide mashed potatoes among bowls. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add sausage; cook until warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add chopped asparagus, corn, and broccoli florets. Pour in broth; cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are almost cooked through, about 5 minutes. Scoop 1 cup of broth out of the skillet into a small bowl. Whisk in flour until smooth. Pour broth mixture back into skillet. Stir until a thickened gravy forms, about 5 minutes. Serve sausage mixture and gravy over mashed potatoes. Season with black pepper.
