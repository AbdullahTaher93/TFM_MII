Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Place 3 cloves quartered garlic in the center of a small piece of aluminum foil lined with parchment paper. Fold up edges to form sides. Drizzle with 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, and sprinkle with salt. Fold aluminum foil and parchment over garlic to enclose. Place on a small baking sheet. Transfer to oven, and bake until golden brown and soft, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven, and set aside to cool. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add broccoli rabe, and cook until bright green, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain well. Cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces; set aside. In a blender, puree sun-dried tomatoes. Transfer to a small bowl; set aside. In a large skillet, combine 1/4 cup olive oil, 4 cloves crushed garlic, dried red pepper, and a pinch of salt over medium heat. Cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add sausage, and cook, stirring frequently, until brown, about 10 minutes. Add pureed sun-dried tomatoes, plum tomatoes, and broccoli rabe. Cook until liquid is reduced, 10 to 12 minutes more. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni according to package instructions, until al dente; drain. Toss cooked pasta with roasted garlic, and add to sauce. Stir to combine. Taste and adjust for seasoning. Serve immediately.
