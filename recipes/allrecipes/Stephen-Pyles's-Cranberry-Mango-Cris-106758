Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 11- x 7- x 2-inch or similar size 6+ cup baking dish and set aside. Combine cranberries, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, and orange zest in a large mixing bowl; let stand 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add mangoes; stir gently. Spoon the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Combine flour, SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend, oats, cinnamon and nutmeg in a mixing bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture with a pastry blender or 2 knives until crumbly. Stir in pecans. Spoon topping mixture over the cranberry mango filling. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until topping is browned. Serve warm with a scoop of ice cream, if desired.
