Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Knead the flour into the cookie dough until smooth. Roll the dough out to 1/4-inch thickness. By hand, or using a Christmas light cookie cutter, cut out shapes. With a spatula, gently transfer the cookies to a baking sheet. Using a drinking straw, press a hole at the top of each cookie. Bake for 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. Separate different colors of M&M'S(R) Brand Chocolate Candies, and set aside. Spread vanilla frosting on top of each cookie. Arrange a solid color of M&M'S(R) Brand Chocolate Candies on top of each cookie. Let the cookies dry for 30 minutes. Run licorice laces through each hole, connecting the cookies into one continuous strand.
