Press cookie dough onto an ungreased 12-in. pizza pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 13-16 minutes or until center is set and cookie is lightly browned. Cool for 5 minutes; gently run a flexible metal spatula under crust to loosen. Cool completely. In a small mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar until blended. Spread over crust. In a bowl, whisk cream and pudding mix for 2 minutes. Let stand for 2 minutes or until soft-set. Spread over cream cheese mixture; sprinkle with nuts. Refrigerate until serving.
