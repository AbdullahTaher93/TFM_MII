Preheat oven to 350 degrees F, with rack in center. In a bowl, whisk together flour and ginger. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar and syrup; cook over low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until sugar dissolves, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in flour mixture. Cool completely, about 25 minutes. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray so the batter will spread out evenly. If you use an insulated sheet, you'll need to increase the cooking time by a few minutes. Making two cookies at a time, drop batter by level tablespoons onto sheet, at least 6 inches apart. Bake until batter spreads and is golden in center (edges may be darker), 9 to 11 minutes (cooking times will be shorter for later batches). Coat baking sheet with more cooking spray before each batch. Let cool 30 to 40 seconds. Working quickly with a wide metal spatula, slide cookies onto two overturned cups; mold with your fingers. Cool completely; remove from cups. Store in airtight container up to 1 week. To serve, fill bowls with ice cream.
