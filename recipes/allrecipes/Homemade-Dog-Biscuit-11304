Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Stir in the tomato juice. Combine the all-purpose flour, bran, grits or cornmeal, salt, garlic powder, whole wheat flour, rye flour and non-fat dry milk powder. Stir in the yeast mixture. Dough should be very stiff. On a lightly floured board roll dough out to 1/3 to 1/2 inch thick. Cut into desired size with a knife or cookie cutters. Place on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for 1 hour. Turn oven off and leave biscuits overnight or for at least 4 hours in oven to harden.
