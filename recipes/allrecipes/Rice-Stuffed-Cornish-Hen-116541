In a saucepan, cook and stir the rice, onion and almonds in 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat for 5 minutes or until rice is lightly browned. Stir in the water, bouillon, lemon juice and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 16-20 minutes or until rice is tender. Stir in mushrooms. Sprinkle outside and cavity of hens with pepper and remaining salt. Stuff hens with rice mixture. Place on a rack in a shallow roasting pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Melt remaining butter; brush half over hens. Cover and bake at 400 degrees F for 25-35 minutes longer or until juices run clear and a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees F for hens and 165 degrees F for stuffing.
