Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. In a medium bowl, stir together egg, oil, orange juice and orange zest. In a separate bowl, combine flour, white sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir egg mixture into flour mixture, just until combine. Fold in chopped rhubarb. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean.
