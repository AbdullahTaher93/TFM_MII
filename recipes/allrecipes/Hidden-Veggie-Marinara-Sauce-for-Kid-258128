Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir onion in the hot oil until translucent, about 10 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir diced tomatoes, carrot, celery, Italian seasoning, oregano, salt, pepper, and bay leaf into the saucepan. Simmer until flavors combine, about 1 hour. Pour sauce into a food processor, discarding bay leaf. Cover and blend carefully until smooth.
