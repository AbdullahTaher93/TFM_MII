In a large bowl, mix all ingredients until well incorporated. Transfer dip mixture into a large crockpot. Place crockpot setting on medium-high heat. Stirring occasionally, let dip mixture cook for 60 minutes or until dip reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F as read by a food thermometer. Dip is served great with baked pita chips!
