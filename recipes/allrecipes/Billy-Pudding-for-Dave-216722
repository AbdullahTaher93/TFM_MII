Stir the tapioca into the water in a bowl, and allow to soak 8 hours or overnight. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish. Mix the soaked tapioca, brown sugar, dates, walnuts, butter, cinnamon, and salt together in a large bowl; transfer to the prepared baking dish. Bake until set, about 1 hour. Serve warm.
