Preheat oven to 475 degrees F. Place sugar, cinnamon, and nuts on a plate and stir to combine. Remove biscuits from package and pull each to about 6 inches in length. Melt butter in small pan over low heat and leave butter in pan. Dip each biscuit in melted butter, then roll in sugar-nut mixture. Twist and place on ungreased baking sheet. Bake 8 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from baking sheet and place on wire rack to cool slightly. Serve warm.
