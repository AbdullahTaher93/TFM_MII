Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in prosciutto and cook until crisp, about 3-4 minutes. Place asparagus in the skillet, and toss gently until coated with oil. Pour in water and cover with lid; cook for 1 minute. Remove lid, stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute with lid on. Remove lid and cook uncovered until the spears are still crisp but tender, about 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Squeeze lemon juice over the top.
