Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a rolling boil; add the egg noodle nests and return to a boil. Turn off the heat and let stand for 5 minutes; drain and set aside. Heat the peanut oil in a wok over high heat. Stir in the garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes; cook a few seconds until the garlic begins to turn golden. Add the chicken, green onions, and carrots. Cook and stir until the chicken is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Stir in the water chestnuts, mushrooms, peanut butter, oyster sauce, curry powder, and soy sauce until the peanut butter has dissolved into the sauce. Stir the noodles into the chicken mixture; cover and reduce heat to warm or very low. Let stand 10 to 15 minutes for the noodles to absorb some of the sauce.
