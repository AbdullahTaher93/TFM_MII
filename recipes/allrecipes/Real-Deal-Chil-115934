In a Dutch oven, cook bacon over medium heat until just beginning to brown, about 4 minutes. Add onion and garlic, and cook for 30 seconds. Add paprika, cumin, oregano, cayenne, salt, pepper, and ground beef. Cook, stirring occasionally, and breaking up the meat with the side of the spoon, until the beef is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Stir in water, cornmeal, and vinegar, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid thickens, about 20 minutes. It may be necessary to add a little water to thin the chili. Serve hot, garnished with desired toppings.
