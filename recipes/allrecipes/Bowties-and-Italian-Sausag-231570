Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until about halfway cooked, 5 to 6 minutes; drain. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir sausage in the hot oil until browned and cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes. Add red bell pepper and onion; cook and stir until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir tomatoes, beef broth, and Italian seasoning through the sausage mixture; bring to a simmer. Add bow-tie pasta to the sausage-broth mixture; simmer until pasta is cooked yet firm to the bite, 5 to 6 more minutes.
