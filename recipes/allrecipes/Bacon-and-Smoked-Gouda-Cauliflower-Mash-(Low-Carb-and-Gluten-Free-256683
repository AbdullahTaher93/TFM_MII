Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble into small pieces. Combine cauliflower, heavy cream, butter, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and garlic powder in a pot; bring to a boil. Cook until cauliflower is soft, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer cauliflower mixture carefully to a food processor. Add crumbled bacon and smoked Gouda cheese; blend until smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper.
