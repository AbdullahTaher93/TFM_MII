Preheat an oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Combine the melted butter and onion soup mix in a bowl; stir. Add the pretzel pieces; toss to coat. Spread the coated pretzels into the bottom of a large baking dish. Bake the pretzels in the preheated oven for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes. Allow pretzels to cool completely before storing in an airtight container.
