Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta; cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels; crumble into small pieces. Mix basil, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, pepper, and salt together in a small bowl. Combine bacon pieces and avocado in a large bowl. Stir in basil mixture. Add pasta; toss to combine. Sprinkle Romano cheese on top.
