Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Melt the butter in a large skillet over high heat. Add pecans and saute until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add the SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend for Baking and cook until caramelized, about 3-5 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in the paprika, chili powder and cumin. Add the vinegar and cook until all the liquid has evaporated; season with salt(optional). Spread the pecans on a cookie sheet and bake in the oven until crisp, about 3 minutes.
