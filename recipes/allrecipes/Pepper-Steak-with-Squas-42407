In a large skillet, cook steak in 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat until no longer pink; drain. Remove and keep warm. In the same skillet, heat remaining oil; saute peppers for 2 minutes. Stir in zucchini, onion and garlic; cook and stir 2 minutes longer. Add peas, mushrooms and water chestnuts. Saute until the vegetables are tender, about 2 minutes. Return beef to the skillet. Combine cornstarch, broth and soy sauce until smooth; add to skillet. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Serve over rice.
