Spoon flour into measuring cup and level. Mix flour and salt in medium bowl. Cut in CRISCO(R) using pastry blender (or 2 knives) until all flour is blended in to form pea-size chunks. Sprinkle with water, one tablespoon at a time. Toss lightly with fork until dough will form ball. Divide dough in half, if making double crust. Press between hands to form one or two 5 to 6-inch pancakes. Flour dough lightly. Roll into circle between sheets of waxed paper on dampened countertop. Peel off top sheet. For single crust, trim one inch larger than inverted 9-inch pie plate. Flip into pie plate. Remove other sheet and press pastry to fit. Fold edge under. Flute. Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Thoroughly prick bottom and sides with fork (50 times) to prevent shrinking. Bake at 425 degrees F for 10 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned. In large bowl, beat eggs with brown sugar, heavy cream, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and salt. Stir in canned pumpkin. Pour in shell. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-40 minutes. Filling should jiggle slightly. Cool completely on a rack. (Note - for best results, refrigerate overnight before serving). Serve at room temperature with whipped cream.
