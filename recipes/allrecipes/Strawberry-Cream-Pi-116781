Combine the cookie crumbs, sugar and butter; press into a 7-in. pie plate. Bake at 375 degrees F for 8 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack. In a small mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Stir in the strawberries. In another small mixing bowl, beat cream until it begins to thicken. Gradually add confectioners' sugar, beating until stiff peaks form. Fold into the cream cheese mixture. Spoon into the crust. Refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.
