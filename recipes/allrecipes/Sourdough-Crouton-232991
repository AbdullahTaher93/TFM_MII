Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Combine melted butter, Italian seasoning, olive oil, and kosher salt in a large bowl; add bread cubes and toss to coat. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the bread cubes; toss to coat. Spread onto a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
