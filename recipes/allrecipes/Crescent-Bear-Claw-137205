Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Line cookie sheet with cooking parchment paper. In medium bowl, beat egg lightly with wire whisk. Place half of egg (about 1 1/2 tablespoons) in custard cup; beat in milk until blended and set aside. To remaining egg in bowl, stir in remaining filling ingredients until well blended. Meanwhile, in 1-quart heavy saucepan, mix glaze ingredients. Heat to boiling. Remove from heat; cool while making rolls. On lightly floured work surface, unroll dough; press into 12x8-inch rectangle, firmly pressing perforations to seal. Spoon filling into 12x2-inch strip lengthwise down center 1/3 of dough. Fold 1/3 of dough over filling. Fold filling-topped section over last 1/3 of dough so seam is on bottom of folded dough. With hand, gently flatten 1-inch-wide strip of dough along one long side of folded dough. Cut folded dough crosswise into 6 (2-inch) pastries. Along flattened edge of each pastry, cut 1-inch-long cuts about 1/2 inch apart. Lightly brush egg-milk mixture over each pastry. Place almonds on plate; invert each pastry onto almonds and press gently so almonds stick to dough. Place almond side up on cookie sheet, spreading each cut slightly to form claw shape. Sprinkle remaining almonds over top of pastries. Bake 15 to 18 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire rack; cool 5 minutes. Drizzle cooled glaze over each pastry. In another small bowl, mix icing ingredients until smooth (if icing is too thick, add 1/2 teaspoon water at a time until drizzling consistency). Drizzle icing over cooled pastries.
