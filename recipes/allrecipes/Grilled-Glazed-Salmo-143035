In a shallow baking pan, combine the olive oil, water, red wine vinegar, garlic, garlic salt, black pepper and basil. Place salmon filet in the marinade meat side down, if skin is still on. Marinate for 30 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil grate. Coat the salmon filet lightly with SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener. Place on grill and cook 12 minutes per side. Baste with marinade periodically while cooking. Salmon is done, when it flakes easily with a fork.
