Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat an 8x8-inch baking pan with cooking spray. In a large bowl, whisk together flours, baking soda, baking powder, and cinnamon. In another bowl, whisk together sugar, butter or non-hydrogenated margarine, applesauce and egg. Add applesauce mixture to flour mixture and mix just to combine. Gently fold in trail mix and spoon into baking pan. Smooth the surface. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool for 15 minutes and turn out onto a cutting board. Let them cool completely. When cool, cut into 10 bars. Spread the top of each bar with a little NUTELLA(R).
