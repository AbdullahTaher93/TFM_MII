Salt and pepper both sides of pork shank sections. Heat oil and butter in a heavy pot over high heat. Brown pork until it gets a nice sear, 3 or 4 minutes per side. Transfer pork to a plate; reduce heat to medium. Add onions, carrots, and celery to pot. Sprinkle with salt. Cook and stir until onions start to turn translucent. Add tomato paste; cook and stir until tomato paste starts to caramelize, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle in flour; stir for 2 minutes. Add white wine and raise heat to medium high. When sauce comes to a simmer, cook until sauce reduces slightly. Add bay leaf, thyme, rosemary, and ground cloves. Add chicken stock and return to a simmer. Transfer pork back to pot along with any accumulated juices. Bring mixture to a very slow simmer. Cover and cook until fork tender, 3 to 3 1/2 hours. Serve shanks with plenty of sauce, topped with freshly chopped parsley and a sprinkle of lemon zest.
