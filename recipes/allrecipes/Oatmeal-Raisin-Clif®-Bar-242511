Place dates in a large bowl and break apart using a wooden spoon. Add oats and brown rice cereal; stir until evenly combined. Mix raisins, almonds, flax seed meal, water, protein powder, and cinnamon into date mixture until dough sticks together. Shape dough into 2-bite or 4-bite bars and store in an air-tight container in the refrigerator.
