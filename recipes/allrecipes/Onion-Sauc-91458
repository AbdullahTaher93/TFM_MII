Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions, cook and stir until lightly browned. Sprinkle in the sugar, and continue cooking until onions are deep golden brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in the chicken broth and vinegar and season with paprika. Mix in the bread until dissolved. Bring to a boil, then simmer over low heat for 3 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a blender or food processor, and blend until smooth. Serve with pork or beef.
