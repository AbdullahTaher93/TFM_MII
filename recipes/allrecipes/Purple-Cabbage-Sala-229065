Lightly toss red cabbage, mandarin orange segments, green onion, and cranberries together in a salad bowl. Toast pine nuts in a small skillet over medium heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant and lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Remove immediately to a bowl and let cool. Whisk canola oil, vinegar, sugar, and salt in a bowl until sugar and salt have dissolved. Stir toasted pine nuts into salad and pour dressing over the top. Toss again to coat salad with dressing.
