Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan lightly. Mix almond flour, flaxseed meal, eggs, almond milk, olive oil, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl until smooth dough forms. Transfer to prepared loaf pan. Bake in preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 40 minutes. Cool in loaf pan 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
