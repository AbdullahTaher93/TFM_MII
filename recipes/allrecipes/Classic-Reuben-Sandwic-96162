Heat a large skillet or a griddle on medium-low heat. Lay 4 bread slices on the counter. Build each sandwich in the following order on the bread: 1 slice Swiss cheese, 1 tablespoon dressing, 1/4 of corned beef, 1/4 cup sauerkraut and the second slice of Swiss cheese. Top with remaining bread slice, butter each top. Place each sandwich, buttered side down, in the skillet or griddle. Butter each top. Grill sandwiches until both sides are golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Cut in half and serve immediately.
