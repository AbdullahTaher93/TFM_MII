Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat 12 muffin cups with nonstick spray. In a bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, ginger, and baking soda. In another bowl, whisk milk, molasses, apple butter, egg, and oil. Stir in pears. Add pear mixture to dry ingredients and stir just until moistened; divide batter among muffin cups. Bake until a toothpick inserted into center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Remove muffins from pan and place on a wire rack to cool. Serve warm or cooled.
