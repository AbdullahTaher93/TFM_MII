In a skillet, cook the sausage, onion and tortillas in oil over medium-high heat until sausage is no longer pink and tortillas are lightly browned; drain. Stir in tomato, jalapeno, garlic powder and salt; heat through. Reduce heat to medium. Add eggs; cook and stir until eggs are completely set. Sprinkle with cheese. Serve immediately.
