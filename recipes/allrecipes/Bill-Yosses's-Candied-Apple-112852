Prepare apples by washing and drying each apple and sticking Popsicle stick or dowel vertically into the top of the apple, at the stem. Grease a piece of wax paper and set aside. Boil water, SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, lemon juice, honey and corn syrup to 295-300 degrees F using a candy thermometer. When syrup reaches peak temperature, add food coloring and set aside for 20 seconds. Mix by gently swirling the saucepan contents together. Remove from heat and avoid stirring the liquid. Wear rubber gloves when dipping the apples to avoid sugar burns. Hold onto the Popsicle stick, dip the apple into cooked SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend syrup tilting pot if necessary to coat the sides of the apple. Do not touch the hot syrup. Hold apple by the stick above sugar mixture until it stops dripping and then place on greased waxed paper to cool until hardened. They should be served within several hours. They may become sticky in humid weather.
