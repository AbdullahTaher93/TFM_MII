Roll sausage into 100 very small balls using no more than 1 1/2 teaspoons meat per ball. Stir red wine vinegar, ketchup, brown sugar, soy sauce, and ground ginger together in a large saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer until beginning to thicken, about 15 minutes. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Fry sausage balls in batches in the hot skillet until browned on all sides and no longer pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes per batch. Remove cooked sausage balls with a slotted spoon to the saucepan and stir into the sauce to coat.
