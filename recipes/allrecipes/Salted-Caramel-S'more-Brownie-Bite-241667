Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two 24-count mini-muffin pans with baking cups. Set aside salted caramel pouch. Prepare the brownie batter as directed on the back of the box. Use a spoon and fill the baking cup half way with the brownie batter. Push 3 mini marshmallows halfway down into the center of the batter. Sprinkle graham cracker crumbs over the marshmallows. Bake until the marshmallows are puffed and light golden, 20 to 23 minutes. Cool for 20 minutes. Drizzle salted caramel pouch over brownie bites.
