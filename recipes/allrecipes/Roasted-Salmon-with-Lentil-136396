Heat broiler. Combine lentils and 2 1/2 cups water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, and simmer, covered, 5 minutes. Add onion and celery; cover, and continue cooking until lentils and vegetables are just tender, 15 to 25 minutes more. Drain, reserving cooking liquid. Transfer lentils and vegetables to a medium bowl. In a bowl, whisk 2 tablespoons reserved cooking liquid with vinegar, oil, mustard, garlic, and parsley; season with salt and pepper. Toss half the dressing with the lentil mixture. Meanwhile, season salmon with salt and pepper. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. Arrange salmon on sheet; broil until opaque throughout, 8 to 10 minutes. Spoon lentils onto plates; top with salmon, flaking it into large pieces, if desired. Drizzle with remaining dressing.
