Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a heavy pan. Mix flour, sugar, raisins, caraway seeds, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Add eggs, buttermilk, and milk to the flour mixture; stir until evenly incorporated. Transfer dough to the prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven until when the bread is tapped on top it sounds hollow, about 75 minutes.
