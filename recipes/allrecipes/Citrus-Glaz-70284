Combine the orange juice, lemon juice, lime juice, water, sugar and salt in a small skillet. Mix well, and bring to a boil over medium to medium-high heat. Cook until reduced by half. Let cool until the glaze is thick and sticky. Brush onto grilled meats or fish during the last 2 minutes of cooking. Pour remaining glaze over afterwards, or use as bright decoration to your entree.
