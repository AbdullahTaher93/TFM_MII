Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8x4x2-inch loaf pans and flour pans using 2 teaspoons flour. Stir 2 1/4 cups flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk pumpkin, oil, and eggs together in a separate bowl. Pour pumpkin mixture into flour mixture and stir until just combined; fold cranberries and chocolate chips into batter. Pour batter into prepared loaf pans. Bake loaves in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
