Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Whisk Catalina salad dressing, melted butter, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, and dill together in a bowl. Brush over the salmon fillets. Cook salmon on the preheated grill, basting regularly with the sauce, until the flesh flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes.
