Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the scallions, chile, celery, and red pepper and stir-fry until the vegetables are slightly soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, fennel seeds, coriander, cumin, and turmeric and cook 1 minute. Add the tomatoes with their juice, the coconut milk, stock, and soy sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat, cover the pan and simmer 5 minutes. Stir in the bamboo shoots, white fish, and shrimp. Cover the pan again and simmer until the pieces of fish are just cooked and the shrimp turn pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the lime juice. Serve the braised fish garnished with a sprinkle of chopped scallions and fresh cilantro.
