Peel potatoes and chop into medium-sized chunks. Cover with water in large pot and boil until pieces are easily pierced with a fork. While sweet potatoes cook, toast pecans on rimmed cookie sheet. Remove sweet potatoes from water, add buttermilk, margarine, and spices and mash together. With hand mixer or immersion blender, whip potatoes until smooth. Transfer potatoes to serving dish and top with chopped pecans. Serve immediately or keep warm uncovered in a 200-degree oven.
