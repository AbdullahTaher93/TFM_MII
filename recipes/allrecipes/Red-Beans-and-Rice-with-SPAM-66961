Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir together the luncheon meat, kidney beans with liquid, butter, and onion flakes in a large saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Spoon the beans over the cooked rice to serve.
