Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil and coat with nonstick spray. Place the squash, cut side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 50 minutes, or until soft and tender. Scoop out and discard the seeds. Using a fork, separate the squash into strands and transfer to a large bowl. In a food processor, combine the tomatoes, basil, parsley, garlic, lemon juice, oil, salt, and pepper. Process until combined but slightly chunky. Pour over the squash and toss to coat.
