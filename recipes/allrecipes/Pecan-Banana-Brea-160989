Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray the inside of a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray. Sift together flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon into a medium bowl. Set aside. Cream SPLENDA(r) Brown Sugar Blend and butter in large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until well combined, about 1 minute. Add eggs and continue to mix on medium scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Reduce speed to low and mix in bananas. Stir in vanilla and banana extracts. Fold in flour mixture. Do not over mix. Spread batter evenly into the prepared pan. Sprinkle pecans and SPLENDA(r) Brown Sugar Blend on top. Bake until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 55 minutes. Let cool in pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove from pan and let cool completely on rack.
