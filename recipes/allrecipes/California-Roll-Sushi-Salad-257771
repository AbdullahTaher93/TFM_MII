Bring water and rice to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Let cool, about 15 minutes. Stir rice wine vinegar, pickled ginger juice, mayonnaise, soy sauce, sugar, wasabi powder, and sesame oil together in a bowl. Pour over cooled rice; mix to coat and break up clumps. Dice pickled ginger. Fold ginger, crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and nori gently into rice. Chill until serving.
