Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Stir melted butter and garlic powder together in a bowl. Turn cornbread out onto a cutting board. Thinly slice crusts from each of the short ends and discard. Cut cornbread in half lengthwise; cut into 4 1/2 x 1/2-inch slices. Brush both sides of each piece with butter mixture using a pastry brush. Arrange slices on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until tops are golden and crisp, 4 to 6 minutes. Flip biscotti and continue baking until top side is golden and crispy, 4 to 6 more minutes.
