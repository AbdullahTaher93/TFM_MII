Toss the mango, avocado, tomatoes, cilantro, onion, garlic, salt, and lime juice together in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Melt the honey butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp; cook and stir until pink and opaque, 2 to 3 minutes. To serve, place a few shrimp onto a warm tortilla, top with mango salsa and fold up. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
