1 Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In large bowl, break up cookie dough. Stir or knead in crushed granola bars until well mixed. In 10-inch tart pan with removable bottom or 13x9-inch pan, press dough in bottom and up side. Bake 12 to 17 minutes or until light golden brown. 2 With back of spoon, press down crust on bottom and side; bake 3 to 5 minutes longer or until deep golden brown. Press down crust again with spoon. Cool 3 minutes. 3 Meanwhile, in large microwavable bowl, microwave chocolate chips and whipping cream on High 1 minute. Stir; microwave 1 to 2 minutes longer, stirring every 30 seconds to prevent chocolate from burning, until completely melted and smooth. In small microwavable bowl, microwave peanut butter on High 1 minute or until melted; stir. 4 Spread warm peanut butter in bottom of crust. Pour chocolate mixture over peanut butter mixture. Sprinkle peanuts evenly over top. Refrigerate at least 2 hours or until serving time. For easier cutting, let tart stand at room temperature 15 minutes before serving. Store in refrigerator.
