In a blender or food processor, puree the apricots until smooth; set aside. In a skillet over medium heat, brown pork chops in butter for 2-3 minute son each side; remove and keep warm. In the same skillet, saute celery until tender. Add rice, water, raisins, ginger, salt, pepper and apricot puree; bring to a boil. Remove from the heat; stir in almonds. Pour into an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Place the chops on top. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until the pork is no longer pink and the rice is tender.
