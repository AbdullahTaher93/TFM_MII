Add milk to pumpkin in large bowl; stir with wire whisk until well blended. Add pudding mixes and spice. Beat 2 minutes or until well blended. (Mixture will be thick.) Gently stir in half of the whipped topping. Spoon into pie crust. Refrigerate 4 hours or until set. Meanwhile, place walnuts, brown sugar and butter in small microwavable bowl. Microwave on HIGH 1 to 1-1/2 minutes or until hot bubbly, stirring after 1 minute. Cool. Sprinkle walnut mixture over pie just before serving. Top each serving with a dollop of the remaining whipped topping.
