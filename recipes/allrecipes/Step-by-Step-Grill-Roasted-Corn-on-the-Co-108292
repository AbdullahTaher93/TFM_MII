Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for direct heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is directly under the food). Carefully peel back husks from corn and remove the silks. Using a basting brush, brush each ear with melted butter. Pull husks back over kernels and place corn on grill over a solid bed of medium hot coals or medium high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand just above grill for 3 to 4 seconds). Keep charcoal grill uncovered; close lid on gas grill. Cook ears, turning as needed with tongs, until hot and speckled brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Pull back or remove husks, rub corn with lime wedges, if desired, and sprinkle with salt to taste.
