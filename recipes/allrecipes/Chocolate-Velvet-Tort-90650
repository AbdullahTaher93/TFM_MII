Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in a microwave oven at 50 percent power, stirring twice, until chocolate is soft, 3 to 4 minutes total. Remove from oven; stir until mixture is smoothly blended. Add egg yolks and flour to chocolate mixture; whisk until smooth. In a bowl, combine egg whites and cream of tartar. Beat with a mixer on high speed until whites are foamy. Beat, gradually adding sugar, until whites hold stiff, glossy peaks. Add about one fourth of the beaten whites to chocolate mixture; stir to mix. Add remaining whites and gently fold into chocolate mixture until evenly incorporated. Scrape mixture into an 8-inch cake pan with removable rim. Spread batter smooth. Bake until torte puffs slightly and center barely jiggles when pan is gently shaken, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool at least 1 hour in pan on a rack (torte will sink slightly). Slide a sharp knife between torte and pan. Remove pan rim. Cut torte into wedges and transfer to plates. Spoon whipped cream onto each serving and garnish with berries.
