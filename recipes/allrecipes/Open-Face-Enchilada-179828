In a 2- to 3-quart pan, mix together mole paste and broth. Cook over medium heat, stirring often until mole mixture is smooth and hot; remove from heat. Place spinach in a colander; press all liquid from spinach. Place 3 tortillas on each of 2 baking sheets (about 12 by 15 inches each). Spoon about 3 tablespoons mole over each tortilla, leaving bare the outer 1/4-inch rim. Sprinkle 1/3 cup spinach over mole on each tortilla; top equally with feta and jack cheese. Bake enchiladas in oven until hot and cheese is melted, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a 1 1/2- to 2-quart pan, heat refried black beans. Place an enchilada on each plate with a serving of refried black beans. Garnish with cilantro, lime wedges, and salsa; offer remaining mole sauce to add as desired. Serve immediately.
