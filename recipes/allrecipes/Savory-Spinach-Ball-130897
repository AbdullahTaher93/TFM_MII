Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper and lightly coat with cooking spray. Place the spinach in a colander and squeeze to remove most of the liquid. Transfer to a medium bowl. Add the cheese, egg substitute, eggs, butter, parsley, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and salt. Mix well. Stir in the bread crumbs and season to taste with the pepper. Divide the mixture into 48 balls and place on the prepared baking sheet. Lightly coat the balls with cooking spray. Bake for 10 minutes or until lightly browned. Serve warm or at room temperature.
