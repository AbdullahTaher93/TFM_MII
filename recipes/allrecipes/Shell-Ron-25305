Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place ground beef, bacon and onion in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and place in a large saucepan along with tomatoes, soup, milk and 1/2 cup cheese. Cook, stirring, until it comes to a low boil. Stir in pasta, reduce heat to medium-low and cook until pasta is tender, stirring often to prevent sticking. Transfer to a 9x9 inch baking dish and sprinkle remaining cheese on top. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes or until cheese is melted.
