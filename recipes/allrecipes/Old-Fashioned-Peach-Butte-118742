In a large bowl, combine the peaches, sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon and cloves; mix well. Transfer to a 5-qt. slow cooker. Cover and cook on low for 8-10 hours or until peaches are very soft, stirring occasionally. Stir in tapioca. Cook, uncovered, on high for 1 hour or until thickened. Pour into jars or freezer containers; cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Refrigerate or freeze.
