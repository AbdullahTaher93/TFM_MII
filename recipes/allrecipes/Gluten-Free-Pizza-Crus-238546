Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Coat the bottom and sides of a cast-iron skillet or an oven-proof baking dish with 1 tablespoon olive oil; heat in oven for 5 minutes. Whisk garbanzo bean flour and water together in a bowl until batter is smooth. Add remaining olive oil, garlic, and salt; mix well. Pour batter into the heated skillet. Cook crust in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 15 minutes.
