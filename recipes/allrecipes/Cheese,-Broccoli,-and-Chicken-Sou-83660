Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the onion and chicken in the skillet 5 minutes, or until chicken juices run clear; drain. Bring the chicken broth to a boil in a large pot, and stir in the broccoli, processed cheese food, and Cheddar cheese. Mix in the chicken and onion. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in rice, and continue cooking 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until cheeses are melted, and broccoli and rice are tender.
