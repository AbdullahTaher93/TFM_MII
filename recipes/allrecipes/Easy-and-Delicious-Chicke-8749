In a slow cooker, combine the chicken breasts and Italian-style dressing. Cover, and cook on Low for 6 to 8 hours. Drain off the juices, and shred the chicken meat. In a medium bowl, mix the soup, broth, cream cheese, basil, thyme, salt, and pepper. Pour over the chicken in the slow cooker. Continue cooking on Low for 1 hour.
