Pour egg yolks, lemon juice, white wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, salt, sugar, vegetable oil, and olive oil, respectively, into a tall, narrow bowl. Set a immersion blender into the oil mixture and hold against the bottom of the bowl; pulse until a thick, pale mixture begins to form, about 3 to 6 pulses. Continue blending until smooth and creamy.
