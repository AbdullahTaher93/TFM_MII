Combine pineapple juice, soy sauce, vinegar and brown sugar in a medium saucepan and cook over medium-low heat. Stir in flour and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens. Remove from heat; cover to keep warm. Heat oil in a skillet over high heat until wisps of smoke start to rise. Add celery, bell pepper, water chestnuts and scallions; stir-fry until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in pineapple, chicken and sauce; heat through. Serve immediately.
