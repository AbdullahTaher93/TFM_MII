Place flour, butter and half of the cream cheese in food processor; cover. Process, using pulsing action, until mixture is well blended and almost forms a ball. Shape dough into ball; wrap tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate 1 hour or until chilled. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place pastry on lightly floured surface; roll out to 14x8-inch rectangle. Place on parchment paper-covered baking sheet; set aside. Mix remaining cream cheese and half of the dry gelatin mix until well blended. Spread onto pastry to within 2 inches of edge. Toss apples with the remaining dry gelatin mix, the cornstarch and cinnamon. Spoon evenly over cream cheese filling. Fold edge of pastry over apples toward center of tart. (Apples in center of tart will remain exposed.) Sprinkle top with almonds. Bake, in lower third of oven, 35 min. or until crust is golden brown and apples are tender. Cool. Store leftover tart in refrigerator.
