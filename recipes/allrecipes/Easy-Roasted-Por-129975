Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place pork in large lightly greased roasting pan; brush with 1/2 cup of the dressing. Place vegetables in large bowl. Add remaining 1/4 cup dressing; toss to coat. Add potatoes and beets to pork in pan. Bake 15 min. Remove pan from oven. Add onions and carrots to ingredients in pan. Bake 1-1/2 hours or until pork is cooked through (160 degrees F), basting occasionally with the pan juices. Let stand 10 min. before cutting pork into slices. Serve with the vegetables.
