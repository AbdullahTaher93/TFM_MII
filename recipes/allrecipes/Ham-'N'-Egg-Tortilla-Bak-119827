In a large skillet, saute the mushrooms, onion and green pepper in butter until tender. Meanwhile, in a bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk and pepper; add the ham. Pour into the skillet. Cook and stir over medium heat until eggs are completely set. In a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish, spread half of the soup. Place 3 tablespoons egg mixture down the center of each tortilla; sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon cheese. Roll up and place seam side down over soup. Spread remaining soup over tortillas. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until heated through.
