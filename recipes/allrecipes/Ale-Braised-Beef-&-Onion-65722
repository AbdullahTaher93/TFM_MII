Coat beef with 1/3 cup flour. Brown beef slowly on both sides in hot oil in Dutch oven or large saucepan. Combine ale, soy sauce and allspice; pour over beef. Bring to boil; cover and simmer 1 hour. Turn beef over and add onions; simmer, covered, 1 hour longer, or until beef is tender. Meanwhile, blend remaining 2 tablespoons flour with water. Remove beef and onions to serving platter; keep warm. Pour pan juices into large measuring cup; skim off excess fat. Return 2-1/2 cups juices to pan; bring to boil. Gradually stir in flour mixture, cooking until gravy boils and thickens. To serve, cut beef across grain into thin slices and serve with gravy.
