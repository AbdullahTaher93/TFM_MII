Combine turkey, Parmesan cheese, cornmeal, Worcestershire sauce, egg, and jalapeno pepper together in a bowl; form into meatballs. Mix beer, chili sauce, pickle relish, and tequila in a separate bowl until sauce is evenly combined. Transfer sauce to a saucepan and add meatballs. Simmer meatballs in the sauce over medium-low heat until meatballs are cooked through, about 30 minutes.
