In a 3- to 4-quart pan, bring 2 quarts water to a boil over high heat. Add asparagus; cook, uncovered, until just tender when pierced (2 to 3 minutes). Lift from water with a slotted spoon and immerse in ice water until cool; drain and set aside. Add pasta to boiling water and cook, uncovered, according to package directions. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking water. Meanwhile, melt butter in a 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add shallots; cook, stirring often, until soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in cream and lemon peel. Bring to a boil; stir until sauce is slightly thickened, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add drained pasta, the 1/2 cup reserved cooking water, asparagus, lemon juice, salmon, and chopped dill. Toss gently until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes; season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide pasta mixture among 4 warm dinner plates.
