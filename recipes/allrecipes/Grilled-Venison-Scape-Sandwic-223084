Place venison strips in a bowl; sprinkle with garlic scapes. Pour in canola oil and soy sauce; mix well. Cover bowl and let venison marinate for at least one hour. Preheat grill fitted with fine grate grill topper to medium heat. Evenly spread venison on the grill topper. Stir occasionally to evenly cook meat until no longer pink, about 10 to 15 minutes. Warm hamburger buns on warming rack of grill. Divide venison among the buns and top with Cheddar cheese.
