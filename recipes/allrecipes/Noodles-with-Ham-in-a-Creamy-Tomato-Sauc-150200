Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain well. Place the pasta in a large bowl. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook the ham in the skillet for 3 minutes. Add the cream, sugar, tomato paste, soy sauce, and salt; stir. Reduce heat to medium low and cook and stir until the mixture reaches a low boil. Pour the sauce over the drained pasta. Sprinkle the Swiss cheese over the top of the pasta; stir until the pasta is evenly coated.
