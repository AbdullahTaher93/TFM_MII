In a mixing bowl, beat eggs. Add sugar and oil; mix well. Combine flour, almonds, baking powder and salt. Gradually beat into the sugar mixture. Chill the dough until firm. Divide into three pieces. Roll each piece into a 8-in. x 2-in. rectangle; place on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until firm to the touch. Cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 300 degrees F. Carefully cut each rectangle into 1/2-in. slices. Place slices with cut side down on baking sheet. Bake 8-10 minutes longer.
