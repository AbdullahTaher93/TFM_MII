In a large bowl, combine flour and sugar. Cut in butter until crumbly; stir in the cheese and dill. In a small bowl, beat egg and milk; pour into dry ingredients and stir just until moistened. (Batter will be very thick.) Pour into a greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until bread tests done. Cool in pan 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack.
