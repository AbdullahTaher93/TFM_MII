In a large skillet combine chicken, gravy, water, onion, celery, chile peppers, garlic salt, salt and pepper. Stir together to mix. Cover skillet and simmer over low heat for 1 to 2 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a 11x14 inch baking dish layer 6 tortillas, then 1/2 of the chicken mixture, then 1/2 of the cheese. Repeat layers. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
