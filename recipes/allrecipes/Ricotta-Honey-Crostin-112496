Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange the bread slices on a large foil-lined baking sheet and brush the tops with olive oil. Bake until the edges start to turn golden, about 10 minutes. Let cool slightly. Smear each toast with some ricotta, about 1 teaspoon each, then drizzle with a little honey and sprinkle with pepper.
