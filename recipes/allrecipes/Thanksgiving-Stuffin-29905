Place the sausage in a skillet over medium heat. Cook, breaking sausage apart with a fork, until evenly brown. Set aside, reserving pan drippings. Mix onions and celery into skillet, and cook in the pan drippings until browned. Drain remaining drippings. In a large bowl, toss together the sausage, onions and celery, cornbread, white bread, broth, and eggs. Mix in poultry seasoning, steak sauce, and salt. Stuff turkey just before roasting.
