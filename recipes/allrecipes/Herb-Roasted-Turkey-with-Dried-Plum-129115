Place a rack in the lower part of the oven and preheat to 450. Place the turkey giblets and neck in a large roasting pan. Rinse the turkey inside and out and pat dry. Using your fingers, gently loosen the skin from the turkey breast and slip the rosemary and sage underneath, spreading them in an even layer. Season the bird's cavity with salt and pepper and place the apple quarters inside. Place the turkey, breast side up, on a rack in the roasting pan; tuck in the wings. Rub all over with the butter and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Place the dried plums and 4 whole shallots around the turkey and pour 1 cup wine into the pan. Place the turkey in the oven, reduce the temperature to 350 and roast for 1 hour. If the skin is nicely browned, tent the turkey loosely with foil. Roast for another hour, basting with the pan juices about halfway through and adding the remaining 1 cup wine and up to 1 1/2 cups water as needed. Scatter the sliced shallots on the turkey and continue to roast, basting once or twice, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thigh without touching the bone registers 165, about 1 hour. Let the turkey rest for 15 minutes before carving. Skim most of the fat from the pan; discard the giblets and neck. Garnish the turkey with the sage and rosemary sprigs. Serve with the dried plums, shallots and pan juices.
