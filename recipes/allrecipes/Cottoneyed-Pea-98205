Brown the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crispy; drain, crumble, and set aside. In a large saucepan, combine the canned black-eyed peas, canned tomatoes, onion, celery, garlic, and jalapeno peppers. Cook over medium heat until the celery and onion are tender. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add crumbled bacon before serving.
