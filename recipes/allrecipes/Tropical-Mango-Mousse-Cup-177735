Bake, cool and remove the 'tops' of the pastry shells according to the package directions. Place the cream cheese, mango, brown sugar and lime zest into a food processor. Cover and blend until the mixture is smooth. Spoon the cream cheese mixture into a medium bowl. Fold in the whipped topping. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 1 hour. Divide the cream cheese mixture among the pastry shells. Sprinkle with the coconut and top with the mango slices, if desired.
