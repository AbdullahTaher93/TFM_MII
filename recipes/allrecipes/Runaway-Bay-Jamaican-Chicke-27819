In a food processor, combine onion, garlic, habanero pepper, and ginger. Pulse until ingredients are minced. Blend in olive oil, brown sugar, vinegar, orange juice concentrate, soy sauce, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, cilantro, salt, and pepper. In a container, combine marinade with chicken. Cover, and refrigerate overnight. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil grate. Grill chicken for 10 minutes per side, or until no longer pink and juices run clear.
