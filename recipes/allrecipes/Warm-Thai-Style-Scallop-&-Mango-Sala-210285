Cook scallops in 1 tablespoon salad dressing for 2 to 3 minutes, or just until opaque. (If using shrimp, cook until shrimp turn pink and opaque.) Remove from heat. Toss together salad blend, mango, cucumber, bell pepper and cilantro leaves with 1/4 cup salad dressing. Spoon mixture onto three serving plates. Arrange scallops over each salad; drizzle remaining tablespoon of dressing over scallops.
