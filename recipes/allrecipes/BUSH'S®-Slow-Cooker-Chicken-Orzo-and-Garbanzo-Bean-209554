Add the chicken, beans, tomato sauce, onion, olives, oregano, garlic and pepper to the slow cooker and stir to combine. Cover and cook on low until the chicken is cooked through and the flavors are all melded, about 4 hours. Cook the orzo pasta according to the directions on the package. Serve over cooked orzo pasta and top each serving with a tablespoon of feta cheese. Garnish with a sprig of fresh oregano as desired.
