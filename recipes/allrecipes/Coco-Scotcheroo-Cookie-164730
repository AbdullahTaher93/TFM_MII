Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the butter, shortening, brown sugar, and white sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Gently stir in the butterscotch chips and coconut. Drop dough by rounded tablespoons onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake until set and lightly browned, about 10 to 12 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes. Transfer cookies wire racks to cool completely.
