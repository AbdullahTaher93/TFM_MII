In a large bowl, combine almond flour, salt and baking soda. In a medium bowl combine grapeseed oil, agave and vanilla. Stir wet ingredients into the almond flour mixture until thoroughly combined. Fold in chocolate chips and almond slices. Spoon dough 1 heaping tablespoon at a time onto a parchment lined baking sheet, pressing down with palm of your hand to flatten. Bake in a 350 degree F oven for 7 to 10 minutes, until lightly golden. Cool cookies on the baking sheets for 20 minutes, then serve.
