Preheat a square waffle iron. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder and salt. Add the eggs, cheese, sour cream, butter and jalapenos; stir until just combined. Using a scant 1/2 cup batter for every 4 square inches, spread the batter on the hot iron and bake until golden brown. Repeat with the remaining batter, keeping the waffles warm on a baking sheet in the oven. Slice each waffle into thirds and serve with the maple syrup.
