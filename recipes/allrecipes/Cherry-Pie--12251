In a small bowl, soften gelatin in cold water. Set aside. In a medium saucepan, mash half the cherries with the sugar. Stir in cornstarch, lemon juice, and food coloring. Cook over medium heat, stirring until thick and transparent. Remove from heat. Add gelatin, and stir briskly. Slice remaining cherries into the crust, and pour gelatin mixture over cherries. Chill at least 4 hours before serving.
