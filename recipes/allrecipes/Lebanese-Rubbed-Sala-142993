Place the salad greens in a large bowl. Add the cucumber, garlic, cherry tomatoes, and Feta cheese. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, toss to blend. Drizzle with vinegar and olive oil. Using clean hands (all rings removed), rub the salad ingredients together for 2 minutes to thoroughly work the oil, vinegar, and seasonings into the greens.
