Heat a cast iron or heavy skillet over medium heat. Place chicken in heated skillet and cook until no longer pink in the center, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Brush barbeque sauce on top of chicken. Cover skillet and cook until chicken is glazed, about 1 minute per side. Transfer chicken to a plate and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. (A countertop induction oven can be used in place of the skillet to cook the chicken. Preheat the oven with the grill pan inside on the grill setting. Grill chicken on medium until no longer pink in the center, about 4 minutes per side.
