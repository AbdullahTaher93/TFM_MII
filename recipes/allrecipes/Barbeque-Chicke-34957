In a large glass bowl mix lemon juice, vegetable oil, vinegar, oregano, and garlic powder. Place chicken pieces in the bowl, and season with salt and pepper. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate. On the prepared grill, cook chicken until no longer pink and juices run clear. Periodically brush chicken with the remaining marinade mixture while cooking. Discard any leftover marinade.
