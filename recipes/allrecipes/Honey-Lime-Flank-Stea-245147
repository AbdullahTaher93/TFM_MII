Place the steak into a large, shallow baking dish and place the onion and baby carrots on top of the steak. Make the marinade by mixing the honey, soy sauce and lime juice. Pour the marinade over the steak and vegetables, cover the dish, and let it sit in the refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours, turning the steak once about half-way through. While the steak is marinating, prepare your favorite cornbread recipe and toss in the diced carrots, red peppers and peas before baking it. Preheat a saute pan/skillet or your grill. Remove the steak from the marinade and sear it about 5 minutes on both sides for medium rare. You can cook the meat a little longer, but is important that you do not cook the steak past medium or the meat will be tough. If you have a food thermometer, insert it into the steak and confirm that it reached an internal temperature of 145 degrees F. Remove the meat from the heat and let it rest on a clean plate. This will help all of those juices reabsorb back into the meat. While the steak is resting, place the onion, carrots and remaining marinade in a pan and let it simmer until the vegetables are tender and the sauce is reduced (has a syrup-like consistency). When ready to serve, take a very sharp knife and slice the steak thinly, against the grain, at a very sharp angle. Serve the steak slices on top of a slice of cornbread with veggies on the side, spooning any extra honey lime sauce over top.
