Whisk lemon juice, olive oil, oregano, salt, and pepper in small bowl. Place beef steak and 1/2 of marinade in food-safe plastic bag; turn to coat. Close bag securely and marinate in refrigerator 6 hours or as long as overnight, turning occasionally. Reserve remaining marinade. Preheat oven broiler. Remove steak from marinade; discard marinade. Place steak on rack in broiler pan so surface of beef is 2 to 3 inches from heat. Broil 17 to 18 minutes for medium rare doneness, turning once. Remove; let stand 10 minutes. Carve into thin slices. Combine beef, lettuce, cucumber and onion in large bowl. Add reserved marinade; toss. Sprinkle with cheese and olives. Serve with pita wedges.
