Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. For cookies, combine the 1 1/4 cups LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk and lemon juice; let stand 5 minutes. In a large mixing bowl beat shortening with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Add the granulated sugar, 2/3 cup cocoa, baking soda, and salt. Beat until thoroughly combined. Beat in the egg and 1 teaspoon vanilla until combined. Beat in the 2 cups flour alternately with the LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk-lemon juice mixture. Drop by rounded tablespoons 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake in a 350 degree F oven for 8 to 10 minutes or until the edges are firm; cool on a wire rack. For filling, in a saucepan gradually stir the 3/4 cup LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk into the 1/4 cup flour until smooth. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir 2 minutes more. Remove from heat; cool. In a mixing bowl beat the 3/4 cup butter with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Add the first 2 cups powdered sugar; beat until fluffy. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla. Beat cooled LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk mixture, 1 large spoonful at a time, into butter mixture. Beat on high for 1 minute or until filling is smooth and fluffy. Spread about 2 tablespoons filling on the flat side of half the cooled cookies. Top with the remaining cookies, flat side down. For frosting, beat together the 1/4 cup cocoa powder and 3 tablespoons butter. Gradually beat in 1 cup of the powdered sugar. Slowly beat in 2 tablespoons LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Gradually beat in remaining 1 cup powdered sugar. Beat in additional LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, if needed, to reach spreading consistency. Frost cookies. Store in the refrigerator.
