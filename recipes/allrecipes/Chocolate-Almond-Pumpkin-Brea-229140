Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray the inside of a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Mix flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin pie spice, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Add pumpkin puree, vegetable oil, water, and eggs; beat until well incorporated and smooth. Gently stir in chocolate chips and almonds. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean, 1 hour and 15 minutes. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to finish cooling.
