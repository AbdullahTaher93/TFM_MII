Butter a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. pan; set aside. In a heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, water and cream of tartar. Bring to a boil, without stirring, over medium heat until a candy thermometer reads 300 degrees F (hard-crack stage). Syrup will turn a golden color. Remove from the heat; stir in butter and vanilla. Return to heat. Cook and stir until thermometer returns to 300 degrees F. Pour into prepared pan. Cool. Break into pieces.
