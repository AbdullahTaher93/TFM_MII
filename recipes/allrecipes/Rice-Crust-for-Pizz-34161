Place water and rice in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a medium size mixing bowl, mix together cooked rice, beaten egg, mozzarella cheese, and Tabasco sauce. Press mixture evenly into a lightly greased 12 inch pizza pan, covering bottom and sides. Bake in preheated oven for 4 minutes, or until set. Remove crust from oven, and let cool slightly before layering with your favorite sauce and other goodies.
