Place hot dogs in a slow cooker. Mix chili, Cheddar cheese soup, ketchup, and chopped green chilies in a bowl and pour over hot dogs. Cover cooker and set to Low; cook 4 to 5 hours (can cook longer if desired). Serve hot dogs on buns topped with a large spoonful of chili, 1 teaspoon of chopped onion, 1 tablespoon of shredded Cheddar cheese, and about 2 tablespoons crushed corn chips.
