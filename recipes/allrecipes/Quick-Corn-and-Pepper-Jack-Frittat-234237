Preheat broiler. Whisk eggs, milk and cumin in a medium bowl; set aside. Melt butter over medium heat in a large cast iron or oven-safe skillet. Cook frozen stir-fry vegetables in hot butter for 4 to 5 minutes or until vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally. Add canned corn to skillet. Pour egg mixture over vegetables in skillet. Cook over medium heat. As eggs set, run a spatula to lift eggs so uncooked portion flows underneath. Continue cooking and lifting eggs until almost set. Sprinkle with cheese. Broil 4 to 5 inches from heat for 1 to 2 minutes or just until top is set and cheese is melted. Cut into 6 wedges. Serve with salsa.
