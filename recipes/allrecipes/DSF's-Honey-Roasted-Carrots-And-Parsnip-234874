Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange carrots and parsnips in a baking dish; drizzle with olive oil. Toss to evenly coat vegetables. Pour honey over coated vegetables and season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are very tender, about 40 minutes.
