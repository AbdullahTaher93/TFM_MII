Whisk mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, cider vinegar, sugar, curry powder, and black pepper together in a bowl until smooth. Lightly toss turkey meat, red grapes, apple, celery, red onion, and walnuts in a salad bowl; pour dressing over salad and toss again to coat. Chill at least 1 hour (or overnight for best flavor).
