Line a large baking sheet with parchment or wax paper. Arrange diced papaya in a single layer and freeze overnight. Combine water and sugar in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar is completely dissolved and syrupy, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour the syrup into a glass measuring cup and let cool for 15 minutes. Remove the papaya from the freezer to defrost while the syrup is cooling. Transfer half the frozen papaya to a food processor. Add half the syrup, 2 tablespoons coconut milk, 1 tablespoon lime juice, 1/2 teaspoon lime zest and a pinch of salt. Pulse two or three times then process until smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides and stir as necessary. Transfer the sorbet to a large serving bowl. Repeat with the remaining ingredients; add to the serving bowl. Serve immediately or freeze until ready to use.
