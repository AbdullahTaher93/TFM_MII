Coat a mini-muffin tin with cooking spray and press the wontons into each tin to form a cup. Lightly coat with cooking spray and bake for 7 minutes in a 350 degree oven or until lightly brown. Remove from the oven and cool. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the onion, garlic and chicken granules. Cook until onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Add the spinach, artichokes, and cheese and continue to cook until spinach is wilted. Cool slightly and add the sour cream. Spoon a heaping tablespoon of the mixture into the wonton cups.
