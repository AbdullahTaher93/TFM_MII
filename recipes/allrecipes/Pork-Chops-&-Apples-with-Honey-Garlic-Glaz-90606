Line a broiler pan with heavy-duty foil. Spray with cooking spray. Place oven rack 4-inches from broiler unit. Preheat broiler. In a small bowl, toss apples with 1-tablespoon Honey Garlic sauce. Place chops on foil. Spread about half the remaining sauce over the chops. Broil for 4 minutes. Remove from broiler, turn chops over and push towards the corners of the pan. Brush chops with remaining sauce. Place apples in center of the pan in a single layer. Broil for 3 to 4 minutes or until pork is cooked through and apples are browned. Spoon apples over chops and serve with additional Honey Garlic sauce.
