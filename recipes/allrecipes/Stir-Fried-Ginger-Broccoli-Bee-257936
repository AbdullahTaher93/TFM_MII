Toss beef strips with 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules and 3/4 teaspoon sugar in a bowl. Marinate in the refrigerator, 20 minutes to 1 hour. Combine remaining 1/4 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules, 1/4 teaspoon sugar, and ginger juice in a bowl. Mix 2 tablespoons water with cornstarch in a small bowl. Add to bowl with ginger juice mixture; stir. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok over medium-high heat; cook and stir ginger until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add broccoli; cook and stir for 2 minutes.
