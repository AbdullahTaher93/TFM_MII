In a bowl, toss shrimp and paprika together to coat; set aside. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Panfry sausage slices, for about 4 min or until golden brown; transfer to a plate. Wipe out skillet with paper towel. Whisk flour into cream and add water. Return skillet to medium-high heat and add cream mixture along with the garlic, thyme and cayenne pepper. Bring to a boil and add shrimp; simmer for about 4 min until shrimp are pink and firm. Return sausage to skillet and warm through. Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook linguine for about 3 min or until tender but firm. Drain well and add to skillet. Cook, stirring on low heat for about 2 min or until sauce coats pasta well. Serve in shallow soup bowls and sprinkle with green onion.
