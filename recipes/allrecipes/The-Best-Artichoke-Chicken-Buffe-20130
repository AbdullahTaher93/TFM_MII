Combine wild rice and water in a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 40 to 50 minutes. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly browned. Drain, crumble, and set aside. In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Cook onion and mushrooms in butter until soft. Stir in soup, cream, sherry, and salt; cook until hot. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a large bowl, mix together cooked bacon, soup mixture, chicken meat, artichoke hearts, carrots, and mozzarella cheese. Spread cooked rice in the bottom of the baking dish, then spread chicken and artichoke mixture over rice. Top with Parmesan cheese. Cover, and bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove cover, and bake for an additional 30 minutes.
