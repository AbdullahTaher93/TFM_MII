In a large salad bowl, toss the first six ingredients. In a blender, combine the cranberries, sugar, vinegar, apple juice concentrate, salt, mustard and onion. Cover and process until smooth. While processing, gradually add oil in a steady stream. Drizzle over salad just before serving. Refrigerate any leftover dressing.
