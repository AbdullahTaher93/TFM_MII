In a large pot over medium high heat, saute the ground beef for about 5 minutes, or until tender. Drain excess fat. Add the tomato-vegetable juice and bring to a boil. Add the potatoes, vegetables and onion and bring back to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. Salt and pepper to taste.
