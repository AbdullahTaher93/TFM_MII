In a large pot, heat the oil over moderately low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Increase the heat to moderately high. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and the soy sauce. Add the lentils, salt, and water to the pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until the lentils are tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Stir the turkey, pepper, and 1/4 cup of the parsley into the soup. Top each serving with some of the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons parsley.
