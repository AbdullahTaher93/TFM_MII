Place the rhubarb in a large pot and fill with enough water so that it is almost covered. Bring to a boil, then simmer over medium heat until starting to fall apart, about 20 minutes. Stir occasionally. Remove from the heat and stir in the sugar and cinnamon until sugar has dissolved. Serve hot or cold.
