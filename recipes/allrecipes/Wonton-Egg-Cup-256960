Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cook and stir sausage in a small skillet over medium heat until browned, about 5 minutes. Drain excess grease. Let cool, about 5 minutes. Whisk eggs, cinnamon, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Stir in sausage. Spray mini muffin tin with cooking spray. Press a wonton wrapper into each opening to form a cup. Fill cups with egg and sausage mixture. Sprinkle Manchego cheese on top. Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set and lightly browned on top, 12 to 15 minutes.
