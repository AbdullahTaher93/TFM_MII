Scoop out the pulp and place in a mixing bowl; add butter and mash. Stir in Parmesan cheese, pepper and sausage. Spoon into potato shells. Place in an 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until heated through. Sprinkle with cheddar cheese. Bake 5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.
