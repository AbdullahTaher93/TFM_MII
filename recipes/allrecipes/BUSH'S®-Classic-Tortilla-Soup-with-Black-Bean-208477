Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until golden, about 7 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cumin and cook an additional 1 minute. Add the chicken broth, tomato sauce, beans, corn and stir to combine. Raise the heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. To add more body to the soup, whisk together the cornstarch and water in a small bowl. Bring the soup back up to a boil, stir in the slurry, and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. Meanwhile, pre-heat the oven at 400 degrees F. Place the corn tortilla strips in a large bowl and toss with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil until well coated. Place on a baking sheet and cook until golden and crispy, about 10 minutes, stirring halfway through to ensure even cooking. To serve, ladle the soup into individual bowls. Add *optional toppings, as desired.
