Heat oven to 325 degrees F. Place pecans and butter in baking pan; toast in oven about 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until butter is melted and nuts are coated. Set aside to cool. Meanwhile, place chips and milk in medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave at HIGH (100%) 1 minute; stir. If necessary, microwave an additional 15 seconds at a time, stirring after each heating, just until chips are melted when stirred; cool 10 minutes. Beat cream cheese and powdered sugar until fluffy in large mixer bowl; blend in chocolate mixture. Prepare whipped topping mix according to package directions; fold into chocolate mixture. Fold in 1/2 cup toasted pecans; pour into crust. Wrap tightly; freeze 4 to 6 hours or until firm. Garnish with whipped cream and remaining pecans.
