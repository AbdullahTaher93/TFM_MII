Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add farfalle pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup pasta water. Place broccoli in a pot fitted with a steamer basket over boiling water. Steam 5 minutes, or until tender. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in garlic, and cook 1 minute, or until golden brown. In a bowl, toss together the pasta, reserved pasta water, broccoli, garlic, remaining oil, and cheese. Season with salt and pepper.
