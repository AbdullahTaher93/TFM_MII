Mix ground turkey, bread crumbs, onion, green onion, egg, garlic, parsley paste, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, and salt together in a bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish. Form turkey mixture into 4 patties; arrange in a baking dish. Bake turkey burgers in the oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
