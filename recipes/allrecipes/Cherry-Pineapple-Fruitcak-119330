In a bowl, combine the cherries, pineapple, pecans and 1 cup flour; set aside. In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Beat in vanilla. Combine baking powder and remaining flour; gradually add to creamed mixture. Fold in fruit mixture. Spoon into a greased and waxed paper-lined 10-in. tube pan. Bake at 300 degrees F for 1-3/4 to 2 hours or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Remove waxed paper while warm; cool completely before slicing.
