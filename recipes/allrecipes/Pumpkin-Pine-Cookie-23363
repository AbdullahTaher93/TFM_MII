Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Stir together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon and cloves; set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, sugar and egg until smooth. Stir in the pumpkin and cream. Gradually mix in the dry ingredients until well blended and then stir in the oats, pineapple and pecans. Drop dough by tablespoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until bottoms begin to brown. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
