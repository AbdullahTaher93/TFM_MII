Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan. Blend onion and roasted red pepper in a blender until liquefied; transfer to a large bowl. Mix salmon, saltine crackers, milk, egg, Worcestershire sauce, cayenne pepper sauce, cayenne pepper, and black pepper with the onion mixture in the large bowl; transfer to the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 45 minutes.
