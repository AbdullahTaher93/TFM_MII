To make cooking sauce, in a medium-size bowl, stir together broth, orange juice, cornstarch, soy sauce, coriander, cumin, and cayenne; set aside. In a large bowl, combine coleslaw mix and vinegar; mix lightly, then set aside. In a 1 1/2- to 2-quart pan, bring broth to a boil over high heat. Stir in couscous; then cover and let stand until liquid has been absorbed (about 5 minutes). Heat 2 teaspoons of the oil in a wide nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add half the pork and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned (about 3 minutes). Remove pork to a plate and keep warm. Add 2 teaspoons more oil to pan and repeat stir-frying with remaining pork; add to plate of cooked pork. To pan, add remaining 2 teaspoons oil, onion, ginger, and garlic; stir-fry for 2 minutes. Return pork to pan; stir sauce, then add to pan. Cook, stirring, until sauce boils (about 2 minutes). Meanwhile, spoon cabbage onto a large, deep platter; mound hot couscous on cabbage. Spoon pork and sauce over couscous. Sprinkle with cilantro.
