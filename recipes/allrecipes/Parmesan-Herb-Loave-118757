Place dough in two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Thaw according to package directions. In a small bowl, combine the Parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic, dill and salt. Brush dough with butter; sprinkle with cheese mixture. Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled, about 2-1/2 hours. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
