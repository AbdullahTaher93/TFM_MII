In a large saucepan combine the chicken broth, green onions, carrots, lentils, ginger, curry powder, cumin, and red pepper. Bring mixture to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, for 25 to 30 minutes or until lentils are tender. Stir in the snipped cilantro; cook for 1 minute more. If desired, top each serving with sour cream and garnish with cilantro sprigs.
