Cook and stir sausage in a skillet over medium-high heat until cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove sausage from skillet, draining grease. Cut sausage into thin rounds. Cook and stir onion and garlic in the same skillet until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Combine sausage, onion mixture, beef broth, diced tomatoes, black pepper, Italian seasoning, and salt in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover pot, and simmer until soup flavors blend, about 1 hour. Bring soup to a boil, add tortellini, and cook until tortellini are cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes.
