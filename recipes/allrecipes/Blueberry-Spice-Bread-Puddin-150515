Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place bread cubes and blueberries in buttered 9x9-inch baking pan; mix well. In large bowl, mix together remaining ingredients. Pour evenly over bread cubes and blueberries, completely moistening bread. Let stand 10 minutes. Bake 45 to 50 minutes or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. Cool. Serve warm with ice cream, or chilled. Store leftovers covered in refrigerator.
