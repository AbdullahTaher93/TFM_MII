Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Mix mustard and Italian dressing together in a bowl. Place bread crumbs in a separate bowl. Dip zucchini slices in the mustard mixture; coat with bread crumbs. Arrange coated zucchini in a casserole dish. Bake in the preheated oven until soft, about 30 minutes.
