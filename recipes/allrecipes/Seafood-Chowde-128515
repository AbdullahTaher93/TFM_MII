Warm butter or margarine in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and celery and cook 5 minutes, or until tender. Add broth, pasta, bay leaf, thyme, nutmeg, and red pepper. Heat to boiling. Reduce heat to low and cook 15 minutes, or until pasta is tender. Stir in the evaporated milk, shrimp and/or scallops, clams or oysters (with liquid), fish, pimiento, and parsley. Heat gently 10 minutes, or until fish flakes easily. Remove and discard bay leaf before serving.
