Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 2-quart baking dish with cooking spray. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix tomatoes with green chile peppers, broccoli, Mexican cheese blend, and cream of celery soup into sausage mixture; spread into the prepared baking dish. Arrange potato nuggets over sausage mixture; season with pepper. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and potato nuggets are slightly brown, about 45 minutes.
