Add potatoes to a pot of boiling water and simmer for approximately 25 minutes, or until tender. Drain potatoes, cool to room temperature and chop into cubes. While potatoes are simmering, combine yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, dry mustard, sugar and cayenne and mix until smooth. Toss potatoes with eggs, cucumber, celery and radishes and then mix with dressing and fresh herbs. Season with ground black pepper and chill for at least two hours before serving.
