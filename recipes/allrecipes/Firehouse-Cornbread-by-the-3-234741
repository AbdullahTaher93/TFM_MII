Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 15x10x2-inch baking pan. Whisk flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; stir in milk, vegetable oil, and eggs until batter is evenly combined. Pour batter into prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 33 minutes.
