Start charcoal fire or preheat gas grill to medium-high heat. Combine 2 cups flour, undissolved yeast, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Add very warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Dough should form a ball and will be slightly sticky. Knead** on a floured surface, adding additional flour if necessary, until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. (If using RapidRise Yeast, let dough rest at this point for 10 minutes.) Divide dough into 8 portions. Pat or roll dough on a well-floured counter to about 8-inch circles; they do not need to be perfect. Using hands, lift each crust carefully and place on grill. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until bottom is lightly browned and top looks set. Using long handled tongs, remove crust from grill, grilled side up, to a platter or baking sheet. Spread about 2 tablespoons hummus over the grilled side of each pizza crust. Top with 2 tablespoons asparagus, 1 tablespoon roasted red pepper, about 1 tablespoon goat cheese and a few pinenuts. Repeat with remaining pizzas. Carefully slide each pizza onto the grill. Cook an additional 3 to 4 minutes until bottom of crust is browned and cheese is melted. Remove from grill and serve immediately.
