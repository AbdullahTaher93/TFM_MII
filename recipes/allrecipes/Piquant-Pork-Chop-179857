Sprinkle chops lightly with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a 12- to 14-inch frying pan over medium-high heat. Add chops and cook, turning once, until well browned on both sides and just barely pink in center (cut to test), 8 to 10 minutes. Place one chop on each of two warm dinner plates and keep warm. Drain and discard fat from pan. Pour in wine, add mustard, and bring to a boil over high heat; boil, stirring to loosen drippings, until reduced to about 1/4 cup. Pour sauce evenly over chops; sprinkle chops with cornichons. Arrange lettuce and tomatoes beside chops.
