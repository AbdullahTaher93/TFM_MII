Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 large muffin cups. Mix brown sugar, all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, cranberries, coconut, flax seed, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Add grated apple and carrots; stir to combine. Add pineapple, vegetable oil, applesauce, pecans, eggs, and vanilla extract; stir until just combined. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 35 minutes.
