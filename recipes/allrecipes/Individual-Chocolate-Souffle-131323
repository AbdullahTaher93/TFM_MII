Preheat oven to 350. Coat four 1-cup ramekins with cooking spray. Divide 1 tablespoon sugar among them, tilting in all directions to coat the insides completely. Tap out any excess sugar. In a small saucepan, whisk together remaining 4 tablespoons sugar, cocoa powder, and flour. Slowly whisk in milk and place over medium heat, stirring constantly until sauce thickens and begins to bubble, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and add chocolate; stir until melted. Transfer to a medium mixing bowl and let cool 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Blend in egg yolk and vanilla. In a large bowl, beat egg whites and salt with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Gently fold chocolate mixture into egg whites with a rubber spatula. Divide batter evenly among ramekins and place them on a baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30 to 35 minutes until souffles are set (a toothpick inserted in center should come out clean). Garnish with raspberries and serve immediately.
