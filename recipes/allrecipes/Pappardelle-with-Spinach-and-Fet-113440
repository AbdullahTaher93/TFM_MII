Cook the pappardelle in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente. Drain the pasta in a colander set in the sink, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water. Meanwhile, in a large, deep skillet, cook the spinach over high heat, stirring until wilted, about 1 minute. Drain the spinach in a colander set over a bowl and press gently; reserve the liquid. Coarsely chop the spinach. Wipe out the skillet and add the olive oil and garlic. Cook over moderate heat, stirring, until the garlic is lightly browned. Add the crushed red pepper and cook for 30 seconds. Add the spinach and a generous pinch of salt and cook, stirring until hot, about 1 minute. Add the pasta to the skillet along with the reserved spinach liquid and pasta cooking water and season with salt. Cook until the liquid has nearly evaporated and the spinach is silky, about 3 minutes. Stir in the feta and parsley and serve in deep bowls.
