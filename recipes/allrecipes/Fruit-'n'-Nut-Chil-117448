In a Dutch oven, cook the beef, onion, green pepper and garlic over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the tomatoes, water, apples, beans, tomato paste, almonds, cocoa and seasonings. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 30 minutes or until heated through. Garnish with sour cream if desired.
