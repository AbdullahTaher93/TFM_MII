In a large mixing bowl, cream shortening and 1 cup sugar. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; add to the creamed mixture alternately with milk. Stir in vanilla and chocolate. In a small mixing bowl, beat egg whites on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in the remaining sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, on high until stiff peaks form. Fold into batter. Pour into two greased and floured 9-in. round baking pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. In a small saucepan, melt the chocolate and butter over low heat until smooth. Remove from the heat; transfer to a mixing bowl. Beat in the confectioners' sugar, hot water, vanilla and salt. To assemble, split each cake into two horizontal layers. Place bottom layer on a serving plate; top with 1/3 cup of filling. Repeat layers three times. In a bowl, gently combine the whipped topping, extracts and food coloring. Frost the sides of the cake. Store in the refrigerator.
