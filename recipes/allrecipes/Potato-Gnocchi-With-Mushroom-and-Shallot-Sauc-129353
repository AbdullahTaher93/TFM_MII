Gnocchi: Cook the potatoes in salted, boiling water for 15 to 20 minutes, or until tender. Drain and peel them. Use a potato masher to mash them and spread them on a surface to cool. Season with salt and add the flour. Knead the mixture into a ball. Pull off 1-inch-thick logs. Cut the logs into 1-inch lengths and press against the times of a fork or slide along a floured ridged board, making sure they are not too close together. Sauce: Drain the mushrooms, straining the water through a coffee filter or paper towel to remove grit. Finely chop the mushrooms. Saute the shallots, onion and mushrooms in the oil in a saucepan over medium heat for about five minutes. Increase the heat and pour in the wine. Mix the tomato paste into 1/4 cup of the filtered mushroom water. Add to the saucepan. Season with salt and pepper and simmer over medium heat for about 20 minutes, adding the stock as the sauce starts to thicken and stick to the bottom of the pan. Cook the gnocchi in small batches in a large pot of salted boiling water until they rise to the surface, about two minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the gnocchi and transfer to the sauce. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve.
