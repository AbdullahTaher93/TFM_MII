Rub turkey tenderloin with dry sage. Season with salt and pepper. Lay out prosciutto slices and place turkey on one end, then roll up around turkey completely. Secure with toothpicks. In a saute pan heat olive oil. Place turkey in pan and cook until golden and crispy on all sides. Place on a baking tray and place in a preheated 350 degree F oven for about 12-15 minutes or until cooked throughout. Let rest 10 minutes before slicing. In a mixing bowl add the salad greens, Kalamata olives and mozzarella. Toss lightly with dressing. Place equal amounts of salad onto plates. Slice turkey and place slices over salad. Serve.
