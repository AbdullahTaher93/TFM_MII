In a soup pot, add the lentils, water (or stock), garlic, oregano, cumin and bay leaf. Bring to a boil and then cover and reduce to a simmer for 1 hour. Remove bay leaf. Meanwhile; in a fry pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onions and celery and saute for about 5 minutes. Add to the lentils (within the first 15 minutes of their cooking time). Add the ham to the lentils. Cover and simmer for about 15-20 minutes until heated through. Stir occasionally in a gentle manner. Taste and add salt and pepper as desired.
