In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add warm milk, sugar, butter, salt, egg and 2 cups flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. Line two baking sheets with foil and grease well; set aside. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Roll each portion into a 14-in. x 7-in. rectangle. Spread cherries over dough to within 1/2 in. of edges. Combine the flour, brown sugar and pecans; sprinkle over cherries. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch seams and tuck ends under. Place seam side down on prepared baking sheets; pinch ends together to form a ring. With kitchen scissors, cut from outside edge two-thirds of the way toward center of ring at 1-in. intervals. Separate strips slightly and twist to allow filling to show. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks. Combine icing ingredients; drizzle over warm coffee cakes.
