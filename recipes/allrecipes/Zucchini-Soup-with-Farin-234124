Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and green onion in hot butter until softened, about 5 minutes. Add chicken broth, zucchini, vinegar, and dill to the saucepan; bring to a boil. Gradually pour farina into the broth mixture while stirring. Reduce heat to low, loosely cover saucepan, and cook broth mixture at a simmer until the zucchini is tender, about 15 minutes more. Blend soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Add cream cheese and blend again until the cheese is fully incorporated.
