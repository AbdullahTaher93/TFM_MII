Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 13 x 9-inch baking pan with no-stick cooking spray. Spread almonds on baking sheet. Bake 7 to 10 minutes or until golden brown, stirring several times. Cool completely. Chop coarsely. Combine brown sugar, shortening, coffee crystals, milk, vanilla and almond extracts in large bowl; beat at medium speed until well blended. Add eggs; beat well. Combine flour, cocoa, salt and baking soda in medium bowl. Add to shortening mixture; beat at low speed just until blended. Stir in chocolate chips and reserved almonds. Spread mixture evenly in prepared pan. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until set. Cool completely on wire rack. Cut into 2 x 1 1/2-inch bars. Stir coffee and hot water until dissolved; let cool slightly. Combine powdered sugar and coffee in small bowl; stir until well blended. Add additional water, a little at a time, if frosting is too thick, or add additional powdered sugar, if frosting is too thin. Drizzle glaze over bars.
