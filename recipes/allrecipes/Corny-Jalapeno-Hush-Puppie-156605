In a bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. In a separate bowl combine the egg, milk, onion, corn, and jalapeno. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. In an electric skillet or deep fryer, heat oil to 375 degrees F. Drop batter tablespoon by tablespoon into oil. Fry 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown, turning occasionally. Drain on paper towels, serve warm.
