Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add squash and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool. In a large bowl combine eggs, milk, cheese, salt, baking powder, flour and chiles; mix well. Fold in squash. Sprinkle half of the crushed corn chips in the bottom of the prepared dish. Spoon the squash mixture into the dish, and top with the remaining crushed chips. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
