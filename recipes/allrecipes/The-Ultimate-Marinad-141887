Place the sesame seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir for 5 minutes, or until golden brown and fragrant. In a medium bowl, mix toasted sesame seeds, green onions, garlic, tahini, soy sauce, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, red wine vinegar, and pepper. Place desired meat in the mixture, cover, and marinate as long as you like, but overnight is best. Grill as desired.
