Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat. Stir the ginger into the hot oil, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the razor clams in their shells, and cook until all of the clams have opened, about 2 minutes. Stir in the sa cha sauce and water, and bring to a boil. Toss with the bell pepper and green onions to serve.
