Heat olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook shallot in hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Pour wine into saucepan; cook, stirring regularly, until reduced in volume by half, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir beef broth with the wine. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook at a simmer until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Stir butter and Italian seasoning into the sauce; cook until butter is completely melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt.
