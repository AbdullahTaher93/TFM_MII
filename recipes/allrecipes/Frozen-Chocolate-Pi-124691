In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Add cocoa alternately with milk; mix well. Fold in whipped topping. Pour into pie shell. Freeze for 8 hours or overnight. If desired, garnish with chocolate curls or chips. Serve directly from the freezer (pie does not need to be thawed to cut).
