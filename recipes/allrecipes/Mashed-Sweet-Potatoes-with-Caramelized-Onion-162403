Place sweet potatoes in large saucepan with enough water to cover. Heat to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer 20 to 25 minutes, or until fork tender; drain. When potatoes are cool enough to handle, slip off skins. Return potatoes to saucepan and mash. Stir in burger topper, butter, cream and salt. Spoon potatoes into serving dish; sprinkle with pecans.
