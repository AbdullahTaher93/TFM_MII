In a large skillet, saute the zucchini, onion and garlic in butter until tender; set aside. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, basil, marjoram and salt. Stir in zucchini mixture and Monterey Jack cheese. Pour into a greased 1-qt. baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
