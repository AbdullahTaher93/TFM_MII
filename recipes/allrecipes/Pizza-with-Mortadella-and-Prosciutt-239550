Using, hand-tossed pizza dough, place on a hot grill for approximately 3 to 4 minutes until the bottom is firm. Turn it over and brush with olive oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place mortadella and prosciutto on the pizza. Then top with thinly sliced fresno peppers and shaved parmesan cheese. Grill until cheese is melted (about 5 minutes).
