Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add corn; cook until tender, about 6 minutes. Drain. Cook corn on the preheated grill until lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Cool until easily handled, 5 to 10 minutes. Cut corn kernels off the cob with a sharp knife. Transfer to a large bowl; add tomato, Monterey Jack cheese, orange bell pepper, cucumber, and cilantro. Stir in balsamic vinegar, sea salt, pepper, and garlic powder; mix to combine.
