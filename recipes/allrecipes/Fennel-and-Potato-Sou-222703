Slice the fennel into medium-size pieces. Heat butter and olive oil together in a pot over medium-low heat. Add sliced fennel, spring onions, and 1 cup of the stock. Cover and simmer gently for 15 minutes until fennel is soft and translucent. Pour remaining stock into the pot; add potato. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer gently until the potato is very soft and cooked through, about 25 minutes. Gently mash vegetables with a potato masher or the back of a wooden spoon until soup is thick and chunky. If soup is too thick, stir in water by tablespoons to your desired consistency. Season with black pepper. Let rest 5 minutes to allow flavors to develop before serving.
