Place snow peas in a small saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil; boil for 1 minute. Drain and set aside. In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch, salt, pepper and milk until smooth; set aside. In a large nonstick skillet or wok coated with nonstick cooking spray, stir-fry chicken in 1 teaspoon hot oil for 5 minutes or until juices run clear. Remove and keep warm. In the same pan, stir-fry mushrooms and ginger in remaining oil for 2 minutes. Add peas; stir-fry 2 minutes longer. Stir cornstarch mixture and stir into mushroom mixture. Return chicken to pan. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Serve over rice. Sprinkle with parsley.
