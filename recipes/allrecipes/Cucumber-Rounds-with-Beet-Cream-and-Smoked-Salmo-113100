In a bowl, combine the sour cream, cream cheese, beets and fennel seeds and stir well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Place a cucumber round on a platter and top with a dollop of the beet mixture. Roll up a salmon strip and place on top of the beet mixture. Repeat with the remaining cucumber rounds.
