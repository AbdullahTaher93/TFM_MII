Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Peel potatoes, if desired, and slice thinly (you should have 6 cups). Place slices in a colander. Rinse with cold water; set aside to drain. For sauce, in a medium saucepan cook onion and garlic in hot butter over medium heat until tender but not brown. Stir in flour, salt, and pepper. Add LACTAID(R) Whole Milk all at once. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Remove from heat; stir in snipped sage. Grease a 2-quart casserole. Layer half of potatoes in casserole. Cover with half the sauce. Repeat layering with the potatoes and sauce. Bake casserole, covered, in a 350 degree F oven for 45 minutes. Uncover; bake 15 to 20 minutes more or until potatoes are just tender. Sprinkle 1/3 cup of toasted walnuts over top, if desired. Let stand 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh sage leaves, if desired.
