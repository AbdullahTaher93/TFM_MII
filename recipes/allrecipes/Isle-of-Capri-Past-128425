In a food processor or blender, combine the spinach, basil, parsley, Parmesan, broth, oil, garlic, red-pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper. Process for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Stop occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Cook the penne in a large pot of boiling water according to the package directions. Drain and place in a large serving bowl. Add the spinach-basil pesto and toss to coat well. Add the roasted red peppers and peas. Toss to mix.
