Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Place cranberries in 2-cup glass measure and cover with near-boiling water. Set aside, allowing berries to soak while you complete the next step. In large bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In another large bowl, beat SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, oil, orange juice, applesauce, and egg substitute until smooth. Gently stir into flour mixture until thoroughly blended. Do not overmix. Use a sieve to drain water off of berries, and fold berries into batter (discard cranberry water). Transfer batter to pan and bake 50 minutes or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool cake in pan on a wire rack 10 minutes. To serve, cut cake into twelve 3/4-inch slices.
