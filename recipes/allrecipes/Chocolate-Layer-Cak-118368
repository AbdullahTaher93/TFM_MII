Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat shortening and sugar in a bowl until creamy. Beat in egg and vanilla extract. Combine flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl; add to creamed mixture alternately with milk. Pour into a greased and floured 9-inch round baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool in pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. For frosting, in a small mixing bowl, cream butter. Gradually beat in the confectioners' sugar, cocoa, vanilla and enough water to achieve spreading consistency. To assemble, cut cake in half. Place one half on a serving plate. Spread with 1/2 cup frosting. Top with remaining cake. Spread remaining frosting over top and rounded edge of cake.
