Heat oven to 375 degrees F(190 degrees C) In a large bowl, combine bread cubes, melted margarine, raisins, and cinnamon; mix well, and transfer to a 2 quart baking dish. Use the same bowl to beat the eggs and egg substitute. Stir in SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend for Baking, vanilla, and salt. Warm the milk and half-and-half in the microwave until hot, about 2 minutes. Slowly whisk into the egg mixture. Pour egg mixture over bread cubes, sprinkle with nutmeg, and set aside to soak for 5 minutes. Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.
