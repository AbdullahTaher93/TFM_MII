Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 13 inch x 9 inch (32.5 x 23-cm) baking pan. Place the chocolate and butter in a microwaveable bowl. Microwave on high for 4 minutes, or until the butter is melted. Remove from the microwave oven and stir constantly to fully melt the chocolate. Stir in the sugar until well-blended. Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring after each addition, until well-blended. Stir in the vanilla extract and flour. Spread into the prepared pan. Bake for 40 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Place on a rack and cool slightly. Place the chips on the warm brownies and spread to form a glaze. Cool in the pan on a rack.
