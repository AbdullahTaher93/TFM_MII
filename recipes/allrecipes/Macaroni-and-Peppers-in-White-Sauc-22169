Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, cook onions until translucent. Stir in peppers and cook until just tender. Stir in bouillon cube, wine, oregano, paprika, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Simmer 20 minutes, until thickened. Reduce heat to low and stir in feta, Gouda and creme fraiche. When cheese is melted, toss sauce with pasta and serve.
