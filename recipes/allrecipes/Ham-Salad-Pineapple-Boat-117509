Stand pineapple upright and cut in half, leaving the top attached. Remove fruit, leaving a 1-in. shell. Dice fruit; set aside 1 cup for salad and refrigerate the remaining fruit for another use. In a bowl, combine mayonnaise and mustard. Stir in the ham, celery, green pepper and reserved pineapple. Spoon into pineapple halves.
