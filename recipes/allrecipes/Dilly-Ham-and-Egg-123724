In a skillet, saute ham, onion and green pepper in butter until vegetables are crisp-tender. Transfer to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with 3/4 cup cheese. In a bowl, beat eggs, sour cream and milk; mix in the next eight ingredients. Pour into the baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until eggs are set. Top with remaining cheese.
