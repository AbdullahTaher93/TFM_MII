Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Mix Duncan Hines(R) Devils Food Cake Mix, flour, eggs, vegetable oil and water. Using a tablespoon, scoop batter onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Put no more than 6 to 8 on a sheet pan, as the batter will spread. Bake for 8 minutes. Let cool completely. Pour 1 packet of Duncan Hines(R) Frosting Creations(TM) Orange Creme Flavour Mix into 1 can of Duncan Hines(R) Frosting Creations(TM) Frosting Starter. Stir until evenly blended. Repeat with second can and packet. Spread 1 tablespoon of the Orange Creme frosting you just created on the flat sides of half of the whoopie pies and top with remaining pies.
