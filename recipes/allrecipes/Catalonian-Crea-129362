Dissolve the cornstarch in 1/2 cup milk in a small bowl. Set aside. Bring the remaining 3 1/2 cups milk, lemon zest, and cinnamon to a oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Beat the egg yolks and sugar with an electric mixer at high speed until pale and thick. Slowly pour the boiling milk into the eggs and sugar. Return to the heat and gradually add the cornstarch mixture, stirring constantly. Bring to a boil and cook 2-3 minutes over low heat, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and pour into individual ramekins. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before serving.
