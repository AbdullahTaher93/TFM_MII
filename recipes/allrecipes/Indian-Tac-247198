Mix flour, salt, and baking powder together in a bowl. Stir in enough water to make a dough. Divide dough into 4 pieces and form into 6-inch patties. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry patties in batches until puffed and golden, about 5 minutes per side. Place bannocks on serving plates and top with chili, tomato, Cheddar cheese, and lettuce.
