Puree the parsley, rosemary, garlic, Parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and bread crumbs in a blender until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper; set aside. Brush the lamb steaks on one side with the beaten egg. Spread the rosemary pesto onto the egg-coated side of the lamb, coating liberally. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place the lamb steaks into the pan, pesto-side down. Cook 3 to 4 minutes until the pesto mixture has lightly browned. Turn the steaks over, and continue cooking until done to your desired degree of doneness, 3 to 4 minutes for medium.
