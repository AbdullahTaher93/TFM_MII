Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir green onions and garlic in the butter until softened, about 2 minutes. Add frozen shrimp; cook and stir until thawed, about 5 minutes. Transfer shrimp to a bowl. Whisk wine and cornstarch together in a small bowl until smooth. Pour over the green onions and garlic in the skillet. Stir in heavy cream, lime juice, Creole seasoning, sugar, salt, and pepper; simmer until mixture thickens, about 3 minutes. Return shrimp to the skillet. Stir in spinach and basil. Cook and stir until shrimp is heated through and spinach is wilted, about 5 minutes. Serve over angel hair pasta.
