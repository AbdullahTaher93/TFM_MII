In a large skillet sprayed with nonstick vegetable cooking spray, over medium-high heat, add 1/2 tbsp vegetable oil. When hot, add chicken and cook, stirring 4 to 5 minutes until no longer pink. Remove chicken and set aside. In the same skillet, add remaining 1/2 tbsp vegetable oil and mushrooms. Saute 3 to 4 minutes. Add wine, low-fat sour cream and salt to the skillet. Stir and heat through. Add chicken and serve over linguine noodles. Top with slivered almonds.
