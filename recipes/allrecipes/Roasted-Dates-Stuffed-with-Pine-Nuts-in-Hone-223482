Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish. Soak pine nuts in a bowl with white wine and 1/4 cup honey to infuse flavor, at least 30 minutes. Drain. Mix Gorgonzola cheese and pine nuts together in a bowl. Spread dates open slightly; season the inside of each date with black pepper. Spoon Gorgonzola mixture into each date. Season the outside of each date with salt. Arrange stuffed dates in a baking dish. Cover with 1 cup honey. Bake in the preheated oven until warmed, about 10 minutes. Transfer cooked dates to a serving platter. Garnish with almonds.
