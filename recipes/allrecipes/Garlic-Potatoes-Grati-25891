Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. In the prepared dish layer 1/2 of the potatoes, 1/2 of the cheese, then the remaining potatoes. Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Saute garlic until fragrant and golden brown; pour over potatoes. Combine cream, salt and pepper; pour evenly over potatoes and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake in preheated oven for 75 minutes. Serve immediately.
