In a bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar and pecans. Stir in butter; mix well. Set aside 1/3 cup for topping. Press remaining mixture into a greased 8-in. square baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until lightly browned. Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar. Beat in the egg, milk, lemon juice and vanilla. Pour over crust; sprinkle with reserved pecan mixture. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until firm. Cool on a wire rack. Cut into 16 squares, then cut each square in half diagonally. Store in the refrigerator.
