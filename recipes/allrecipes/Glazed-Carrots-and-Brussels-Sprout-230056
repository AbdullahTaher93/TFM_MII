Fill a large pot 3/4 full of water and bring to a rolling boil. Add Brussels sprouts and carrots, bring back to a boil, and cook vegetables until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain. Heat butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion in the melted butter until tender, about 5 minutes. Add beef consomme, apple juice, cornstarch, lemon juice, brown sugar, and cloves. Cook, stirring often, until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes. Fold Brussels sprouts and carrots into sauce.
