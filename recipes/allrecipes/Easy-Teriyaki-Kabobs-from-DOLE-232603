Combine 1/2 cup teriyaki sauce, 2 tablespoons pineapple juice and oil; pour over meat pieces in shallow glass dish. Refrigerate; marinate 1 hour, turning occasionally. Thread meat on skewers alternating with vegetables and pineapple chunks. Discard remaining marinade. Grill 4 to 5 inches from heat, turning skewers and brushing with additional marinade, about 15 minutes or until desired doneness.
