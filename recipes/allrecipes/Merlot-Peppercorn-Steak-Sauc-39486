Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the mushrooms, garlic, and peppercorns, and saute until the mushrooms are tender. Pour in the wine, balsamic, and Worcestershire sauce, increase the heat to medium-high, and reduce by 1/3. Stir in the rosemary and cook for 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant.
