Mix chicken with ground ginger, black pepper, garlic salt, and sesame oil in a bowl; cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook broccoli, bell pepper, and mushrooms in the boiling water until broccoli is just tender, about 3 minutes; drain. Whisk cornstarch and 1/2 cup water together in bowl. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chicken until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir cooked vegetables, jicama, brown sugar, and honey into chicken. Add cornstarch mixture and continue cooking and stirring until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes more. Sprinkle sesame and peanuts over chicken and vegetables before serving.
