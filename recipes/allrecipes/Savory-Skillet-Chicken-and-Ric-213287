Heat the butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until it's well browned, stirring often. Stir the soup, milk, onion, thyme and black pepper into the skillet. Heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. Stir in the beans and rice. Cover the skillet and remove from the heat. Let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork.
