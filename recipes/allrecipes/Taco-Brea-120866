In a mixing bowl, combine 1-1/2 cups flour, cornmeal, taco seasoning, sugar, yeast, onion and salt. In a saucepan, heat the soup, water and butter to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. Stir in chilies and enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Shape into a loaf. Place in a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm.
