Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Stir the feta cheese, pimento peppers, Greek seasoning, black pepper, and olive oil together in a bowl; place about 2 tablespoons of the mixture on each of the 8 bell pepper segments. Wrap each segment with a slice of bacon; secure with toothpicks and arrange on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the bacon is brown and beginning to crisp, about 20 minutes. Serve hot.
