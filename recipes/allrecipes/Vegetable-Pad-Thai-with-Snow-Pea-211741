In a large pan heat oil over medium-high, saute onions, cabbage, red pepper, carrots and snow peas until tender, about 12 minutes. Add VH(R) Pad Thai Sauce and noodles to pan and toss until heated through. Serve sprinkled with peanuts. To avoid noodles from sticking to the pan turn off heat while tossing with sauce.
