Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Stir milk and cornmeal together so the cornmeal is completely wet; let soak for 5 minutes. Stir flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl with a whisk; add cornmeal mixture, eggs, and coconut oil and stir until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.
