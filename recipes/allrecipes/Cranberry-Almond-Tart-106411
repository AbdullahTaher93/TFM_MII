Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Unroll pastry and roll to 1/8-inch thickness on a lightly floured surface; using a 2- inch square cookie cutter, cut out 24 squares, re-rolling pastry, if necessary. Place squares in ungreased miniature muffin pans. Place in freezer. Combine SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and water in a saucepan, stirring until blended. Stir in cranberries. Bring mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring constantly 2 minutes or until berries pop. Pour through a wire-mesh sieve, set over a bowl. Return liquid to saucepan; reserving berries. Bring liquid to a boil; reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes or until liquid is reduced to about 3 tablespoons. Pour sauce over cranberries, tossing to coat. Stir in almonds and almond extract. Spoon mixture into pastry shells. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until pastry is golden and filling is set. Carefully remove tarts from muffin tins; cool on a wire rack.
