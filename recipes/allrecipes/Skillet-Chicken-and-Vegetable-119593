In a large skillet, saute the chicken, garlic and basil in oil for 4 minutes. Add the mushrooms, zucchini, onion and peppers. Cook and stir for 5-7 minutes or until chicken juices run clear and vegetables are crisp-tender. Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti according to package directions. Stir the mayonnaise and 3 tablespoons Parmesan cheese into chicken mixture. Drain spaghetti; top with chicken mixture. Sprinkle with remaining cheese.
