Heat canola oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Season oil with onion powder and garlic powder. Cook and stir rice in seasoned oil until rice is golden, 2 to 4 minutes. Pour water and tomato sauce over the rice; stir. Bring the mixture to a boil, cover the skillet, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the rice is tender, about 15 minutes.
