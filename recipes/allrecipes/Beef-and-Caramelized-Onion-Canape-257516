Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spread baguette slices on a baking sheet. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook and stir red onion until it starts to soften, about 5 minutes. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until completely soft, about 10 minutes. Uncover and pour in red wine; increase heat and stir constantly until wine evaporates, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. Bake baguette slices in the preheated oven until lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Mix mayonnaise and horseradish together in a bowl. Spread mayonnaise-horseradish mixture over baguette slices; cover with onion and roast beef.
