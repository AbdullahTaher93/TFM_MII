Place bacon slices in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels; chop into smaller pieces. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Arrange potato chips in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle bacon and cheese curds evenly on top. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese curds start to melt and chips start to brown around the edges, about 4 minutes. Top with pepperoncini peppers and black pepper. Let cool. Transfer to a serving bowl.
