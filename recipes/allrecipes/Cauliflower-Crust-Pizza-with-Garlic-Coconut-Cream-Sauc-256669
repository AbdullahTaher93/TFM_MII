Preheat oven to 425 degrees (400 if using a convection oven). Cut cauliflower into medium-small sized florets, and steam until fork tender. Blend cauliflower in food processor until it looks like rice or quinoa in size, then, in a kitchen towel, squeeze out excess water and place cauliflower into a large bowl. In a separate bowl, mix flax seed and warm water, and allow to sit for 10 minutes. Mix all crust ingredients into large bowl (with cauliflower) and mix with hands until just combined. On a sheet pan lined with parchment paper, spray parchment paper with non-stick spray (or use silicone baking sheet) and press out dough until around 1/2 inch thick, (with slightly thicker edges). Cook crust for around 45 minutes, or until just browned and fairly solid. While crust cooks, blend garlic, culinary coconut milk, 1 tablespoon oregano, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in saucepan over medium heat, and cook until thick (or has reduced by about 1/2). Add sauce to crust, and top rest of mozzarella-style shreds and your favorite sliced vegetables (for example, 1 cup each (85 g) sliced Brussels sprouts, yellow squash, and red peppers). Place topped pizza back in oven for around 12 minutes or until toppings are just starting to crisp. Slice into squares or rectangular slices.
