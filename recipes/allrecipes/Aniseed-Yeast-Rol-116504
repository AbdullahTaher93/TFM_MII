In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups flour, brown sugar, salt, yeast and 3 teaspoons aniseed. In a saucepan, heat water and butter to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat just until moistened. Add five eggs; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into 22 pieces. Shape each into a ball. Place 2 in. apart on grease baking sheets. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes. Beat remaining egg; brush over dough. Sprinkle with remaining aniseed. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-22 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks.
