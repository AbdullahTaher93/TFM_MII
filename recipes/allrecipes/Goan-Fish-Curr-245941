Season fish pieces with salt. Grind coconut, red chiles, garlic, coriander, and peppercorns together with a morter and pestle until a fine paste forms. Combine paste and turmeric powder in a pot and bring to a boil; add fish. Lower temperature to medium and cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes. Add kokum and mix well.
