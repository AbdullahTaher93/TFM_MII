Make Stir-Fry Sauce. Combine the Stir-Fry Sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside. Make Stir-Fry. In a large skillet or wok, heat the oil and stir-fry the green beans until they are barely crisp (approx. 2 minutes). Add the water and continue stir-frying for another 2 minutes, until the beans are slightly tender and water has evaporated. Add the sauce and continue stir-frying for 5-6 minutes, until the beans are tender but not overcooked. Serve immediately.
