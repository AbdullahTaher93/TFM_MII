In a medium saucepan, heat pineapple and juice over medium heat until boiling. Add gelatin and stir to dissolve. Remove from heat and refrigerate until partially set. In a small bowl, blend the pimento into the softened cream cheese. Mix the gelatin mixture and cream cheese together, and then fold in the whipped cream, nuts and celery. Pour into a 1 1/2 quart mold and chill until firm.
