Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook radiatore in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 to 15 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water. Soak in cold water for 3 minutes. Drain again. Combine radiatore, ham, red bell pepper, zucchini, black olives, Cotija cheese, and Greek dressing together in a large bowl; toss to coat.
