In a small bowl, combine 1 cup cream and lemon juice; let stand for 1 hour at room temperature. Place the remaining cream in a blender or food processor. Add the eggs, egg yolks, cream cheese, 4 tablespoons butter and Parmesan cheese; cover and process until blended. Transfer mixture to a large bowl; fold in the broccoli, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Spoon 1 cup broccoli mixture into six 6-oz. ramekins. Place cups in a baking pan. Fill pan with boiling water to a depth of 1 in. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. For sauce, combine flour and remaining butter to form a paste. In a large, heavy saucepan, combine the lemon-cream mixture, chicken bouillon and remaining salt and pepper. Bring to boil. Whisk butter mixture into cream mixture until smooth and mixture is thickened. Add snipped dill. Remove from the heat and set aside. Carefully run a knife around the edge of each custard cup to loosen. Arrange on individual serving plates top side up. Spoon sauce around each timbale and garnish with dill sprigs if desired.
