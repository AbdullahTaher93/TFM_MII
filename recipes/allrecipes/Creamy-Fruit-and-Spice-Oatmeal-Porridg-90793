In a 3 to 4-quart pan, combine 2 3/4 cups water, oats, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, raisins, and dates. Bring to a boil, then cook, covered, stirring often, until almost all the water is absorbed, about 5 minutes for regular oats, 1 1/2 minutes for quick-cooking. Stir in milk to create desired texture, and top with optional additions, if desired.
