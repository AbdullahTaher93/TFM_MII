Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9-inch pie plate with non-stick cooking spray. Microwave caramels and heavy cream in a microwave-safe bowl on HIGH for 21/2 minutes or until melted, stirring after 1 1/2 minute. Pour caramel mixture into prepared pie plate. Place drained pie filling over caramel mixture and sprinkle with pecans. Separate biscuits and place snugly in pan. Brush with the melted butter. Bake 25 minutes, or until golden brown. Invert immediately onto serving plate, scraping any remaining caramel over biscuits. Serve warm.
