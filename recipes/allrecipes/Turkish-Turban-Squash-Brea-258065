Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place turban squash halves cut-side in a baking dish. Pour a small amount of water into the bottom of the dish. Bake in the preheated oven until very soft, about 1 hour. Pour out any moisture that accumulated in the cavity of the squash. Let cool until easily handled, 10 to 15 minutes. Scoop squash flesh into a large bowl. Mash until smooth. Transfer to gallon-sized freezer bags and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9x5-inch loaf pans. Combine 4 cups mashed squash, eggs, white sugar, dark brown sugar, applesauce, oil, vanilla extract, and ginger in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until well blended, about 3 minutes. Whisk all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves together in a separate bowl. Stir into the squash mixture with a wooden spoon until just blended. Fold dried cranberries into the batter. Divide batter between the prepared loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
