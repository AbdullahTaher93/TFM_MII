In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, beat the eggs, buttermilk and butter. Stir in dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in rice, blueberries and cranberries. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
