Rinse chicken; pat dry. Combine 1/4 cup flour, salt, and pepper in a plastic bag. Add chicken, a few at a time, shaking to coat. Cook chicken in hot margarine or butter in large skillet over medium-high heat 8 to 10 minutes or until tender and no longer pink, turning once. Reduce heat as necessary during cooking to prevent overbrowning. Remove from skillet, reserving any drippings. Keep warm. For sauce, combine broth and 3 tablespoons flour in screw-top jar. Cover and shake well; add to skillet. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir 1 minute longer. Stir in ReaLemon(R) and sugar; heat through. Serve sauce over chicken. Sprinkle with chives.
