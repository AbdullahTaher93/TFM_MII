In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over high heat, bring broth and saffron to a boil. Stir in rice and seasoning packet, reduce heat, and simmer, covered, until rice is tender to bite, 16 to 18 minutes. Meanwhile, in an 8- to 10-inch frying pan over medium heat, stir linguica and bell pepper until meat is well browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat (if using frozen shrimp, add to pan now and stir often until they are warm to the touch, about 4 minutes). To rice, stir in sausage mixture, shrimp, scallops, and peas. Cover and cook over medium heat until scallops are no longer translucent and peas are hot to touch, about 4 minutes.
