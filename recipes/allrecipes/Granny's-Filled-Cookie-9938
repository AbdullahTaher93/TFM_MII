Mix cream cheese and butter well in large bowl until well blended and creamy. Add in flour slowly, beating well after each addition. Roll dough into 1-inch balls and wrap well in cellophane. Store in fridge overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Roll out dough balls flat and place a 1/2 teaspoon full of the jam in the center. Fold sides over and place on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for 13-15 minutes until brown and the jam starts to bubble hard. Cool for 3 minutes and place on cooling rack. Sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired.
