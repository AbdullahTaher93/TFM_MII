In a small bowl, mix together peanut butter, honey, and cinnamon. Spread about 2 tablespoons of the peanut butter spread over one side of one slice of bread. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon raisins evenly over peanut butter, and place a slice of bread on top of the raisins to make a sandwich. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
