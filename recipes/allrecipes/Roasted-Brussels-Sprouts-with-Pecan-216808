Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place the Brussels sprouts, pecans, olive oil, and garlic onto a large rimmed baking sheet, and toss the ingredients together until well combined and coated with oil. Spread out into a single layer, and turn the Brussels sprouts to face cut sides down. Roast in the preheated oven until golden brown and tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
