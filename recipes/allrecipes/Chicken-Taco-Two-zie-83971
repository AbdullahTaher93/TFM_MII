In large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook 3 minutes. Stir in 1 package Chicken Taco Spices & Seasonings and water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and cook, uncovered, 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. In medium bowl, mix together beans and remaining package Chicken Taco Spices & Seasonings. Spread about 1/3 cup seasoned beans all the way to edges of each flour tortilla. Place a taco shell on center of each bean-tortilla and fold edges up around shell, lightly pressing to 'stick' tortilla to shell. Fill each taco with about 3 tablespoons seasoned chicken. Top with your choice of taco toppings.
