In a large soup or stock pot, combine tomatoes, onion, jalapenos, cumin, salt, sugar, vinegar, garlic, tomato sauce, tomato paste, ketchup, and water (add enough water to bring the mixture to your desired consistency). Bring mixture to a slow boil, reduce heat and let simmer for at least 2 hours. Let the mixture cool completely, then pour into individual jars. Store in refrigerator. Will keep for several weeks.
