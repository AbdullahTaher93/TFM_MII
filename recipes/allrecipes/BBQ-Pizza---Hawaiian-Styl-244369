Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place pizza crust on a pizza pan or baking sheet. Spread barbeque sauce over crust and top with ham, pineapple, bacon, and green onions. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over toppings. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, 12 to 20 minutes.
