Freeze banana halves for 2 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Wrap each frozen banana half with crescent roll dough until each is completely covered; arrange on a nonstick baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 14 minutes. Place each wrapped banana in a serving dish and top with 1 scoop ice cream, 1 teaspoon chocolate syrup, and 1 teaspoon caramel sauce.
