In a bowl, mix the ground pork with the soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, cornstarch, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Marinate at least 10 minutes. Place the tofu in a microwave-safe dish. Place the pork over the tofu. Discard any remaining marinade. Top with green onion, carrots, and chile pepper. Cover with microwave-safe plastic wrap. Cut a small slit in the plastic wrap to vent steam. Cook 5 minutes on High in the microwave, or until vegetables are tender and pork is cooked to desired doneness.
