Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Season ribs with salt and pepper. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Cook ribs, turning occasionally, until well browned on all sides. Add wine (if using), water, caraway seeds, and brown sugar; stir to dissolve sugar. Stir in drained sauerkraut, apple, and carrots, and transfer to a large casserole dish. Bake, covered, in the preheated oven for 2 1/2 hours, adding water as needed to prevent drying out.
