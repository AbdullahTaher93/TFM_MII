In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix in the mashed potatoes and egg until well blended. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or heavy deep skillet to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). Carefully drop the potato mixture by spoonfuls into the hot oil, and fry until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from oil to drain on paper towels.
