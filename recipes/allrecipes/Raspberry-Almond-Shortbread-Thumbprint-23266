Combine butter, sugar and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract in large bowl. Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until creamy. Reduce speed to low; add flour. Beat until well mixed. Cover; refrigerate at least 1 hour. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Place 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets. Make indentation in center of each cookie with thumb (edges may crack slightly). Fill each indentation with about 1/4 teaspoon jam. Bake for 14 to 18 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Let stand 1 minute; remove from cookie sheet. Cool completely. Meanwhile, stir together all glaze ingredients in small bowl with wire whisk until smooth. Add an additional teaspoonful of water if desired for drizzling consistency. Drizzle over cooled cookies.
