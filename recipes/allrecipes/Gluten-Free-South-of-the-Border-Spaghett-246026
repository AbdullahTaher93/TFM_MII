Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile in a large skillet, saute garlic in 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat for about 1 minute. Add ground turkey and brown well until cooked through. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. In a small bowl, make the salsa by combining the corn, tomatoes, onion, parsley, Anaheim pepper and lime juice. Season with salt to taste, mix well and set aside. Cook pasta according to package directions. Add 1 cup of the cooking water to the ground turkey and bring to a simmer. Add sour cream and stir to combine. Drain the pasta and toss with the turkey and sauce. Remove the skillet from the heat and add half of the cheese and half of the salsa. Stir to combine. Before serving, top with the remaining cheese and salsa.
