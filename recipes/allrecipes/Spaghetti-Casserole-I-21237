Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, cook ground beef until brown. Drain. Place beef in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Top with tomatoes, tomato soup and tomato juice. Layer spaghetti over tomatoes and top with shredded cheddar. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, until cheese is golden and bubbly.
