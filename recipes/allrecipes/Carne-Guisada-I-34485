Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Cook beef until evenly brown. Pour off excess fat. Stir in tomato paste, beef broth and water. Season with garlic, chili powder, cumin, black pepper, salt and serrano peppers. Reduce heat, and simmer for 8 to 12 hours. Dissolve cornstarch in a small amount of water, and stir into simmering stew until thickened, about 5 minutes.
