Arrange the chicken breasts into the bottom of a baking dish. Stir the tzatziki sauce, red onion, cumin, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; pour evenly over the chicken. Allow to marinate at least 30 minutes. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake the marinated chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
