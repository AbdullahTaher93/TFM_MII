Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir 1 cup flour, brown sugar, oats, and melted butter together in a bowl. Press 1/2 to 3/4 of the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch square baking dish. Beat eggs and milk together in a large bowl until smooth. Stir rhubarb, strawberries, white sugar, 1/4 cup flour, and allspice into the egg mixture until the flour and sugar dissolve completely; pour over the crust. Sprinkle remaining crust mixture over the top of the fruit layer. Bake in preheated oven until the filling is set, 45 to 60 minutes.
