In an 8-in. skillet, heat butter until it sizzles. Saute mushrooms, caraway seed and lemon pepper for 3-5 minutes. In a small bowl, beat eggs, milk salt and pepper. Pour over mushrooms. Cook over medium heat. As eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. When eggs are set, fold omelet in half.
