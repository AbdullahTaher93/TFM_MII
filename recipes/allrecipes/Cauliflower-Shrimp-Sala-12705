Place eggs in a small saucepan, and add water to cover. Cover the pan, and bring to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat and let stand covered for 12 minutes. Cool, peel, and chop the hard boiled eggs. Mix mayonnaise and salad dressing together in a small bowl. To a large bowl, add cauliflower, shrimp, green onions, chopped eggs, olives, and pimientos. Toss to combine. Stir in dressing mixture, and toss to coat. Refrigerate. Serve chilled.
