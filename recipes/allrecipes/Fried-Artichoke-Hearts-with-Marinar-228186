Drain artichoke hearts, discarding marinade; set artichokes aside. Place flour in a shallow dish. In a small bowl, beat eggs lightly with the water. In another shallow dish, combine bread crumbs, oregano, and peppers. Dip artichokes in flour, egg mixture, and then bread crumb mixture to coat completely. In a deep-fat fryer heat oil to 365 degree F. Fry coated artichoke hearts, about 6 at a time, for 1 to 2 minutes or until golden. Drain on paper towels. Transfer to serving plate. Serve warm with Classico(R) Four Cheese pasta sauce.
