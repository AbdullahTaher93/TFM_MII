In a large pot of salted water boil tortellini until al dente. Drain well. In a 1-1/2 quart saucepan combine sauce, green chilies, cilantro and cumin. Simmer over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Place tortellini on a serving platter and pour tomato sauce mixture evenly over pasta. Sprinkle cheese over sauce and serve.
