Place bacon in a large saucepan and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble. Saute onion and celery in reserved bacon drippings over medium-high heat until tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in beans, crumbled bacon, oregano, chili powder, and garlic powder. When beans have softened, add Swanson(R) Chicken Broth and salsa. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer covered until flavors have blended, about 15 minutes. Garnish with cilantro and cheese. Serve with tortilla strips.
