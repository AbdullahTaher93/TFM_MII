Heat grill. Place fish, skin side up, on grill over medium-high heat. Cover and cook 8 to 12 minutes, until fish flakes easily with fork, turning once. Stir together the broccoli slaw and mayonnaise. Cut salmon in half lengthwise to fit the rolls, remove the skin. Place salmon on roll; top each sandwich with about 1/4 cup of the broccoli slaw.
