In a large no-stick frying pan over medium-high heat, warm 2 teaspoons of the oil. Add the onions; cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes. Add the red peppers, yellow peppers, zucchini, squash, ginger and soy sauce; cook, stirring frequently, for 6 to 7 minutes, or until the vegetables are just tender. Meanwhile, in a 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the water, cherries, and lemon juice to a boil. Stir in the couscous and the remaining 1 teaspoon of oil. Remove from the heat. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes, or until the couscous is soft. Fluff the couscous with a fork and place in a large bowl. Add the vegetables and toss well. You can make this a day ahead and serve it cold, if you wish.
