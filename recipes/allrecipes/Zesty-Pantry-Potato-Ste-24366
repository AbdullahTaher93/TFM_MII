Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). In a large bowl toss together carrots, TVP, rice and onion. Transfer to a deep, round casserole dish. Press mixture down evenly. Layer potatoes on top of carrot mixture. In a medium bowl combine salsa, sherry, salad dressing, water and cornstarch. Slowly pour over potatoes. Bake, covered, in preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove cover and sprinkle with bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. Heat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and bake, uncovered, for 1 1/2 hours. Cool slightly before serving.
