Combine pears, sugar, crushed pineapple, and lemon juice in a large bowl. Pulse in batches in a food processor until coarsely chopped. Pour pear mixture into a large pot; bring to a rolling boil. Reduce heat; simmer, stirring frequently, until it thickens, about 45 minutes. Let cool to room temperature, 1 to 2 hours. Ladle into a freezer bag, seal, and transfer to the freezer.
