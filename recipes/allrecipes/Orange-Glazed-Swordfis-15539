In a non-reactive shallow dish, combine the swordfish with the orange juice, ginger, sesame oil, and soy sauce and marinate for 30 minutes. Prepare an outside grill with an oiled rack set 6 inches above the heat source. Drain and reserve the marinade. Grill the swordfish for 6 to 7 minutes per side until the swordfish is opaque in the center. In a small bowl, mix together the cornstarch with the water. Place the reserved marinade in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the cornstarch sauce to the marinade and cook 1 minute until thickened. Serve the orange sauce with the swordfish.
