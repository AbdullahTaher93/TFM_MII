To Make Cornbread: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a 13x9 inch pan. Combine the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and sugar, and mix well. Combine the 5 eggs, 6 tablespoons melted butter, and buttermilk. Add wet to dry while mixing on low with a mixer. Mix just until no dry ingredients remain. Pour into prepared pan. Bake until top is browned and a toothpick comes out clean, about 55 minutes. Allow to cool completely. To Make Stuffing: In a small bowl combine the 2 tablespoons salt with the black pepper, onion powder, oregano, thyme, basil, and bay leaves. In another bowl combine the minced onions, parsley, and garlic. Melt 1 cup butter in a large frying pan. Add the spices and cook for a few minutes. Add the vegetables and cook about 5 minutes. Do not allow the vegetables to brown. Crumble the cornbread into the skillet and mix. Add the evaporated milk and eggs off the heat. Make sure to stir well when adding the eggs. Return to low heat and cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes. Remove the bay leaves. Place stuffing in a bowl and cover. Cool before stuffing turkey.
