Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. In a 2 quart casserole dish combine cooked pasta, spinach and cottage cheese; mix well. In a small bowl crumble the toast and add melted butter. Sprinkle over spinach mixture. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until heated through.
