Bring the chicken broth to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium high heat. Add the carrots, onion, garlic and celery salt. Reduce heat to low and add the chicken breast. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Carefully remove the chicken breast, cut it into chunks and return it to the pot. Stir in the cilantro OR dill to taste.
