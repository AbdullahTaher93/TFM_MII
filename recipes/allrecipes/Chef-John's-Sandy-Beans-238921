Heat garlic olive oil, bread crumbs, and 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until mixture resembles wet sand and is fragrant, 2 to 5 minutes. Stir in remaining Parmesan cheese; cook and stir until golden brown and crunchy, about 1 minute more. Transfer bread crumbs to a plate. Return skillet to heat; cook and stir white beans, olive oil, vinegar, cayenne pepper, and salt in hot skillet until beans are heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir parsley and breadcrumbs to taste into beans; toss to coat.
