Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon into a bowl, set aside. Stir together the rum, sweet potatoes, banana, pineapple, and butter; mix well. Fold the flour into the sweet potato mixture until well combined. Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Drop tablespoon-sized pieces of batter into the hot oil, and fry until light golden brown. Drain on paper towels, and dust with powdered sugar.
