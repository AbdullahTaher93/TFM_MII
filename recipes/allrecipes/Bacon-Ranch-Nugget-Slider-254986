Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread chicken nuggets and slider buns on separate baking sheets. Bake chicken nuggets in the preheated oven until heated through and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Bake slider buns until lightly toasted, 3 to 5 minutes. Place 2 chicken nuggets on each toasted bun. Top with ranch dressing. Sprinkle bacon bits over dressing. Place a leaf of lettuce and slice of tomato on top.
