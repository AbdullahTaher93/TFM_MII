In a shallow bowl, beat the egg. In another bowl, combine the potato flakes, bread crumbs, salt and pepper. Dip scallops in egg, then roll in potato mixture. In a large skillet, heat butter and oil over medium heat. Add scallops; cook for 4-5 minutes or until scallops are opaque and coating is golden brown, turning once.
