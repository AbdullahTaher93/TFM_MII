In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the chicken stock, balsamic vinegar, wine vinegar, mustard, minced scallions, caraway seeds and lemon pepper. Bring to a boil while you stir to incorporate the mustard. Add the cabbage, stir and reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, remove the seeds and membrane from the orange bell pepper. Slice into the thinnest slivers that you can. When the cabbage is done, use tongs or a slotted spoon to transfer to a serving platter. Toss in the slivers of bell pepper. Serve garnished with the sour cream and a sprinkle of fresh dill.
