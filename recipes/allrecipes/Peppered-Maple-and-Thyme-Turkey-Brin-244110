In the vessel that you will marinate the turkey in, combine all ingredients and mix well with a wire whisk, being sure that the chicken base is completely blended. Carefully place raw turkey or poultry into this vessel, being sure that the entire bird is covered with the brine. Cover vessel and place under proper refrigeration for 24 to 48 hours. When ready to cook the turkey, carefully remove it from the brine and rinse under cold water and pat dry with a paper towel. Your turkey is now ready to cook, as you normally would do.
