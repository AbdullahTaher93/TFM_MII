Whisk mayonnaise, vinegar, 1/4 cup olive oil, garlic, water, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, and a pinch cayenne pepper together in a bowl until dressing is thick and creamy. Cover dressing with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours or overnight. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir corn in hot oil until light golden brown and toasted, about 15 minutes. Mix corn and red pepper together in a bowl. Pour enough dressing over corn mixture to coat completely. Season with salt and black pepper. Stir basil and a pinch cayenne pepper into corn mixture; toss.
