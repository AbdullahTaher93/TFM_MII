Cook 1 pound of raw ground beef and 1 package of taco seasoning per recipe instructions (follow instructions on the seasoning pack), drain and reserve hot for the recipe build. To build 1 Taco Salad Wrap: Spread 2 tablespoons hot refried beans over the entire wrap. Place of the heated taco seasoned ground beef over the beans, down the center of the wrap (forming a V, like at the 10 and 2 O'clock positions). Evenly place 1 cup lettuce over the beef. Top the lettuce with 2 tablespoon pico de gallo, 1 tablespoon guacamole and 2 tablespoon Mexican cheese blend. Fold lower edge of wrap over the ingredients then roll the wrap into a cone shape, rolling the wrap from left to right. This will create a cornucopia with a closed end. Repeat steps 1 through 5 with remaining 3 wraps and ingredients. Serve.
