In a bowl, combine biscuit mix and water until a soft dough forms. Turn onto a floured surface; knead 5-10 times. Roll dough into a 13-in. circle; cut into 10 wedges. Place 1 tablespoon sauerkraut on each wedge. Place a hot dog at the wide end; roll up each wedge tightly. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 450 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. Heat remaining sauerkraut; serve with the hot dogs.
