Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir potatoes and carrots in hot butter until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir Brussels sprouts, bell pepper, peas, garlic, thyme, sea salt, and black pepper into the potato mixture; cook and stir until vegetables are slightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour water into the skillet; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir remaining tablespoon butter and spinach into the vegetable mixture; toss to coat spinach in liquid. Cook until spinach wilts, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and adjust seasoning.
