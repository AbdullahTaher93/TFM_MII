Place an 11x17-inch baking sheet in the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Combine butternut squash, carrots, parsnip, sweet potato, and red onion in a large bowl; add 2 tablespoons olive oil, rosemary, 1/2 teaspoon sea salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and stir to coat. Spread vegetable mixture in a single layer onto the warmed baking sheet from the oven. Roast vegetables in the preheated oven for 15 minutes; stir and continue roasting until tender, about 15 minutes more. Pound chicken to 1/2-inch thickness on a work surface; season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and ground black pepper to taste. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook chicken until no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a bowl. Pour chicken broth and wine into the same skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, about 2 minutes. Stir honey and mustard into wine mixture; add chicken and turn pieces until coated. Serve chicken alongside roasted vegetables.
