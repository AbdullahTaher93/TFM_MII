Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Scrub and dry the potatoes, then prick several times with a fork and place onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Remove and allow to cool briefly. Cut the ends off the yams and discard; transfer the yams to a large bowl. Add the honey, melted butter, cardamom, cinnamon, tangerine juice, and orange liqueur to the yams. Beat with a hand-held electric mixer until combined.
