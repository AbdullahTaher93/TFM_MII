Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Cook sausage, onion, and garlic over medium heat in a large skillet for 8 to 10 minutes or until sausage is fully cooked, stirring frequently. Drain off fat. Add spaghetti sauce and basil to sausage; heat through. [Cleaning tip: Once the stove top is cool, wipe up any oil splatters or spills with Clorox(R) Disinfecting Wipes*. Rinse hands once complete.] Combine cottage cheese, the 3/4 cup Parmesan cheese, egg, parsley, and pepper in a medium bowl. Spoon 1/2 cup of the sauce evenly over the bottom of a 3-quart rectangular baking dish. Top evenly with 3 noodles, 1/3 of the cottage cheese mixture, 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese, and 1/3 of the remaining sauce, spreading ingredients evenly. Repeat process for 2 remaining layers. Sprinkle the 1/4 cup Parmesan over top. Cover with foil. Bake for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake 20 minutes more or until browned and noodles are tender. Let stand for 15 minutes before serving.
