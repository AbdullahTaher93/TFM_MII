In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, butter and sugar. Add cornstarch, melted chocolate and vanilla; beat until smooth. Unroll crescent roll dough; separate into triangles. In a small bowl, whisk together eggs, butter and extract. Brush some over dough. Drop rounded teaspoonfuls of chocolate mixture at the wide end of each triangle; roll up from the wide end. Place point side down on greased baking sheets; curve ends slightly. Brush with remaining glaze. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or until golden. Remove from pans to cool on wire racks. Dust with confectioners' sugar if desired.
