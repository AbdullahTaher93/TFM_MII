Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir potatoes and sausage in hot oil until the potatoes are tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir green chiles into the potato mixture; cook and stir another 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the potato mixture. Place lid on the skillet and set aside until the cheese melts, 3 to 5 minutes.
