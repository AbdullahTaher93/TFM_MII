In a small frying pan, toast the pine nuts over moderately low heat, stirring frequently, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Light the grill or heat the broiler. In a glass dish or stainless-steel pan, combine the lamb, 6 tablespoons of the oil, the thyme, and 3 tablespoons of the lemon juice. In a large frying pan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over moderate heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the cauliflower, garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the cauliflower is golden, about 10 minutes. Add the saffron, if using, 1 1/4 teaspoons of the salt, 1/2 teaspoon of the pepper, the tomatoes, broth, and currants. Simmer until the cauliflower is tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the couscous and parsley. Bring to a simmer. Cover, remove from the heat, and let sit for 5 minutes. Stir in the pine nuts and the remaining 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Put the lamb on skewers. Sprinkle the kabobs with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Grill or broil the kabobs, turning and basting with the marinade, until the lamb is cooked to your taste, 6 to 8 minutes for medium rare. Serve the skewers on the couscous.
