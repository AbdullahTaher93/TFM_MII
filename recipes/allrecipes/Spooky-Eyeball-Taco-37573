Mix meat and seasoning mix. Shape into 36 (1-inch) balls; place in 15x10x1-inch baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked through. Fill each taco shell with 1 meatball; drizzle with salsa. Top with 2 meatballs dipped in sour cream. Garnish with olives to make "eyeballs."
