In a bowl, stir half of the whipped topping into peanut butter. Stir in the remaining topping until blended. Set aside two chocolate kisses; coarsely chop the remaining chocolates. Divide a third of the topping mixture between two parfait glasses; top each with a fourth of the chopped chocolate. Repeat layers. Top with remaining topping mixture and reserved kisses. Chill until serving.
