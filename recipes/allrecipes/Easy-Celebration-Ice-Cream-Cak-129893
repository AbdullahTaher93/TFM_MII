Line 9-inch round cake pan with plastic wrap, with ends of plastic wrap extending over side of pan. Stand 14 of the cookies around edge of pan. Crush remaining 10 cookies. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cookie crumbs for later use; sprinkle remaining crumbs onto bottom of pan. Spread strawberry ice cream over crumbs; top with 1 cup of the whipped topping and the reserved 1/2 cup crumbs. Cover with chocolate ice cream. Freeze 4 hours or overnight. Remove dessert from pan just before serving, using the plastic wrap handles to lift dessert from pan. Carefully peel off plastic wrap; place dessert on serving plate. Let stand 10 min. at room temperature to soften slightly. Top evenly with the remaining 1 cup whipped topping; drizzle with fudge topping. Cut into 14 wedges to serve. Store leftover dessert in freezer.
