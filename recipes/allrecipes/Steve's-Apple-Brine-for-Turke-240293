Place rosemary, thyme, sage, bay leaves, and black pepper into a cloth spice bag. Combine water and salt in a stock pot; stir until salt dissolves. Bring to a boil, place spice bag into water, and simmer until flavors combine, about 20 minutes. Cool to room temperature, at least 1 hour. Pour cold apple juice into cold spice mixture and stir until combined.
