Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place game hen halves with skin sides up into a 9x13-inch roasting pan. Roast hens in the preheated oven for 35 minutes. Stir orange juice, honey, soy sauce, and vinegar together in a small bowl; brush mixture over hens. Roast hens for 5 more minutes and baste again with orange juice mixture. Roast until skin is browned and meat is no longer pink inside, about 10 more minutes.
