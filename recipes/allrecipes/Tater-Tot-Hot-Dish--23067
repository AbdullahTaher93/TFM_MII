Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Crumble beef and salt into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Add chopped onion; sprinkle oats on top. In a small bowl, combine the soup and milk and pour mixture over meat mixture. Top all with tater tots, placing them close together. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour.
