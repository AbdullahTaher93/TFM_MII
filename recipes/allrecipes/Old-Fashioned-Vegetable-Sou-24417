In a large pot over medium heat, melt butter. Cook onion, carrots and celery until onion is translucent. Stir in tomatoes with their juice, salt, pepper, parsley, soy sauce, Worcestershire and paprika. Pour in beef broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes, until vegetables are tender and flavors are well blended.
