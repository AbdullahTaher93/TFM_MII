Slice off the blossom end of the zucchini, grate into a mixing bowl. This should be close to 2 cups (loosely fitting). If your zukes are small then add another one. Add the salt, stir and let sit for about 3 minutes. Squeeze the zucchini releasing some of its liquids into the bowl. Add the powdered egg whites, onion flakes, oregano and pepper, stir and let sit another 3 minutes. Whip with a fork until frothy (1 full minute). Add the ricotta and stir well. On a non-stick pancake griddle or large frying pan, melt a little bit of butter over medium heat. Spoon out 1 rounded Tbsp of batter and flatten with a spatula. Do as many as will fit comfortably allowing room to flip them easily. Let cook until the top loses its sheen. Carefully flip over and cook until nicely browned. Repeat with remaining batter.
