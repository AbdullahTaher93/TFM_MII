Place all of the ingredients (except the cranberries and the walnuts) in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select Light Crust and Sweet Cycle and press Start. If your machine has a Fruit setting, add the cranberries and walnuts at the signal, or around 5 minutes before the kneading cycle has finished.
