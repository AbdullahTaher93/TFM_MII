Melt coconut oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute chicken in hot oil until browned completely, about 5 minutes; add celery, onion, curry powder, and garlic and continue to saute until the onion is tender, 8 to 10 minutes more. Pour chicken broth, water, and coconut milk into the pot; add butternut squash, diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, and coconut. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook the soup at a simmer until the squash is soft, about 40 minutes. Stir sliced bananas into the soup; simmer until soft, about 5 minutes more.
