Prepare pasta according to package directions. While the pasta is cooking, grate the carrot and cut the bell peppers into various sized stars and half-moons (crescents). During the last 3 minutes of cooking the pasta, add the Romanesco broccoli and cook together. Rinse the pasta and Romanesco broccoli mixture under cool water to prevent further cooking. Combine the pasta and Romanesco broccoli mixture, grated carrot, bell pepper shapes and olives. Add the Hidden Valley(R) Original Ranch(R) Light to the pasta and veggies and mix until well combined. Chill for at least 2 hours before serving.
