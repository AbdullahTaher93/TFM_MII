Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Arrange eggplant slices in a shallow baking dish; top with a layer of spinach. Mix tomatoes, onion, and chives together in a bowl; spread evenly over the spinach layer. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, sprinkle Colby-Monterey Jack cheese evenly over the dish, and continue baking until the cheese melts slightly, about 2 minutes. Cool 5 minutes before serving.
