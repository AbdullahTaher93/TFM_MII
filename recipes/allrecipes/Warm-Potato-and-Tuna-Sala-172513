In a 4- to 5-quart pan, cover potatoes with water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until nearly tender, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine green onions, celery, parsley, and pimientos. In a small bowl, make dressing by whisking together vinegar, water, mustard, anchovy paste, olive oil, and garlic. Pour dressing over onion mixture and toss. Add potatoes and toss again. Add tuna, eggs, white pepper, and paprika. Toss again, gently.
