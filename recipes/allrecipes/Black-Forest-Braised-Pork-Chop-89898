Melt butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Brown both sides of pork chops in butter. Remove chops. Add mushrooms, onion, garlic and salt to pan. Cook, stirring occasionally for 2 to 3 minutes or until onion has softened. Stir in flour until well mixed. Stir beer into vegetables, mixing well. Return pork chops and any accumulated juices to pan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer 7 to 8 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F. Stir in parsley.
