Place cupcake liners into muffin tins. Combine crumbs, 2 tablespoons sugar and butter in a bowl. Cut in butter until it forms small crumbs. Place approximately 1 tablespoon crumb mixture into each cupcake liner and pat it down. Beat cream cheese and 1/2 cup sugar until fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla; mix thoroughly. Spoon a layer of cream cheese mixture on top of crusts (fill cups 2/3 full). Bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes. Cool and spoon cherry pie filling over the top. Refrigerate.
