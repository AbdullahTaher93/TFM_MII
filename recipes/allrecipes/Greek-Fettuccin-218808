Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the fettuccine, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Place the tomatoes, mint, and black olives (if using) into a saucepan over medium-low heat, and bring to a bare simmer. Stir in the feta cheese, and allow to melt slightly. Place the spinach fettuccine into a serving bowl, and toss with the tomato mixture. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.
