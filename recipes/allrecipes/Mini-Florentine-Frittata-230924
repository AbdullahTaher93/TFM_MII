Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Generously butter a 12-cup non-stick muffin pan or line with parchment paper or silicone liners. In a sieve, drain thawed spinach, pressing to squeeze out excess liquid. In a bowl, whisk eggs until blended. Whisk flour into Cream; whisk into egg mixture. Stir in spinach and 1/4 tsp (1 mL) each salt and pepper. Divide egg mixture among prepare muffin cups. Bake for 15 to 20 min or until puffed and just set. Let stand for 3 min. Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine tomatoes, garlic, basil, Canadian Parmesan cheese and a pinch each, salt and pepper. Run a knife around frittatas to remove from pan; serve topped with tomato bruschetta.
