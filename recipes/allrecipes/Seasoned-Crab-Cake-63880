In bowl, combine first 7 ingredients and 1 teaspoon bouillon. Stir until combined. In another bowl, combine cornflake crumbs with remaining bouillon. Evenly divide crab mixture into 12 (2 1/2 inch) patties. Coat patties with cornflake mixture. In large skillet, heat a small amount of oil. Place patties in skillet and cook over medium heat, about 3 minutes on each side, until golden brown. Add additional oil to skillet and continue cooking crab cakes. Serve immediately. If desired, garnish with lemon wedges and serve with tarter sauce and Dijon mustard.
