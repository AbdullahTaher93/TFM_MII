Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coarsely chop stewed tomatoes by running a knife through tomatoes in can. Combine tomatoes, tomato sauce, rice vinegar and brown sugar in a small saucepan. Crumble beef into a large bowl. Add 1/2 cup of the tomato mixture, egg, breadcrumbs, onion, salt and pepper; mix well. Shape into a loaf in an 8 x 8-inch baking pan. Bake 45 to 50 minutes. Meanwhile, bring remaining tomato mixture to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, 10 minutes or until slightly thickened. Spread 1/4 cup over meat loaf during last 10 minutes of cook time. Serve remaining sauce with sliced meat loaf.
