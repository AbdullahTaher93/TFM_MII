Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the kielbasa, baked beans, chili beans, corn, bell pepper, and onion into a mixing bowl. Sprinkle in the chili powder and Cheddar cheese. Stir until evenly mixed, then pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the mixture is hot and the cheese has melted, 25 to 30 minutes.
