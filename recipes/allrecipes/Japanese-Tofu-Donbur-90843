In a 3- to 4-quart pan, combine rice and 3 1/2 cups water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover and simmer over low heat until rice is tender to bite, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a deep 10- to 12-inch frying pan over high heat, stir oil, onion, and ginger until onion is lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add broth, soy sauce, and sugar. Crumble tofu into approximately 1-inch chunks and add to pan. Bring to a boil. Add spinach, cover, and cook until wilted, about 1 minute. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, beat eggs to blend. Reduce heat to low, evenly distribute mixture in pan, and pour in eggs. With a spatula, push vegetables aside slightly so egg mixture can flow down through sauce. Cover and cook just until eggs are softly set, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Spoon cooked rice into bowls. Top equally with egg-spinach mixture, including juices. Sprinkle with tomato.
