In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat together the butter and sugar until fluffy. Add the cream, egg yolks, vanilla, and peppermint extract and mix thoroughly. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt until well combined. Remove half of the dough from the mixing bowl and shape into a ball. To the remaining half, add the red food coloring and beat on low speed until well blended. Shape the red dough in a ball. Cover each ball of dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Take a walnut-sized piece of red dough and a walnut-sized piece of white dough. Separately, roll each color on a lightly floured surface, into a 6-inch rope. Place ropes side by side; gently press together and twist the two ropes to form a spiral. Place on a parchment lined baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Curve the top of the cookie to form a cane shape. Bake cookies for 10-12 minutes or until set, rotating sheets halfway through. Do not overbake. Cool for 2 minutes on cookie sheets before removing to wire racks to cool completely. Store in an airtight container.
