Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2 quart casserole dish. Layer the squash and onions in the casserole dish. Dot with butter, and top with Swiss cheese slices. Cover, and bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove cover, and continue baking 15 minutes, or until squash is tender.
