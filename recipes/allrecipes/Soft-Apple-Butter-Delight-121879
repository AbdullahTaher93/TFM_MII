In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and brown sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in coffee. Combine flour, baking soda, salt and nutmeg; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Stir in apple butter and walnuts (dough will be soft). Refrigerate for 1 hour. Drop by teaspoonfuls 2 in. apart onto lightly greased baking sheets. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until edges are firm. Remove to wire racks to cool.
