Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic in hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute; add asparagus, season with salt, cover skillet with a lid, and cook, stirring occasionally, until asparagus is tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Let asparagus cool in the skillet. Gently stir egg quarters into the cooled asparagus mixture; season with pepper and garnish with lemon slices.
