Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Slice a pocket into the side of each pork chop. Stuff 1 tablespoon of bread crumbs into each pocket. Stuff a few slices of Italian sausage into each pocket. Season the outside of the chops with salt, pepper and steak seasoning. Heat the oil in an oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the pork chops in the pan until light brown. Remove chops from the pan and keep warm on a plate. Add the onion and mushrooms to the pan. Cook and stir until tender. Return the chops to the pan and add the apple slices and grape juice. Season with a small amount of salt and pepper. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for 1 hour. Serve pork chops with the sauce spooned over them.
