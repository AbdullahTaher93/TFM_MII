Preheat grill by lighting charcoal, then allowing coals to burn until they are covered with white ash and are no longer flaming, about 30 minutes. Spread out coals evenly. Rub both sides of salmon with oil, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Place salmon, skin side down, on grill and cover with lid. Cook until salmon looks opaque and still slightly pink, about 20 minutes. Bottom will be slightly charred.
