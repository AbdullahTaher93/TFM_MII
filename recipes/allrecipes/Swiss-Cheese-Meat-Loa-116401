In a skillet, cook bacon over medium heat for 2 minutes on each side or until cooked but not crisp. Drain on a paper towel; set aside. In a bowl, combine the egg, crackers, 4 tablespoons cheese, onion, garlic, salt, sage and pepper. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Shape into a loaf and place in a greased 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pan. Place bacon pieces over top. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining cheese; bake 2-4 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F and cheese is melted.
