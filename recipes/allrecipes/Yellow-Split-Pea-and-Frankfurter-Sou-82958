Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in onion, carrot, celery, and garlic; cook to soften, but not brown, about 7 minutes. Mix in the mace and split peas. Stir in the stock; cover, and simmer for 1 hour, or until the peas are soft. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in frankfurters, and heat through.
