Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 13x17-inch baking dish with parchment paper. Combine oats, pecan halves, coconut flakes, and flax seeds in the prepared baking dish; mix well. Combine honey, white sugar, coconut oil, and salt in a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high until mixture starts to bubble, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk until honey and coconut oil are well-combined. Stir in vanilla extract. Pour honey mixture over oat mixture in the baking dish; stir until evenly distributed. Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 15 minutes, until oats are a deep golden brown, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Allow to cool, about 1 hour. Break oat clusters apart before serving.
