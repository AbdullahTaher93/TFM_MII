Mix ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, onion, and garlic together in a large bowl. Shape into 4 patties. Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill patties until browned, about 5 minutes. Flip and continue cooking on the second side, about 4 minutes. Add 1 slice of Gouda cheese to each patty; cook until slightly melted, about 1 minute. Serve on hamburger buns.
