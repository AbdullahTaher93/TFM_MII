Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9 x 5 inch loaf pans well. Sift together flour, salt, cinnamon, baking powder, and soda. In a large bowl, beat eggs until lemon colored; beat in sugar and oil. Stir in vanilla, zucchini, and cooled chocolate. Mix dry ingredients into zucchini mixture. Stir in the chopped almonds. Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake for 60 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in pans 15 to 20 minutes, then flip onto racks to finish cooling.
