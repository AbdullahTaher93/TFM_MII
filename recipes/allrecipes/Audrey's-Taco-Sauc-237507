Whisk sour cream and mayonnaise together in a bowl until smooth; add lime juice and whisk until again smooth and pourable, though still creamy, adding lime juice or sour cream if the mixture needs to be thinner or thicker. Stir cumin, coriander, dill, oregano, and chipotle chile powder through the sour cream mixture. Fold jalapeno pepper, cilantro, and garlic through the mixture. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the seasonings disseminate throughout the sauce, at least 1 hour.
