In a mixing bowl, cream butter and confectioners' sugar. Beat in vanilla. Add flour and mix well. Divide dough in half; with food coloring, tint half red and half green. Shape each portion into an 8-in. log. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Cut each log in half lengthwise. Press red and green halves together. Tightly wrap each roll in plastic wrap; freeze for up to 6 months. To prepare cookies: Let dough stand at room temperature for 15 minutes. Cut into 1/4-in. slices; place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Sprinkle with colored sugar if desired. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until set. Cool on wire racks.
