Season steaks on both sides with salt and pepper to taste. Brush corn equally with olive oil. Lay corn on a lightly oiled grill over a solid bed of hot coals (you can hold your hand at grill level for only 1 to 2 seconds) or over high heat on a gas barbecue; close lid on gas barbecue. Cook, turning as needed, to brown corn evenly on all sides, about 12 minutes. Remove corn and set aside. Add steaks to grill and cook, turning once, until brown to your liking, 10 to 12 minutes for medium-rare (cut to test). While steaks cook, cut corn from cobs. In a bowl, mix kernels with tomatoes, diced chili, garlic, lime juice, ground chilies, and salt to taste. Transfer steaks to plates and spoon salsa equally over them.
