Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until tender; drain. In the meantime, cut the tofu into 1/4 inch thick by 2 inch wide slices. Heat the olive oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Cook the garlic and onions and cook until they begin to soften, about 1 minute. Stir in the mushrooms, walnuts, vinegar, and black pepper, turn heat to medium-low and allow to simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. Gently fold in the tofu slices, cover, and allow to simmer for about 5 minutes more. When the pasta has cooked, toss it with the tofu mixture, and sprinkle with Romano cheese.
