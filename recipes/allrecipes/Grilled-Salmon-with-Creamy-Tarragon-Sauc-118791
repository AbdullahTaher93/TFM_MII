Brush salmon on both sides with oil. Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill. Place salmon, skin side down, on grill rack. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 20-25 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. For sauce, combine the remaining ingredients in a small bowl. Serve with the salmon.
