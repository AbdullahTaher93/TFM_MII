Whisk the orange juice, cilantro, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes together in a small bowl; set aside. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the halibut cheeks until golden brown on each side, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Pour the orange juice mixture into the skillet and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until the halibut flakes easily with a fork and the sauce has thickened slightly. Remove halibut cheeks to a plate and drizzle with orange sauce to serve.
