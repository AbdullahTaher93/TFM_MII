In a small bowl, combine the spinach, onions and sour cream. Spread into an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Cut sole fillets into 6-in. x 2-in. strips; carefully roll up and secure with toothpicks. Place over spinach mixture. Sprinkle with lemon-pepper. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. In a saucepan, combine cornstarch and water until smooth. Gradually add tomatoes. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Discard toothpicks from roll-ups. Spoon tomato sauce over roll-ups and spinach mixture.
