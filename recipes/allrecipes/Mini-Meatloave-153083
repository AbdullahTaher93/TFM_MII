Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Coat 8 muffin cups with cooking spray. Mix beef, pork, turkey, egg, oats, parsley, 2 tablespoons ketchup, milk, onion, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Form the mixture into 8 balls and place in the prepared muffin cups. Combine the remaining 2 tablespoons ketchup and Worcestershire sauce and spread about 1/2 teaspoon over each mini meatloaf. Place the muffin pan on a baking sheet. Bake the meatloaves until their internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F, 25 to 30 minutes. Pour off fat before serving.
