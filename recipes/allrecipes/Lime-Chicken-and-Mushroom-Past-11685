Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente. Heat a large, non-stick skillet over medium high heat. Add olive oil and chicken, and saute slightly. Add mushrooms and peppers; saute until peppers are soft but crisp. Stir in lime juice and cilantro. Drain pasta, and transfer to a large serving bowl. Top with chicken mixture, and toss slightly. Garnish with lime slices.
