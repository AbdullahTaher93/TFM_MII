Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and celery and saute for 5 to 10 minutes, or until tender. Reduce heat to medium low, add the tomatoes and the water and break the tomatoes apart with your hands in the pot. Then simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in the basil, chickpeas and pasta and simmer for 15 to 20 more minutes, or until all ingredients are heated through.
