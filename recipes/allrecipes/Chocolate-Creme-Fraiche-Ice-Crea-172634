Blend the chocolate and milk together in a blender on high until smooth; add the creme fraiche, sugar, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Blend again until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until it reaches "soft-serve" consistency. Transfer ice cream to a lidded plastic container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, ice cream should ripen in the freezer at least 2 hours or overnight.
