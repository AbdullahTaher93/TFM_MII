Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix all ingredients well. Place into a standard loaf pan, forming an even loaf. Using squirt bottles, put ketchup and mustard over the top, forming a zigzag or squiggle pattern. If squirt bottle is not available, can spread ketchup over the top with a knife. Bake for 1 hour.
