Cut off about 1/4 of the jicama and peel with a knife (or a really sharp vegetable peeler). Slice into sticks. During the summer I just scoop out 2 Tbsps of peanut butter and put it into a custard dish and onto a plate with the sliced jicama. In the winter I sometimes zap the peanut butter in the microwave for a few seconds first.
