Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Oil a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Arrange chicken pieces in a single layer in baking dish. Stir together coffee, Kahlua, honey, and soy sauce in a saucepan. Bring to a boil; lower heat and simmer until reduced by 1/3, about 8 minutes. Let cool slightly. Pour coffee mixture over chicken pieces; turn several times to coat evenly. Bake, basting occasionally with pan juices, until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from oven and serve over rice.
