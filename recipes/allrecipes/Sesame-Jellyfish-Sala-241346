Rinse and drain jellyfish; place into a bowl. Whisk sesame oil, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, chili oil, and ginger together in a small bowl; stir into jellyfish and marinate 15 minutes. Place sesame seeds in a dry skillet over medium-low heat; toast until golden, about 1 minute. Set aside to cool, about 5 minutes. Stir cilantro and green onions into jellyfish mixture; sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve immediately.
