Process walnuts in a food processor until you have a coarse powder; add oats, flax seeds, cumin, paprika, salt, and ground cinnamon and process again until the oats are ground into a coarse powder. Put black beans and sweet potato into the processor bowl; process until smooth and transfer to a mixing bowl. Stir egg, onion, Fresno chile, crimini mushroom, garlic, and soy sauce into the black bean mixture until smoothly integrated; shape into 6 patties. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Fry patties in oil until a deep-brown crust forms, about 5 minutes per side.
