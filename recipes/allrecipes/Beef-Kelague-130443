Pour lemon juice, soy sauce, and Tabasco in a large, glass bowl. Stir in the green onions and beef. Add additional lemon juice if needed to cover the beef. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and allow to rest at room temperature for one hour, until the meat turns a grayish-brown color and appears cooked.
