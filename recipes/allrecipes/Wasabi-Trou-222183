Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking dish with aluminum foil and grease with olive oil. Mix soy sauce, olive oil, wasabi paste, garlic, oregano, and black pepper in a bowl. Cut a diagonal slash across each piece of fish and coat fish with wasabi mixture; spoon remaining wasabi mixture over fish and into the diagonal cuts. Place fish into prepared baking dish and sprinkle with Cajun seasoning. Bake in the preheated oven until fish is opaque and flakes easily, 7 to 9 minutes.
