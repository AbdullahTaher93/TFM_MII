Prepare popcorn by preferred method (stove top, microwave, etc.). Discard unpopped popcorn kernels. Place popcorn in large bowl. Combine melted butter or margarine with Morton(R) Nature's Seasons(R) Seasoning Blend or Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM). Pour butter mixture over popcorn. With a large spoon and spatula, gently toss the popcorn with the Nature's Seasons(R) or Hot Salt(TM)/butter mixture to coat completely. Sprinkle with cheese; continue to toss with popcorn to coat. Serve immediately.
