Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Mix flour, seafood seasoning, and salt in a large resealable plastic bag; place chicken breasts in bag, seal, and shake to coat chicken with seasoned flour. Place chicken into a roasting pan and spray with cooking spray. Bake in the preheated oven until browned and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), 35 to 40 minutes. Mix hot pepper sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and unsalted butter in a large bowl. Toss baked chicken breasts in hot pepper mixture to coat; serve.
