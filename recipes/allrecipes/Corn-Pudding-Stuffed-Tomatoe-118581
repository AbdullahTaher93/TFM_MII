Cut a thin slice off the top of each tomato; scoop out and discard pulp. Sprinkle inside of tomatoes with half of the salt and pepper. Invert on paper towels to drain. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and remaining salt and pepper. Combine the eggs, cream, corn and butter; stir into dry ingredients. Spoon into tomatoes. Place in a shallow baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 38-40 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center of corn pudding comes out clean. Sprinkle with parsley.
