Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Using a mortar and pestle, crush together garlic and salt to form a paste. Transfer to a medium bowl. Add parsley, chives, lemon juice, and butter; stir with a wooden spoon until well combined. Place bread on a baking sheet. Warm bread in oven until crust is crisp, about 10 minutes. Serve with the butter. Butter can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to 2 weeks.
