To Marinate: In a large nonporous glass dish or bowl, combine the sour cream, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, celery salt, paprika, salt, pepper and garlic; mix well. Add chicken breasts and coat well with sour cream marinade. Cover dish or bowl and refrigerate to marinate for at least 8 hours, or overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place bread crumbs in a shallow dish or bowl. Remove chicken from marinade and discard marinade. Dredge chicken in bread crumbs to coat well and place in 2 lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dishes. In a small saucepan or skillet, melt butter and spoon evenly over chicken. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 60 to 70 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and fork-tender and juices run clear.
