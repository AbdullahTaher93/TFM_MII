In a bowl, combine the cracker crumbs, walnuts and butter; press onto the bottom and up the sides of a grease 9-in. pie plate. Bake at 375 degrees F for 8-10 minutes. Cool completely. Spread coffee ice cream over crust. Freeze for 2 hours or until firm. Repeat with vanilla ice cream. Remove pie from the freezer 15 minutes before serving. For sauce, combine butter and brown sugar in a saucepan; cook and stir over low heat for 5-6 minutes. Remove from the heat; slowly stir in cream. Cook and stir 1 minutes longer. Remove from the heat; stir in walnuts and vanilla. Serve warm over slices of pie.
