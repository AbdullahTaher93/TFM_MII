Combine hash browns and butter in a greased 9-in. pie plate. Press onto the bottom and up the sides, forming a shell. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Cool for 5 minutes. In a bowl, combine cornstarch, eggs and milk until smooth. Stir into beef mixture. Add the remaining ingredients; mix well. Pour into shell. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand 5-10 minutes before cutting.
