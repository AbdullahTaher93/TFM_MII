Stir together water, vinegar, corn syrup, preserves, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 2 minutes. Brush 1/4 to 1/3 cup of this glaze over your ham about 30 minutes before it is finished baking. Stir any ham drippings into the remaining glaze and serve alongside the sliced ham.
