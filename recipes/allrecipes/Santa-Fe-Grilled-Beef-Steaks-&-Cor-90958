Preheat barbecue grill. Peel corn, leaving husks attached at base; remove silk. Rewrap corn in husks; tie closed. Soak in cold water 30 minutes. Meanwhile, combine Heinz 57 sauce, garlic, chili powder, and cumin; remove and reserve 1/4 cup. Drain corn. Place on grid over medium, ash-covered coals. Grill, uncovered, 20 to 30 minutes, turning frequently. After 5 or 10 minutes, place beef steaks on grid with corn. Grill T-bone or Porterhouse steaks, uncovered, 14 to 16 minutes (top loin steaks 15 to 18 minutes) for medium rare to medium doneness, turning occasionally and brushing with glaze during last 5 minutes. Combine reserved 1/4 cup glaze and butter in 1-cup glass measure. Microwave on High 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, stirring once. Carefully peel corn; brush with chili butter. Serve with steaks and remaining chili butter.
