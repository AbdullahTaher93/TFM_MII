Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups with vegetable oil or line with paper liners. Whisk ketchup, Dijon mustard, brown sugar, and Worcestershire sauce together in a bowl until sugar dissolves. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until sauce is chilled, about 30 minutes. Knead ground beef, milk, 8 ounces Cheddar cheese, bread crumbs, eggs, onion soup mix, chili powder, and paprika together in a large bowl until well-mixed. Fill prepared muffin cups with meat mixture, pressing down to remove any air pockets. Cook in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Spread chilled sauce over each meatloaf 'cupcake'; return muffin pans to the oven and cook until no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Sprinkle remaining Cheddar cheese over 'cupcakes'; let cool for 10 minutes.
