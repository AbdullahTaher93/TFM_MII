Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 large bread pans. Beat sugar, pumpkin, eggs, water, applesauce, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together in a large mixing bowl. Whisk flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, cloves, and ginger together in a separate bowl; stir into the pumpkin mixture until just combined. Fold walnuts into the resulting batter; pour into prepared bread pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. Wrap tightly in aluminum foil to store.
