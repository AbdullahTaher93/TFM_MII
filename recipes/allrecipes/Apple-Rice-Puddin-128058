In a medium saucepan, combine the milk, apple juice, honey, butter, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Heat just to boiling. Stir in rice, apples, and dates. Heat until bubbles appear at the edges of the pan. Remove the cinnamon. Coat a 1 1/2-quart (1.5-L) casserole with nonstick spray; pour in the pudding mixture. Bake at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) until top is lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve warm.
