Rinse pork and pat dry; trim and discard any fat. Place meat between sheets of plastic wrap. With a heavy, flat mallet, pound until meat is an even 1/4 inch thick. In a small bowl, mix paprika, vinegar, garlic, cumin, oregano, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Uncover meat and rub seasoning mixture evenly over both sides. Add enough oil to a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over high heat to coat pan bottom when swirled. When hot, add meat and cook until edges turn white, about 2 minutes. Turn meat to brown other side, about 2 minutes. Continue to cook, turning for even color, until pork is no longer pink in center (cut to test), about 8 minutes total. Cut into serving pieces. Add salt and serve with lime wedges to squeeze over to taste.
