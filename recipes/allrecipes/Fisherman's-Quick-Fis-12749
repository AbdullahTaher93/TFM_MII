Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Coat a 9x13 inch baking dish with non-stick cooking spray. In a medium bowl, marinate the fish fillets in the salad dressing for a few minutes. Toss the shredded cheese and crushed chips together. Place the marinated fish fillets in the prepared baking dish and top with the cheese/chip mixture. Discard the leftover marinade. Bake, uncovered in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes or until the fish can be flaked with a fork.
