In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in peanut butter. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla. Combine flour, oats, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture and mix well. Pour into a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake at 325 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted near the center comes out clean. Immediately sprinkle with chocolate chips and return to the oven for 2 minutes or until chips begin to soften. Spread evenly over the top. For glaze, beat peanut butter and sugar. Add enough milk to reach a spreading consistency. Spread over warm bars; sprinkle with peanuts.
