Place the water, sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in a pan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, and stir in the cherries. Reduce heat, and simmer until cherries are transparent. Pour into resealable freezer bags and freeze, or pour into hot jars, leaving 1/4-in. headspace. Adjust caps. Process for 15 minutes in a boiling-water bath.
