Bring a large saucepan of water to boil, and cook beans uncovered until tender but crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat, drain, and immerse in a medium bowl filled with enough ice water to cover. In a small bowl, mix honey mustard, vinegar, olive oil, and chives. Season with salt and pepper. Drain ice water, and pour the honey mustard mixture over the beans. Stir to coat.
