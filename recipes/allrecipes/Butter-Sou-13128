Quarter the onion and separate the layers. Boil 8 cups water with the potato, onion, butter, bay leaf, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. When the potatoes are done, mix the flour, eggs, and about 1 teaspoon salt in a separate bowl. Add water until it is a thick dough. Spoon or cut noodles into soup--I tilt the bowl over the soup and use a butter knife to cut strips as it pours. After noodles are fluffy, pour in the cream. Heat and serve. This soup is even better the next day!
