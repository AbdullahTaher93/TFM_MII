In a large soup pot, heat canola oil over medium-high heat. Add scallions and garlic. Saute 2 minutes. Add white pepper, nutmeg and mustard. Stir. Add chicken broth, water or clam juice, tarragon leaves, and lobster shells. Stir. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove and discard lobster shells. Return broth to a boil over medium-high heat. Cut lobster meat into 16 pieces. Add lobster, asparagus, and hot milk to pot. Stir, cover, and remove from heat. Let stand 5 minutes to steep. Place a generous dollop of mashed potatoes to the side in each of 4 shallow bowls. Spoon stew into the bowls beside the potatoes. Garnish with fresh tarragon sprigs.
