In a small skillet, saute celery and onion in butter until tender. In a bowl, combine the bread cubes, celery mixture, salt and pepper; set aside. Cut a lengthwise slit down the center of each tenderloin to within 1/2 in. of bottom. Open tenderloins so they lie flat; cover with plastic wrap. Flatten to 1/2-in. thickness. In a large skillet, brown pork in oil on both sides over medium-high heat. Spoon stuffing onto one tenderloin. Top with the second tenderloin; tie with kitchen string. Place on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until a meat thermometer inserted into the meat reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let stand for 5 minutes before slicing.
