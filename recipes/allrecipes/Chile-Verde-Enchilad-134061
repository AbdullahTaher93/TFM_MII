Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray 11x7-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Spoon 1/4 cup of the cooking sauce in bottom of prepared pan; spread. Mix 1 cup of the cooking sauce, 1 cup of the cheese, onions and chicken in large bowl. Fill each tortilla with one-eighth of chicken mixture. Roll up tightly and place side by side in baking dish, seam side down. Pour remaining cooking sauce over filled tortillas. Cover with aluminum foil and bake 20 minutes or until hot. Remove from oven; uncover and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Dress these up with a squeeze of lime juice, some chopped fresh cilantro and a spoonful of sour cream, if you like.
