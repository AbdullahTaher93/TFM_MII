In a bowl, combine the cinnamon with 1 cup of the sugar and set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter or margarine, cream cheese, egg yolks and the remaining 1/2 cup sugar. Spread this mixture on the pieces of bread and roll them up. Brush each roll with melted butter or margarine and roll in the cinnamon sugar mixture. Place rollups seam-side down on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Cover tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and freeze. Thirty minutes before baking, preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Do not thaw the rolls before baking. Remove rolls from freezer and bake uncovered for 15 minutes.
