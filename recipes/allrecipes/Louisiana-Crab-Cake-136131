Mix crabmeat, peppers, onions, eggs, pepper sauce and 1/2 cup of the cracker crumbs. Cover. Refrigerate 1 hour or until firm. Meanwhile, mix mustard and dressing; cover. Refrigerate until ready to use. Shape crab mixture into 10 (1-inch-thick) patties; coat with remaining cracker crumbs. Heat oil in large heavy skillet on medium heat. Add crab cakes, in batches; cook 3 to 5 minutes on each side or until golden brown on both sides. Remove to paper towels to drain. Serve warm with the mustard mixture.
