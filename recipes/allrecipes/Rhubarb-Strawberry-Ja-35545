In a large saucepan or stockpot, stir together the fresh rhubarb and sugar. Cover, and let stand overnight. Bring the rhubarb and sugar to a boil over medium heat. Boil, stirring constantly, for 12 minutes on low heat. Remove from heat, and stir in dry gelatin mix. Transfer to sterile jars, and refrigerate.
