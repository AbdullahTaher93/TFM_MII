Combine mashed strawberries and 3/4 cup water in a saucepan; bring to a boil and simmer for about 3 minutes. Strain juice from cooked strawberries and add enough water to make 1 cup juice. Discard pulp. Combine sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and salt in a saucepan; stir strawberry juice into sugar mixture. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, until clear and thick, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Stir sliced strawberries into strawberry sauce.
