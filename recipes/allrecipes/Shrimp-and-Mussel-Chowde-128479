Wash and dry the saucepan. Melt the butter in the saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the flour to make a smooth paste. Gradually whisk in the reserved mussel broth and the milk. Cook, whisking, over medium-low heat for 5 minutes, or until thickened. Stir in the potato, celery, bell peppers, corn, and carrot. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Stir in the shrimp and cod. Simmer, covered, for 8 minutes, or until the fish is opaque. Season with the hot-pepper sauce. Stir in the parsley and mussels and serve immediately.
