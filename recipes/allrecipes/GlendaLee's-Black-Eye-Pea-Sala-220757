Place black-eyed peas, onion, green bell pepper, tomato, mayonnaise, canola oil, white vinegar, sugar, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl; stir to evenly distribute mayonnaise. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight. Toss cabbage into black-eyed pea mixture just before serving.
