Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef and onion together in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir mushroom soup, green beans, tomatoes, oregano, salt, and pepper with the beef mixture; bring to a boil and top with potato nuggets. Place a cover on the skillet, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the green beans and potato nuggets are heated through, about 15 minutes.
