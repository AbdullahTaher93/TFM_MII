Dissolve the yeast and 1/4 cup SPLENDA(R) in the warm milk. Sift flour into a large bowl, make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture, egg, salt, nutmeg and butter. Stir flour into center. Once combined turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface knead until dough is elastic. Cover and let dough rise overnight in the refrigerator. Remove dough from the refrigerator and roll on a lightly floured surface to 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Cut into 2 inch rounds. Cover and let rise for about 15 to 20 minutes. In a medium bowl combine the cottage cheese, egg, 2 tablespoons SPLENDA(R) and vanilla. Beat until well combined. Form dough rounds into a ball and insert about 2 teaspoons of cheese filling into half of the rounds and 2 teaspoons of preserves into the other half. In a heavy pot or electric skillet, pour in oil to about the 2 inch mark. Heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Drop sufganiot (doughnuts) into the oil, turning when browned. Drain on paper towels and roll in confectioners' sugar.
