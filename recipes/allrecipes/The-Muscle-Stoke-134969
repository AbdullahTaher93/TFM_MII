Place the beef in the marinade of red wine and olive oil, and refrigerate for 2 hours. Grill over medium heat until beef reaches desired doneness, then cut into 1-inch cubes. Dump broth, vegetables, mushrooms, and oregano into a large skillet and boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. Add meat, then pour brandy in center of skillet and light (see 'How to Light Your Fire,' below, for warming and torching instructions). Gently stir everything together and then serve over pasta.
