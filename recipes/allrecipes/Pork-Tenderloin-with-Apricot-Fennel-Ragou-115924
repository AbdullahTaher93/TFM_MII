Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine both mustards. Salt and pepper the pork, rub with mustards, and sprinkle with breadcrumbs. Pat coating. Set aside. Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons oil. Sear pork, turning, until brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove from pan; set aside. Add remaining tablespoon oil and the butter to pan. Add shallots and fennel. Cook over medium-high heat until shallots are tender, about 5 minutes. Add 1/2 cup stock; cook until liquid evaporates, 1 to 2 minutes. Return pork to pan; add apricots, 1/2 cup stock, and cognac. Roast in oven, stirring vegetables occasionally, until pork registers 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 20 minutes. Transfer pork to a cutting board; place pan over medium-low heat. Add remaining 1/2 cup stock and the thyme; stir, loosening brown bits from bottom. Simmer 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Slice pork, and serve pork slices with vegetables and sauce. Garnish with thyme.
