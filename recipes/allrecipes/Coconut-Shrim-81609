Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. In a very small bowl (like a ramekin) mix together the water and powdered egg whites until completely dissolved. This will take awhile. Mix then let sit a couple minutes and then mix again. Add the lime juice and mix again. In a shallow bowl, blend together the coconut, whey, Splenda and salt. Dip each shrimp into the egg wash. Shake off any extra (just so it is not dripping). Then press gently into the coconut mixture and coat on both side. Place on the parchment lined cookie sheet. Repeat with the remaining shrimp. Bake at 375 degrees F for 6-8 minutes, just until the shrimp have turned red and the coconut is just starting to brown at the tips ever so slightly. Remove from oven and transfer carefully to serving platter.
