Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. In a large bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, chives, garlic salt and salt. Cut in the shortening until the mixture has only small lumps. Add milk and cheese and stir until moistened. Drop dough by heaping spoonfuls onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until golden.
