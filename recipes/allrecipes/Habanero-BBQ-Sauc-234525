Bring vinegar to a boil in a saucepan; add habanero peppers, onion, garlic, red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, mustard, white pepper, and seasoned salt. Allow mixture to return to a boil, then stir in brown sugar and ketchup. Boil sauce for 15 minutes, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 30 to 45 minutes. Cool and serve.
