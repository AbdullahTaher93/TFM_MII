Place eggplant in a colander and sprinkle generously with salt; allow to sit and drain for 30 minutes. Squeeze eggplant to release more water. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; saute eggplant until golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer eggplant to a bowl, reserving any oil in the skillet. Cook and stir onion, celery, and green bell pepper in the same skillet, adding more oil as needed, until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix eggplant, tomatoes, anchovies, basil, and oregano into onion mixture; saute over high heat until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and cool mixture to room temperature, at least 15 minutes. Mix olives and capers into eggplant mixture and dress with red wine vinegar and more olive oil; season with salt and pepper. Add pine nuts. Line a plate with lettuce leaves. Spoon eggplant mixture onto toasts and arrange on lettuce. Garnish with tomato wedges.
