In a mixing bowl, cream the butter and brown sugar. Beat in molasses and egg. Combine the flour, baking soda, ginger, salt, cinnamon and cloves; add to the creamed mixture alternately with water. Mix well. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or until easy to handle. On a well-floured surface, roll out dough to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with a rocking horse cookie cutter or cutter of your choice dipped in flour. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 9-11 minutes or until edges are firm. Remove to wire racks to cool.
