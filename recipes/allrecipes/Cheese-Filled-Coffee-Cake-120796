In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. In a saucepan, heat sour cream and butter to 110 degrees F-115 degrees F. Add the sour cream mixture, sugar, salt and eggs to yeast mixture; mix well. Gradually add flour; mix well. Do not knead. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours. In a mixing bowl, beat filling ingredients until smooth. Set aside. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface; divide into four pieces. Roll each into a 12-in. x 8-in. rectangle. Spread filling to within 1/2 in. of edges. Roll up, jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch seam to seal and tuck ends under. Place, seam side down, on two greased baking sheets. With a sharp knife, make deep slashes across the top of each loaf. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks. Combine glaze ingredients; drizzle over warm loaves. Cool. Refrigerate leftovers.
