Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix flour, baking powder, and salt. Cut in chilled butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. In a small bowl, mix coconut milk, honey, and egg. Stir into the flour mixture. Fold in pineapple and orange zest. Divide the mixture into 12 rounded pieces, and arrange in a single layer on a medium ungreased baking sheet. Bake 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown.
