In a bowl, combine tomato juice, egg, bread crumbs, dried tomato, Worcestershire sauce, celery salt, hot sauce, and garlic, if you like. Add ground beef and gently mix with a fork just until ingredients are evenly blended. Divide meat mixture into 4 equal portions. With your hands, shape burgers into 3/4-inch thick patties. If making ahead, lay patties side by side on a plate, cover airtight, and chill up to 24 hours. Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, medium-high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inch above the cooking grate only 3 to 4 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). In a small bowl, blend mayonnaise and horseradish with a fork. Lay patties on well-oiled cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook, turning once with a wide spatula, until meat is no longer pink in center (cut to test), about 10 minutes total. During the last minute of cooking time, place buns with cut sides down next to burgers and cook until toasted. Transfer buns to a platter and tuck burgers inside. Spread horseradish mayonnaise on buns and garnish to taste.
