Bring chicken broth to a boil in a saucepan. Stir quinoa into the broth and bring again to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and broth has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir scallions and 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice into the quinoa. Mix paprika, cumin, onion powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and sea salt together in a small bowl; rub onto chicken breasts to season completely. Prepare a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat. Lay chicken breasts into the hot skillet, cover skillet with a lid, and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Blend avocado, yogurt, 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice, and garlic powder in a food processor until smooth. Spread quinoa onto a serving platter. Arrange chicken breasts onto the platter. Drizzle avocado cream sauce over the chicken breasts.
