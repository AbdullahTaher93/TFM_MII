Whisk egg and milk together in a bowl. Mix cornmeal, ranch dip mix, black pepper, and salt in a separate bowl. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Oil should be about 1/2 inch deep. Dip tomato slices in egg mixture; coat each slice with the cornmeal mixture. Place tomatoes in the hot oil; fry until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Season with salt and black pepper.
