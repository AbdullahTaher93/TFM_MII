In a blender, combine the shallot, anchovies, vinegar, lemon juice, Parmesan, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper. Blend to form a paste. While the machine is running, add the 1/2 cup oil in a thin stream and then add the hot water. Heat the broiler or a grill pan, or light the grill. Coat the swordfish with the 1 teaspoon oil and sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cook the fish for 4 minutes. Turn and cook until golden brown and just done, 4 to 5 minutes longer. Let the fish rest for a few minutes and then cut it into bite-size pieces. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the linguine piccole until just done, about 9 minutes. Reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta water. Drain the pasta and toss with the sauce, the swordfish, 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta water, and the parsley. If the sauce seems too thick, add more of the reserved water.
