Lay the chicken breasts onto a cutting board, and slice each into thin halves. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place the chicken breasts into the hot skillet, and cook until golden brown. Sprinkle the breasts with oregano and lemon verbena, then turn over and cook until golden on the other side and no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes total. Place chicken on a plate, and set aside. Pour the wine, vinegar, and lemon juice into the skillet. Increase heat to high, and bring the wine to a boil. Cook and stir until the wine has reduced by half, then add the chicken breasts, and simmer until reheated.
