Place pecans in a small frying pan over medium-high heat. Shake or stir often until nuts are lightly toasted, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove nuts from pan and set aside. Meanwhile, in an 8- to 10-inch nonstick frying pan, cook bacon over medium-high heat, stirring often, until browned, about 10 minutes. To pan add vinegar, honey, and mustard; whisk until mixture is smooth and comes to a boil. Remove from heat and set aside. Place spinach, apples, and cheese in a serving bowl. Add pecans and warm bacon mixture and mix gently until spinach is evenly coated. Eat immediately.
