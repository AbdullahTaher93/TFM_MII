Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spread melted butter all over a 9x13-inch baking dish. Stir baking mix, lemon-lime soda, sour cream, and softened butter together in a bowl until dough is well-mixed; knead with your hands, adding more baking mix as necessary, until dough is smooth but still sticky. Roll dough into 15 equal-size balls and place dough balls in prepared baking dish, turning to coat each completely in melted butter. Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
