Pour oil into the pot and add onion and garlic; turn to the "Saute" setting. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is tender, about 10 minutes. Mix carrots and spinach into onion mixture; stir well. Lay chicken on top; add macaroni. Pour chicken stock and coconut cream over macaroni; add sriracha sauce, paprika, and salt. Close lid and cook using the "Manual" setting on high until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Release pressure through manual release.
