Bake pie according to package directions. Stir toffee bits and ginger in small bowl until combined. Spoon toffee mixture onto hot pie around edge of pie, leaving center open. Cool on wire rack at least 2 hours. Then refrigerate until ready to serve. Cut pie into 8 slices. Top each slice with a serving of Reddi-wip just before serving.
