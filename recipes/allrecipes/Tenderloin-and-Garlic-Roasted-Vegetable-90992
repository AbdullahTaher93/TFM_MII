Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Combine Italian seasoning and pepper; press onto beef roast. Place roast on rack in shallow roasting pan. Insert ovenproof meat thermometer so tip is centered in thickest part of beef, not resting in fat. Do not add water or cover. Roast 50 to 60 minutes for medium rare; 60 to 70 minutes for medium doneness. Meanwhile, prepare the Garlic-Roasted Vegetables: Cut off top of garlic bulb, cutting through tip of each clove; wrap bulb in foil. Combine potatoes, onions, tomatoes, and zucchini in large bowl; toss. Place garlic, potatoes and onions in jelly roll pan. Roast in oven with tenderloin 30 minutes. Add tomatoes and zucchini to pan; roast 15 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Remove roast when meat thermometer registers 135 degrees F for medium rare; 150 degrees for medium. Tent with foil. Let stand 20 minutes. (Temperature will continue to rise about 10 degrees to reach 145 degrees F for medium rare; 160 degrees F for medium.) Remove vegetables. Squeeze garlic pulp over vegetables; mix. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons cheese and salt to taste. Carve roast; sprinkle with 1/4 cup cheese. Season with salt to taste. Serve with vegetables.
