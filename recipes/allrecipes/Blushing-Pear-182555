Mix gelatin mixes and water in Dutch oven or small stockpot. Bring to boil on medium-high heat; cook 2 min. until gelatin is completely dissolved, stirring frequently. Add pears; partially cover pan with lid. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer 20 min. or just until pears are tender, stirring every 10 min. Remove pears from liquid; reserve liquid for another use (see Tip) or discard. Top pears with whipped topping just before serving.
