Place mushrooms and tomatoes in a small bowl. Add enough boiling water to cover and let stand for 5 minutes. Drain and snip the mushrooms and tomatoes, discarding mushroom stems, if present; set aside. Cook pasta according to package directions, adding green beans to the water with the pasta. Add squash the last 2 minutes of cooking. Drain; keep warm. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl stir together LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, broth, green onion, cornstarch, 1/2 teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning, and 1/4 teaspoon salt; set aside. Season pork lightly with additional salt and lemon-pepper seasoning. In a large skillet heat oil. Cook pork in hot oil over medium heat for 5 to 6 minutes per side or until juices run clear and an instant-read thermometer registers 160 degrees F. Remove meat from skillet; cut the meat into thin bite-size strips. Keep warm. For sauce, drain fat from skillet. Stir cornstarch mixture and add to skillet. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly, scraping up any brown bits from bottom of skillet. Reduce heat; cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Stir in mushrooms and tomatoes. Divide pasta mixture among four plates. Arrange pork strips on each plate; spoon sauce over all.
