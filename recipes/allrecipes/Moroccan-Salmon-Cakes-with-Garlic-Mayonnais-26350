In a small stainless steel or glass bowl, stir together mayonnaise, garlic, and paprika. Set aside. Prepare couscous according to package directions using the 2/3 cup of orange juice in place of water. In a mixing bowl, combine the cooked couscous, red salmon, drained spinach, egg yolks, garlic, cumin, black pepper, and salt. Form into patties. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the olive oil and fry patties until golden brown turning once, about 8 to 10 minutes. Serve with garlic mayonnaise.
