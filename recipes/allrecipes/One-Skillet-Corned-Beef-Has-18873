Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Saute onions and potatoes until slightly browned, then stir in corned beef. Season with pepper and add vinegar 1 tablespoon at a time, cooking for 3 to 5 minutes in between each addition. Partially cover skillet, reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes or until potatoes are tender.
