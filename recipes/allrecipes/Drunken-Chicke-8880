Prepare an outdoor grill for medium heat. Rinse chicken and pat dry. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Coat with mustard. Pour half of beer out of can and refill with Italian style dressing. Place can on a disposable baking sheet. Set chicken on beer can (it acts as a stand), inserting can into cavity of the chicken. Place baking sheet with beer and chicken on the preheated grill. Cover, and cook about 1 hour, until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
