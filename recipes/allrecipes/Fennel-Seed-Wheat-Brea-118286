In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and contents of yeast packet from hot roll mix, whole wheat flour and 1-1/2 teaspoons fennel seed. In a saucepan, heat the water and butter to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat just until moistened. Add egg; beat until blended. Turn onto a floured surface. Knead in cheese until dough is smooth and elastic, about 4-6 minutes. Pat dough into a greased 9-in. square baking dish. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 25 minutes. Brush with milk and sprinkle with remaining fennel seed. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 15 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
