Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the tomatoes, olives, basil, olive oil, salt and pepper into the bowl of a food processor and pulse until all of the ingredients are well blended and the consistency is almost smooth. Scrape the tomato and olive marinade into a large bowl; toss the scallops in the mixture until well coated. Cut prosciutto slices in half lengthwise and wrap each piece around one scallop. Arrange wrapped scallops on a baking sheet and bake in preheated oven for twenty minutes.
