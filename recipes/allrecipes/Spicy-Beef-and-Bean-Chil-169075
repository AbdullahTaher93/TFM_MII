Cook and stir meat and onions in hot oil in Dutch oven or large saucepan on medium-high heat 4 to 5 minutes or until meat is evenly browned. Add steak sauce and tomatoes with their liquid; mix well. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer 30 to 40 minutes or until meat is tender. Stir in beans. Cook until heated through, stirring occasionally. Serve over the rice.
