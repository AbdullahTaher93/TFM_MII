In a large skillet, cook the bacon and remove to a paper towel-lined plate. Add the onion to the bacon drippings and cook until clear (about 5 minutes). Add the spaghetti and the bacon to the onions and toss until well mixed. Add the eggs and the cheese and stir until the cheese is melted. Serve while warm.
