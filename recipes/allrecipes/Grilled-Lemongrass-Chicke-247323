Pound shallot, lemongrass, chile pepper, garlic, and ginger into a coarse paste in a mortar and pestle. Mix in fish sauce, vegetable oil, sugar, and oyster sauce. Place chicken strips in a large resealable plastic bag; add paste and toss to coat. Let chicken marinate in the refrigerator, at least 1 hour. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Thread marinated chicken onto skewers. Grill until chicken is golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes per side.
