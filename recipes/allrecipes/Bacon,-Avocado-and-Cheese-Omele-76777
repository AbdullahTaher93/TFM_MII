Stir together, in a small bowl, tomato, onion, jalapeno, cilantro, lime juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Whisk together eggs, water, and salt and pepper to taste. Heat 1/2 tablespoon CRISCO(R), in an 8-inch skillet, preferably non-stick, over moderately high heat, until the foam subsides. Pour in 1/6 the egg mixture evenly over bottom of skillet. Cook for 1 minute, or until it is set. Sprinkle 1/2 the omelet with 1/6 of the bacon, 1/6 of the avocado and 1/6 of the Monterey Jack cheese; cook the omelet for 1 minute, or until it is set. Fold omelet over the filling, transfer to a plate and keep warm. Repeat in the same manner with the remaining CRISCO(R), egg mixture, bacon, avocado and Monterey Jack cheese. Serve omelets with the salsa.
