Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place walnuts on a baking sheet. Bake until toasted and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Transfer walnuts to a plate to cool. When walnuts are cool, transfer to a resealable plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin. Combine cream cheese, honey, and walnuts in a food processor and pulse until creamy.
