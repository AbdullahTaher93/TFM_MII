Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add lentils. Reduce heat and simmer until lentils are tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions until slightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Add mushrooms and celery; cook until mushrooms have softened, about 7 minutes. Whisk 1/4 cup olive oil, soy sauce, honey, lemon juice, and garlic together in a bowl. Stir almonds into onion mixture; mix well. Carefully fold in lentils and dressing; stir to coat. Serve warm or cold.
