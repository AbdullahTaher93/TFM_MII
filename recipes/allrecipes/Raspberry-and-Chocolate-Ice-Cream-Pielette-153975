Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine graham cracker crumbs and sugar in medium bowl. Mix in spread until crumbs are coated. Press a quarter of the mixture onto bottoms of 4 tartlet pans (4 inch diameter) with removable bottoms. Bake 5 minutes and cool completely. Fill each crust with 1/4 cup of the ice cream and smooth with spoon. Top 2 of the pielettes with about 8 raspberries each. Sprinkle the remaining 2 pielettes with chocolate. Freeze until set, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove sides of tartlet pans before serving.
