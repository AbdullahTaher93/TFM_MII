Combine butter, brown sugar and vanilla in large bowl. Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until creamy. Add flour; reduce speed to low. Beat, scraping bowl often, until mixture leaves side of bowl and forms a smooth, soft dough. Divide dough in half. Shape each half into 6x2-inch round log. If desired, shape logs into squares or triangles. Wrap each log in plastic food wrap; refrigerate at least 2 hours. Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Cut logs into 1/4-inch slices with sharp knife. Place 1 inch apart onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 7 to 9 minutes or until lightly browned on edges. Let stand 5 minutes before removing from cookie sheets. Stir together sugar and cinnamon in small bowl. Roll warm cookies in cinnamon-sugar mixture.
