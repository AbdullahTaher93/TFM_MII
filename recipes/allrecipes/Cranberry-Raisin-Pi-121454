Stir in cranberries and raisins; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cook and stir over medium heat until thickened, about 5 minutes. Pour into crust. Roll out remaining dough between two sheets of waxed paper. cut slits in pastry or use a 1-1/2-in. holly leaf cutter to make a design. Place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edges. Brush pastry with milk if desired. Bake at 400 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool on a wire rack. Refrigerate leftovers.
