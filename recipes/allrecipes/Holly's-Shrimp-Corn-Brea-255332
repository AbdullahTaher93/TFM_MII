Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). (If using a countertop induction oven, preheat to 325 degrees (165 degrees C)). Grease a 9-inch baking dish. Combine cornmeal, baking powder, salt, and Creole seasoning in a bowl. Add eggs and butter; mix until smooth. Fold corn, shrimp, 8 ounces Cheddar cheese, onion, and jalapeno peppers into the batter. Spread in the prepared dish. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons Cheddar cheese on top; continue baking until melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
