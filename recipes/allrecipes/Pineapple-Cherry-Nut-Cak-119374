In a bowl, toss the cherries, pineapple and pecans with 1/2 cup flour; set aside. In a mixing bowl, cream butter and brown sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in extracts. Combine baking powder and remaining flour; add to creamed mixture. Beat on low speed until well mixed. Fold in cherry mixture until moistened. Pour into a greased and floured 10-in. fluted tube pan. Bake at 300 degrees F for 2 hours or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Combine glaze ingredients; drizzle over cooled cake.
