Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place chicken breasts in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Top with croutons and pour soup over all; mix together so that croutons are covered in soup. Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 40 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through (no longer pink).
