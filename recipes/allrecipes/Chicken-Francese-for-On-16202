Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Add chicken to skillet and brown for 5 to 7 minutes, turning occasionally. When chicken is browned, add remaining 6 tablespoons of butter and the lemon juice (if desired, add extra lemon juice to taste). Saute for 6 minutes over medium heat, then remove chicken from skillet. Add cheese to skillet, stir all together until mixture has reached the consistency of a sauce, then pour the sauce over the chicken and serve hot.
