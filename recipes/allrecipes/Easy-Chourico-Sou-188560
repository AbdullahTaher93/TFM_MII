Cook the chourico in a soup pot over medium-high heat until it releases some oil. Add the chopped onion; stir and cook until the onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Mix in the garbanzo beans, diced tomatoes, sweet potatoes, vegetable broth, and thyme. Bring the soup to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the sweet potatoes are soft, about 10 minutes. Stir the baby spinach into the soup and continue cooking for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
