Slice corn from the cob into a large skillet, leaving about a third of the kernel still on the cob. Using the back of the knife, scrape all of the juice and remaining kernels into the skillet. Stir in water, sugar, and salt and cook over medium high heat until sugar has dissolved, about 10 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature before serving.
