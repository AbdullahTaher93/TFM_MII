Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle beef strips lightly with salt and black pepper, and sear the meat in the hot oil until well browned on both sides, 2 to 4 minutes, working in batches. Do not crowd beef. Transfer beef to a plate. Reduce heat to medium, and cook the shallots until they start to become tender, about 2 minutes; stir in ginger and cook 1 additional minute. Stir in the curry paste, and fry 1 more minute. Mix in the chicken broth, and bring to a boil, scraping up and dissolving any brown flavor bits from the skillet. Stir in the coconut milk and fish sauce. Increase heat to medium-high, and return beef and any juices to the skillet. Stir to coat with sauce, and simmer until tender, 10 to 12 minutes; stir in the zucchini, cover the skillet, and simmer until zucchini are tender, about 8 minutes. Mix in the lime zest; sprinkle with cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.
