Beat the soup, milk and eggs in a medium bowl with a fork or whisk. Stir in the corn, corn muffin mix, cheese, and 2/3 cup onions. Pour the soup mixture into a 1 1/2-quart casserole. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes or until the mixture is hot. Top with the remaining onions. Bake for 5 minutes or until the onions are golden brown.
