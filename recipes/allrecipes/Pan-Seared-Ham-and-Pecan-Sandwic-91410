In a large nonstick skillet, warm pecans over medium-heat for 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly toasted, stirring occasionally. Transfer to a small bowl and reserve. Wipe pan clean with paper towel. Add olive oil to pan, swirling to coat. Cook ham slices on one side over medium-heat for 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Turn slices over and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add, pineapple juice, light brown sugar, and Dijon mustard. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until liquid is reduced by 1/2, turning the ham slices occasionally to coat with mixture. Stir in reserved pecans and remove from heat. To assemble the sandwich, spread 1 tablespoon light mayonnaise on each of the bottom halves of a toasted wheat hamburger buns. Place two slices of ham (with some of the reserved juices) on top of the bottom part of the bun. Arrange 2 slices of Italian plum tomatoes and 1/2 cup spinach on top. Place top part of bun on top and serve.
