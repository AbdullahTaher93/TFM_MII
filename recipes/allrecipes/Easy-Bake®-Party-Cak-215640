PREHEAT your oven for 15 minutes. PREPARE THE PAN. Spray the baking pan with cooking spray to prevent sticking. MIX THE BATTER. Pour one cake mix and 2 teaspoons of water into a bowl. Stir until smooth. FILL THE PAN. Spoon the batter into the pan and spread it evenly. BAKE THE CAKE. Use the pan pusher to move the cake into the oven. Bake for 10 minutes. After baking, use the pan pusher to move the cake into the cooling chamber. Let it cool for 10 minutes. TURN THE CAKE. Run a thin spatula along the inner edge of the pan to loosen the cake. Turn the pan upside down and tap gently until the cake falls out. MIX THE FROSTING. Pour one frosting mix and 1 teaspoon of water into a bowl. Stir until smooth. If the frosting is too thick, add an extra drop or two of water. FROST YOUR CAKE. Spread the frosting over the top and sides of the cooled cake. SERVE your cake in thick, triangle-shaped slices.
