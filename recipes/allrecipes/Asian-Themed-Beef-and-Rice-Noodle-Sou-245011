Heat oil in a stock pot over medium heat and cook and stir steak until it begins to brown, about 2 minutes; season with onion powder and garlic powder. Stir chopped onion into steak mixture; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir beef broth, brown sugar, soy sauce, ginger, and sriracha sauce into beef mixture; bring to a rolling boil. Reduce mixture to a simmer, and stir in rice noodles, carrots, cabbage, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and celery; cover and simmer on low, stirring occasionally, until rice noodles are tender, about 8 minutes.
