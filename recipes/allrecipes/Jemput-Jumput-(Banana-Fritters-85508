Heat oil in a deep fryer or heavy bottomed pan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Sift the flour, salt, and baking powder into a medium bowl. In a separate bowl, mash together the bananas and sugar. Gradually mix flour mixture into mashed bananas, stirring until well combined. Drop batter by spoonfuls into hot oil, and cook, turning once, until browned, 2 to 8 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
