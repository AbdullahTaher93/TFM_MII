Stir chicken stock, water, bay leaves, fish sauce, shrimp bouillon, soy sauce, chicken bouillon, Chinese five-spice powder, garlic powder, and onion powder together in a stockpot; bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium. Add carrots, celery, red bell pepper, and onion; bring stock to a simmer and cook until the vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add spaghetti to the stockpot; cook until tender yet firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add shrimp, spinach, white wine, ginger, lemongrass, sesame oil, black pepper, and cayenne pepper; stir. Turn heat below stockpot off and let soup sit as the residual heat cooks the shrimp until they are firm and the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more.
