Seed the bell peppers and cut into strips. In a large fry pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the chicken; cook for about 3-4 minutes per side. Add the wine and garlic and cook for 5 minutes. Add the canned tomatoes with the juices. Stir to distribute. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes, loosely covered. Add the peppers, oregano, rosemary, thyme, salt and pepper. Turn over the chicken and cook for another 10 minutes or until the chicken is thoroughly cooked.
