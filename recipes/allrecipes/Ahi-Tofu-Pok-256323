Place tofu on a plate and balance another plate on top. Set a 3 to 5-pound weight on top. Press tofu for 2 to 3 hours; drain and discard the accumulated liquid. Dice tofu into small pieces. Whisk tamari, juice of 1 lime, sesame seeds, sriracha sauce, beet juice, sesame oil, ginger, and dulse powder together in a bowl. Pound nori into a coarse powder using a mortar and pestle. Stir into the tamari mixture. Combine tofu, cucumber, and green onions in an airtight container. Pour in tamari mixture; toss to combine. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator, tossing occasionally to mix evenly, 8 hours to overnight. Toss avocado with juice of 1 lime in a bowl. Heat 1 inch of oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry wonton triangles in batches until golden brown, about 10 seconds. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Top each fried wonton with a small heap of the marinated tofu mixture and some diced avocado.
