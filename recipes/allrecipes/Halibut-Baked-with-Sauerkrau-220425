Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x12-inch glass baking dish with cooking spray. Pat dry halibut fillets with paper towels. Season each side with salt and black pepper. Place fillets in prepared baking dish; top each fillet with sauerkraut. Spread tomatoes over fillets. Cover the dish loosely with foil. Bake in the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 12 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle with malt vinegar before serving, if desired.
