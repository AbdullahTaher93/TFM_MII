In mixing bowl, combine pie filling, milk, vanilla, and 1/2 of the whipped topping; mix on low speed until blended. Increase speed and beat until thick, about 2 minutes. Pour 1/3 of mixture into crust; layer sliced bananas on top, reserving 1/2 banana for garnish. Pour remaining filling into crust. Chill 2 hours. Garnish with remaining bananas, whipped topping and optional chocolate sundae syrup.
