Cook greens in boiling water until tender. Drain, squeezing out as much water as possible. This can be done several hours before cooking in soup. It is not necessary to cut greens, as they will break apart while they cook in soup. Bring broth to a simmer. Add garlic and greens. If using canned white beans, place in a strainer and rinse under cold running water to remove packing liquid. Add beans to broth. Simmer gently, partially covered, for about 10 minutes. Discard garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Do not add salt before soup has finished cooking, or it may become too salty. Ladle into heated bowls. Pass cheese and/or pepper flakes at the table.
