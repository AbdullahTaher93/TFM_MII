Toast oregano in a small dry skillet over medium-high heat until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a plate to cool. Combine 1/2 teaspoon toasted oregano and 2 tablespoons onion in a small bowl. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the remaining 6 tablespoons onion and salt; cover and cook over medium heat until the onions are translucent, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the remaining 1/2 teaspoon toasted oregano and chili powder and cook for 1 minute. Add broth and hominy, bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Add beans and chicken; return to a simmer and cook until the chicken is no longer pink in the middle, about 5 minutes. Top with cabbage and the reserved onion-oregano mixture. Serve with lime wedges.
