Stir together Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, liquid smoke, lemon juice, teriyaki sauce, ketchup, and hot pepper sauce in a bowl. Season with garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper. Mix in the sliced venison until completely coated. Cover tightly, and marinate at least 8 hours in the refrigerator. Prepare jerky in a food dehydrator according to manufacturer's directions, or dry on racks in the oven at 150 degrees F (65 degrees C) until the jerky has dried and will snap when bent, 10 to 12 hours.
