Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Pour beans into a 2 quart casserole dish. Place bacon in a 9 inch skillet, completely covering bottom of pan. Spread brown sugar over bacon and cook on medium heat. When bacon grease starts to bubble up through the sugar, transfer to the casserole dish and mix with beans. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes.
