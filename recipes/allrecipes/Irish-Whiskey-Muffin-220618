Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups. Stir together flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a bowl. Mix Irish cream liqueur and Irish whiskey in a 1-cup measure. Pour milk into same measuring cup for a total of 8 fluid ounces. Whisk together egg, milk mixture, and butter in a bowl. Gently stir liquid ingredients into dry ingredients until just moistened. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
