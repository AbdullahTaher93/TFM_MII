In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in milk. Stir in butter, eggs, sugar and salt. Combine 3 cups flour, raisins, currants, cinnamon and allspice; add to yeast mixture and mix well. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down; shape into 1-1/2- to 2-in. balls. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Using a sharp knife, cut a cross on top of each roll. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Beat water and egg yolk; brush over rolls. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire racks. Pipe icing over rolls.
