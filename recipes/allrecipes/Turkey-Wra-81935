On a microwave safe plate, place the turkey with the cooked bacon on top and the cheese on top of that. Zap for about 30 seconds or just until the cheese melts. Slather the mayo onto 1/2 of the tortilla. Place the turkey, bacon and cheese in the middle of the mayo. Add the avocado slices and the sprouts and then wrap-up.
