Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine cooked pork, enchilada sauce, onion powder, 1/2 cup sour cream, green chilies, and one cup of the shredded cheese in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, stir together tomato soup, remaining 1/2 cup sour cream, garlic powder, and cumin. Pour a thin layer of the tomato soup mixture into a 9x13 baking dish. Spread pork mixture down the center of each tortilla. Roll tortillas to enclose filling; place seam side down in the baking dish. Pour the remaining soup mixture over the filled tortillas. Top with the remaining 1 cup cheese. Bake in preheated oven until hot and bubbly, about 30 minutes.
