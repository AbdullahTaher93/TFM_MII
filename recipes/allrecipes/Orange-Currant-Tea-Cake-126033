FOR TEA CAKES: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray mini-muffin tins with baking spray; set aside. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine currants and 3/4 cup orange juice. Heat on 100% POWER for 4 to 5 minutes. Use a mesh strainer to drain juice into a measuring cup, reserving currants. Add enough orange juice (about 1/4 cup) to yield 3/4 cup. In a medium bowl, combine pound cake mix, pumpkin pie spice, eggs, orange juice, and orange extract. Use an electric mixer to beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then on medium speed for 2 minutes. Stir in reserved currants. Spoon a generous 1 tablespoon of batter into each muffin cup. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 22 minutes or until light, just barely golden brown. (NOTE: If necessary, work in batches. Wash muffin cups between baking. Dry and re-spray with baking spray as directed.) Remove tea cakes from muffin tins and let cool for 5 minutes. FOR GLAZE: In a small bowl, combine all glaze ingredients. Stir until smooth. Dip top of each tea cake in glaze and let cool completely.
