Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Crumple 6 sheets of foil to make 6 (3-inch) balls; place on baking sheet. Top each with 1 tortilla; spray with cooking spray. Bake 6 to 8 min. or until tortillas are golden brown. (Tortillas will drape over balls as they bake to form cups.) Meanwhile, combine chicken and salsa in microwaveable bowl; cover with waxed paper. Microwave on HIGH 2 min. or until heated through; stir. Fill tortilla cups with chicken mixture; top with remaining ingredients.
