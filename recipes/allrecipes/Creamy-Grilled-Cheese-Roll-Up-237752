Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Flatten bread slices on a work surface using a rolling pin. Mix cream cheese, chives, onion, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl until smooth and creamy. Spread a thick layer of cream cheese mixture on 1 side of each piece of bread. Place 1 slice provolone cheese over cream cheese layer. Roll bread around cheese filling and secure each roll with a toothpick. Brush each cheese roll with butter and place, seam-side down, on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes; flip rolls and continue baking until lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes more. Remove toothpicks and cut each roll in half.
