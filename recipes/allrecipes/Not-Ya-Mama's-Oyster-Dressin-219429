Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch square baking dish. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion and garlic until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the parsley, oregano, thyme, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper until combined, and gently mix in the oysters. Cook, stirring often, until the edges of the oysters begin to curl, about 8 minutes. Stir in the bread crumbs and reserved oyster liquid until the stuffing is thoroughly combined. Lightly spoon the stuffing into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the stuffing with Parmesan cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
