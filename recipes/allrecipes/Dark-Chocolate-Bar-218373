Line baking sheet with wax paper. Combine pretzels, chips and peanuts in small bowl. Microwave chocolate in small, uncovered, microwave-safe bowl on Medium-high (70%) power for 45 seconds; stir. If pieces retain some of their original shape, microwave at additional 10- to 15-second intervals, stirring just until melted. Stir in half of snack-peanut mixture. Pour onto prepared baking sheet. Spread mixture to desired thickness. Sprinkle with remaining snack-pretzel mixture. Tap sheet several times to spread chocolate and settle pretzels. Refrigerate for 30 minutes or until firm. Break into pieces. Store in airtight container at room temperature. Best when eaten within 24 hours.
