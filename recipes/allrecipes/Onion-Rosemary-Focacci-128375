Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Coat a baking sheet with nonstick spray. Sprinkle with the cornmeal. Warm the oil in a medium nonstick skillet set over medium heat. Add the onion, rosemary, and salt. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 to 20 minutes, or until very soft. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Roll into a 12 x 6-inch (30 x 40-cm) rectangle. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with the basil. With your fingertips, press the basil into the dough. Top with the onion mixture. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the crust is browned.
