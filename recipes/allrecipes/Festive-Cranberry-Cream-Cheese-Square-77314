Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In large bowl, beat flour, oats, 3/4 cups brown sugar and butter until crumbly. Reserving 1 1/2 cups crumb mixture, press remaining mixture on bottom of greased 15x10-inch jellyroll pan. Bake 15 minutes, or until lightly browned. Meanwhile in medium bowl, beat cream cheese until fluffy. Gradually beat in sweetened condensed milk until smooth; beat in eggs. Spread over baked crust; top with mincemeat. Combine remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and cornstarch; stir in cranberry sauce. Spoon over mincemeat. Top with reserved crumb mixture. Bake 40 minutes or until golden. Cool. Chill. Cut into squares. Garnish as desired. Refrigerate leftovers.
