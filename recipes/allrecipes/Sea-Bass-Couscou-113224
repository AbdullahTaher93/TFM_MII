In a large pot, heat the oil over moderately low heat. Add the onion and bell pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until starting to soften, about 4 minutes. Stir in the paprika, coriander, cayenne, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, and 1 teaspoon of the salt. Add the broth, tomatoes, and sweet potatoes. Simmer until the potatoes are almost tender, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, bring the water and 3/4 teaspoon of the salt to a boil. Stir in the couscous. Cover, remove from the heat, and let sit for 5 minutes. Stir the chickpeas, fish, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt into the sweet-potato mixture. Simmer until the fish is just done, about 4 minutes. Serve the fish and vegetables over the couscous. Ladle the liquid over the top.
