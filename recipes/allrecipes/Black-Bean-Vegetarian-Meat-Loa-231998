Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously coat the inside of an 8x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Mash black beans in a large bowl. Mix crackers, Cheddar cheese, bell peppers, corn, onion, jalapeno pepper, egg white, taco seasoning, and Ranch seasoning into black beans until evenly mixed. Spoon mixture into the prepared baking dish; form into a loaf. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 45 to 60 minutes.
