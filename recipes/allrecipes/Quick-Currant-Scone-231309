Pulse flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a food processor. Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles oatmeal. Transfer to a bowl. Stir cream into flour mixture until just combined. Fold currants into dough. Transfer dough to a sheet of plastic wrap; fold to completely cover dough. Shape dough into a 1-inch thick disk and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicon mat. Unwrap dough and cut into 8 wedges. Arrange wedges on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes.
