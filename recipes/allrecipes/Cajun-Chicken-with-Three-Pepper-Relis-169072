Pour 1/2 cup of the marinade over chicken in resealable plastic bag; seal bag. Turn bag over several times to evenly coat chicken. Refrigerate 30 minutes. Meanwhile, mix peppers, celery, onion, garlic and lime juice until well blended; cover. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Preheat grill to medium heat. Remove chicken from bag; discard marinade. Grill 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked through, turning and brushing occasionally with the reserved 1/4 cup marinade. Serve with pepper relish.
