Combine cranberries and sugar in saucepan; cook over medium-low heat until berries release juices, about 8 minutes. Place pears a medium bowl, and toss with lemon zest and juice. Add orange juice, raisins, and dates to cranberries. Raise heat to medium-high. Stir occasionally, adding pears when mixture begins to bubble. Cook, stirring, until mixture thickens and pears turn red and are cooked through, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Let cool; refrigerate up to 24 hours.
