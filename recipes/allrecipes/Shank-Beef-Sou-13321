In large stock pot soak peas in 2 cups water for 1 hour. Cook peas over medium heat, continually checking to see if more water needs to be added. When peas are half way done, (approximately 40 minutes) add sweet potatoes and eddoes. Pressure cook beef shank with garlic until tender. In a separate mixing bowl combine flour, cornmeal, and enough water to form a workable dough. Knead to a non-sticky consistency, adding more flour if dough is sticking. Roll dough out to a 1/4 of an inch thickness and cut into 1 inch by 1 inch strips. Once split peas and potatoes are cooked through add celery, onion, shank and dumplings. Season with thyme, sugar, vinegar, salt and pepper. Let simmer until dumplings are floating and then serve.
