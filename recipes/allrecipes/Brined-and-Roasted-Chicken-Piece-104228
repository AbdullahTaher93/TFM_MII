In a gallon-size sealable plastic bag, dissolve the Morton(R) Kosher Salt and sugar in 1-quart of cool water. Add the chicken, then seal the bag, pressing out as much air as possible. Refrigerate for about 1 hour. Remove chicken from the brine; rinse well under cool water. Pat dry with paper towel. Combine butter, garlic and pepper. Brush the chicken pieces on all sides with the egg yolks. Spread the garlic mixture over the chicken and lightly pat so that chicken is evenly coated. Transfer the chicken pieces (skin-side-up) to an oiled rack in roasting pan. Roast uncovered at 425 degrees F until juices run clear and chicken is cooked through (internal temperature reaches 170 degrees F for poultry breast meat and 180 degrees F for poultry thigh meat). (About 30 to 35 minutes for legs and wings; 40 to 45 minutes for breasts and thighs). Remove legs and wings to serving platter when cooked through and keep warm. Remove the breasts and thighs when cooked through, and serve.
