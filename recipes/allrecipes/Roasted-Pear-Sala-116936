In a bowl, toss pears with 1 teaspoon oil. Place in a 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10 minutes. Turn pears over;bake 5-7 minutes longer or until golden and tender. When cool enough to handle, peel pears. Thinly slice two pear halves lengthwise and set aside. Place remaining pear halves in a food processor or blender. Add the vinegar, water, honey, salt and white pepper; cover and process until smooth. While processing, slowly add remaining oil. In a large bowl, toss the salad greens, watercress, nuts and cranberries. Arrange pear slices on top; drizzle with dressing.
