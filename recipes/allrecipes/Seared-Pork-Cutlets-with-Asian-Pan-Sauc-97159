Heat oil in a large skillet over low heat. Sprinkle both sides of pork with salt and pepper. In a small bowl whisk together broth, soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, garlic and ginger; set aside. Increase heat to medium-high. When wisps of smoke start to rise from the pan, add pork; saute until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Transfer chops to a plate, cover and keep warm. Add broth mixture to empty skillet; simmer to blend flavors and thicken, about 4 to 5 minutes. Serve sauce with pork chops.
