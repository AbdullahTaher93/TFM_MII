In a saucepan, saute onion in butter until tender. Stir in flour until blended. Gradually add broth and milk. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in cheese. Pour 1/3 cup each into two greased 8-in. square baking dishes; set aside. In a bowl, combine 1 cup cheese sauce, chicken, broccoli, eggs, bread crumbs, pimientos, parsley and salt if desired. Spread about 1/2 cup over each noodle. Roll up jelly-roll style, beginning with a short side; secure ends with toothpicks. Place six roll-ups curly end down in each baking dish. Top with remaining cheese sauce. Cover and freeze one casserole for up to 3 months. Cover and bake second casserole at 350 degrees F for 40 minutes. Uncover; bake 5 minutes longer. Discard the toothpicks before serving.
