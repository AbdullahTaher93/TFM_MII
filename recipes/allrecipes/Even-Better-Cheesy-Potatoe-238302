Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt 6 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is slightly softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix potatoes, Mexican cheese blend, sour cream, cream of chicken soup, and onion mixture together in a bowl; pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix corn flakes, melted butter, and garlic salt together in a bowl; sprinkle over potato mixture. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until corn flake topping is lightly browned, about 30 minutes more.
