Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Toss okra with olive oil, paprika, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper in a bowl. Grill okra on the preheated grill until 1 side is bright green with visible grill marks, about 5 minutes. Turn okra, cover grill, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer okra to a serving bowl; sprinkle with lemon juice, rosemary, and thyme.
