Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Spray 15x10x1-inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray. In medium bowl combine Simply Potatoes(R), oil and taco seasoning; stir to coat potatoes. Place potatoes in single layer on prepared pan. Bake, turning Simply Potatoes(R) occasionally, 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown and slightly crisp. Meanwhile, cook ground beef in 10-inch nonstick skillet until browned; drain grease. Stir in salsa con queso and salt. To serve divide potatoes evenly onto 4 dinner plates. Top each serving of potatoes with one-fourth of meat mixture, generous 1/3 cup lettuce, 1/4 cup tomatoes, 1 tablespoon green onion and 1 tablespoon black olives. Top with sour cream if desired.
