Place sweet potatoes in a Dutch oven; cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and cook for 30-35 minutes or until tender. Drain; cool slightly. Peel the potatoes and place in a large mixing bowl; mash. Add the pineapple, butter, orange juice, egg, salt, mace and ginger; mix well. Transfer to a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 20-30 minutes or until heated through. Combine the coconut, pecans and brown sugar; sprinkle over the top. Bake 8-10 minutes longer or until topping is lightly browned.
