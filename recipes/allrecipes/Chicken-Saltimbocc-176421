Working with 2 pieces at a time, lay chicken breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. With a meat mallet or rolling pin, pound meat to 1/4 inch thickness. Repeat with remaining chicken. Season chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Arrange 2 sage leaves on top of each chicken breast. Wrap 1 slice of the prosciutto around meat like a belt, covering sage. Pour 1/4 cup flour into a pie pan. Dredge prosciutto-wrapped chicken in flour and set aside. In a large frying pan over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Add 2 chicken pieces and cook, turning once, until breasts are well browned and prosciutto is crisp, about 4 minutes total. Transfer cooked chicken to a clean plate and cover with foil; repeat with remaining chicken pieces. Do not wash frying pan. Reduce heat to medium. In same pan, melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter and whisk in remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons flour to drippings and stir for 1 minute. Whisk in wine and broth. Let mixture come to a boil, then remove from heat. Pour sauce over chicken, garnish with fresh sage leaves, and serve on buttered egg noodles.
