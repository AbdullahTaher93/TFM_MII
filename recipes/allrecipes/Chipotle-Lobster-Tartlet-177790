Bake, cool and remove the 'tops' of the pastry shells according to the package directions. Stir the mayonnaise, cilantro, chipotle pepper, lime juice and zest in a medium bowl. Add the lobster, avocado and green onions and toss to coat. Spoon about 1 teaspoon lobster mixture into each pastry shell. Garnish with the cilantro. Serve immediately.
