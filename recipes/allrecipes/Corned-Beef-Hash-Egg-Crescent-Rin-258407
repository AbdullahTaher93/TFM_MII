Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Separate crescent rolls and arrange them on the parchment paper in a circle with the short sides of triangles forming a 4-inch circle; overlap the edges of the pieces. Press dough where it overlaps to flatten. Whisk eggs, milk, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Melt butter on medium low heat in a nonstick pan. Add chopped red peppers and jalapeno peppers. Cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Pour in eggs. Gently scramble, pushing and lifting eggs until just set, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Heat vegetable oil on medium heat in a nonstick pan. Add Hormel Corned Beef Hash. Cook and stir until heated through and beginning to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Spoon corned beef hash around the crescent roll ring. Top with 1/2 cup shredded cheese and scrambled eggs. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup shredded cheese. Pull the points of each triangle over the hash, eggs, and cheese and carefully tuck under the center to form a ring. Some areas will have exposed filling. Bake in preheated oven until browned, about 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool 3 minutes before serving. Serve with salsa.
