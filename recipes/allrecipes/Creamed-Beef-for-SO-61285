Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; stir in the ground beef, chicken bouillon, garlic powder, black pepper, and onion powder. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 7 minutes. Stir in the flour and cook for 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in the milk and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 5 minutes to thicken.
