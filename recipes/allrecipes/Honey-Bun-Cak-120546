In a large mixing bowl, combine dry cake mix, egg whites, sour cream and applesauce. Beat on low speed until moistened. Beat on medium for 2 minutes. Pour half into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Combine brown sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over batter. Cover with remaining batter; cut through with a knife to swirl. Bake at 325 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. For glaze, combine confectioners' sugar, milk and vanilla until smooth; drizzle over warm cake.
