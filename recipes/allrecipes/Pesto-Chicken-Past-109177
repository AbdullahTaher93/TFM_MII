Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid and return pasta to pot. In a medium bowl, mix chicken, tomatoes, pesto and feta cheese. Pour mixture over pasta, adding some of the reserved cooking liquid if needed; toss to coat. Serve with extra feta, passed separately.
