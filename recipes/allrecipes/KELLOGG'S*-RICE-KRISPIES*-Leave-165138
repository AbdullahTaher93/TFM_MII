In a large microwave-safe bowl, melt margarine or butter and marshmallows in a microwave set on HIGH for 2 minutes, stirring after 1 minute. Stir until mixture is smooth. Add KELLOGG'S* RICE KRISPIES* cereal, stirring until well coated. Spread cereal mixture into a 33 x 23 x 5 cm (13 x 9 x 2 in) baking pan coated with cooking spray or butter. When slightly cooled, cut cereal mixture with leaf-shaped cookie cutters or use a knife to cut leaf shapes. Allow to cool. Decorate by spreading frosting over top of leaves. Draw veins on leaves with decorating gel.
