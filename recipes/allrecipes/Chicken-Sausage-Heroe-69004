In a bowl, mix the ground chicken, Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, sun-dried tomatoes, parsley, fennel seeds, pepper, and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Form into 8 links. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet, and cook the sausage links 10 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat, and saute the onion and garlic about 5 minutes, until tender. Stir in the green bell pepper and red bell pepper. Cook and stir about 5 minutes, until tender. Sprinkle with vinegar and season with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Place sausages on the bottom of the loaf of bread, cover with the vegetables, and layer with provolone cheese. Form a long sandwich by replacing the top of the loaf, and cut into slices to serve.
