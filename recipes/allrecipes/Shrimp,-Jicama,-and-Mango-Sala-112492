In a large frying pan, bring the water and 3/4 teaspoon of the salt to a boil. Add the shrimp, cover, and bring back to a boil. Cook, covered, over moderate heat for 1 minute. Stir. Continue cooking until the shrimp are just done, about 2 minutes longer. Drain. When the shrimp are cool enough to handle, cut each one in half lengthwise and then in half crosswise. Put the shrimp in a large glass or stainless-steel bowl and add the jicama, mango, and cilantro. In a small glass or stainless-steel bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, the mustard, the remaining 1 1/4 teaspoons of salt, and the pepper. Add the oil slowly, whisking. Just before serving, add this vinaigrette to the shrimp mixture and toss.
