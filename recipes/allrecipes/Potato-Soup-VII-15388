In a large saucepan over high heat, add the potatoes, water, onions, celery, carrots and bouillon. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. Mash slightly. In a small bowl, mix together the milk powder and the flour. Gradually add the milk, stirring until smooth. Add the milk/flour mixture to the potato mixture, stirring constantly. Cook and stir until soup is thick and bubbly.
