Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray 4 muffin cups with cooking spray. Mix flour, 1 tablespoon white sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk milk, 2 tablespoons butter, and apple cider vinegar together in a small bowl. Pour over the flour mixture; mix until a soft dough forms. Dust a flat work surface with flour. Roll dough out to a 6x7-inch rectangle. Spread remaining 2 tablespoons butter on top. Mix remaining 1 tablespoon white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Sprinkle evenly over the buttered dough. Roll dough lengthwise into a log. Cut into 4 pieces using a sharp serrated knife. Place 1 piece in each muffin cup. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on all sides, 13 to 15 minutes.
