Season eggplant slices with salt and pepper; let stand for 2 minutes. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute 1/2 of the eggplant until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining olive oil and eggplant. Preheat a panini press according to manufacturer's instructions. Layer eggplant, roasted red pepper, and mozzarella cheese, respectively, onto the bottom piece of each flat bread. Spread 1 tablespoon hummus on the inside of each top piece of flat bread and place over the mozzarella layer, creating a panini. Grill each panini on the preheated panini press until cooked through and cheese is melted, about 7 minutes.
