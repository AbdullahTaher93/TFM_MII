Place watermelon, lemon juice, ginger juice, sugar, salt, and black pepper in a blender; blend until smooth. Pour mixture through a fine mesh strainer to strain the pulp from the juice. Pour juice back into the blender; add cold water and ice and blend. Pour lemonade into glasses and stir gently; garnish with mint leaves.
