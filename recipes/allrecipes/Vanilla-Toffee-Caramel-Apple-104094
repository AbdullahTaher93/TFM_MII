Microwave caramels and vanilla for 2 1/2 - 3 minutes on high or until caramel is melted, stirring every minute. Dip top of each apple slice in caramel. Remove and twist caramel around the apple. Then, roll in toffee. Place each apple slice on its side on wax paper and either refrigerate or let stand until caramel sets.
