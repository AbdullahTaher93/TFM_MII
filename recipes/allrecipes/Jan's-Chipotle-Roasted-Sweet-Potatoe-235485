Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Toss sweet potatoes and butter together in a large bowl. Whisk brown sugar, onion powder, garlic powder, chipotle chile powder, salt, and black pepper together in a small bowl; sprinkle over sweet potatoes and toss to coat. Pour potatoes in a single layer onto the prepared baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender, 30 to 45 minutes.
