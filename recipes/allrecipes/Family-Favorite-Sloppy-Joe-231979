Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Mix ketchup, chili sauce, brown sugar, Parmesan cheese, relish, onion, and Worcestershire sauce into ground beef; simmer until heated through and flavors blend, 20 to 25 minutes.
