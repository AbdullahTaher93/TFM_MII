In a wide nonstick frying pan, combine oil, onion, and garlic. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until onion is tinged with brown (about 4 minutes). Add mole paste and 1/2 cup broth. Stir to incorporate mole; then cook, stirring, until almost all liquid has evaporated (about 4 minutes). Remove from heat. Add beans to pan, mashing about half of them to thicken the mixture. If mixture is too thick for dipping easily, stir in a little more broth, 1 tablespoon at a time, until mixture has the desired consistency. Spread bean mixture 3/4 inch thick on a platter; set aside. (At this point, you may cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day.) In a food processor or blender, combine cilantro, chiles, and taco sauce. Whirl until mixture forms a paste as thick as pesto; occasionally scrape down paste from sides of container. Spoon chile mixture over center of beans; sprinkle cheese over chile mixture.
