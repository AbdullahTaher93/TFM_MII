Thaw fish, if frozen. Prepare Blueberry Tzatziki (see Step 4 below); chill. Preheat broiler. Rinse fish; pat dry with paper towels. Measure thickness of fish. Brush fish with oil and lemon juice; sprinkle with oregano and pepper. Place fish on the greased unheated rack of a broiler pan. Broil 4 inches from heat until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Allow for 4 to 6 minutes per 1/2-inch thickness of fish, turning once if fish is 1 inch thick or more. Serve fish with Blueberry Tzatziki and blueberries. Garnish with fresh oregano (if desired).
