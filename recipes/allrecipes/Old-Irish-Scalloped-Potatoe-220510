Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Arrange thinly sliced potatoes in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer butter slices on top of potatoes. Season with salt and black pepper. Pour half-and-half evenly over potato mixture. Bake in preheated oven until sauce has thickened and potatoes are tender, 45 to 60 minutes.
