Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a large dish, combine the garlic with the rosemary, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and 1 teaspoon of pepper. Add the chicken and turn to coat. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Light a grill or preheat a grill pan. Spread the diced bread on a pie plate and bake for 5 minutes. In a small nonstick skillet, heat 1 teaspoon of the olive oil. Add the Canadian bacon and raisins and cook over moderately high heat until the bacon is browned, 1 minute. Transfer to a small plate. Add 1 tablespoon of the vinegar to the skillet, then scrape it onto the plate. In a small bowl, mix the mustard with the lemon juice, remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of vinegar; season with salt and pepper. Season the chicken with salt and grill over a hot fire until lightly charred and just cooked, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a carving board. In a large bowl, combine the watercress, walnuts, croutons, Canadian bacon and raisins. Add the dressing and toss to coat. Cut each breast into 3 crosswise pieces on the bias. Mound the salad on plates, top with the chicken and serve.
