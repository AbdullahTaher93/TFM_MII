Beat eggs in a large bowl until frothy. Stir in salt, 3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons ice water, and 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour until just incorporated but batter is still very lumpy. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dry sweet potato slices well. Dip 3 slices at a time in the batter, letting excess batter drip back into the bowl. Fry until golden brown, turning once, about 2 minutes per side. Lift out with a slotted spoon onto a cooling rack set over paper towels. Repeat with remaining slices. Whisk rice wine and soy sauce together in a small bowl to make dipping sauce.
