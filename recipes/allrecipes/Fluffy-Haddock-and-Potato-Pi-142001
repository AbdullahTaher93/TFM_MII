Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bring potatoes to a boil in a large pot of salted water. Cook until tender enough to insert a fork, but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and move to a large bowl. Meanwhile, place the haddock in a large saucepan over medium heat. Pour the milk over the fish and then sprinkle with the green onions. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until the fish flakes easily with a fork. Transfer haddock to a plate. Remove the bones and skin and discard. Pour the milk mixture over the diced potatoes; beat until smooth. Blend in the creme fraiche. Season with salt and pepper. Gently fold the haddock into the mixture along with half of the shredded Emmentaler cheese. Spoon the mixture into a large, shallow baking dish. Sprinkle the remaining Emmentaler cheese over the top Bake in preheated oven until the surface has turned golden brown, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately.
