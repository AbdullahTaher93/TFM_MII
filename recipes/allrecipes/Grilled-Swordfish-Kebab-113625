In a large, shallow dish, combine the olive oil, garlic, cumin, paprika, parsley and crushed red pepper. Add the swordfish and stir to coat with the marinade. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Light a grill. Thread the swordfish onto 6-inch skewers. Season with salt. Grill the kebabs over a hot fire, turning once, until lightly charred and cooked through, about 8 minutes. Serve hot, with lemon wedges and harissa.
