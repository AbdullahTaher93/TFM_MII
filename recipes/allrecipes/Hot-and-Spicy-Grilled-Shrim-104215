If using frozen shrimp, thaw in refrigerator or overnight. Shell and devein the shrimp, leaving the tail intact. In a large bowl, toss the peeled shrimp with Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM), making sure to coat them evenly. Thread 4 shrimp onto each wooden or metal skewer and set aside in refrigerator, until needed. In a bowl, combine the ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, honey, green onions, garlic, lemon juice, dill, melted butter and the 1/2 teaspoon of Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM). Preheat grill to medium-high. Grill the shrimp for 2 to 3 minutes per side, basting with Hot Salt 'N Honey BBQ Sauce, until the shrimp are opaque in color and just done. Baste with extra sauce and serve immediately.
