On a cutting board, cut sausage links into 1-inch pieces; set aside. In a Dutch oven, cook pierogies according to package directions. Drain and keep warm. In a large skillet, melt butter and saute onion until tender, about 5 minutes. Add sausage, continue to cook and stir until sausage is heated through and brown. Stir in prepared pierogies. Sprinkle with parsley, if desired. Serve.
