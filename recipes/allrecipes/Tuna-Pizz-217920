Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread the softened cream cheese on the pre-baked crust. Sprinkle the tuna and onions over the pizza; then top with shredded mozzarella cheese and optional red pepper flakes. Bake in preheated oven until the cheese has melted and started to brown, about 15 to 20 minutes.
