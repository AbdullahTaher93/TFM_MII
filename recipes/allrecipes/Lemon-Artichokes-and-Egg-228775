Trim artichoke stems, cut away leaves, and remove the fibrous portion at the center of the artichoke, leaving the heart. Slice the hearts. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir artichoke slices and garlic until garlic just begins to turn golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice, mint, salt, and black pepper; continue to cook until artichoke slices are tender. Spoon a little water into skillet if juices evaporate. Pour beaten egg into the skillet and scramble gently until egg is set and not runny, 2 or 3 minutes; serve immediately.
