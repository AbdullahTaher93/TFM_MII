Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, stir together flour, sugar, beer, cheese and chilies. Spoon batter into prepared loaf pan; spread batter to evenly fill pan. Pour melted butter on top of loaf. Bake in preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of loaf comes out clean.
