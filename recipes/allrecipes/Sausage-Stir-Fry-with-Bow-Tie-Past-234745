Cook and stir sausage slices in a skillet over medium heat until cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer sausage to a plate using a slotted spoon and set aside. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Heat oil in the same skillet used for sausage over medium heat; cook and stir onion, zucchini, mushrooms, red bell pepper, and garlic in the hot oil until tender, about 10 minutes. Add cooked sausage, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, and black pepper to vegetable mixture; cook until sauce and sausage are heated through, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir pasta into sauce and mix well; top with Parmesan cheese.
