In a small saucepan, place raisins and enough water to cover; bring to a boil. Turn off heat; set aside. In a heavy saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch, salt, cloves and cinnamon. Stir in sour cream. Beat in egg yolks. Add milk; cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until pudding comes to a boil and is very thick. Remove from the heat. Drain raisins, reserving 1/2 cup liquid. Stir liquid into filling. Add raisins, and nuts if desired. Pour into pie shell. For meringue, in a small mixing bowl, beat egg whites with salt until foamy. Gradually add sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time; beat until stiff and glossy. Spread over pie, making sure meringue covers all of filling. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or until light golden brown. Serve warm or cold. Store leftovers in the refrigerator.
