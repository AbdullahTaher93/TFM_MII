Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Mash butter, chipotle peppers, lime zest, and salt together in a bowl until evenly mixed. Place corn on the grill, place lid on the grill, and cook corn, turning occasionally, until husks are charred, about 20 minutes. Serve corn with spicy butter.
