Preheat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Roll pizza dough onto a baking stone. Spread pureed figs over crust for the 'sauce'. Crumble feta cheese over fig layer. Arrange prosciutto slices evenly over cheese layer. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is crisp and browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Drizzle balsamic vinegar over pizza.
