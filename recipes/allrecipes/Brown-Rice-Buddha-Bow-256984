Combine water, brown rice, and salt in a pressure cooker. Close and secure the lid; bring to high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions. Cook for 10 minutes. Release pressure naturally according to manufacturer's instructions. Drain any remaining water and transfer rice to a large bowl. Whisk lime juice, olive oil, sesame oil, Thai basil, and chile pepper in a small bowl to make dressing. Toast sesame seeds in a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Cook and stir snow peas in the same skillet until bright green, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. Arrange snow peas, chickpeas, tofu, baby corn, carrots, and green bell pepper over the brown rice. Drizzle dressing over the entire bowl; toss to mix. Sprinkle toasted sesame seeds on top. Garnish with green onions and cilantro.
