Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners. Stir oats, whole wheat flour, kamut flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamom together in a bowl. Add apples and toss to coat. Beat buttermilk, canola oil, eggs, and honey together in a separate bowl. Make a well in the center of oat mixture; pour buttermilk mixture into the well. Mix until batter is just moistened. Set aside to soften oats, about 5 minutes. Generously fill muffin cups with batter. Bake in the preheated oven until muffins are golden brown and spring back when lightly touched, 20 to 25 minutes.
