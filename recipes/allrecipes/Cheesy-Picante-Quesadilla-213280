Place 6 tortillas onto 2 baking sheets. Spread about 1/4 cup picante sauce onto each tortilla to within 1/2-inch of the edge. Top each with 1 tablespoon chiles and 1/4 cup cheese. Brush the edges of the tortillas with water. Top with the remaining tortillas and press to seal. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10 minutes or until the filling is hot. Cut each quesadilla into 4 wedges. Serve with additional picante sauce.
