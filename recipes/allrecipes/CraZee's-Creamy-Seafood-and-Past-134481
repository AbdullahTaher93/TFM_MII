Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Bring white wine and milk to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk in sour cream and Parmesan cheese, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in cilantro. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and scallops, and cook until the shrimp begin to firm and turn pink. Stir in the yellow and orange peppers, season with Cajun seasoning, salt, and pepper; continue cooking until peppers are tender. To serve, place cooked pasta into a serving bowl, top with seafood mixture, and pour sauce overtop.
