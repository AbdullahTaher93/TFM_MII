Preheat grill to medium high heat. Clean outer skin of zucchini, and slice lengthwise into quarters. Place a pat of butter or margarine on each zucchini quarter, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Wrap all four quarters in one piece of aluminum foil. Place foil wrapped zucchini on heated grill, and cook for 10 to 15 minutes on each side.
