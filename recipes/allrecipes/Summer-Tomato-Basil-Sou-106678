Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in onions and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, basil and chicken broth. Reduce heat to low and simmer soup for 15 minutes. Set soup aside to cool slightly. Working in batches, puree soup until smooth and return to pot. Stir in heavy cream and season the soup to taste with salt and pepper and up to 1 tablespoon of sugar. Heat soup through over low heat and serve.
