Mix cinnamon and sugar together in a bowl. Pour melted butter into another bowl. Separate biscuits and form each piece of dough into a rope 4 to 5 inches long. Wrap the dough pieces around sticks. Hold sticks over campfire and slowly turn until the biscuit dough is browned and set, 8 to 10 minutes. Dip biscuits into melted butter and then into cinnamon sugar. Eat biscuits from sticks.
