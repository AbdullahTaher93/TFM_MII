In a large bowl, mix flour and salt. With a pastry blender, cut in the shortening until pea-sized. Beat together egg, vinegar and water. Mix liquid with flour mixture, using a fork, until mixture forms a ball (Note: add liquid one tablespoon at a time. You probably will not use all of it.) Roll out on lightly floured pastry cloth with cloth covered roller. Brush the crust with milk and sprinkle with sugar before baking.
