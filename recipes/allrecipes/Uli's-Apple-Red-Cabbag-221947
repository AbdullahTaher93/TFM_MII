Melt butter in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Stir in bacon and cook until just beginning to crisp, 4 to 6 minutes. Add onions; cook and stir until onions are lightly browned and translucent, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in chicken broth, red wine, apple slices, and apple cider vinegar; bring to a boil. Stir in sugar, cloves, bay leaves, nutmeg, cinnamon, salt, and black pepper. Stir in red cabbage; cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until cabbage is soft and cooked through, 30 to 45 minutes.
