Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and transfer pasta to a bowl; stir in butter. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Season chicken with 1 pinch Italian seasoning and black pepper; place in a baking dish. Broil chicken in the oven until no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut chicken into bite-size pieces. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir sun-dried tomatoes and garlic until garlic is softened, about 2 minutes. Stir chicken broth and cornstarch together in a bowl until dissolved; stir into sun-dried tomato mixture. Mix artichoke heart juice, vodka, and lemon juice into chicken broth mixture; simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and stir in artichoke hearts, chicken, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, parsley, and oregano; simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir pasta and 1/4 cup feta cheese into chicken-artichoke mixture and simmer until pasta is warmed and feta cheese is melted, 2 to 3 more minutes. Remove skillet from heat. Sprinkle mixture with remaining 1/4 cup feta cheese; stir.
