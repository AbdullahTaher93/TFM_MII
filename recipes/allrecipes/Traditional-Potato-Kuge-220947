Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Drain any excess liquid from grated potatoes, zucchini, carrot, and onions, then place vegetables in a large bowl. Mix eggs, flour, canola oil, salt, and black pepper into the potato mixture until well blended; pour mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly brown and crisp, about 1 hour.
