In a bowl, beat eggs and milk. Stir in bread crumbs and horseradish. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Shape into 1-1/2-in. balls. Place in a lightly greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until meat is no longer pink. In a large saucepan, combine the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil; add the meatballs. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 15 minutes or until heated through, stirring occasionally.
