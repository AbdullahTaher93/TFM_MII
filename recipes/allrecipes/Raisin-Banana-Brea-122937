In a mixing bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. Add eggs, oil and vanilla; mix well. Stir in zucchini, carrot, banana, raisins and nuts. Pour into four greased and floured 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45-48 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pans to wire racks.
