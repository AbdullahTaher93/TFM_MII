In a large bowl, combine the turkey, bread crumbs, parsley, mint, chili peppers, cumin, ginger, garlic, lemon juice, and egg. Form the mixture into small logs about 4 inches (10 cm) long and 1/2 inch (1 cm) thick. (The recipe will make about 16 kabobs.) Place on the skewers. Grill or broil the kabobs until they are browned on all sides and cooked through, about 10 minutes. To serve, cut the pitas in half. Open each pocket, remove the kabobs from the skewers, and fill each pita with 1 or 2 kabobs, a spoonful of yogurt, some chopped tomatoes and a lettuce leaf.
