Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place broccoli in a large saucepan with enough water to cover. Heat over medium-high heat until water begins to boil; remove from heat and drain. In a large bowl combine broccoli, soup, onion, sour cream and flour. Mix well and transfer to a 2 quart casserole dish. In a small bowl combine stuffing mix and butter; spread over broccoli mixture. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before cutting.
