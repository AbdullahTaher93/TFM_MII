Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and 2 cloves garlic until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir quinoa into onion mixture until lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Pour vegetable broth into quinoa mixture. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer until quinoa is tender, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat salmon, white wine, and water in a saucepan over medium heat. Simmer until salmon is cooked through and easily flaked with a fork, 10 to 12 minutes; drain. Transfer salmon to a plate and flake fish meat; discard skin and set salmon aside. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir 2 cloves garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir Swiss chard and lemon juice into garlic until Swiss chard begins to soften, about 2 minutes; remove from heat. Gently fold flaked salmon and chard into the cooked quinoa. Season with salt and black pepper.
