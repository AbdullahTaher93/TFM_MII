Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray 13x9-inch (3-quart) glass baking dish with cooking spray. In medium bowl, stir Bisquick mix and milk until soft dough forms. Drop half of dough by spoonfuls* evenly in bottom of baking dish (dough will not completely cover bottom of dish). Drizzle about 1 cup pizza sauce over dough. Arrange half of the pepperoni slices evenly over sauce. Top with 1 cup of the cheese. Repeat layers with remaining dough, pizza sauce, pepperoni and cheese. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown, biscuits in center are cooked and cheese in center is bubbly.
