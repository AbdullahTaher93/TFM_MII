In a large, shallow bowl, hold one ear of corn upright and, with a sharp knife, cut kernels from cob. Then, using blunt edge of knife, scrape juice from cob into bowl. Repeat with remaining ears of corn. Discard cobs. Add cucumber, peas, lime peel, lime juice, and shredded sage to bowl. Mix gently but thoroughly; set aside. Melt butter in a small nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Heat until butter just begins to brown; do not scorch (about 4 minutes). Working quickly, pour butter over corn salad and blend well. To serve, line 4 individual plates with lettuce leaves; top with corn salad. Garnish with sage sprigs.
