Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Combine onion, zucchini, chicken broth, beef broth, beef, basil, thyme, rosemary, and white pepper in a stockpot; simmer until beef is cooked through and zucchini is tender, about 30 minutes. Add more chicken broth if mixture becomes too thick. Bring soup to a boil, add noodles, and cook until noodles are tender, yet firm to the bite, 15 to 20 minutes.
