Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8 x 4 inch loaf pans. In a large bowl, beat the eggs lightly. Blend in the sugar, oil, and vanilla. Add flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon; mix just to combine. Stir in the peaches and nuts. Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake for about 1 hour, or until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean.
