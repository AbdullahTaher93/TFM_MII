In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and ginger. In another bowl, beat the eggs, butter and vanilla; stir in pineapple. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in carrot and sunflower kernels. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups three fourths full. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm.
