Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups. Whisk eggs, brown sugar, vegetable oil, and milk together in a bowl until smooth. Stir flour, oatmeal, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into wet ingredients to form a batter. Fill the prepared muffin cups with batter. Bake in preheated oven until tops are golden brown and an inserted toothpick comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
