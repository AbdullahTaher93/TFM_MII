Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. In a large bowl, combine cake mix, pudding mix, eggs, 3/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup water. Beat for 2 minutes at medium speed. Pour batter into a 9x13 inch pan. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes, or until toothpick inserted into cake comes out clean. Remove cake from oven and poke evenly with a fork every 1/2 inch. Frost while still warm. In a medium bowl, combine confectioners sugar, 3 tablespoons water, 3 tablespoons oil and orange juice. Mix thoroughly and pour over cake, allowing it to saturate cake.
