Combine soy sauce, sake, and ginger in a large bowl. Add chicken; turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator, about 30 minutes. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place cornstarch in a large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken; seal bag and toss until chicken is coated with cornstarch. Fry chicken in batches until juices run clear and it is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels or on a wire rack.
