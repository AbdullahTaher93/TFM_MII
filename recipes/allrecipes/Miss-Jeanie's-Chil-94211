Add olive oil to skillet, heat to medium (hot enough to get a sizzle from the meat), then brown ground sirloin, and Italian sausage (remove casing if necessary). Drain fat, and put meat into a large stockpot. Combine tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste and light red kidney beans in the large stockpot. Chop and add green peppers and onion. Stir in chili powder, cayenne pepper, paprika, salt and ground pepper. Continue simmering on a medium heat for approximately 1 hour. Serve in a soup bowl with shredded cheddar cheese or chopped onions on the top.
