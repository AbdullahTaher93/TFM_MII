Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. In a medium bowl, whisk egg white and water until frothy. Add walnuts and almonds and stir to coat completely. In a large plastic bag, combine SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend, cinnamon, ginger, salt, coriander, allspice, and pepper. Holding the open end tightly, shake vigorously to blend. Add half of the nuts to the bag and shake to coat thoroughly. Remove nuts and place on a large nonstick baking sheet. Repeat with remaining nuts and spices, and spread on the baking sheet. Bake, stirring and smoothing nuts into a single layer every 15 minutes. Bake until nuts are caramelized, about 45 minutes. Allow nuts to cool.
