Heat oven to 375 F. Separate dough into 8 triangles. Remove wrappers from chocolate pieces. Place 2 chocolate pieces at wide end of each triangle; place an additional chocolate piece on top of other two pieces. Starting at wide end, roll to opposite point; pinch edges to seal. Place rolls, pointed side down, on ungreased cookie sheet. Curve into crescent shape. Bake 10 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool slightly; sift with powdered sugar. Serve warm.
