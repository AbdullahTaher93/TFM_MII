In a medium bowl, toss the pasta with the tamari or soy sauce, the oil, gingerroot, and garlic. Using a pastry brush dipped in water or a damp paper towel, moisten the rice paper wrappers. Place one-quarter of the pasta mixture in the center of each wrapper. Top each with one-quarter of the carrot, lettuce, basil, mint, and cilantro. Bring the two opposite ends of each wrapper together over the filling and roll up.
