Bring the brown rice and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce the heat to medium-low, place a cover on the saucepan, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes. Spread the rice onto a large platter and chill in refrigerator until cooled completely. Gently toss the cooled rice, diced tofu, tamari almonds, sesame seeds, chopped kale, red cabbage, shredded carrot, chopped flat-leaf parsley, and chopped dill together in a large mixing bowl. Whisk the lemon juice, tamari soy sauce, olive oil, garlic, and mustard together in a small bowl; season with salt and black pepper. Drizzle the dressing over the rice mixture; toss gently to coat evenly.
