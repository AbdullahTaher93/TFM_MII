Mix beef, pork, onion, carrots, water chestnuts, garlic, 1 egg, oyster sauce, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl until well blended. Place about 1 tablespoon beef-pork mixture on an egg roll wrapper with one corner facing you. Fold corner closest to you over filling; fold two side corners toward center and continue rolling wrapper tightly around meat. Brush a small amount of beaten egg over the top corner and press to seal. Repeat with remaining filling and wrappers. Store rolls in a covered container. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry rolls in batches until golden brown, about 7 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Serve immediately.
