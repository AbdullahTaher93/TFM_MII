Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spread vegetables evenly in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with 3 tbsp. olive oil and thyme. Add salt and pepper to taste. Roast vegetables in the center of oven, stirring once, until tender when pierced and edges begin to caramelize, 25 to 30 minutes. Let stand until cool, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook fusilli as directed on package. Drain and rinse under cold water until pasta is cool to touch. Drain well. Transfer pasta to a large bowl; scrape vegetables and pan juices on top. Drizzle with vinegar and additional oil, if desired. Sprinkle with goat cheese; gently mix salad until well blended. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve at room temperature or cover and chill up to 2 days.
