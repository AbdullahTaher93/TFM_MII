In a skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Sear tuna on one side for about five minutes. Flip and sear other side for two to three minutes, or until tuna is cooked to your desired degree of doneness. Remove from skillet and allow to rest. Return skillet to heat and add white wine. Scrape bottom of pan with spatula to remove any bits from browning the tuna. Reduce heat to medium and add shallot and garlic. Cook and stir until shallot is clear, approximately 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in blood orange juice. Boil until the liquid has reduced to half its original volume or until it thickens. Remove from heat. Slice the tuna across the grain. Fan the slices out onto a place and drizzle with blood orange sauce.
