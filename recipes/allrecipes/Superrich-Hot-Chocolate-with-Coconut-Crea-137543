In a small saucepan, combine the coconut milk and sugar and heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar; keep warm. In a medium saucepan, combine the cream and whole milk and bring to a simmer. Add the chocolate chips and remove from the heat. Let stand, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate is melted; whisk until smooth. Pour the chocolate into 8 mugs and spoon some of the coconut milk on top. Garnish with the marshmallows and serve.
