Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in rice, and cook until lightly browned. Pour in the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until all liquid has been absorbed. In a large bowl, mix the green beans, olives, red pepper, green pepper, pickle, tomatoes, and garlic. Toss with the rice. Sprinkle with vinegar and remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, and toss to coat. Cover, and refrigerate 1 hour, or until completely cooled, before serving.
