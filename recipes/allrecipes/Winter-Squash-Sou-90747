Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Pour oil into a 6- to 8-inch frying pan and place over medium-high heat. When oil is hot, add whole sage leaves and stir until they turn a darker green, 45 seconds to 1 minute. With a slotted spoon, lift out leaves and drain on paper towels; set aside. Reserve the oil. Rinse squash; if not cut and seeded already, slice squash in half and scoop out seeds. Discard seeds (or save for another use). Brush cut surfaces of squash and onions with reserved oil. Place squash and onions, cut side down, in a 10- by 15-inch baking pan. Slip garlic under squash. Bake until all vegetables are soft when pressed, 45 to 60 minutes. Reserve pan juices. Scoop flesh from squash skins; discard skins. Peel garlic. Peel and chop onions. In a 3- to 4-quart pan, combine squash, garlic, onions, parsley, chopped sage, and thyme. Mash squash mixture with a potato masher. Stir in reserved pan juices and 4 cups water (or use broth). Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Simmer, covered, to blend flavors, about 25 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Stir any remaining sage cooking oil into soup. Distribute cheese equally among 8 bowls, and ladle soup into bowls. Top soup with fried sage leaves and fresh-ground pepper.
