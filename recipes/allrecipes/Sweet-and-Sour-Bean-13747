Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. Reserve 2 tablespoons bacon fat. Add onions to fat in pan, and saute until soft. Stir in garlic powder, dry mustard, wine vinegar, and brown sugar. Simmer for 20 minutes. In a large pot or slow cooker combine bacon and onion mixture with the kidney beans, lima beans, butter beans, and baked beans. Mix together, and simmer for 70 minutes.
