Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 7x11-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Beat eggs, half-and-half, milk, white sugar, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl; add bread cubes and stir to coat. Let soak until bread is moist, at least 10 minutes. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir apples and brown sugar into the melted butter to moisten the sugar completely; add cinnamon and cook, stirring regularly, until the apples are warmed yet still firm, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir apple mixture into the bread mixture; pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until golden on top and still somewhat soft in the center, 35 to 45 minutes.
