Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Put cauliflower in a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil over the cauliflower and toss to coat; spread onto a baking sheet and season with salt and pepper. Roast in preheated oven until browning along the edges, 25 to 30 minutes. Bring vodka sauce to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat. Reduce heat to low, add spinach, cover the pot, and cook at a simmer, stirring occasionally, until the spinach wilts, 5 to 7 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add frozen tortellini and cook at a boil until the tortellini float to the surface and the filling is hot, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Gently stir cauliflower into the tortellini. Pour warm sauce over the mixture and toss to coat.
