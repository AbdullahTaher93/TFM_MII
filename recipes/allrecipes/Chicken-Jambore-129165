Heat the oil in a large skillet with a lid over high heat. Add the chicken and brown the pieces, stirring constantly, 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium. Stir in the onion, mushrooms, bay leaf, thyme, tarragon, if used, and lemon zest. Saute until the onion and mushrooms begin to soften, about 4 minutes. Pour in the sherry and water. Add the carrots and seasoning to taste, and stir to mix all the ingredients. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and cover the pan. Simmer 5 minutes. Stir in the broccoli florets. Increase the heat to bring the liquid back to a steady simmer. Cover the pan and simmer until the pieces of chicken are tender and the vegetables are just cooked, about 5 minutes. Remove and discard the bay leaf and the sprigs of thyme and tarragon, if used. Blend the cornstarch to a smooth paste with 2 tablespoons cold water. Stir the cornstarch paste into the casserole and simmer, stirring constantly, until thick and smooth, 2 minutes. Check the seasoning, then stir in the parsley.
