Heat the oil over medium heat in a large stockpot. Saute garlic and onion until lightly browned. Stir in tomato paste and add water. Bring to a boil. Add remaining ingredients, lower heat and simmer, uncovered, 45 minutes (or up to 1 1/2hours). Skim foam and fat from the top. Strain the stock in a colander lined with a damp double layer of cheesecloth over a large metal bowl. Discard solids. Let cool. Transfer to airtight storage containers and refrigerate for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 4 months.
