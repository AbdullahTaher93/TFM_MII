Unroll crescent dough and separate into triangles. Sprinkle each with about 2 tablespoons onions. Roll up each from the wide end; place on a ungreased foil-lined baking sheet. Curve ends down to form crescents. Beat the egg and water; brush over dough. Sprinkle with remaining onions. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
