Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Beat sweet potatoes, butter, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg in medium bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Spoon into lightly greased 1-1/2-qt. baking dish; top with the marshmallows. Bake 15 to 20 min. or until sweet potato mixture is heated through and marshmallows are lightly browned.
