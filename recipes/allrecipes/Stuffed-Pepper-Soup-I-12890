Saute onion, celery, garlic, and green pepper in oil until just tender. Do not brown. Stir beef into vegetables; cook until beef is browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in rice. Add tomatoes, juice, water, parsley, sugar, salt, and pepper to the browned beef mixture. Cover, and simmer 45 minutes or until rice is cooked. Adjust liquid if necessary. Stir in cinnamon. Taste for seasoning. Garnish each serving with a parsley sprig.
