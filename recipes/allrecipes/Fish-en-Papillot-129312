Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Cut out 4 12-inch squares of foil or baking parchment. Arrange a quarter of the chopped Asian greens in the middle of each foil or paper square. Top with a fish steak, and sprinkle with the orange zest and juice, basil, garlic, white wine, olive oil, fennel, carrot, and salt and pepper to taste. Fold over the foil or paper to form a packet, leaving a little air inside so the ingredients can steam, and twist the edges to seal. Put the packets on a baking sheet and set aside. Combine the bulgur with 3 cups of water in a large saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until the bulgur is just tender, about 12-15 minutes. Drain the bulgur if necessary. While the bulgur is cooking, put the fish packets into the oven and bake for 10 minutes. Open 1 of the parcels to check that the fish is cooked and will flake easily. Use a fork to fluff the cooked bulgur and mix in the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, basil, cilantro, and spring onions. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve each person a fish packet to open at the table, with the bulgur pilaf in a bowl.
