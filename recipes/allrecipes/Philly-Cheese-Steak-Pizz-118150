Unroll crescent roll dough and place in an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Press onto the bottom and 1/2 in. up the sides to form a crust; seal perforations. Bake at 375 degrees F for 7-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, saute the green pepper, onion and bouillon in oil until vegetables are tender; set aside. Arrange beef over crust. Brush with salad dressing and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Bake 4-5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted. Top with green pepper mixture. Cut into squares.
