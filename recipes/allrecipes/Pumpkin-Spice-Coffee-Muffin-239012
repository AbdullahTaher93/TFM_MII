Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray 24 muffin cups with cooking spray or line with paper liners. Combine warm water and coffee granules together in a cup until coffee is dissolved; pour into a large bowl. Mix flour, sugar, pumpkin puree, vegetable oil, eggs, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and baking powder into coffee until batter is thoroughly mixed; fold in chocolate chips. Fill muffin cups with batter. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
