Heat the oil in a large saucepot or Dutch oven over high heat. Add the pork, onion, garlic, cumin, and cinnamon. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until the pork is lightly browned. Add the broth, tomatoes (with juice), chiles, and black pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 25 minutes. Stir in the butternut squash or pumpkin, zucchini, and bell pepper. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour, or until the pork and squash are tender. Stir in the almonds. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes longer, or until slightly thickened.
