Put the turkey steaks between sheets of plastic wrap and pound them into flat scallops about 1/4 inch thick. Mix the flour with some salt and pepper, and use to coat the scallops, shaking off the excess. Heat the oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the turkey pieces, in one layer, and fry 2 to 3 minutes on each side; transfer to a plate and keep warm. Add the onion to the pan and saute 2 to 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms and saute until soft, about 1 minute longer. Stir in the Madeira and leave to bubble about 2 minutes. Stir in the mustard, oregano, and stock. Return the turkey to the pan and simmer 3 to 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, spoon the turkey and mushrooms onto a warm serving platter. Stir the sour cream into the sauce and warm through, then check the seasoning. Pour the sauce over the turkey and sprinkle with parsley.
