Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 inch ring mold. In a medium bowl, cream together butter and brown sugar. Blend in eggs and lemon juice. Gradually mix in flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Fold in carrots. Transfer the mixture to the prepared ring mold. Bake 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
