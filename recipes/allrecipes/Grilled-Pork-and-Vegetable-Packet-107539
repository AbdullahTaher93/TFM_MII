Preheat an outdoor grill for medium high heat and lightly oil grate. In a medium bowl, mix together pork, bell pepper, onion, zucchini, tomatoes and garlic. Stir in oil and steak sauce. Season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Divide mixture evenly among four 18-inch square pieces of heavy-duty foil. Fold edges of foil to seal the packet well. Place packets on hot grill and cook for 20 minutes, or until vegetables are tender. (Note: Be careful when opening foil packet as the steam that escapes will be very hot.)
