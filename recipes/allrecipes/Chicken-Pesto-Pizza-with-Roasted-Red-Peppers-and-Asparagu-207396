Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Brown chicken with onion and garlic in olive oil in a medium, non-stick skillet. Remove from heat; blend with 2 tablespoons pesto sauce; set aside. Lightly coat a 9x12-inch baking sheet or a 14-inch pizza stone with vegetable oil spray. Press or roll dough onto baking sheet or pizza stone to desired thickness. Spread remaining 2 tablespoons pesto sauce over dough, leaving a 1-inch edge. Arrange chicken mixture, asparagus and roasted red peppers on top. Sprinkle with cheeses. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until cheeses melt and crust is lightly browned.
