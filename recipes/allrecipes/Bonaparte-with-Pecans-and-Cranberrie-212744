With a sharp knife, cut the rind off the top of the cheese. Cover with chopped nuts, pressing them gently into the cheese. Spoon the cranberry sauce uniformly over the top to cover, and sprinkle with more chopped nuts. Place the cheese on a microwave-safe soup plate and microwave at medium-high power for about 3 minutes. Garnish with pecan halves and serve immediately with bread and crackers and a spoon for spreading.
