Arrange sweet onions in the bottom of a slow cooker. Mix salt, brown sugar, paprika, black pepper, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl until seasonings are well mixed; rub all over pork roast. Place roast in the slow cooker, fat-side up. Brush any leftover seasonings mixture from the work surface into the slow cooker. Cook on Low for 1 hour. Pour ginger beer into slow cooker. Continue cooking until roast is tender and pulls apart easily with a fork, 9 to 11 hours.
