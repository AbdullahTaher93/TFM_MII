In a large container, mix the Italian dressing, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, mustard, ginger, and brown sugar. Place chicken in the container and marinate in the refrigerator 8 hours or overnight. Preheat grill for high heat. Lightly oil grill grate. Discard marinade and place chicken on grill. Cook 30 minutes, or until chicken juices run clear. Smaller parts will be done more quickly.
