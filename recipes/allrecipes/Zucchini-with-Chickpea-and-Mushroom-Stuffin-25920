Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a shallow baking dish. Scoop out the flesh of the zucchini; chop the flesh and set aside. Place the shells in the prepared dish. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute onions for 5 minutes, then add garlic and saute 2 minutes more. Stir in chopped zucchini and mushrooms; saute 5 minutes. Stir in coriander, cumin, chickpeas, lemon juice, parsley, salt and pepper. Spoon mixture into zucchini shells. Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until zucchini are tender.
