Quarter potatoes and place in a large saucepan fitted with a steamer basket. Steam for 20 to 25 minutes or until potatoes are tender when pierced with a sharp knife; set aside to cool. Spray a small skillet with nonstick cooking spray. Add ham; cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes until lightly brown, stirring frequently. Add to bowl with potatoes, bell peppers and green onions. Whisk together dressing ingredients and drizzle over salad. Lightly toss to coat potatoes with dressing, then cover and refrigerate until ready to serve (at least 1 hour). Just before serving, stir in walnuts and basil.
