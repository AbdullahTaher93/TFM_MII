Drain pears, reserving the juice; cut pears into slices and set aside. In a large skillet, brown the pork chops in butter. Transfer to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, mustard and reserved pear juice. Pour over chops; top with pear slices. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
