Line a 9x9-inch square pan with whole graham crackers (break crackers, if necessary). Prepare pudding with milk as directions indicate; let stand 5 minutes, then blend with whipped topping. Spread half of the pudding mixture over graham crackers. Place another layer of graham crackers on top. Spread remaining pudding mixture over crackers. Add another layer of crackers. Then spread cherry pie filling over the top. Cover, and refrigerate 3 hours.
