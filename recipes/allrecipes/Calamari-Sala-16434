In a small bowl, mix the olive oil, red wine vinegar, and garlic. In a medium saucepan, bring the wine and water to a low boil. Stir in the squid and cook until opaque, about 2 minutes. Drain and cool. In a large bowl, mix the celery, cilantro, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, cucumber, green onions, parsley, jicama, and jalapeno. Toss gently with the squid and the olive oil dressing mixture. Chill until serving.
