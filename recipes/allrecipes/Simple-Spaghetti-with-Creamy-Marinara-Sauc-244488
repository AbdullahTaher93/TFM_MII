Pour whole box of pasta into a large skillet (approximately 12 inches in diameter). Pour 3 cups of cold water into the pan, ensuring that the liquid covers the pasta. Turn the burner to high, then set your timer for 10 minutes (optional: add a bit of salt to taste). Cook on high, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated. Stir in sauce and cream, and continue to cook until desired consistency is reached, approximately 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat, top with fresh basil and cheese. Serve immediately.
