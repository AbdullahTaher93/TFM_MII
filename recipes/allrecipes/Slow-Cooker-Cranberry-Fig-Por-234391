Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Sear pork chops in the hot skillet until lightly browned, about 1 minute per side. Transfer seared pork chops to the slow cooker. Combine cranberries, figs, reserved fig juice, apple juice, brown sugar, salt, black pepper, and rosemary in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Pour cranberry mixture over pork chops. Cook on High for 4 hours.
