Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Unroll crescent dough. Separate into four rectangles; press perforations together to seal. Place rectangles on lightly floured surface; roll each to 7x5-inch rectangle. Mix mozzarella cheese blend and sauce; set aside. Place 4 of the pepperoni slices on one of the short sides of each dough rectangle, 1 inch from edge of dough. Spread sauce mixture evenly over pepperoni. Fold dough rectangles crosswise in half; press edges together with fork to seal. Transfer to baking sheet. Sprinkle evenly with Parmesan cheese. Bake 12 min. or until golden brown. Cool 5 min. before serving.
