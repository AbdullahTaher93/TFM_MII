Heat olive oil in a skillet over low heat. Cook and stir jalapeno peppers, habanero peppers, serrano peppers, and garlic in the hot oil until slightly tender and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Blend tomatoes in a blender until pureed and smooth. Mix pureed tomatoes, lemon juice, and lime juice into pepper mixture; bring to a low simmer. Stir whiskey into tomato mixture and simmer for 15 minutes. Strain sauce through a fine-mesh strainer, reserving the solids and transferred strained sauce back to the skillet. Blend the solids in a blender until smooth. Transfer pureed solids to the sauce and simmer for 15 minutes. Cool sauce completely; pour into jars or bottles and store in the refrigerator.
