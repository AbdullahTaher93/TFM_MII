In a small bowl, whisk together the 1/4 cup coconut milk, honey-Dijon dressing, lime juice and sugar until well blended. Cover and refrigerate until just before serving. In a medium saucepan, heat water and 1/2 cup of coconut milk to boiling. Stir in rice. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until rice is tender and liquid absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and cool. In a large salad bowl, stir together the cooled rice, shrimp, black-eyed peas, mango, cucumber, red pepper, onion and cilantro. Pour coconut dressing over all and toss.
