Make the soy-mustard sauce by mixing the mustard powder and hot water together to form a paste. Let sit for a few minutes to allow the flavor and heat to develop; then add the vinegar and soy sauce, mix together, and strain through a fine sieve. Chill the sauce in the refrigerator. Combine the paprika, cayenne, chili powder, and pepper on a flat plate to make the blackening spice; then dredge the tuna in the spice. Heat a lightly oiled cast-iron skillet over high heat and sear the tuna fillet to the desired doneness (about 15 seconds per side for rare, 1 minute per side for medium-rare). Cut the tuna into 16 thin slices and arrange four slices in a pinwheel or cross shape on each plate. (or you can cut it into thicker slices.) Ladle some sauce around the plate.
