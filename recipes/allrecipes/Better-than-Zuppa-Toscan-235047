Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir pork sausage, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Crumble bacon into a large soup pot; add sausage mixture, chicken broth, potatoes, and red pepper flakes. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the potatoes are soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir kale, sour cream, and Parmesan cheese into the soup; cook until the kale wilts, about 5 minutes. Garnish with extra Parmesan cheese if desired.
