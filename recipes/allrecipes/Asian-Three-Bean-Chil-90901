Heat oil in a deep 12-inch frying pan (or 5- to 6-quart pan) over medium-high heat. When hot, add pork and cook, stirring often and breaking up meat into small pieces, until pork is browned, 5 to 7 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove pork to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain; set aside. To pan, add 1/3 cup green onions, chilies, garlic, ginger, chili powder, five spice, and salt. Stir often until onions are soft and spices are fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Return pork to pan along with 1 1/2 cups of water, the kidney beans, pinto beans, tomatoes, and black bean sauce. Cover and simmer until flavors are blended and mixture is hot, about 10 minutes. Ladle into bowls and top with additional sliced green onions, if desired.
