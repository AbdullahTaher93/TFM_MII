Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 9x13 inch baking pan with aluminum foil. Shape the ground beef into patties and place in pan. Layer the vegetables on top of the beef patties, starting with the potatoes, then carrots and finally onion rings. Season with salt, pepper and garlic salt to taste. Cover with aluminum foil and seal edges. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or to desired doneness.
