In a large pot of boiling water, cook the potatoes until tender but slightly resistant when pierced with a fork, about 30 minutes. Drain and cool, but do not peel. When cool, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces and place in a medium bowl. In a small bowl, combine the sour cream, mayonnaise, celery, celery seed, chives, mustard, olives, salt and pepper to taste, and parsley. Mix well. Pour the mixture over the potatoes and toss gently until evenly coated. Taste for seasoning. Refrigerate 1 to 2 hours. Transfer the salad to a serving bowl and garnish with parsley and chives. Serve cold.
