Preheat your smoker according to manufacturer's instructions. Place butter and tarragon under the skin of the chicken breast. Smoke chicken in the preheated smoker until chicken is no longer pink near the bone, about 5 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
