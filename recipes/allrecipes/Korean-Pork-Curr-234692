Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir pork in hot oil until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot; cook and stir onion, potatoes, and carrots in the hot oil until the vegetables begin to soften, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir pork into the vegetable mixture. Pour water into the pot, reduce heat to low, and place a cover on the pot; cook at a simmer until the potatoes are tender, but not yet falling apart, about 20 minutes. Remove pot from heat and stir curry powder into the pork mixture until completely dissolves. Return pot to heat and continue cooking until the sauce is thick and the onions are translucent, 20 to 30 minutes more.
