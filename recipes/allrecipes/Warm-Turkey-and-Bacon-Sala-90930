In a 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat, stir bacon often until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to towels to drain. Spoon out and discard all but 1 tablespoon fat from pan. Add mushrooms to pan and stir often until browned, about 5 minutes. Add turkey and bacon and stir until hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vinegar. In a large bowl, combine lettuce, watercress, and onion. Add turkey mixture and mix well. Add salt and pepper to taste. Divide salad equally among 4 dinner plates. Sprinkle evenly with blue cheese, if desired.
