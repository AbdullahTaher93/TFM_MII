Stir creamy salad dressing, sweet pickle relish, mustard, black pepper, and salt in a large bowl until thoroughly blended. Grind smoked ham, hard-cooked eggs, green onions, green bell pepper, and celery together into a bowl with a food grinder, spooning tablespoons of salad dressing mixture into the grinder for moisture as you work. Combine the ham mixture thoroughly with the remaining salad dressing mixture; store covered in refrigerator until serving time.
