Mix salsa, chili powder and beans in 1-quart saucepan. Heat over medium heat about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until warm. Spoon 1/4 cup of bean mixture onto center of each tortilla. Top with lettuce and cheese. Fold in sides of tortilla and roll from bottom to create roll-up. Serve with additional salsa, if you like.
