To make the Lemon Creme: Combine all the ingredients in a heavy sauce pan. Whisk well over heat and bring it slowly to a simmer. When the lemon creme is thick take it off the heat and cool. To make the macaroons: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grind the SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend in a blender until the mix is fine and almost powder like. Sift half of the SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend into the almond flour and combine it with the powdered egg whites. Beat the egg whites and slowly sift the rest of the sugar mix into it. Still beating egg whites, add creme de tarter. Make sure the egg whites are nice and stiff. Gently fold the almond flour into the egg whites. Layer a sheet pan with parchment paper and place quarter sized drops with a piping bag. Let them rest for 20 minutes. Bake the macaroons for 10 minutes. Allow to cool after baking. When cooled, sandwich two macaroons with lemon creme in the center and serve with fresh berries or ice cream.
