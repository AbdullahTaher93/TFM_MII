Thaw tilapia, if frozen. Rinse tilapia; pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle tilapia with pepper. Set aside. Combine 1 can of the corn, the half-and-half, cheese and garlic in a blender. Cover and blend until nearly smooth. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a 12-inch skillet. Cook tilapia in hot oil for 4 to 6 minutes or until tilapia flakes when tested with a fork, turning once. Remove from skillet; cover and keep warm. Add the corn mixture and the remaining can of corn to the skillet. Cook and stir over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes or until heated through. Serve corn with tilapia fillets. Sprinkle with chives.
