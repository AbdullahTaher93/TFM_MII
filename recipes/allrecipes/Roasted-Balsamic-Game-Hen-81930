Thoroughly rinse the game hens. They can be left whole or you can remove the back bone and lay them out flat. Place them is a large re-sealable plastic bag. Add the vinegar, water, oil, onion flakes, rosemary sprigs and the salt and pepper. Remove the outer loose skin off the garlic head. With a sharp knife cut off the top 1/4 of the head, exposing just the tips of the raw garlic. The head can be left whole or broken in halves. Don't worry if a clove or two breaks off; just toss them into the bag too. Add the garlic to the plastic bag and seal, removing as much air as possible. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or over night. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place the hens, garlic and rosemary into a roasting pan breast side up. Add 1/2 cup of water and roast tightly covered for 15 minutes. Uncover, reduce heat to 350 degrees F and continue roasting another 20 minutes or until juices run clear (or internal temp of 180 degrees F). Remove hens to a platter and let rest 5-10 minutes before serving. Serve as is with the roasted garlic on the side, or use the garlic to flavor Creamed Cauliflower or Mashed Turnips (page 177), as a side dish.
