Unroll crescent dough and separate into eight rectangles; seal perforations. Brush with 2 tablespoons butter. Combine the pecans, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg; mix well. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon over each rectangle; gently press into dough. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting at a long side. Pinch seams to seal. Twist two or three times. Cut six shallow diagonal slits in each roll. Shape each into a ring; pinch ends together. Place on a greased baking sheet; brush with remaining butter. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until golden brown. Combine confectioners' sugar and syrup until smooth; drizzle over the warm rolls.
