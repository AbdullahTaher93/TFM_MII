Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat; add chocolate chips and cook, stirring constantly, until chocolate is melted, 5 to 10 minutes. Dip corn chips in the melted chocolate mixture until evenly coated and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate coated chips until chocolate is set, about 30 minutes.
