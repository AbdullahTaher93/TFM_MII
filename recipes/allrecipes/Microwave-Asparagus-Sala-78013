Trim, peel and rinse asparagus (do not dry). Place spears flat, two or three deep, in a glass pie plate or similar dish. Cover tightly with microwavable plastic wrap and microwave on high 2 1/2 to 5 minutes, depending on wattage. Whisk together dressing ingredients, pour over asparagus and marinate in refrigerator until cool. Divide greens onto four salad plates; top each with six asparagus spears. Drizzle with equal amounts of dressing, and top with hazelnuts.
