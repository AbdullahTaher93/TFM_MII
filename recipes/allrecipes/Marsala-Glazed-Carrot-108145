Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Cut baby carrots in half cross-wise. In a saucepan, bring water, carrots, and salt to a boil, and then reduce heat to low. Cover, and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until tender but firm. Drain, and set aside. Return pan to the stove over medium heat, and melt butter. Cook shallots in the melted butter, stirring occasionally, until translucent. Stir in Marsala and SPLENDA(R). Continue simmering until sauce has thickened slightly. Toss carrots with the sauce until well coated. Garnish with parsley, if desired. Serve immediately.
