Combine water, olive oil, honey, and salt in a bread machine. Mix the oat flour, all-purpose flour, gluten flour, and ground macadamia nuts in a large bowl until well blended. Sprinkle the flour mixture on top of the water mixture in the bread machine, making sure to cover the water. Make two indentations in the flour mixture, and spoon 1 tablespoon of yeast into each indentation. Select the Express Bake setting on the bread machine for a 2-pound loaf of bread; press start.
