Place the pork, beans, enchilada sauce, carrot, and salsa in the slow cooker and stir to combine. Cover and cook on low for 7 to 8 hours. When the meat is done, carefully remove the lid of the slow cooker. Using two forks, pull the meat apart into shredded pieces and mix with the sauce. Place the tortillas on a plate and heat on high in the microwave until warm, 30 to 45 seconds. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to divide the pork mixture evenly and put it in the center of each tortilla. Add *optional toppings as desired and roll up burrito style, slice in half, and serve.
