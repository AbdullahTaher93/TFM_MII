Brown ground chicken, onion, garlic and spices in a skillet. Break up the meat so that it cooks evenly. Add tomatoes then mix in apples and olives. Put stove on low and let it simmer for about 15 minutes, allowing the flavors to fully marry. Insert a food thermometer into the meat mixture to read at least 165 degrees F. Serve over brown rice. Serve alongside reverse guacamole. Slice the avocados, coat them in ranch dressing or plain yogurt and roll them in smashed tortilla chips.
