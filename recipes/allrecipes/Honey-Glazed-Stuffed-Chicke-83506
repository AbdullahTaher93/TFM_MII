Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut a slit in each chicken breast, and stuff with equal amounts Boursin cheese. Wrap each breast with 2 slices bacon. Secure with toothpicks. Arrange on a baking sheet. Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until chicken juices run clear. Drizzle breasts with equal amounts of honey during the final 5 minutes of cook time.
