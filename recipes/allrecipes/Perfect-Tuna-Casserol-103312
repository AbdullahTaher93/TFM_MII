Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni pasta and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, stir together the tuna, cream of mushroom soup, cheese and peas. Season with dill and pepper then add the drained macaroni and stir to coat. Transfer to a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until heated through. Sprinkle the French-fried onions on top and return to the oven for 5 minutes or until lightly toasted.
