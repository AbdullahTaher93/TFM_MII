Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Place a piece of aluminum foil over a baking sheet; spread fries in a single layer on baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Preheat broiler. Sprinkle fries with cheese and crumbled bacon. Broil until cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with Ranch dressing.
