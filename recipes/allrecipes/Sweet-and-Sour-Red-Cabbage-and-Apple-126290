In a large saucepot or Dutch oven, heat the butter and oil over medium heat until the butter melts. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, for 6 minutes, or until soft. Add the cabbage, salt, pepper, and allspice. Cook, stirring frequently, for 4 minutes, or until the cabbage begins to wilt and the color starts to change. Add the apples, apple juice concentrate, and vinegar. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring frequently, for 15 minutes, or until the cabbage is very tender.
