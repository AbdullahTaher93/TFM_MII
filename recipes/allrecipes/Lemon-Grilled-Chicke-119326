In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the first seven ingredients; mix well. Remove 1/4 cup for basting and refrigerate. Add chicken to the bag; seal and turn to coat. Refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Drain and discard marinade from chicken. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 20 minutes. Baste with reserved marinade. Grill 20-30 minutes longer or until juices run clear, basting and turning several times.
