Place 12 heavily greased iron popover pans or custard cups in 450 degree F oven. Crush cereal into fine crumbs and mix with flour and salt in 4 cup liquid measure. Set aside. Combine well-beaten eggs, milk and cooled, melted butter. Add to flour mixture, beating until smooth. (Don't be afraid of overbeating.) Pour batter into heated pans until 1/2 full. Bake at 450 degrees F about 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F and bake 15 minutes longer. Remove immediately from pans and cut slit in side of each popover to allow steam to escape. Serve immediately.
