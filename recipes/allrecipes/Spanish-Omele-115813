Heat clarified butter in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Whisk eggs together until very well mixed. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Wilt spinach in skillet, about 30 seconds. Pour in eggs; cook, whisking constantly and shaking pan vigorously, until they begin to set but are still quite loose. Stop whisking; cook until almost completely set, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, depending on desired consistency. Sprinkle left half of omelet with feta. Using a rubber spatula, fold right half over cheese, forming half-moon shape. Fold top half over bottom half; slide omelet onto a plate. Quickly return skillet to heat. Add oil, garlic, and oregano; saute until garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Add tomatoes and wine or 1/2 cup water, raise heat to medium high, and simmer until tomatoes burst and liquid is somewhat reduced, 3 to 5 minutes. Ladle sauce over omelet, and serve immediately.
