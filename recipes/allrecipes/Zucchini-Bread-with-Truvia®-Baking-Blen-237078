Beat until thick and yellow colored. Stir in zucchini. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Stir dry mixture into the wet mixture. Add chopped pecans (optional). Pour batter into pans and level. Bake for 1 hour or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
