Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Dredge meat in flour, and cook in hot oil until well browned. Stir in onions, and cook until onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Mix in tomatoes. Season with salt, black pepper, white peppercorns, bay leaves, brown sugar, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and beef bouillon cube. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 1 1/4 hours. Stir occasionally, making sure nothing sticks on the bottom of the pot. Stir in the potatoes and cook for an additional 45 minutes, until the potatoes are done and the meat is tender.
