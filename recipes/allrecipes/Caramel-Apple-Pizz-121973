Press cookie dough into a greased 14-in. pizza pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. Run a large flat spatula under crust to loosen from pan. In a mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, peanut butter, brown sugar and milk until smooth. Spread over the cooled crust. In a bowl, combine the apples and soda; drain well. Toss apples with cinnamon; arrange over cream cheese. Drizzle with the caramel topping and sprinkle with pecans. Cut into wedges.
