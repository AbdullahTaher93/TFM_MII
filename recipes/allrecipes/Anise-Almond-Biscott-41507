Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease large cookie sheet. In a large bowl, add first 6 ingredients. Blend, using an electric mixer, on low speed. In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs and vanilla. With mixer running, slowly pour egg mixture into bowl. Mix just until the dough comes together. Do not overmix. Divide dough in half and shape each half into a 12x2-inch log. Place logs onto cookie sheet. Bake 30 minutes or until slightly risen and firm to touch. Remove cookie sheet from oven. Cool logs on wire rack 15 minutes. Transfer to cutting board. Using a sharp serrated knife, cut logs diagonally into 1/4-inch slices. Place slices in single layer on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-13 minutes or until crisp and golden. Cool on cookie sheet. Store in a covered container.
