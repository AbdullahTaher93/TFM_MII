In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm milk. Add sugar, butter, salt lemon peel, eggs and 2 cups of flour; beat until smooth. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Divide in half; shape each half into 12 balls. Place 3 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Flatten each ball to a 3-in. circle. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. In a small mixing bowl, beat all filling ingredients until smooth. Make a depression in the center of each roll; add filling. Bake at 375 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to cool on a wire rack.
