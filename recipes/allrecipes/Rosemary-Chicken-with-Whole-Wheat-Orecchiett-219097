Bring a large pot of water to a boil. In the meantime, rub chicken breasts with salt, pepper and fresh rosemary. In a large saucepan, pan-fry chicken breast strips over medium-high heat with olive oil. Fry until browned and thoroughly cooked, about 15 minutes. Once water boils, add salt and then pasta. Cook orecchiette for al dente texture, according to package instructions. Drain, reserving 1 1/4 cups of pasta water for finishing sauce. Turn heat down to medium-low and add pasta to cooked chicken in saucepan with enough pasta water to loosen sauce, 1/2 cup Parmesan, salt and pepper. Cook on medium-low for about 3 minutes, until sauce has thickened. Add more pasta water if necessary. Sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan to serve.
