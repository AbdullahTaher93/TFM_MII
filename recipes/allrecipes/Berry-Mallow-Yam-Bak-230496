Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Toss yams and cranberries together in a bowl. Mix flour, brown sugar, oatmeal, margarine, and cinnamon together in a separate bowl. Add about half the oat mixture to the yam mixture; toss to combine and spread into a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish. Sprinkle remaining oat mixture over the casserole. Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned, about 35 minutes.
