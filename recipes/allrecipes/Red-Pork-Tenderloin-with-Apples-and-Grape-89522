Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Pat tenderloins dry and season with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in large, oven-safe skillet over high heat, and brown 3 minutes per side. Add onions, apples and grapes to skillet and place in oven, roasting for 10-15 minutes. Place pork on a plate, and cover with foil. Return skillet to stove over high heat. Pour in white wine and simmer until reduced by 1/2, about 1/4 cup. Pour in the heavy cream and continue to simmer until reduced by half again. Stir in mustard, adding fresh chopped thyme. Cut tenderloins into 1/2 inch slices and fan out on platter. Top with sauce, scattering grapes and apples over top. Serve immediately.
