Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir eggs and soy sauce together in a bowl. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat; pour in egg mixture and cook until firm, 3 to 5 minutes. Slide eggs onto work surface and cut into bite-size cubes. Heat sesame oil and canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add tofu; cook until golden brown on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer tofu to a plate. Add mushrooms and broccoli to skillet; cook until broccoli is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Place cashews in a baking dish; cook in preheated oven, tossing occasionally to avoid burning, until toasted, 8 to 12 minutes. Place edamame in a microwave-safe bowl, cover and cook in the microwave until hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in egg noodles, bring back to a boil, and cook over medium heat until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain. Combine soy milk, peanut butter, coconut milk, and tahini together in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir until peanut butter and tahini have dissolved, 2 to 4 minutes. Add egg, tofu, mushroom and broccoli mixture, edamame, and egg noodles; toss to combine. Top with toasted cashews to serve.
