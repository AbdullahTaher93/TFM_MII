Mix the flour, cayenne pepper, paprika, salt, and black pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Drop 5 or 6 wings at a time into the flour mixture. Seal the bag and shake to coat wings with flour. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Gently lower the coated wings into the hot oil and deep-fry until wings are no longer pink in the center and the coating is golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain the wings on paper towels and set aside. Place the butter, hot pepper sauce, habanero pepper sauce, habanero peppers, and pineapple into the pitcher of a blender. Blend the sauce until smooth (do not allow sauce to touch your eyes); pour into a large resealable plastic bag. Place the fried chicken wings into the bag of sauce, 5 or 6 at at a time, seal the bag, and gently shake to coat the wings in the sauce. Remove to a platter for serving.
