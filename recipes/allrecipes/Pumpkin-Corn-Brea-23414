Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. In a large bowl, stir flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and make a well in the center. In a small bowl, stir together the eggs, pumpkin, sugar, and oil. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the egg mixture. Stir just until blended; do not over mix. Fold in pecans. Divide the batter evenly among prepared muffin tin cups. Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 18 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of a muffin comes out clean.
