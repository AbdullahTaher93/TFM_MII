In a medium saucepan over medium heat, place the green beans with liquid and wine. Cook until heated through; drain. Place the cheese in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave on low or medium power in 1 minute intervals, until melted. Scoop the melted cheese over the heated green beans, and season with minced garlic to serve.
