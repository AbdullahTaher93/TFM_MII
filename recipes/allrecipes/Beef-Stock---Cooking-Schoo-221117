Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Arrange bones and ribs on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle them with vegetable oil. Rub the bones with the oil to coat. Roast bones in the preheated oven, turning occasionally, until browned, about 45 minutes. Transfer bones to a stockpot. Place the baking sheet on the stove top over high heat; pour 1/2 cup water into the pan, bring to a boil, and scrap the browned bits off of the bottom with a wooden spoon. Remove from heat and pour liquid into the stockpot. Stir carrots, celery, onion, tomato paste, parsley, and peppercorns into the stockpot. Pour in enough cold water to cover the bones by 3 inches. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium heat, skimming off any fat that rises to the surface. Reduce heat to low; simmer, without stirring, skimming off any fat that rises to the surface during the first hour, until stock is rich and flavorful, 5 to 8 hours. Strain stock through a fine-mesh strainer lined with cheese cloth into a clean container. Place container in a sink filled with ice water and stir occasionally until cooled. Cover the container and refrigerate overnight. Once completely chilled, remove and discard any fat that has solidified on the surface.
