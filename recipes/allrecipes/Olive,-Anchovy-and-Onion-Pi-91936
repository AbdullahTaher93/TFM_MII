In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, salt and basil leaves. Mix in the butter, olive oil and water until it becomes a smooth dough. Cover and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter an 8 inch pie plate. Press the dough into the bottom and up the sides of the dish until it is about 1/4 inch or 1/2 centimeter thick. Bake for about 8 minutes in the preheated oven, until just starting to brown. Make a layer of mushrooms and onion in the bottom of the pie crust. Top with a layer of tomatoes, olives and anchovies. Dot with goat cheese. Return to the preheated oven, and bake for 10 minutes, or until golden brown.
