In a small saucepan, blend first 4 ingredients until cornstarch is completely dissolved. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly over medium heat until mixture thickens (about 4 minutes). Add preserves; stir until melted. Remove saucepan from burner and allow mixture to cool completely. Place chicken in a self closing plastic bag. Reserve 1/3 cup marinade; pour remaining marinade over chicken; close bag and turn to coat. Refrigerate 30 minutes. Remove chicken from marinade. Place on grill over medium heat. Grill 10-12 minutes or until done, turning occasionally and basting with reserved marinade.
