In a bowl, combine the first five ingredients. In another bowl, beat eggs, sugar and oil until smooth; add the strawberries and banana. Stir into the dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in walnuts. Pour into a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 60-65 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
