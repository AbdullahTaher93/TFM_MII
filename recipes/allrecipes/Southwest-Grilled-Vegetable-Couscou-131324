Preheat grill to medium heat. Lightly mist all sides of tomatoes, corn, and onion slices with olive oil spray, then sprinkle with garlic powder, salt, and cayenne. Place veggies on grill. Cook tomatoes about 2 to 3 minutes per side until tender but not mushy. Cook onion 5 minutes per side until tender and corn about 15 to 20 minutes, rotating every 5 minutes until tender. (Vegetables should all have some browned spots.) Remove from grill and let cool 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine water and salt. Place over high heat until boiling. Add couscous, cover, and turn off heat. Let sit 5 minutes. Peel tomatoes and discard skins. Chop tomatoes and onions. Cut corn kernels from ear. Transfer couscous to a medium bowl. Stir with veggies, lime juice, cilantro, olive oil, and garlic. Season with additional salt and cayenne if desired.
