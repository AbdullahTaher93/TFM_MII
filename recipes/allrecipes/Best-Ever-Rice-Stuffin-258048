In a saucepan, saute rice in butter until brown, stirring frequently. Stir in contents of seasoning packet and orange zest. Mix together the orange juice and enough water to equal 2-1/3 cups water and add to rice. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer until liquid is absorbed, about 25 minutes. Stir in toasted pecans.
