Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the chicken pieces into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Season with salt and pepper. In a medium bowl, mix together the Worcestershire sauce, ketchup and cola. Pour over the chicken. Cover with a lid or aluminum foil. Bake for 50 minutes in the preheated oven, until the chicken is no longer pink.
