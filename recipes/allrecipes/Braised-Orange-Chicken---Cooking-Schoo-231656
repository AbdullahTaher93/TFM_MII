Pat chicken dry with paper towels and trim off any excess fat or skin. Season with salt and black pepper. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; place chicken thighs, skin-side down, in the skillet and cook in hot oil until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Remove chicken thighs from the skillet to a plate. Cook and stir onion in the same skillet until golden, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour orange juice over the onion mixture and return chicken thighs to the skillet; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover the skillet with a lid, and simmer until chicken is tender and no longer pink in the center, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to plates and drizzle orange juice braising liquid over the top.
