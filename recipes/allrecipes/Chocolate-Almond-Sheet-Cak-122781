In a saucepan over medium heat, bring butter, water and cocoa to boil. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking soda and salt. Beat in cocoa mixture. Add eggs, buttermilk and extracts; mix well. Pour into a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-22 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, for frosting, place butter and milk in a saucepan. Cook and stir over medium heat until butter is melted. Remove from the heat; add remaining ingredients and beat well. Carefully spread over warm cake. Cool.
