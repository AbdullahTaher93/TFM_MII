In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Combine milk and extracts; add to creamed mixture alternately with dry ingredients. Transfer to three greased and floured 9-in. round baking pans. Bake at 375 degrees F for 18-22 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely. Split each cake into two horizontal layers. Place a bottom layer on a serving plate; spread with a fifth of the jam. Repeat layers four times. Top with remaining cake. For frosting, in a mixing bowl, beat butter until smooth. Gradually beat in the confectioners' sugar, lemon juice and peel. Frost top and sides of cake.
