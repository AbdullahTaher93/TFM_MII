Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for indirect heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is balanced on the sides, not directly under the food). Rinse tenderloins and pat dry. Cut garlic into thin slices; with the tip of a short, sharp knife, cut gashes about 1 inch deep evenly all over the tenderloins and push a piece of garlic into each cut. Rub meat lightly with oil. Lay tenderloins on center of grill (not over direct heat). Brush top of meat generously with barbecue sauce. Cover charcoal grill and open vents; close lid on gas grill. Cook 10 minutes, brushing once or twice with barbecue sauce. With tongs, turn tenderloins over; brush generously with additional sauce. Continue to cook, with grill covered or lid closed, brushing several times with remaining sauce, until an instant read meat thermometer inserted in center of thickest part reaches 150 degrees to 155 degrees, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Transfer pork to a clean platter and let rest at least 5 minutes. Slice and serve with additional barbecue sauce and salt to taste.
