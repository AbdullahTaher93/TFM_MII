Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Place the shallots into the oil and butter; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Pour the chicken stock and balsamic vinegar in with the shallots; add the lime zest and lime juice and stir until well combined. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the mixture has thickened and reduced by half into a glaze, 15 to 20 minutes. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper, drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil; toss to coat. Preheat a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the shrimp in the preheated skillet until opaque and bright pink, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes per side. Arrange the Bibb lettuce leaves on a serving platter. Place one shrimp in each cup of lettuce. Drizzle the shrimp with the balsamic-lime glaze. Serve extra glaze on the side for dipping.
