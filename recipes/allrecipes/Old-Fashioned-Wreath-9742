Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Whip the cream and vanilla and add to mixture. Sift the flour and baking powder and add, stirring well. Knead the dough lightly on a board. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Roll the dough and cut into pencil sized strips 6 to 7 inches long. Double the strips and twirl together. Make into circles approximately 3 inches around. Bake 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden.
