In a food processor or blender, whirl chocolate chips until coarsely chopped. Add sugar, salt, egg, and vanilla. Set aside. In a 1-cup glass measure, microwave milk on high (100%) for 2 minutes or until it begins to bubble at edges. With processor or blender running, gradually add scalded milk, whirling on high speed until mixture is smooth (about 1 minute). Pour chocolate mixture into 6 ramekins (about 1/2-cup size) and refrigerate until cool and slightly thicker (about 25 minutes); for a firmer dessert, refrigerate for 45 minutes to 1 hour. To serve, top custards with whipped cream and, if desired, chocolate curls.
