Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Poke holes all over potatoes with a fork. Arrange in a baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until potatoes are easily pierced with a knife, about 45 minutes. Cut potatoes in half, widthwise, on a cutting board. Scoop flesh into a mixing bowl. Add coconut milk, lime juice, salt and pepper to taste. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth.
