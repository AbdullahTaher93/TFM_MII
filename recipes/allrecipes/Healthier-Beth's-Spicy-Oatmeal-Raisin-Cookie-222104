Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt in a bowl. Beat butter, brown sugar, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into butter mixture before adding next. Beat in vanilla extract with last egg. Mix in flour mixture until just incorporated. Fold in rolled oats and raisins; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until light and golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool for 2 minutes before cooling completely on a wire rack. Store in airtight container.
