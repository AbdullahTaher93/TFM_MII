Unroll each tube of crescent roll dough into two rectangles. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets; press perforations to seal. In a small bowl, combine butter and 2 tablespoons honey. Brush over dough. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on pans for 15 minutes. Carefully transfer one crust to a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Layer with turkey, second crust, cheese and ham. Add third crust; spread with preserves. Top with remaining crust; spread with remaining honey. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or until crust is golden brown and loaf is heated through. Carefully cut into slices.
