Place chile peppers in the bottom of a small saucepan. Add tomatillos, onion, and garlic. Pour in enough water to almost cover tomatillos. Arrange tomatoes over tomatillos. Cover saucepan and bring water to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until tomatoes soften, about 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and let cool, about 10 minutes. Pour off most of the water and transfer mixture to a blender; puree until smooth. Season with chicken bouillon to taste.
