Mix nuts and breadcrumbs together. Season with salt, pepper and a pinch of cayenne. Remove the rind from top of the Sir Laurier d'Arthabaska cheese. Coat the cheese with egg on all sides, with the exception of the rindless top. Place in nut/breacrumb mixture so that a nutty crust is formed. Refrigerate for one hour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Wrap the cheese in aluminum foil leaving rindless top exposed. Then, place it on a baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes. Serve warm with nut or fruit bread and desired slices of fruit.
