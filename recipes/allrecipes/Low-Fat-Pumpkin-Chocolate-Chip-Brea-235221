Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Stir pumpkin pie filling, applesauce, sugar, egg, egg whites, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger together in a separate bowl. Whisk flour mixture into pumpkin mixture until batter is well combined; fold in chocolate chips. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes.
