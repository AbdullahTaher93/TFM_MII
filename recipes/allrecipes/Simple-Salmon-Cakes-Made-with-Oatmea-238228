Mix salmon, egg, and chopped onion in a bowl with your hand; add oats incrementally, mixing until the mixture holds together and it not overly moist. Shape the mixture into 4 patties. Heat oil and butter together in a skillet over medium heat until the butter is melted and the mixture is hot. Fry patties in oil mixture until browned and heated through, about 7 minutes per side.
