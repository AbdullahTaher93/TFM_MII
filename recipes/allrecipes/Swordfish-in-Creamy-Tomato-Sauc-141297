Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. In a large, ovenproof skillet, flameproof clay pot or enameled cast-iron baking dish, melt the butter. Add the garlic and poblano, season with salt and pepper and cook over moderate heat until the poblano starts to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in the chopped tomatoes, water and cream and bring to a simmer. Season the swordfish steaks with salt and pepper and nestle them in the tomato mixture. Cover with foil and bake in the oven for about 20 minutes, turning the steaks once, until just cooked through. Using a slotted spatula, transfer the swordfish to plates. Stir the vinegar and oregano into the sauce and season with salt and pepper. Pour the sauce over the fish.
