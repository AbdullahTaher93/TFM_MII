Spread butter on one side of each slice of bread. Cut bread into strips; place strips, buttered side down, on the bottom and around the sides of two greased 10-oz. baking dishes. In a bowl, beat eggs and milk. Add cheese, onion salt and hot pepper sauce. Pour over bread. Place the dishes on a baking sheet. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until puffed and golden brown. Serve immediately.
