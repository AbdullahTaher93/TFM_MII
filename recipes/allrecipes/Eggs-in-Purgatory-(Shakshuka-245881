Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In 12-inch oven-proof or cast-iron skillet over medium heat, in hot oil, cook onion, red pepper and garlic about 5 minutes until tender-crisp, stirring occasionally. Stir in cumin and hot pepper sauce; cook 1 minute. Add crushed tomatoes, green chilies, salt and pepper. Over high heat, heat to boiling; simmer 6 to 8 minutes until mixture has thickened and flavors are blended. Make 6 indentations in tomato sauce. Gently crack eggs into indentations. Place skillet in oven; bake 5 to 10 minutes, just until eggs are just set. Sprinkle with chopped parsley.
