Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 7x11 inch baking dish. In a large bowl, mix flour, baking powder, salt and brown sugar. Cut in butter. Pour in milk and stir to form a dough. Turn out onto a well-floured surface and roll out. Cut into 6 - 6 inch squares. Place a whole apple in the center of each square. Fill the core with blueberries. Drizzle with maple syrup. Pull up corners of dough and pinch edges together to seal. Place dumplings in prepared pan and sprinkle with cinnamon and nutmeg. Combine remaining maple syrup with enough water to pour over dumplings to a 1 inch depth in dish. Submerge remaining blueberries and apple peelings with dried orange peel in liquid. Bake in preheated oven 45 minutes, basting as necessary, until crisp and browned. Serve warm with sauce.
