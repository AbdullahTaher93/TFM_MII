Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place egg whites in a large mixing bowl; let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Add cream of tartar and vanilla extract. Beat at high speed with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Gradually add 1/4 cup SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend for Baking and light corn syrup. Sift flour and cornstarch 2 times into another large mixing bowl. Add 3/4 cup SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend for Baking to flour mixture, stirring until blended. Sprinkle 1/4 of the flour mixture over the egg whites. Fold gently. Repeat procedure three times with the remaining flour mixture. Pour batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan, spreading batter evenly in pan. Cut through batter with a knife to remove air bubbles. Bake on lowest rack in oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Invert tube pan; cool cake in the pan for 30 to 40 minutes. Loosen cake from sides of pan using a narrow metal spatula; remove cake from pan.
