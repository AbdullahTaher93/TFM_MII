Slice pork tenderloin in half lengthwise, and then cut crosswise thinly. Toss pork, bacon and chipotle pieces together in small bowl, set aside. Combine oil, cumin, oregano and garlic and heat in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bell pepper and onion, stir-fry 2-3 minutes or until crisp-tender. Remove and reserve. In same skillet, stir-fry the pork, bacon and chile for 2-3 minutes, until pork is just done and bacon crisp. Return the vegetables to the skillet and heat through. Serve over lettuce.
