Cut the bread lengthwise and crosswise without cutting through the bottom crust. Insert cheese between cuts. Combine butter, onions and poppy seeds; drizzle over the bread. Wrap in foil; place on a baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15 minutes. Unwrap; bake 10 minutes longer or until the cheese is melted.
