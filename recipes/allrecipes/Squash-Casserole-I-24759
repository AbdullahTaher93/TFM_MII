Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add squash and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes; drain. To the squash add milk, butter, eggs, green onion tops, salt, pepper and sugar; mix well. Transfer to a 9x13 inch casserole dish. Sprinkle with cheese and crushed crackers. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
