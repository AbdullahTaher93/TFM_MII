After cutting kernels from corn, taste corn. If its tender, use raw; if its starchy, cook as directed in notes. Put in a large bowl. Cut chiles, bell pepper, and cucumber into 1/4-inch dice; add to bowl, along with 1 cup green onions, jicama, and beans. Cut avocados in half; pit and peel them. Cut 3 halves into 1/4-inch dice; reserve remaining half for dressing. Add diced avocado, lime juice, and 1 teaspoon chile flakes to bowl and mix gently. Add salt to taste. Mound salad equally in wide, shallow bowls. Spoon dressing over the top (or serve on the side) and pile croutons alongside. Sprinkle with more chile flakes to taste. For Green Desert Dressing: In a blender or food processor, whirl 1/2 peeled avocado, Lucerne Sour Cream, Safeway SELECT Reduced-Fat Mayonnaise, cilantro, parsley, 1/4 cup green onions, and anchovy fillets with oil until smooth. For Cornbread Croutons: Prepare 1 box (about 13 ounce) cornbread mix as directed, or use your favorite cornbread recipe; bake in an 8-inch-square pan. Let cool about 10 minutes, then invert onto a rack to cool. Cut into 1-inch cubes. Spread 3 tablespoons Safeway SELECT Verdi Olive Oil in a rimmed 10- by 15-inch pan. Add cornbread and turn to coat lightly with oil. Bake in a 375 degrees F regular or convection oven, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool at least 10 minutes. Use warm or cool.
