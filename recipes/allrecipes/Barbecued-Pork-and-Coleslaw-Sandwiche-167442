To make coleslaw: Whisk together vinegar, sugar, oil, Dijon mustard, celery seeds and mustard seeds in a mixing bowl. Add green and red cabbage and carrots; toss well. Season with salt and pepper. To make barbecue sauce: Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onions and garlic and saute until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Add ketchup, vinegar, sugar, mustard, Worcestershire, hot pepper sauce and salt. Cook, stirring, until the mixture boils, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. To cook pork and assemble sandwiches: Preheat the broiler. Place tenderloins on a broiler pan and season with salt and pepper. Broil 4 inches from the heat until lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Turn the tenderloins over and broil until the internal temperature registers 160 degrees F, 6 to 7 minutes longer. (The center should be juicy with just a trace of pink.) Let the meat stand for 5 minutes before cutting into thin strips. Add the meat to the barbecue sauce and toss well. To assemble the sandwiches: Layer the coleslaw and the pork mixture inside rolls.
