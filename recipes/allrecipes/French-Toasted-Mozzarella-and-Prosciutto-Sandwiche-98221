Preheat the oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Place six slices of bread on a flat work surface; arrange half of the mozzarella on the bread, trimming it and rearranging as necessary to cover each slice. Divide the basil and prosciutto di Parma over the mozzarella on each slice of bread; top with the remaining mozzarella and bread slices. Trim off and discard the bread crusts. In a shallow bowl, combine the eggs and milk. In another bowl, combine the bread crumbs, pine nuts and 1/8 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over high heat until hot. Dip the sandwiches into the egg mixture, letting the excess drip off, and then into the bread crumb mixture, coating them well. When the pan is hot, reduce the heat to medium-low and add half the sandwiches. Cook them about 3 minutes on each side or until they are nicely golden and the cheese has melted. Place them in the oven to stay warm and repeat with the remaining oil and sandwiches. Cut the sandwiches in halves or quarters and serve.
