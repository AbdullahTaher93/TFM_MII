Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, mix together the cream-style corn and egg. In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Add the corn mixture to the dry ingredients, and mix until just blended. Drop batter 1/8 cup at a time into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, turning once if the fritters don't turn over by themselves. Drain fritters on paper towels, and serve with maple syrup.
