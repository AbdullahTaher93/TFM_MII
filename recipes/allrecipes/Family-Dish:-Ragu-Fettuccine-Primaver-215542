In 12-inch skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat and cook vegetables and basil, stirring occasionally, 6 minutes or until vegetables are tender. To serve, spoon Sauce over hot fettuccine, then spoon vegetable mixture over pasta. Sprinkle, if desired, with grated Parmesan cheese. Also terrific with Ragu Organic Pasta Sauce.
