Cut duck breast crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick strips. Heat oil in a Dutch oven or large straight-sided skillet over high heat until shimmering but not smoking. Cook the duck, in a single layer, stirring once, until beginning to brown, 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Add eggplant, bell peppers, coconut milk, broth, brown sugar, curry paste, fish sauce (if using) and lime juice to the pan. Bring to a boil, stirring. Reduce heat to a simmer, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Return the duck to the pan; stir to coat with the sauce and cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Remove from heat; stir in basil and serve immediately.
