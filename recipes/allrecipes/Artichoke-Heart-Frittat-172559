In a wide nonstick frying pan with an ovenproof handle, heat 1 tbsp. of the oil over high heat. Add onion and artichokes; cook, stirring often, for 1 minute. Then cover and cook until artichokes are tender to bite (3 to 4 more minutes). Stir in roasted peppers and mint; transfer to a bowl and keep warm. Wipe pan clean with a towel. In a medium-size bowl, beat eggs to blend; beat in 1/4 cup of the cheese and sprinkle in salt and pepper. Heat remaining 1 tbsp. oil in frying pan over medium heat. Pour in eggs and cook without stirring until bottom is set. Then, with a spatula, lift cooked portion gently all around sides of pan to let uncooked eggs flow underneath. When eggs are almost set, spread artichoke mixture over them. Sprinkle with remaining cheese; broil about 6 in. below heat until eggs are firm to the touch and lightly browned (about 5 minutes). Cut into wedges and serve at once.
