Whisk yeast, granulated sugar, salt, nutmeg, and 3 cups flour in a medium bowl; set aside. Mix buttermilk, eggs, and yolk on high speed in the bowl of a mixer fitted with the dough hook until combined. Mix in flour mixture on low speed until combined. Mix in softened butter, 1 tablespoon at a time (dough should form a ball). Gradually add remaining 3/4 cup flour, mixing until dough is tacky but not sticky. Transfer to a lightly oiled bowl; cover with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour 20 minutes. Fit a pastry bag with a #230 filler tip. Stir jam until smooth; transfer to bag. Twist a rubber band around open end of bag to prevent jam from leaking; set bag aside. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Roll out dough 3/4 inch thick on a lightly floured work surface. Cut out rounds using a 1-inch cutter; transfer to a baking sheet. Let rise 25 minutes. Generously brush with melted butter. Bake until pale golden, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack; let cool slightly. Insert tip of filled pastry bag into the side of each donut hole, and pipe jam to fill. The morning of the sale, roll in confectioners' sugar; package in cellophane bags.
