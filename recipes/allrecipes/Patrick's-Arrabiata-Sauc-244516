Place olive oil, butter, and garlic in a large pot; turn heat to high until garlic begins to sizzle, about 2 minutes. Turn heat down to medium; stir in onions and cook and stir until onions are translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour wine over onion mixture; simmer until wine is partially evaporated, about 10 minutes. Place tomatoes and basil in the bowl of a food processor; pulse to blend until tomatoes are chunky. Pour tomatoes into onion mixture; cook, stirring about every 5 minutes, until sauce darkens to a deep red color, about 40 minutes. Turn off heat. Working in batches, pour the sauce into a food processor and blend until smooth. Stir tomato paste, smoked paprika, sugar, and cayenne pepper into tomato mixture; season to taste with salt.
