To make the tomato sauce: Warm the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and sun-dried tomatoes. Cook for 5 minutes, or until softened. Add the garlic; cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the chopped tomatoes (with juice), crushed tomatoes, vermouth or wine, basil, rosemary, sage, and pepper. Simmer for 25 minutes. To make the pasta and chicken: Cook the ziti in a pot of boiling water according to package directions. Drain; transfer to a large bowl. Preheat the broiler. Coat a baking sheet with nonstick spray and place the chicken on the sheet. Broil 4 inches from the heat for 4 to 5 minutes per side, or until no longer pink in the center when tested with a sharp knife. Slice the chicken into 2-inch strips. Add to the ziti. Add the tomato sauce and mix well. Change the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat a 9x9-inch baking dish with nonstick spray. Add half of the ziti mixture. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup of mozzarella. Top with the remaining ziti mixture and the remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella. Sprinkle with the basil and Parmesan. Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for 10 minutes, or until lightly browned.
