Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place a wire rack on a baking sheet. Beat together the egg white and water in a small bowl. Mix bread crumbs, oregano, basil, and Parmesan cheese in a large bowl. Dip each ravioli in the beaten egg, and then roll in the bread crumb mixture. Spray both sides of breaded ravioli with cooking spray; place on the wire rack. Bake breaded ravioli in preheated oven until golden brown and crispy, 15 to 25 minutes.
