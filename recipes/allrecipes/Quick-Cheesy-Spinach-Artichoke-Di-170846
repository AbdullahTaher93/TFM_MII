Heat oven to 400 degrees F. In food processor or blender, combine sour cream and cream cheese and process until smooth, about 1 minute. Add artichokes, spinach and garlic. Process or chop until well combined, scraping sides of the work bowl or blender jar as needed. In a large mixing bowl, combine artichoke mixture, lemon juice, 1/2 cup grated cheese and salt and cayenne pepper to taste. Transfer mixture to a 1-quart microwave-proof baking dish and spread smoothly. Cover with a paper towel and microwave on high for 3-4 minutes, or until bubbly around the edges. Remove bowl and sprinkle 1/2 cup grated cheese over the top. Microwave on high for 1 minute, or until cheese is melted. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup grated cheese and bake, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes or until slightly browned and bubbly.
