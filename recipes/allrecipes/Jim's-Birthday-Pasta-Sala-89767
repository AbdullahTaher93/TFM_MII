Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place penne pasta in pot, and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, until al dente; drain and cool. In a large bowl, gently toss the cooked penne, garbanzo beans, artichoke hearts, cherry tomatoes, lemon zest, basil leaves, and Italian salad dressing. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Chill at least 1 hour before serving
