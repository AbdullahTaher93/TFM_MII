Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Beat margarine and peanut butter in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer until creamy, approximately 1 minute. Add egg substitute, honey and vanilla. Beat on high speed for approximately 1 1/2 minutes. Add SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and beat on medium speed until well blended, approximately 30 seconds. Combine flour, baking soda and salt in a small mixing bowl. Slowly add flour mixture to peanut butter mixture, beating on low speed until well-blended, about 1 1/2 minutes. Mixture may be crumbly. Roll level tablespoons of dough into balls and drop onto a lightly oiled or parchment lined sheet pan, two inches apart. Flatten each ball with a fork, pressing a crisscross pattern into each cookie. Bake 7-9 minutes or until light brown around the edges. Cool on wire rack.
