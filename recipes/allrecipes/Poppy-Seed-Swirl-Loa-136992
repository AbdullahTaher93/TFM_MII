Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease cookie sheet. In small bowl, combine poppy seed filling and lemon peel; mix well. Unroll dough onto floured surface, forming 13x12-inch rectangle. Drop poppy seed mixture by small teaspoonfuls over dough to within 1/2 inch of edges; gently spread being careful not to stretch dough. Sprinkle with raisins. Starting with one long side, loosely roll up dough; pinch edges to seal. Place, seam side down, on greased cookie sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for 28 to 35 minutes or until loaf is deep golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped with finger. Cool 30 minutes. In small bowl, combine powdered sugar and enough water for desired spreading consistency; blend until smooth. Spread frosting over top of cooled loaf. Let stand 5 minutes or until set. Cut into crosswise slices.
