Make ice cream base. Whisk together the evaporated milk, cream, whole milk, nonfat dry milk, honey and vanilla and SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener in a large mixing bowl. Stir well and set aside. Stir gelatin and cornstarch together in a small bowl. Pour cold water into a microwaveable bowl. Add gelatin and cornstarch mixture. Stir well using a small whisk, until the mixture is very well blended and there are no visible lumps. Microwave gelatin mixture on high about 2 minutes, stopping and stirring every 30 seconds, or until a thick clear gel forms. * Remove cooked mixture from microwave. Slowly add 3/4 cup of the ice cream base into the gelatin. Stir well, making sure the gelatin and cornstarch are evenly distributed and there are no visible lumps. Pour back into remaining ice cream base, stirring well. Freeze in ice cream maker following manufacturers instructions. Best if eaten right away!
