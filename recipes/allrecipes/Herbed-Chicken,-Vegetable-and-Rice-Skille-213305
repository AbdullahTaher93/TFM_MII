Sprinkle the chicken with the garlic powder. Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until it's well browned on both sides. Remove the chicken from the skillet. Stir the soup, water and pepper in the skillet. Heat to a boil. Stir in the rice and vegetables. Top with the chicken. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.
