Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Using four long wooden skewers, place two skewers, side-by-side on clean work surface. Thread shrimp onto each set of two parallel skewers alternately with the pineapple, peppers and onions. (You will have two kabobs.) Grill kabobs 4 to 6 minutes or until shrimp turn pink, turning and brushing occasionally with the barbecue sauce. Serve over hot cooked rice.
