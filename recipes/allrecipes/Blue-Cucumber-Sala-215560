With a spoon, scoop out the seeds from the cucumber halves. Slice the cucumbers into thick half moons, and place the slices on a plate on paper towels. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of salt over the cucumber slices, and set aside. Place the onion, sour cream, white wine vinegar, dill, sugar, and white pepper in a bowl, and mix until well combined. Lightly stir in the blue cheese. Pat the cucumber slices dry with paper towels, and lightly mix them into the salad. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving; season to taste with salt just before serving.
