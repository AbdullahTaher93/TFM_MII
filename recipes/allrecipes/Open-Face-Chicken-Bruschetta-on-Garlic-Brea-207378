Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl combine chicken, tomatoes, basil, green onion, 1 tablespoon olive oil, vinaigrette and pepper to taste. Allow flavors to blend for about 15 minutes. Combine 1 tablespoon olive oil with garlic. Brush olive oil-garlic mixture on both sides of bread. On a baking sheet, toast bread in the oven, about 8 to 10 minutes, until lightly browned and crisp. To serve, spread chicken mixture over toasted garlic bread. Top with feta cheese and basil leaves.
