Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper. Separate squash seeds from squash flesh, rinse through a fine-mesh strainer, and spread onto a paper towel to dry. Combine squash seeds, olive oil, rosemary, salt, and sage in a bowl and mix well. Spread seasoned seeds in a single layer onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven, flipping every 10 minutes, until seeds are crunchy, 30 to 40 minutes.
