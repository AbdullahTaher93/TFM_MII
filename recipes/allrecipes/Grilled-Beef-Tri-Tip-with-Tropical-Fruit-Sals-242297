Combine glaze ingredients in small bowl. Place roast on grid over medium, ash-covered coals or over medium heat on preheated gas grill. Grill; covered 25 to 35 minutes for medium rare to medium doneness, turning occasionally. Brush with glaze twice during last 10 minutes. Meanwhile, combine salsa ingredients in medium bowl. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Remove roast when instant-read thermometer registers 135 degrees F for medium rare; 150 degrees F for medium. Tent loosely with aluminum foil; let stand 10 minutes. (Temperature will continue to rise about 10 degrees F to 145 degrees F for medium rare; 160 degrees F for medium.) Carve across the grain into thin slices. Serve with salsa.
