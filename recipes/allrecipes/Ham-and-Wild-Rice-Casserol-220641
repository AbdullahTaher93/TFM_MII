Bring chicken broth to a boil in a saucepan. Add wild rice; cover and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer for 35 minutes. Stir long grain rice into wild rice. Continue simmering until liquid is absorbed, stirring occasionally, about 25 more minutes. While the rice is cooking, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir mushrooms, onion, carrots, green pepper, and garlic until tender and browned, about 10 minutes. Mix white wine, soy sauce, dry mustard, and curry powder into the vegetables. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low. Simmer until liquid is reduced, about 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine ham, cream of mushroom soup, and cooked rice with the vegetables. Transfer the mixture to a large baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly, about 30 minutes.
