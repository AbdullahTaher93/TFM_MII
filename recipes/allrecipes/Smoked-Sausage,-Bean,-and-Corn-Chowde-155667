In a Dutch oven, saute onion in oil until tender. Add the potatoes, corn, sausage, bay leaf, thyme, nutmeg, and 2 cups of broth. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer uncovered for 15 to 20 minutes or until potatoes are tender. In a food processor, combine the milk, beans, and remaining broth; cover and process until smooth. Gradually stir into soup; heat through (do not boil). Discard bay leaf; season with salt and pepper.
