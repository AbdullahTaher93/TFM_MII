Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a 2- to 3-quart pan over medium-high heat, stir shallots in oil until limp, about 3 minutes. Add broth, lentils, and thyme. Bring to a boil over high heat, cover, reduce heat, and simmer just until lentils are tender to bite, about 25 minutes. Drain lentils; discard liquid. While lentils cook, trim off any discolored mushroom stem ends; rinse caps well. Set mushroom caps, gill side up, in a single layer in a lightly oiled 10- by 15-inch pan. Bake until caps are flexible enough to bend easily, 9 to 12 minutes. In a small bowl, mix mayonnaise, garlic, lemon juice, and lemon peel. When mushrooms are ready, thinly slice caps. Mound salad mix on 4 dinner plates; top equally with lentils, then mushroom slices. Spoon about 1 tablespoon garlic mayonnaise onto each salad. Season salads to taste with remaining garlic mayonnaise, salt, and pepper.
