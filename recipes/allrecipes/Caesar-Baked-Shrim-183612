Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Combine Newman's Own Caesar or Light Caesar Salad Dressing, wine, capers, parsley, and basil in 9x13-inch glass casserole. Remove 1/4 cup of mixture and reserve. Add shrimp and artichoke hearts to casserole; coat well with sauce. In a small bowl, mix breadcrumbs with reserved 1/4 cup dressing mixture and sprinkle evenly over shrimp and artichokes. Bake for 20 minutes. (If desired, place casserole under broiler for a few minutes to lightly brown the top.) Serve shrimp over couscous or rice pilaf.
