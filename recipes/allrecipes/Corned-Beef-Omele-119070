In a large skillet, saute the onions in butter. In a bowl, lightly beat eggs and milk; pour over the onions. Cook over medium heat; as the eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. When the eggs are nearly set, sprinkle with the corned beef, cheese and pepper. Remove from the heat; cover and let stand for 1-2 minutes or until the cheese is melted. Cut into wedges.
