Place the ground beef in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, while stirring to crumble, until almost cooked through. Drain the grease, and reduce heat to medium. Stir in the celery, green onions, and tomato. Cook until the celery is tender, and the beef is browned. Meanwhile, bring the beef broth to a boil in a saucepan. Add the bulgur wheat, cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer for about 10 minutes, until tender. Stir the bulgur wheat into the vegetables and beef, and season with salt and cayenne pepper.
