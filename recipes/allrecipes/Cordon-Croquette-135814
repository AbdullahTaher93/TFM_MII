In a medium bowl, combine the turkey, celery, shallot, poultry seasoning and paprika. In a small bowl, combine the ground bread and milk and then squeeze the crumbs as you transfer them to the meat mixture. Mix in the egg, Parmigiano-Reggiano and parsley and season with salt and pepper. Spread a foot-long piece of wax paper on a work surface. Using a rubber spatula, spread half the meat mixture on the wax paper to form an 8-inch-square. Top with the ham and fontina cheese, then the remaining meat mixture, forming the same square shape. Seal the edges to enclose. Cut into 4 square patties and coat each in the bread crumbs. In a large skillet, heat 1 inch olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the patties and fry, turning once, until browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt. Serve with the cranberry sauce.
