Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Coat 1 or 2 large baking sheets with cooking spray. Arrange the tortilla strips on the prepared baking sheets and bake for 2 minutes, or until crisped and lightly browned on the edges. In a large saucepan, combine the broth, water, turkey, onions, bell peppers, chile pepper, cumin, and oregano. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the corn and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, cilantro, and lime juice. Ladle the soup into bowls and top each portion with avocado and tortilla crisps.
