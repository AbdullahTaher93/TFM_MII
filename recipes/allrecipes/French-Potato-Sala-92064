Scrub potatoes with a vegetable brush to remove dirt. Boil, covered, in a 3- to 4-quart pan, in 1 to 2 inches water until tender when pierced (20 to 30 minutes). Drain. Let stand 10 minutes; cut into 3/8-inch slices. Combine with parsley and onion. Blend together mustard, salt, pepper, tarragon, garlic, olive oil, and vinegar. Pour dressing over hot potato mixture; toss gently to coat. Cover and let stand at room temperature at least 3 hours; chill, if desired.
