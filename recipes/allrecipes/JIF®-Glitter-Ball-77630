In a large bowl, combine JIF(R) Peanut Butter and butter until blended; add confectioners' sugar, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring after each addition. Line a baking sheet with foil. Using your hands, shape peanut butter mixture into 1-inch balls. Place balls on prepared baking sheet; chill until firm, about 1 hour. Place white chocolate and CRISCO(R) All-Vegetable Shortening in a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave, stirring at 30-second intervals, until chocolate is melted and smooth, about 2 minutes. Line baking sheet with waxed paper. Using a spoon, dip each peanut butter ball into melted chocolate, spooning chocolate over ball to coat, if necessary. Once covered, sprinkle each ball with glitter. Use multiple colors to create a festive gift. Transfer snowballs to baking sheet. Chill 30 minutes.
