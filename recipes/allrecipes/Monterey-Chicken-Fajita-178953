Heat the oil in a 10 inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook and stir until it is well browned. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the pepper and onion. Cook and stir until the vegetables are tender-crisp. Stir in the soup and salsa. Cook until the chicken is cooked through*. Spoon about 1/2 cup of the chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Top with the cheese and additional salsa. Fold the tortilla around the filling.
