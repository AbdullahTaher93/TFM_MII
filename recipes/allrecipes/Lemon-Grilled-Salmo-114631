Sprinkle dill, lemon-pepper, salt if desired and garlic powder over salmon. Place in a large resealable plastic bag or shallow glass container. Combine brown sugar, broth, oil, soy sauce and green onions; pour over the salmon. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour, turning once. Drain and discard marinade. Place salmon skin side down on grill over medium heat; arrange lemon and onion slices over the top. Cover and cook for 15-20 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
