In a small mixing bowl, cream butter and cream cheese until light. Gradually add flour, beating until blended. Roll into 1-in. balls. Press onto the bottom and up the sides of miniature muffin cups coated with nonstick cooking spray. For filling, in a bowl, combine the egg yolk, sugar, butter, milk and vanilla; gradually stir in melted chocolate. Fill tart shells three-fourths full. Top each with a pecan half. Bake at 375 degrees F for 18-22 minutes or until lightly browned and filling is set. Cool for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack.
