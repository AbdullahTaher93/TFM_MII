Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the cabbage, carrot, squash, bell pepper, and onion in the oil until the onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir the red wine, almonds, and walnuts into the vegetable mixture, reduce heat to low, and simmer 5 minutes. While the vegetable mixture simmers, heat a small skillet over medium heat; cook the peach slices in the skillet until completely warmed, about 5 minutes. Place 2 cups of the baby greens on each of 2 plates. Top each portion of the greens with about half of the vegetable mixture and the warmed peaches. Drizzle each salad with about half of the raspberry vinaigrette. Serve promptly.
