Rinse rice in a fine mesh strainer under cold running water until no longer cloudy. Transfer to a medium saucepan and cover with 2 1/2 cups water. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 15 minutes, remove from heat and let stand for at least 10 minutes, or until all liquid has evaporated. Set aside to cool. Cook onion and bell pepper in 1 tablespoon oil over medium high heat until tender. Add ground beef and thyme, and cook until well browned, stirring occasionally and reducing heat if necessary. In a bowl, stir together cooked rice, meat mixture, avocado, and parsley. In a separate bowl, whisk together olive oil, rice vinegar, and desired amount of salt and pepper. Pour over rice mixture, and toss lightly. Line each pita half with lettuce and tomato, and fill each with rice mixture. Serve warm or cold. Enjoy!
