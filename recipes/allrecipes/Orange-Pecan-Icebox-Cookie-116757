In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter, shortening and sugars. Beat in egg, orange juice, orange peel and extracts. Combine the flour, salt, baking soda and baking powder; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Stir in pecans. Shape dough into four 5-in. rolls; wrap each in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 3-4 hours or until firm. Unwrap and cut into 1/4-in. slices. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 9-10 minutes or until edges begin to brown. Remove to wire racks to cool.
