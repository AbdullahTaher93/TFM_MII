Preheat grill. Combine first six ingredients in a small bowl. Stir in balsamic vinegar and oil. Rub mixture evenly on chicken. Grill chicken over medium direct heat for 25-30 minutes, or until internal temperature of the thickest portion of breast reaches 170 degrees F and thigh reaches 180 degrees F. Turn every 5 minutes to prevent chicken from burning.
