In a blender or food processor, puree tomatoes with liquid until smooth. Pour into a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir in broth, cheese and tomato paste. Season with parsley, basil, tarragon, thyme, salt and pepper. Simmer 30 minutes, stirring frequently, until cheese is melted and smooth and flavors are well blended.
