Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly spray a baking pan with cooking spray. Prepare Idahoan Signature™ Russets Mashed Potatoes according to package directions. Keep warm. Mix bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and parsley together in a bowl. Sprinkle each piece of cod with the bread crumb mixture. Lightly brush cod with the 1/4 cup honey mustard. Bake in preheated oven until fish starts to flake and becomes a golden brown, about 15 minutes. Mix yogurt, mayo, honey mustard, garlic powder, chives, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Spoon over the fish when plating. Serve with a side of Idahoan Signature™ Russets Mashed Potatoes.
