Combine seasoned salt, five spice powder, peanut butter and milk in a shallow bowl. Combine bread crumbs and coconut in another shallow bowl. Coat chicken in peanut butter mixture, dip into breading mixture. Pat to coat well. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken tenders slowly to achieve even browning, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Add more oil as needed. Combine preserves, soy sauce, lemon juice, sesame oil and gingerroot in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on HIGH 20 to 30 seconds or until warmed through; stir. Serve warm with chicken as a dipping sauce.
