Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, carrots, red bell pepper, and garlic until tender and softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add cauliflower to vegetable mixture and pour in chicken broth; bring to a boil. Cook soup until cauliflower is tender, about 10 minutes. Remove pot from heat and blend soup using a hand blender until smooth. Place pot over low heat and add curry powder, butter, hot sauce, salt, and pepper to soup; simmer until flavors have blended, about 15 minutes more.
