Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Cook the cubed chicken until no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain chicken and place it in a medium saucepan with mozzarella cheese, Cheddar cheese, condensed cream of mushroom soup and hot yellow banana pepper. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven 20 to 25 minutes, or until bubbly and lightly browned.
