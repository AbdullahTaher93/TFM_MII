Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Combine sweet potatoes, thyme, olive oil, garlic, salt, and red pepper flakes in a bowl until evenly coated. Arrange coated sweet potato slices in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet or 9x13-inch baking dish. Place baking sheet on the top rack of preheated oven; roast until sweet potatoes are tender and slightly browned, about 40 minutes.
