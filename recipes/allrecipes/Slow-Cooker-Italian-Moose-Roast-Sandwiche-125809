Cut 20 small, deep slits all over the roast; stuff the slits with garlic and bouillon cubes, and place into a slow cooker. Drain half of the liquid from the peppers, then pour the remaining peppers and liquid over the roast. Season with Worcestershire sauce, and sprinkle the Italian dressing mix overtop. Cook on Low for 10 to 12 hours until the meat can easily be pulled apart. Shred the meat finely, and serve mounded on French rolls; dip into juices if desired.
