Put the salmon into a bowl and mash it. Stir in the corn, 1 cup of the cracker crumbs, the onion, and the eggs. Spread the remaining crumbs on a plate. Form the salmon into four burgers and press each into the crumbs on both sides. Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook the burgers two at a time, 3 minutes per side, until browned, adding remaining oil as needed.
