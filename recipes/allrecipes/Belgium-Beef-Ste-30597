Season with thyme, bay leaves, and salt and pepper to taste. Cover, and simmer for 30 minutes. Mix in the beer. Spread mustard over bread, then add the bread and the carrots to the meat. Cover, and simmer for 30 minutes. Mix in the brown sugar (two tablespoons is a minimum! A lot of people prefer more).
