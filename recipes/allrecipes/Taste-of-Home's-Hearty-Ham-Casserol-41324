In a large bowl, combine the first four ingredients; set aside. In a saucepan, saute onion in butter for 2 minutes; stir in flour until blended. Gradually add milk and pepper. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat; pour over the ham mixture and stir until combined. Transfer to a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Cover and bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes. Uncover and sprinkle with cheese. Bake 5-10 minutes longer or until the cheese is melted.
