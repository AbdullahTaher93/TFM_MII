Spray a cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray. Wash apples by gently rubbing with an abrasive scrub sponge and a few drops of dish detergent. Rinse and dry well; remove stem. Push sticks into tops of apples; set aside. Melt caramels and hard candies with butter and water in a medium saucepan over low heat until smooth, stirring often. Dip and swirl apples in melted caramel mixture, using a spoon to spread evenly. Place on prepared pan and refrigerate at least 15 minutes or until caramel sets. Microwave white chocolate in small microwave-safe bowl on HIGH 60 seconds or until melted, stirring frequently. Be careful not to burn chocolate. Remove apples from refrigerator. With one hand, firmly grasp the apple stick. With the other hand, use a teaspoon to delicately drizzle stripes of white chocolate around the caramel apple, gently spinning or turning the apple as necessary to reach all the way around. Return the apple to the refrigerator on for a minimum of 5 minutes to set chocolate. Repeat with semi-sweet chocolate.
