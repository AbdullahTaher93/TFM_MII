Place eggplant on paper towels; cover with coarse salt. Let sit until moisture is drawn out, about 1 hour. Rinse with cold water; dry thoroughly with paper towels. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with cooking spray. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add eggplant; cook and stir until eggplant is tender and lightly brown, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Cover the bottom of the prepared baking pan with half of the eggplant; layer on ham, mozzarella cheese, and basil. Top with remaining eggplant. Whisk eggs, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; pour over the top eggplant layer. Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set and top is golden, about 30 minutes. Cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Flip the pan onto a plate to remove the quiche.
