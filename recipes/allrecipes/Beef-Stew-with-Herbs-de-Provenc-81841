Trim and cut beef into bite sized pieces. Heat the oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Brown the beef cubes in batches making sure they are not crowded. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, remove each batch to a bowl. Add to the pot, the celery and onions. Saute for 1 minute stirring frequently. Add the garlic and cook another 30 seconds or so. Add the red wine, broth, ketchup, herbs, Worcestershire and pepper. Bring to a boil and scrape up any brown bits that might be stuck to the pot. Boil for about 2-3 minutes, reducing the liquids. Stir occasionally. Add the meat and reduce heat to simmer. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
