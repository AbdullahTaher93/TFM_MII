Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Combine ancho chile and 1/2 teaspoon salt in cup. Rinse chicken; pat dry with paper towels; rub spices onto chicken. Wash hands. Heat oil in large nonstick skillet. Add chicken and cook over medium-high heat until browned, 2 minutes per side. Transfer chicken in skillet to oven; bake 15 minutes or until juices run clear when thickest part of chicken is pierced or temperature on instant-read thermometer reaches 170 degrees F. Meanwhile, combine pineapple, onion, cilantro, lime juice, jalapeno, and pinch of salt in bowl. Serve chicken with salsa. (Refrigerate leftovers.)
