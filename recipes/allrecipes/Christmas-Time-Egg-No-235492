In a large saucepan, whisk together eggs and sugar until well combined. Whisk in milk. Add cinnamon sticks, nutmeg, mace and cloves; place over medium heat and whisk gently for about 10 minutes or until mixture has small bubbles around the edge of pan and thermometer reaches 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). Remove from heat and pour through fine mesh strainer into a large bowl. Whisk in rum (if desired) and cover with plastic wrap, directly on surface, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 2 days. When ready to serve, sprinkle with cinnamon, if desired.
