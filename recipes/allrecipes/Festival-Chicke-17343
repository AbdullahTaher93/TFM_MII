Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl combine the preserves, salad dressing and soup mix; stir together until well mixed and set aside. Place chicken pieces skin side down in two lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dishes. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1/2 hour. Brush the skin side of the chicken pieces with the glaze mixture (you will use about 1/2 of the mixture) and return to oven; reduce temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) and bake for another 1/2 hour. Brush with remaining glaze mixture just before serving.
