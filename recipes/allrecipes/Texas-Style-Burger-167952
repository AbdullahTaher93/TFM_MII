Preheat grill to medium heat. Mix ground beef, 1/4 cup of the steak sauce, the onion and chilies; shape evenly into 6 (1/2-inch-thick) patties. Grill patties, uncovered, 11 to 13 minutes or until cooked through (160 degrees F), turning patties occasionally and brushing with the remaining 1/4 cup steak sauce. Serve in buns topped evenly with the guacamole, cheese and tomatoes.
