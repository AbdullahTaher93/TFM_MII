In a shallow bowl or large resealable plastic bag, combine the first six ingredients. Dip chicken in buttermilk, then coat with crumb mixture. Place in a single layer in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with remaining crumbs. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until juices run clear. Meanwhile, for the sauce, bring broth and cornstarch to a boil in a small saucepan. Stir in mustard; simmer for 3 minutes. Add sour cream; heat through, stirring constantly (do not boil). Serve over chicken.
