Chop green bell pepper, red bell pepper, onion, celery, carrots, jalapeno pepper, and garlic, each separately, in a food processor; combine in a large bowl. Chop tomato in the food processor, drain extra liquid, and transfer chopped tomato to vegetable mixture. Mix seasoned salt and black pepper into vegetable mixture until evenly coated. Spray ice cube trays or miniature muffin cups with cooking spray; fill each section with vegetable mixture using an ice cream scoop or large spoon. Place trays in the freezer until vegetable mixtures are completely frozen, at least 3 hours.
