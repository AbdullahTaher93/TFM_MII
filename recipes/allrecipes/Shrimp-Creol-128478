Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp. Remove bacon to paper towels. Crumble when cool. Remove and discard all but 1 tablespoon drippings from the skillet. In hot drippings over medium heat, cook onion, bell pepper, and celery 5 minutes, or until tender. Stir in garlic and cook 1 minute. Add tomatoes (with juice), bay leaf, salt, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and hot-pepper sauce. Heat to boiling. Reduce heat to low and simmer 20 minutes. Add shrimp and bacon. Cook 10 minutes, or until shrimp are opaque. Remove and discard bay leaf before serving.
