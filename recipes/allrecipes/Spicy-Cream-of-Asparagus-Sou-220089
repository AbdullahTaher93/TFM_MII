Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour chicken broth over onions and bring to a boil. Stir in asparagus and potato; cover and cook until asparagus spears are tender, about 8 minutes. Mix in jalapeno pepper. Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Stir in heavy cream. Season with salt, black pepper and hot sauce.
