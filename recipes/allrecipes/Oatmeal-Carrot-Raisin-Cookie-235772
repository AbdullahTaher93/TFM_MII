Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Whisk peanut butter, coconut oil, agave nectar, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla together in a bowl. Whisk flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, and cloves together in a separate bowl; stir into peanut butter mixture until dough comes together. Fold oats, carrots, and raisins into dough. Spoon dough, 1 to 2 tablespoons per cookie, onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, about 15 minutes.
