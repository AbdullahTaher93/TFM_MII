Melt the butter in one of the custard cups by putting it in the microwave for 20-30 seconds. In a small mixing bowl, add the eggs and beat well with a whisk. Before measuring the Sugar Free Maple Syrup, pour the melted butter into the measuring cup and then back into the custard cup. This will make it easier to get the syrup out of the measuring cup. Add the syrup to the egg mixture. Then before more measuring the molasses, dip the Tbsp into the melted butter and coat it well. Add the molasses to the egg mixture. Now add the vanilla extract. Mix well. Pour the melted butter into each custard cup to coat them. Then add the melted butter to the egg mixture. Mix. Rough chop the pecan. This is easily done with a good knife. If using walnuts, a food processor may work better for you. But do not grind. Reserve 4 nut halves to place in the center of each cup if you'd like. Distribute the nuts to the 4 custard cups evenly. Pour the egg mixture evenly between the 4 cups. Place the custard cups on a cookie sheet and bake at 375 degrees F for 12 to 15 minutes. They will rise a little in the center of each cup when they are done.
