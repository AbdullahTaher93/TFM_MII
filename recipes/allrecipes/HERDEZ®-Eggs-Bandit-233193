Fill the bottom of a double boiler half-full with water (top of double boiler should not touch the water). Bring water to simmer over medium-high heat. In the top of the double boiler over the simmering water, whisk together egg yolks, lime juice, chipotle powder, Mexican cooking sauce, and 1 tablespoon water. Gradually whisk the melted butter into the egg yolk mixture, a little at a time. If the sauce begins to get too thick, add a teaspoon or two of hot water. Continue whisking until all butter is incorporated. Whisk in garlic salt, then turn off heat. Place a lid on pan to keep sauce warm. To poach eggs, fill a large saucepan with 3 inches of water. Bring water to a gentle simmer over medium-high heat; add vinegar. Swirl water to make a "whirlpool" then carefully break eggs, one at a time, into the middle of "swirl", and allow to cook for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Yolks should still be soft in center. Remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon and set on a warm plate. While eggs are poaching, cook chorizo in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until cooked through. It will retain its bright red color (the spices) so check the temperature to ensure doneness. An instant-read thermometer should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove from heat when done. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler to low setting. Arrange the bolillo rounds on a baking sheet and toast lightly under the broiler, about 2 minutes per side. Place a few bolillo rounds (size will vary) on each plate and top each serving with 1/4 C of cooked chorizo. Top the sausage with two poached eggs. Drizzle with bandito sauce, and sprinkle with chopped cilantro and/or lime wedges. Serve immediately.
