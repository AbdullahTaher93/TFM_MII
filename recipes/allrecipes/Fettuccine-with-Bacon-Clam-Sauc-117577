Cook fettuccine according to package directions. Meanwhile, drain clams, reserving 1/4 cup juice. In a large saucepan, combine the butter, garlic, parsley, oregano, pepper, clams and reserved juice. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Stir in the cream and Parmesan cheese; simmer 2-3 minutes longer or until heated through. Add bacon. Drain fettuccine; stir into sauce.
