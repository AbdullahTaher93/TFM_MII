Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crispy, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon slices to a plate lined with paper towel to drain, reserving the bacon drippings. Chop the bacon. Drain and rinse pinto beans; transfer to a large pot. Pour enough water over the beans to cover by several inches Stir salt and garlic powder into the water; bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low. Add bacon, reserved bacon drippings, beer, cilantro, green onions, diced tomatoes, and jalapeno pepper to the water; bring mixture to a simmer and cook until the beans are completely tender, 90 minutes to 2 hours.
