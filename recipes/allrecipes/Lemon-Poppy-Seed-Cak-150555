Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In large bowl, whisk EAGLE BRAND(R), eggs, yogurt, butter and lemon rind. With electric mixer, mix in biscuit baking mix, beating just until smooth. Stir in lemon juice and poppy seeds. Pour batter evenly into lightly greased 13x9-inch baking pan. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until golden brown and cake springs back when lightly pressed. Serve warm or at room temperature. Store leftovers covered at room temperature.
