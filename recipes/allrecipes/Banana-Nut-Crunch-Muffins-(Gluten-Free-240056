Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 18 miniature muffin cups or line with paper liners. Blend oats in a blender until consistency of flour. Add bananas, almond butter, milk, agave nectar, coconut oil, egg, vanilla extract, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt to oat flour and blend until batter is smooth. Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 15 to 25 minutes.
