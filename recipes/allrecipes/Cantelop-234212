Using a sharp knife, cut off just the end of a cantaloupe. Be careful not to cut off too much, or you will have a hole in the face of your Cantelope. Using your knife, outline the shape of the Cantelope's smile in the cut portion of the cantaloupe. Once you get the smile outlined, gently scoop out a small amount of cantaloupe to form an indentation. Cut a rectangle lengthwise into what will be the top of your Cantelope. After you have formed the outline with a knife, insert a long knife tip first to cut out the piece. Cut into your second cantaloupe. Scoop out some seeds and clean them on a paper towel to remove any residue. Push pointy parts of seeds into the edges of the smile to form teeth. Pierce the spot where you will place eyes in the face of the Cantelope using the tip of a knife. Gently push tips of chocolate chips into eye holes. Using your second cantaloupe, cut a slice of cantaloupe and remove seeds to form the top piece of your Cantelope. Place into rectangle cut-out on top of Cantelope. Using toothpick, poke holes in the bottom of Cantelope for legs. Once holes are in place, skewer the ends your bananas (cut to 2 inch length) with toothpick and insert into Cantelope. Now your smiling Cantelope dinner companion is ready to romp across the table!
