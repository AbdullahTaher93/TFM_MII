In a medium bowl, mash the hard-cooked eggs with a fork or pastry blender. Mix in mayonnaise, honey mustard, and jalapeno. Season with black pepper, garlic powder, and salt. Spread egg mixture on four of the bread slices. Layer with baby spinach leaves and tomato slices, and top with remaining slices of bread.
