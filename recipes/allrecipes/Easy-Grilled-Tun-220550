Place tuna steaks with Italian dressing in a bowl, coating both sides; marinate in refrigerator for 20 minutes. Preheat outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Grill tuna on the preheated grill until tuna lightens in color but retains a thin line of pink in the center, about 5 minutes on each side.
