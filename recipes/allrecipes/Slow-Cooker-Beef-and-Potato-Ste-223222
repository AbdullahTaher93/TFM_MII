Crumble ground beef into a skillet over medium heat; season with garlic salt and cayenne pepper. Cook and stir the ground beef until completely browned, breaking into small pieces as you stir, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain as much grease from the beef as possible. Combine water, beef broth, corn, potatoes, sliced jalapeno peppers, onion, onion powder, and black pepper in a slow cooker; add drained ground beef. Cook on High until potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally, 3 1/2 to 4 hours.
