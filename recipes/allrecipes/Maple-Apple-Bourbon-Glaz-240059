Combine apple juice, maple syrup, bourbon, brown sugar, liquid amino acid, Dijon mustard, and granulated garlic in a saucepan using a whisk over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until glaze thickens and is reduced by about 1/3, about 12 minutes. Let glaze cool.
