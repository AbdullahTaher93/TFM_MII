Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cream butter and honey and add sugar; beat until light and fluffy. Add eggs, vanilla, salt and baking powder and mix well; gradually add flour and mix until semi-soft dough forms. Roll tablespoons of dough into balls and place them 2 inches apart onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for about 10 minutes, or until bottoms are light golden brown. Remove from oven and immediately remove from cookie sheets. Let cool and serve warm or cold. Enjoy!
