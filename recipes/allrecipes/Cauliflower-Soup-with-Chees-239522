Measure 2 cups cauliflower florets into a bowl and set aside. Mix remaining cauliflower florets, onion, potato, carrot, garlic, and salt together in a Dutch oven or stockpot. Pour water over cauliflower mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until all vegetables are tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Pour soup in batches into a blender no more than half full. Hold lid in place while pulsing blender a few times before leaving on to puree until smooth. Return pureed soup to the pot. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Put reserved cauliflower into the steamer basket, place lid on saucepan, and steam cauliflower until just tender, about 5 minutes; add to pot with pureed mixture. Stir Cheddar cheese, milk, dill, and black pepper into the soup. Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat. Toast cumin seeds in hot skillet until lightly toasted and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes; stir into the soup. Continue heating soup until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.
