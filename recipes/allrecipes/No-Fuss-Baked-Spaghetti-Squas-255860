Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place squash cut side up on a rimmed baking sheet. Divide the sauce among the 4 halves. Brush cut edge of squash with olive oil to prevent drying out. Bake in preheated oven until squash is soft and sauce is hot, about 1 1/2 hours. Serve squash with grated Parmesan cheese.
