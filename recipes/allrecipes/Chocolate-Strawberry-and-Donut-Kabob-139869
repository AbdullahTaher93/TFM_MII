Melt chocolate chips in small microwavable bowl. Stir in oil. Dip or spoon chocolate over bottom third to half of strawberries. Place on wax paper to let chocolate set, about 5 minutes. To assemble, thread 1 donut hole, 1 mint leaf and 1 chocolate-dipped strawberry on each of eight 4 1/2 to 5-inch bamboo skewers.
