Season pork with kosher salt and pepper. Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat; add oil. Stir pork into the hot oil and cooking, turning often with tongs, until pork is evenly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Pour chicken broth over the pork and scrape any brown bits of food off the bottom of the Dutch oven using a wooden spoon; stir in garlic, Italian seasoning, and bay leaves. Mix tomatoes and tomato paste into pork mixture, stirring and pressing paste along the side of the Dutch oven to help dissolve it. Reduce heat to medium-low. Stir, cover, and cook for 2 1/2 hours. Remove Dutch oven from heat and shred pork into the tomato sauce using 2 forks. Add mushrooms; cover and simmer for 1 hour more. Remove bay leaves.
