In a saucepan, saute onion and garlic in 2 teaspoons oil until tender. Stir in the tomatoes, basil, oregano and rosemary. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cook, uncovered, over medium heat for 15-20 minutes or until sauce thickens. Meanwhile, sprinkle both sides of turkey cutlets with salt and pepper. In a large nonstick over medium heat, cook turkey in batches in remaining oil until juices run clear. Serve with tomato sauce. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
