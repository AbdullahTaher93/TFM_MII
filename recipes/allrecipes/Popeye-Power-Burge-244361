Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Whisk egg in a large bowl until uniform in color; add ground beef, oats, onion, spinach, cheese, salt, and ground black pepper and mix with your hands until well blended. Form the beef mixture into 4 patties. Grill patties until bottoms are brown, about 5 minutes; flip and continue grilling until brown, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into middle of burgers should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 5 minutes. Transfer burgers to whole-grain buns.
