Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a saucepan bring water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Arrange pork chops in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 minutes. Remove from oven and drain excess fat from pan. Top each pork chop with a slice of onion. Place a heaping mound of rice on each chop, followed by a whole tomato that you have sliced open slightly to allow the tomato juices to run out. Pour the remaining tomatoes and juices over all along with any remaining onions. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 more minutes.
