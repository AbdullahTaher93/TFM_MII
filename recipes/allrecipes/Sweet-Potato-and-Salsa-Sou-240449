Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until soft and translucent, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir sweet potatoes into onion mixture until potatoes are coated completely. Mix broth into potato mixture, bring to a simmer, and cook until potatoes are soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat; stir salsa, salt, and black pepper into soup. Pour soup into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Return to saucepan over medium-low heat; when soup is hot, stir in lime juice.
