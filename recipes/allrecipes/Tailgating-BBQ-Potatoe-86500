Toss potatoes with oil in a large bowl. Add seasoning; toss to coat evenly. Place potatoes on large, wide sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Place onions on top of potatoes and fold foil end over end until tightly sealed. Grill over medium-high heat 30-35 minutes; turning halfway through cooking time.
