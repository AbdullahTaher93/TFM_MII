To make the dressing, place the balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, honey, shallot, garlic, salt, and pepper in the bowl of a mini food processor. Pulse until blended. Slowly pour in the olive oil, and pulse again until thoroughly blended. Set aside or refrigerate until needed. Divide lettuce between 6 serving plates, and top with red onion, almonds, strawberries, and feta cheese. Serve dressing on the side.
