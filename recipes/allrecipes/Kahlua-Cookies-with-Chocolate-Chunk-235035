Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line cookie sheets with parchment. Combine flour, baking soda, salt and sugars. Make a well in the center of dry ingredients and add softened butter, eggs, Kahlua, instant espresso, ground coffee and chocolate chunks. Mix well to combine all ingredients into cookie dough. Using a small scoop or a heaping tablespoon, drop cookie dough 2 inches apart on prepared cookie sheets. Bake cookies in batches 9 to 11 minutes. Transfer to wire rack to cool.
