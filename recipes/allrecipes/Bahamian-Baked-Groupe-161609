Arrange the grouper on a plate. Drizzle the lime juice over the fillets and season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or 8 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish. Lay the fillets in the prepared baking dish in a single layer. Arrange the tomato slices, onion slices, and bell pepper slices atop the fillets. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven until the fish flakes easily, about 1 hour.
