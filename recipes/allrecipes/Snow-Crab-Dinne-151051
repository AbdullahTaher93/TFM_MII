Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place the Snow Crab in a lipped baking pan. Bake the Snow Crab in the preheated oven for 8-10 minutes. (Keep in mind that the crab is fully cooked; you just want to heat them up.) Slice the lemon in wedges to serve with the Snow Crab. Melt your margarine either in the microwave or in a sauce pan, place it in a small bowl for dipping and serve.
