Mix the garlic, shallot, red pepper flakes, and 2 tablespoons olive oil together in a shallow dish. Lay the mahi mahi fillets in the olive oil mixture; turn to coat. Season the fillets with salt and black pepper. Transfer the dish to the refrigerator and allow the fillets to marinate 30 minutes to overnight. Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the oyster mushrooms in the hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes; season with salt and black pepper. Pour the white wine over the mushrooms; bring to a simmer and allow to cook while you prepare the mahi mahi. Remove the mahi mahi fillets from the marinade; shake to remove any excess marinade. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Gently lay the fillets in the hot skillet; cook about 5 minutes. Pour the marinade over the fillets and continue cooking until the fish is just beginning to flake in the center; remove from heat, transfer to a serving dish, and keep warm. Add the tomatoes and butter to the mushroom and wine mixture. Cook and stir together just until the butter has melted; spoon over the mahi mahi fillets to serve.
