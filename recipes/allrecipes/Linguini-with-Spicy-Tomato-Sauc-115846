Heat oil in a deep saute pan over medium heat. Add garlic, and cook until just golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Add 1/4 teaspoon pepper and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add pasta and 2 1/2 teaspoons salt. Cook until al dente; drain, and set aside. Meanwhile, add clam juice and wine to saute pan, and cook until liquid is reduced by a third, 3 to 5 minutes. Add clams, capers, and red-pepper flakes; cover, and cook until clams open, 10 to 12 minutes; discard unopened clams. Whisk in butter and parsley. Toss with pasta. Season with salt and pepper, and serve.
