Preheat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Place cauliflower in a resealable plastic bag. Add olive oil, Cajun seasoning, and garlic salt to cauliflower; mix until evenly coated. Spread cauliflower in an even layer onto the baking sheet; season with salt. Cover cauliflower with aluminum foil. Roast in the preheated oven until cauliflower are slightly soft, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove foil and toss cauliflower with tongs. Continue roasting until cauliflower are browned and crispy, about 15 minutes.
