In a medium saucepan over medium heat, slowly cook and stir the onions and butter until onions are tender, approximately 10 minutes. Mix red wine vinegar, salt, ground black pepper and white sugar with the onions and butter. Continue to cook and stir until the mixture thickens to a chunky, spreadable consistency, about 10 minutes. Refrigerate until serving.
