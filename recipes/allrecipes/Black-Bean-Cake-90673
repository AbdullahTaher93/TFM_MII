In a food processor, whirl beans until slightly chunky. Scrape into a bowl; stir in 2 egg yolks (discard remaining yolks or save for another use), flour, baking powder, salt, green onions, chilies, cumin, and vinegar. In another bowl, with a mixer on high speed, beat all 4 egg whites until they form soft peaks. Fold whites into black bean mixture just until incorporated. Gently stir in queso fresco. Pour 1 teaspoon oil into a 10 to 12 inch nonstick frying pan over medium high heat; when hot, drop batter in 1/4 cup portions into pan and spread into 2 inch wide cakes with a wide spatula. Cook, turning once with spatula, until cakes are browned on both sides and firm to touch in the center, about 6 minutes total. As cakes are cooked, arrange in a single layer on 12 by 15 inch baking sheets in a 200 degree oven; cover loosely with foil and keep warm up to 30 minutes. Repeat to cook remaining cakes, adding more oil to pan as necessary.
