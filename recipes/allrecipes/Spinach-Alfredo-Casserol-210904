Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square pan. Heat butter, cream cheese, 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, onion powder, and white pepper in a large saucepan over medium heat. Continue stirring until smooth. Stir in the celery soup, cream, and spinach. Pour spinach mixture into the prepared pan. Top with the French fried onions, bread crumbs, and remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and heated through, about 30 minutes.
