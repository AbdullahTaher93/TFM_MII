Preheat the broiler. Melt the butter over medium heat in a saute pan, then add the peppers, salt and pepper, Tabasco and lemon juice. Saute until the peppers are just softened, 5 to 6 minutes. Set aside. Place the clams on their half shells in an iron skillet. Top each clam with some of the cooked pepper mixture and one small square of raw bacon. Place under the broiler, about 4 inches from the heat, for 7 to 8 minutes, until the bacon is cooked. Remove the skillet; and using tongs, remove the clams to plate and garnish with a lemon wedge.
