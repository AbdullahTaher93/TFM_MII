Make a horizontal pocket in each chicken breast half by cutting from one side almost to, but not through, the other side. Place chicken in a self-sealing plastic bag set in a shallow dish. For marinade, in a small bowl combine mustard, mayonnaise, oil, vinegar, oregano, basil, and rosemary. Pour over chicken; seal bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours, turning bag occasionally. Meanwhile, for stuffing, in a medium bowl combine mozzarella cheese, spinach, sweet pepper, black pepper, and garlic. Spoon stuffing into pockets in chicken breast halves. If necessary, fasten pockets with wooden toothpicks. For a charcoal grill, arrange medium-hot coals around a drip pan. Test for medium heat above pan. Place chicken breasts, bone sides down, on grill rack over drip pan. Cover; grill for 45 to 55 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink (170 degrees F), turning once halfway through grilling. (For a gas grill, preheat grill. Reduce heat to medium. Adjust for indirect cooking. Grill as above.) If desired, serve with asparagus and tomatoes.
