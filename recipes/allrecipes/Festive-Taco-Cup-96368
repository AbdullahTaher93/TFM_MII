Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until tender. Add turkey; cook until turkey is no longer pink, stirring occasionally. Stir in taco seasoning mix as package directs. Remove from heat and stir in 1/2 cup cheese; set aside. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly grease 36 miniature (1-inch) muffin pan cups. Remove dough from container but do not unroll dough. Separate dough into 8 pieces at perforations. Divide each piece into 3 pieces; roll or pat each piece into 3-inch circle. Press circles into prepared muffin pan cups. Fill each cup with about 2 teaspoons turkey mixture. Bake 10 minutes. Sprinkle tops of taco cups with remaining cup cheese; bake 2 to 3 minutes more until cheese is melted. Garnish with tomato and green onion, if desired.
