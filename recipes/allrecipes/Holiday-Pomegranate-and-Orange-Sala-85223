Whisk together pomegranate juice, olive oil, vinegar, allspice, mustard, black pepper, and salt. Just before serving, combine vinaigrette and salad greens in a large bowl. Toss gently. Divide salad mixture evenly among 6 plates. Top each with about 5 orange sections, 2 tablespoons Cinnamon Glazed Walnuts and 1 tablespoon pomegranate seeds.
