Place asparagus and water into a dish, cover, and microwave on high for 3 minutes; stir. Continue microwaving until asparagus are bright green and slightly tender, 2 to 3 more minutes. Drain and cool. Toss asparagus, mushrooms, avocado, zucchini, tomato, and red onion gently in a large salad bowl. Combine lemon juice, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, garlic, basil, thyme, salt, and black pepper in a jar with a tight-fitting lid; cover and shake dressing to mix. Pour dressing over salad and toss again to coat. Cover salad and refrigerate until serving time.
