Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry chicken breasts in melted butter until no longer pink on the outside, about 3 minutes per side; transfer to prepared baking sheet. Spread 1 1/2 teaspoons mustard atop each chicken breast. Divide chopped jalapeno pepper between the four chicken breasts, pressing lightly into the mustard. Drizzle 2 tablespoons barbeque sauce atop each chicken breast and top each with a slice of bacon. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper over each breast and top each with 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese. Bake in preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
