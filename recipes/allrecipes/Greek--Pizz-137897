Preheat oven to 400 degrees F, preferably with a pizza stone inside. Meanwhile, soak tomatoes in hot water 10 minutes or until soft. Drain and chop. Squeeze lemon juice onto greens and then scatter greens onto pizza crust. Top with tomatoes and olives, crumble feta on top, and sprinkle with oregano. Bake 12 minutes directly on rack or pizza stone, or until cheese is soft and golden in spots and crust is crisp.
