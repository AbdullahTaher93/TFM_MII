In a saucepan bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add chicken bouillon and rice, and stir. Cover, remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes, or until liquid is absorbed. Refrigerate overnight. To the rice add snow peas, onions and bean sprouts. In a small skillet over medium heat, scramble the eggs; add to rice mixture. Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat. Fry the rice mixture with soy sauce until liquid evaporates; be careful not to fry until crisp.
