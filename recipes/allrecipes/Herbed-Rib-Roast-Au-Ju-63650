Prepare roast: Trim excess fat from roast. Grind peppercorns and bay leaves with salt to a powder in processor, or spice grinder, then transfer to a mortar. Add garlic, mustard, Savory Market Roast Beef Enhancer, thyme, and rosemary; then pound to a smooth paste with pestle. Stir in oil. Rub paste all over roast. Transfer roast to a rack set in a roasting pan. Marinate, covered and chilled, at least 8 hours; preferably, overnight. Cook roast: Let roast stand at room temperature 1 hour. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Roast beef in middle of oven 20 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F and roast beef until a thermometer inserted into center of meat registers 110 degrees F, 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours more. Transfer beef to a large platter and let stand, uncovered, 25 minutes. (Meat will continue to cook, reaching about 130 degrees F for medium-rare.) Make jus: After skimming fat from pan juices, add broth, rosemary, thyme, and garlic and deglaze pan by simmering on top of stove over moderate heat, stirring and scraping up brown bits. Transfer to a small saucepan and add any juices that have collected on platter. Gently simmer 10 minutes and season jus with salt and pepper. Put slices from roast and serve with jus.
