Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for direct heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is directly under the food). Peel onions and cut crosswise into 1/3 inch thick slices. In a large bowl, stir together 1 1/2 tablespoons oil, balsamic vinegar, brown sugar, salt, and pepper. Add onion slices and mix well to coat. If cooking over charcoal, use a grill skillet or basket; if cooking over gas, use a grill sheet or basket (lightly brush sheet with oil or spray with cooking oil spray). Transfer onions to grill skillet, sheet, or basket, reserving oil mixture in bowl. Place skillet or basket on grill over a solid bed of medium hot coals or medium high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand just above grill level for only 3 to 4 seconds). Keep charcoal grill uncovered; close lid on gas grill. Cook, gently shaking once or twice to turn onions, until brown and limp, about 20 minutes. Return onions to bowl and mix to coat with reserved oil mixture. Serve warm or at room temperature.
