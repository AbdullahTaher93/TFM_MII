Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish and oil with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain. Stir sausage, tomatoes and reserved juice, onion, Cheddar cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, 2 teaspoons olive oil, parsley, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and ground black pepper together in a large bowl. Add elbow macaroni and stir. Pour macaroni mixture into prepared baking dish, sprinkle with American cheese, and cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove aluminum foil from baking dish, increase heat to 425, and bake until sauce is bubbly, and the top is golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
