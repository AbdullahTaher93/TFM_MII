In a food processor or blender, whirl yogurt, lemon juice, onion, garlic, ginger, chile, garam masala, salt, and turmeric until well blended. Put turkey in a large bowl. Pour yogurt mixture on top and mix to coat. Let stand, covered, at room temperature for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, medium heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above cooking grate only 4 to 5 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). Place turkey on oiled cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook, turning once with tongs, until meat is browned on the outside and no longer pink in center (cut to test), 12 to 15 minutes total. Transfer to a rimmed board, slice, and serve with lemon to squeeze on top.
