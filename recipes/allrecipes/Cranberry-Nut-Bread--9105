Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 9x5 inch loaf pan. Combine the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Add the cranberries and chopped nuts, stir to coat with flour. Combine the egg, oil, orange juice and grated orange peel. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and stir until just combined. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Let bread sit for 10 minutes and then remove from the pan and place on a cooling rack. Let cool completely before slicing.
