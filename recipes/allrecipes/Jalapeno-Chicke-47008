Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking sheet. In a small bowl, mix cinnamon, chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper. Rub chicken pieces with the mixture, and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, blend chicken broth, honey, lime juice, and jalapeno. Cook and stir until thickened. Place chicken in the preheated oven and cook about 15 minutes. Begin basting periodically with the chicken broth mixture. Continue cooking 30 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
