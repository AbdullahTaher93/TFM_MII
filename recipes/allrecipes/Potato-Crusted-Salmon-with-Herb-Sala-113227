In a medium bowl, toss the potatoes with the chives and flour and season with salt and pepper. Lay the salmon fillets on a work surface and season with salt and pepper. Evenly pat the shredded potatoes onto the top of each fillet. In a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil until shimmering. Carefully add the salmon fillets to the oil, potato side down, and cook over moderately high heat, undisturbed, until browned, about 8 minutes. Carefully flip the salmon and cook for 1 minute longer. Using a slotted spatula, transfer the salmon to plates. Blot off any excess oil. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk the lemon juice, mustard and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Add the herb salad mix and toss to coat. Transfer the salad and salmon to plates and serve.
