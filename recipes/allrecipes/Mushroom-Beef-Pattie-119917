In a bowl, combine egg, 1/2 cup milk, cornflakes and onion. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Shape into eight patties. In a large skillet, cook patties over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Transfer to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. In a bowl, combine the soup and remaining milk until blended. Pour over patties. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes or until hot and bubbly.
