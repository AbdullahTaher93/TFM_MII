Place ribs in a Dutch oven and cover with water. Add onion, garlic, pickling spices, sage and hot pepper sauce. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 1-1/2 hours or until tender. Cool slightly; rinse ribs with water to remove spices. Pour barbecue sauce into a large resealable plastic bag. Add ribs; cover and refrigerate overnight. Drain, reserving marinade and discard marinade. Grill ribs, uncovered, over medium heat, turning several times until heated through, about 10 minutes. Brush remaining barbecue sauce over the ribs.
