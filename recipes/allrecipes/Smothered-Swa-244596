Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange swai fish on an 8x11-inch baking dish. Pour lemon juice over fish and season with parsley, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over fish and top with fire-roasted tomatoes and basil. Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 30 minutes.
