Cover or seal, and chill 8 hours, turning occasionally. REMOVE steak from marinade, reserving marinade. GRILL steak, covered with grill lid, over high heat (400 to 500 degrees) about 6 minutes on each side or until desired degree of doneness. BRING reserved marinade to a boil in a saucepan, and boil at least 1 minute or until reduced by one-third. STIR together cornstarch and 3 tablespoons water until smooth. Add to marinade; bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Boil, stirring constantly, 1 minute; remove from heat. Spoon over steak.
