In a microwave-safe bowl, heat margarine and marshmallows at HIGH for 3 minutes, stirring after 2 minutes. Stir until smooth. Add Kellogg's(R) Rice Krispies(R) cereal. Stir until well coated. Using buttered spatula or waxed paper, press mixture evenly into 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan coated with cooking spray. When slightly cooled, cut cereal mixture with leaf-shaped cookie cutters or use a knife to cut leaf shapes. Allow to cool completely. Decorate by spreading frosting over top of leaves. Draw veins on leaves with decorating gel. Best if served the same day. Microwave cooking times may vary.
