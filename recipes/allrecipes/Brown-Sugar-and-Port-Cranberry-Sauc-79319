In a large saucepan, combine the cranberries, brown sugar, orange zest and juice, and port wine. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the cranberries have popped and the sauce has thickened, about 15 minutes. Cool, and refrigerate overnight before serving.
