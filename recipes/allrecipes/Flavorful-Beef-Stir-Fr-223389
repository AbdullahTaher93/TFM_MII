Bring brown rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, and liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes. Combine cornstarch, sugar, soy sauce, and wine in a small bowl until smooth. Stir in ginger; toss beef in sauce to coat. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir broccoli, carrots, pea pods, and onion for 1 minute. Stir in water chestnuts, Chinese cabbage, and bok choy; cover and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 4 minutes. Remove from skillet and keep warm. In same skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef until desired degree of doneness, about 2 minutes per side for medium. Return vegetables to skillet; cook and stir until heated through, about 3 minutes. Serve over rice.
