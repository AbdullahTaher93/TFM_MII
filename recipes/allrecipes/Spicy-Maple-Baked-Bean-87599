Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Add the onion, and cook until soft. Mix in the ham and garlic; cook and stir for 2 more minutes. Mix in the maple syrup, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, cayenne pepper, and baked beans. Bring to a boil, then simmer over low heat for 45 minutes. Just before serving, stir in the mustard, and season with salt and pepper.
