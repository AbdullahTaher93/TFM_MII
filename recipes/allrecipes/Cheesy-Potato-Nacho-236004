Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Toss potatoes with olive oil, salt, and pepper in a bowl until coated. Arrange potatoes in 1 layer in an oven-proof skillet. Cook potatoes over medium-high heat until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until golden brown on other side, about 4 more minutes. Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until tender, about 25 minutes. Place turkey bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels and chop. Sprinkle bacon, Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese, and green onions over potatoes. Return to oven until cheese is melted, about 3 minutes.
