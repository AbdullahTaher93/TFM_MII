In a skillet over medium heat, cook the sausage, beef, and onion until sausage and beef are evenly brown and onion is tender. Season with garlic salt. Drain grease. Mix in 2 cans diced tomatoes and 1 can diced tomatoes with green chiles. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 15 minutes. Prepare the rice according to package directions. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cut the peppers in half lengthwise, retaining stems, and remove seeds. Arrange pepper halves in a baking dish, and fill each with about 1/3 cup rice. Top with equal amounts of the meat mixture. Pour remaining meat mixture and remaining 2 cans diced tomatoes around the peppers in the dish. Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until bubbly. Top evenly with cheese, and continue baking 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
