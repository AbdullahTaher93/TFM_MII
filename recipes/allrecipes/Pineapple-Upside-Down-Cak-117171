Drain pineapple, reserving 1 tablespoon juice. Set pineapple aside. In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar and 2 tablespoons butter; stir until sugar is dissolved. Pour into an ungreased 6-in. round baking pan. Arrange pineapple slices in a single layer in pan; place cherries and pecans in center of pineapple slices. In a small mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and allspice. Add the egg, milk, reserved pineapple juice and remaining butter; beat just until combined. Spoon over pineapple. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Cool for 5 minutes before inverting onto a serving plate. Serve warm.
