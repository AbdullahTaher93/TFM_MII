Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat a 13 inch x 9 inch (32.5 x 23-cm) baking dish with cooking spray. Warm the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the zucchini and cook for 5 minutes, or until crisp-tender. Remove from the heat and set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta, egg, basil, salt, and pepper. Set aside 1/2 cup (120 mL) of the spaghetti sauce. Place three sheets of lasagna in the prepared baking dish. Evenly spoon half of the remaining spaghetti sauce over the lasagna. Top with half of the ricotta mixture, half the broccoli, half the zucchini, half the tomatoes (with juice), and half the Parmesan. Repeat layering with three more sheets of lasagna and remaining ingredients. End with remaining sheets of lasagna. Spoon the reserved sauce over top and sprinkle with the mozzarella. Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Uncover and bake for 20 minutes, or until hot and bubbly. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
