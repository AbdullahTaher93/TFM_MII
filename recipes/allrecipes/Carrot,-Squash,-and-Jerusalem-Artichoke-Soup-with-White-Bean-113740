In a large saucepan, heat the oil over moderate heat. Add the onion, carrots, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables start to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, zucchini, yellow squash, broth, tomatoes, and the remaining 1 1/4 teaspoons salt; bring to a simmer. Add the Jerusalem artichokes and return to a simmer. Reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, until the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the beans, parsley, pepper, and zest.
