In a large bowl, combine the flour, oats, sugar, salt and baking soda. Cut in butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press half of the mixture into a greased 8-in. square baking pan. Spread with preserves. Sprinkle with remaining oat mixture; gently press down. Bake at 350 degrees F for 38-42 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. Cut into squares.
