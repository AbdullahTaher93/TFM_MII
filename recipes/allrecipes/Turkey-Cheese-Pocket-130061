Press or roll out each biscuit to 3-1/2-inch circle. Place 1 heaping tsp. cream cheese mixture onto each biscuit circle. Fold dough over filling to make small turnover shapes. Firmly press edges of dough together to seal. Place on ungreased baking sheet. Bake 10 to 12 min. or until lightly browned. Serve hot.
