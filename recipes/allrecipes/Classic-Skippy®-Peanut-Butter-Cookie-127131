Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In small bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; set aside. In large bowl, with electric mixer, beat Skippy(R) Creamy Peanut Butter and Imperial(R) Stick until smooth. Beat in sugar, then eggs and vanilla, until blended. Beat in flour mixture just until blended. (If necessary, refrigerate dough until easy to handle.) Shape dough into 1-inch balls. On ungreased baking sheets, arrange balls 2 inches apart. With fork dipped in sugar, gently flatten each cookie and press crisscross pattern into tops. Bake 12 minutes or until lightly golden. On wire rack, cool completely. Store in tightly covered container.
