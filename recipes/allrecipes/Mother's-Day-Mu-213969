In large saucepan melt butter over low heat. Add marshmallows and stir until completely melted. Remove from heat. Add KELLOGG'S(R) RICE KRISPIES(R) cereal. Stir until well coated. Cool slightly. Using buttered hands shape cereal mixture into mug shapes, reserving small portions of cereal mixture for handles. Attach one handle to each mug, securing with frosting. Decorate with additional frosting. Best if served the same day.
