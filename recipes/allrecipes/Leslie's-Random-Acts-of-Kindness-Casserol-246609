Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place peas in a large colander in the sink. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until chewy and still firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain fusilli over peas. Return fusilli and peas to the pot. Add heavy cream and smoked salmon; mix well to combine. Season with salt and black pepper. Pour into a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Combine bread crumbs, olive oil, parsley, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a small bowl; mix lightly with a fork. Scatter topping over casserole. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes.
