Pour the water into the bottom of a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, red pepper, and salt to the water and bring to a boil. Stir in the champagne and return the mixture to a boil. Place the lobsters in a steamer basket and lower into the pot. Steam the lobsters until they turn a bright red color, about 12 minutes.
