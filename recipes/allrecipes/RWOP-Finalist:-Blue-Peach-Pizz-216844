Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray both sides of tortilla with cooking spray and sprinkle with 1/4 tsp. kosher salt. Bake 4 min. on each side. Saute diced sausage and onion over medium heat 7 to 8 min. or until sausage browns and onions are tender. Mix cream cheese with lemon juice, maple syrup and 1/2 tsp. salt. Spread cream cheese mixture on crispy tortilla shell, then sprinkle sausage mixture, diced peaches and blue cheese on top. Place assembled pizza back in oven for about 5 min.
