In a bowl, combine the first six ingredients. Pout half of the marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add steak. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade. Drain and discard marinade from steak. Gill steak, covered, over medium for 5-6 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F well-done, 170 degrees F), basting occasionally with the reserved marinade.
