In a saucepan, combine the cola, tomato paste, onion, wine or vinegar, Worcestershire sauce and salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Set aside 1/2 cup for basting; cover and refrigerate. Carefully loosen the skin of the chicken; brush remaining sauce under skin. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill. Place chicken on grill rack. Grill, uncovered, over indirect medium heat for 20 minutes. Turn; grill 20-30 minutes longer or until chicken juices run clear, basting occasionally with reserved sauce.
