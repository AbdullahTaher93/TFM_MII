Pick over the crabmeat to remove any pieces of shell and place in a mixing bowl. Fold in the dressing and chives. In another bowl stir together the tomato, red onion, olive oil, salt and pepper taste, sugar, and parsley. Place six endive leaves in a flower pattern on each of four serving plates. Place a small mound of the crab mixture in the center. Top the crab meat with the diced avocado and place a spoonful of the tomato mixture on top.
