In a bowl, mix the reserved peach syrup, peach jam, Dijon mustard, curry powder, and honey. Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the pork chops 8 minutes, or to desired doneness. Mix the green onions into the skillet, and cook 1 minute, until tender. Spoon the syrup mixture and peaches over the pork chops. Continue cooking until heated through. Sprinkle with cilantro to serve.
