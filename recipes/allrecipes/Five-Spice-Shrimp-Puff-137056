Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Separate dough into 10 biscuits; separate each evenly into 2 layers, making 20 dough rounds. Press each round in bottom and up side of ungreased nonstick miniature muffin cup, forming 1/4-inch rim above top of cup, using floured fingers if necessary. In medium bowl, toss shrimp and five-spice powder until coated. In 10-inch nonstick skillet, heat oil over high heat until hot. Add shrimp; cook and stir 1 minute. Add sherry; cook and stir an additional minute. Remove from heat. In small bowl, mix all remaining ingredients. Spoon scant 1 tablespoon mixture into each dough-lined muffin cup; press in lightly. Top each with 1 shrimp. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10 to 15 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Cool 5 minutes. Remove from muffin cups. Serve warm.
