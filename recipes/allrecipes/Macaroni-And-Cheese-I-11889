Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling, salted water until al dente. Drain. In a large bowl, combine condensed soup, milk, mustard, and pepper. Stir in macaroni. Transfer mixture into a greased 2 quart casserole. Combine bread crumbs and melted butter or margarine in a cup. Sprinkle over macaroni mixture. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 25 minutes, or until hot and bubbling.
