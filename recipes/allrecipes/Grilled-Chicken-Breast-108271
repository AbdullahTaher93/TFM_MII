Rinse chicken and pat dry. In a large bowl, whisk together buttermilk, salt, sugar, and pepper. Add chicken, stir to coat evenly, then cover and chill at least 4 hours or up to 24. Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for direct heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is directly under the food). For charcoal grill: before you put the grill over the hot coals, brush it with a medium coat of oil. For gas grill: when hot, brush grill with a medium coat of oil. Lift chicken from buttermilk; let excess drip back into bowl. Discard buttermilk. Lay chicken on oiled grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand just above grill level for only 2 to 3 seconds). Keep charcoal grill uncovered; close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning once with tongs, until meat is no longer pink in center of thickest part (cut to test), 10 to 14 minutes total. Transfer chicken to a clean platter or plates and serve.
