While the machine is running, add the olive oil in a thin stream. Transfer the pesto to a bowl. (At this point the pesto can be frozen. Thaw it before proceeding.) Stir the Parmesan cheese, salt, and cayenne into the pesto Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta, and cook it, stirring occasionally, until it is just tender.
