Combine broth, potatoes, carrots, and butter in a large pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Add pickles to broth mixture and stir to combine. Whisk flour, sour cream, and water together in a bowl until mixture has a paste-like consistency. Add sour cream mixture, 2 tablespoons at a time, to broth mixture, whisking vigorously after each addition, until soup is smooth and slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir pickle juice, seafood seasoning, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper into broth mixture; return to a simmer and cook until heated throughout, about 5 minutes more.
