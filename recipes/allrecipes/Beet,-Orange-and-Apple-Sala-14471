Wash and dry beet roots and greens. Shred greens to measure 2 cups and set aside. Place beets in a sauce pan with enough water to cover. Bring to boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes or until tender. Drain and allow to cool. Trim and peel off skins; cut into 8 wedges. Peel and section orange. In a bowl, combine orange sections, beets and apples. Whisk together olive oil, vinegar, sugar, salt and garlic. Pour over beet mixture and toss well. Arrange 1/2 cup beet greens on 4 salad plates. Top with beet mixture, sprinkle with sunflower seeds and serve.
