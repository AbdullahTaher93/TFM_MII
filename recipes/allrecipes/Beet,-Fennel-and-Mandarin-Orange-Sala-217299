Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place beets in medium roasting pan, add water to cover bottom of pan; cover with foil. Roast 40 to 45 minutes or until beets are tender and can be pierced with a fork or knife. Cool slightly; remove skin from beets and cut into wedges. Trim off fennel leaves and stalk; cut into very thin slices. Combine salad, mandarin oranges, mint, beets and fennel in large bowl. Pour dressing over salad; toss to evenly coat. Sprinkle cheese over salad.
