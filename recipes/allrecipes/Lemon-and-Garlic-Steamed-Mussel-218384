Place mussels in large skillet without water. Cover and cook over medium heat, removing the mussels to a warm platter as they open. Discard any that do not open. Reduce liquid in the skillet to about 2 or 3 tablespoons. Return mussels to skillet. Sprinkle with olive oil, lemon juice and garlic. Heat for 1 minute. Serve immediately with crusty bread for dunking.
