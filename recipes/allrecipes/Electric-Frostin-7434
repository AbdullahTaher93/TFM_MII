Place all of the ingredients in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade, and process for 5 minutes. Stop once in a while and wipe down the sides. Transfer to a bowl of a stand-up mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on medium-high until white and fluffy, at least 15 minutes. Use straight away.
