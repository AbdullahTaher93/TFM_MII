Whirl bread in a food processor or blender until fine crumbs form. Pour crumbs into a bowl and combine with egg, green onions, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger. Add turkey and gently mix with a fork just until ingredients are evenly blended. Divide turkey mixture into 4 equal portions. With your hands, shape each portion into a 3/4-inch thick patty. If making ahead, lay patties side by side on a plate, cover airtight, and chill up to 24 hours. Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, medium-high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above the cooking grate only 3 to 4 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). Place burgers on well-oiled cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook, turning once with a wide spatula, until meat is opaque in center (cut to test), about 10 minutes total. During the last minute of cooking time, place buns with cut sides down next to burgers and cook until toasted. Transfer buns to a platter, tuck burgers inside, and garnish to taste.
