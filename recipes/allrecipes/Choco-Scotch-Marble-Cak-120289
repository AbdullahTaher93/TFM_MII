In a large mixing bowl, combine cake mix, pudding mix, eggs, sour cream and oil; beat on low speed for 2 minutes. Divide batter in half; stir butterscotch chips into half and chocolate into the other half. Spoon half of the butterscotch batter in a greased 10-in. fluted tube pan; top with half of the chocolate batter. Repeat layers. Cut through batter with a knife to swirl. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely. For frosting, combine butterscotch chips and chocolate in a small mixing bowl. Beat in enough cream until the frosting is smooth and reaches desired spreading consistency. Spread over top of cake. Sprinkle with pecans.
