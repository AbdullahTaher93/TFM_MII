Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake the frozen pastry shells in the preheated oven for 10 minutes; remove and set aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk together the condensed soup, milk, chile pepper, Worcestershire, hot sauce, salt and pepper in a saucepan over low heat. Preheat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the garlic, onion, red pepper, and asparagus until tender. Stir the soup mixture in with the vegetables and spoon into the prepared pastry shells. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool for 10 minutes before garnishing with parsley to serve.
