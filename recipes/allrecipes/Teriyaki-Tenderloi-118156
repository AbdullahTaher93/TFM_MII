In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the soy sauce, sugar and ketchup. Add the pork tenderloin; seal bag and turn to coat. Refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Drain and discard marinade. Place pork in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let stand for 5 minutes before slicing.
