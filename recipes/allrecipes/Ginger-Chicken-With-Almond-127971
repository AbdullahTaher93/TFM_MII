Slice chicken crosswise into 1/2 inch-thick pieces. Toss with coriander, grated ginger, 2 teaspoons oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Marinate at room temperature 15 minutes (or longer, or overnight, in the refrigerator). Thinly slice white parts of scallions. Julienne green parts; set aside. Stir together chutney, broth, and garlic in a small bowl. Heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil in a wok (or 12-inch nonstick skillet) over medium-high heat. Add scallion whites and julienned ginger; stir-fry 30 seconds. Add chicken and stir-fry until thoroughly cooked, 4 to 6 minutes. Add scallion greens and chutney mixture; cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Transfer to shallow bowls with hot cooked rice. Sprinkle with almonds and serve.
