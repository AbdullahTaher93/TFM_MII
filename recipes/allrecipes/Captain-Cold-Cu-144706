Stir together vinegar, oregano, and oil in a small bowl. Split rolls in half horizontally, and spoon a little vinegar mixture on the bottom half of each roll. Layer peppers, prosciutto, salami, cheese, tomato slices, and lettuce on top. Replace tops of rolls, pressing down firmly. Cut sandwiches into smaller pieces, if desired, and serve.
