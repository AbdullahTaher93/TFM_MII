In a medium bowl, combine pudding mix and milk; beat until creamy. Add cream cheese and beat until fluffy; fold in 1/2 whipped topping and set aside. In a large punch bowl, layer 1/3 of cake cubes; spread 1/3 of pudding mixture on top. Continue layering with 1/3 of bananas, 1/3 of pecans and 1/3 cup fudge sauce. Repeat layering with 1/3 of cake and 1/3 of pudding mixture; add 1/2 of cherries, 1/3 of bananas, 1/3 of pecans and 1/3 cup fudge sauce. Repeat layers for a final time with remaining cake, pudding mixture, cherries, bananas and fudge sauce, reserving 1/3 of pecans for garnish. Top with remaining whipped topping, drizzle with remaining 1/4 cup fudge sauce, and garnish with reserved pecans. Refrigerate 4 hours; serve.
