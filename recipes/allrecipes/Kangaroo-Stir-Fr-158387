Whisk together the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, fish sauce, miso paste, and sesame oil in a bowl. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the kangaroo fillet; cook to medium doneness, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Move to a cutting board to rest. While the meat is resting, return the skillet to medium heat and add the snow peas, broccoli, bok choy, bell pepper, bean sprouts and zucchini; cook and stir until the vegetables are softened. Pour the sauce into the pan and allow to simmer 5 minutes. While the vegetables simmer, thinly slice the kangaroo. Stir into the vegetables; serve hot.
