Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk the white wine, soy sauce, vegetable oil, water, garlic, ginger, oregano, and brown sugar together in a bowl. Arrange the chicken breasts in a covered baking dish; pour the sauce over the chicken. Bake covered in the preheated oven for 1 hour, turn and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
