Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. In a large bowl, prepare the marinade by mixing oil, salt, pepper, rosemary, thyme, oregano, garlic and lemon juice. Add chicken parts and toss to coat. Leave to marinate for 30 to 60 minutes. Place chicken on hot grill. Cover and cook until chicken becomes golden on one side, about 8 to 10 minutes. Turn and continue to cook, covered, until remaining side becomes golden, about 5 minutes longer. Move chicken to one side of the grill, turning burner directly under chicken off and remaining burners to low. Brush chicken parts with lemon marinade; cover and continue to cook until chicken is fully cooked, about 30 minutes longer.
