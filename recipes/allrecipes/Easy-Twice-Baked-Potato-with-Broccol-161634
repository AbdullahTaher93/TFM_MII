Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Microwave potatoes 3 to 4 minutes each, until tender. When cool enough to handle, cut in half, scoop out the pulp, leaving a 1/4 inch shell. In a bowl mash pulp with a fork. Add milk, salt, pepper, sour cream and Broccoli & Cheese Sauce, breaking up any large chunks of broccoli. Mix together. Divide mixture into reserved potato shells. Top with shredded cheese. Bake 18 to 20 minutes or until hot and browned on top.
