Whisk 3 tablespoons olive oil, lemon juice, Italian seasoning, kosher salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; transfer to a large resealable bag. Place pork pieces in marinade and turn to coat. Marinate in refrigerator for 4 to 8 hours. Mix bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small bowl. Set oven rack about 5 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Heat canola oil in a large, heavy, oven-safe skillet, such as a cast-iron skillet, over medium-high heat. Remove pork from marinade and reserve the marinade. Sear marinated pork pieces in the hot oil just until lightly browned but still pink in the center, about 2 minutes. Turn pork over and pour in reserved marinade. Turn heat to high and cook pork for 1 more minute. Spoon crust mixture over cutlets in skillet and broil in the preheated oven until the crust is crisp and golden brown, 1 to 3 minutes. Garnish with parsley.
