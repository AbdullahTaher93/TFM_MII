SORT corn husks, setting aside any torn ones. Soak intact husks in warm water for at least 1 hour or until softened and easy to fold. BEAT 2/3 cup lard in large mixer bowl until creamy. Combine masa harina and salt in medium bowl. Alternately add masa harina mixture and broth to lard, mixing well after each addition. Gradually add melted lard, mixing until consistency of thick cake batter (masa). SPREAD 1/4 cup masa, using back of spoon, to form a square in the center of one husk. Place about 1/4 cup meat filling in center of masa square. Fold right then left edge of husk over masa. Fold up bottom edge. Repeat with remaining ingredients.

Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low. Steam, adding water as needed, for 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until masa pulls away from husks.
