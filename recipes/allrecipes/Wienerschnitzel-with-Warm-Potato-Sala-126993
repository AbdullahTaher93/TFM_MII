Prepare the marinade. In a bowl, combine all the ingredients. Whisk until well blended. Set aside. In a large saucepan, combine the potatoes, garlic, thyme and salt. Cover with enough water and bring to a boil. Lower to a simmer and cook about 8 minutes, or until just done. (Do not overcook). Strain and allow to cool at room temperature. Slice into 1/4-inch-thick round slices. Add to the reserved marinade for at least 20 minutes before serving. Preheat oil to 375 degrees F in a heavy, deep saucepan. To prepare Wienerschnitzel: Season the veal scaloppini with salt and pepper. Dredge in flour. Dip in egg wash. Coat with panko or breadcrumbs. Score the coated scaloppini with four shallow knife cuts in a cross-hatch pattern to help prevent curling while cooking. Deep fry about 3 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Presentation: Place one Wienerschnitzel on each of four dinner plates. Garnish with fried parsley leaves and lemon sections. In a saute pan over high heat, warm the marinated potatoes for about 30 seconds. Divide onto the four prepared plates.
