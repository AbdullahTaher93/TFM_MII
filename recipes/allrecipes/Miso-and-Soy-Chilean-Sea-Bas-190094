Whisk together the sake, mirin, soy sauce, brown sugar, and miso paste in a bowl to make the marinade. Place the sea bass in a large sealable plastic bag and pour the marinade over the sea bass. Chill in refrigerator 3 to 6 hours. Arrange the fillets on a baking sheet. Discard the marinade. Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Prop the oven door to remain slightly ajar. Bake the sea bass under the broiler until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 7 to 9 minutes. Sprinkle with chopped green onions to serve.
