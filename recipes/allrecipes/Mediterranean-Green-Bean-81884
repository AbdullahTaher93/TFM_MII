Drain the tomatoes and coarsely chop. Drain and rinse the capers. In a large bowl, mix together the olive oil, mustard and lemon juice. Add the tomatoes and capers; mix well. Set aside. Steam the green beans just until tender (3-5 minutes). The green beans should still have a bit of a crunch to them. Once the green beans are cooked and drained, add them to the mixing bowl and toss with the tomato mixture. Serve immediately.
