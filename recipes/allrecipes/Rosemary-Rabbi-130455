Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread the thinly sliced onion onto the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan. Rub the rabbit with lemon juice and olive oil. Sprinkle inside and out with a mixture of rosemary, parsley, and cumin. Place rabbit into the roasting pan. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, then sprinkle almonds over the onions. Continue baking until the meat has turned opaque, about 15 minutes.
