You can peel, rinse and cut the potatoes up to 3 days in advance. Refrigerate the pieces in a plastic container covered with water to prevent browning. In a covered 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat, bring 1 quart of water to a boil. Peel and rinse potatoes. Cut into 1-inch chunks; carefully add to boiling water, cover and return to a boil, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, about 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat milk in a microwave oven just until steaming (don't boil). Or warm in a 1-1 1/2 quart pan over medium heat. Strain potatoes. Mash with a potato masher or mixer. Add butter, hot milk and/or desired seasonings, if using, a little at a time. Mix or beat until potatoes are fluffy. Add salt and pepper to taste.
