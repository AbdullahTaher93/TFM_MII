Blend anchovy fillets, garlic, lime juice, mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, black pepper, chipotle pepper, capers, and hot pepper sauce in a blender until smooth. Stream oil into the anchovy mixture while continuing to blend until the oil is fully emulsified into the mixture; repeat with the vinegar. Thin dressing with water if too thick.
