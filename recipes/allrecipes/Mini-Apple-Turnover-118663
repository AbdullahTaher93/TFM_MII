In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and butter until smooth. Refrigerate the egg white. Beat egg yolk and 2 tablespoons water into cream cheese mixture. Gradually beat in flour until well blended. Shape pastry into a ball. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, toss apples with sugar and cinnamon. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 8-10 minutes or until apples are tender. Remove from the heat. Turn the pastry onto a lightly floured surface. Roll to 1/8-in. thickness; cut into 4-in. circles. Top each circle with apple mixture. Brush edges of pastry with water; fold pastry over filling and seal edges well. In a small bowl, whisk egg white and remaining water; brush over pastry. Sprinkle with additional sugar if desired. Place on greased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 18-22 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks to cool. Serve with ice cream if desired.
