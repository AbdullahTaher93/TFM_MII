Place garbanzo beans into a large container and cover with at least 2 inches of cool water; let stand at least 12 hours. Drain garbanzo beans and transfer to a large pot; add enough water to cover beans by at least 2 inches. Bring water to a rolling boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until beans are very tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Remove pot from heat and cool water and beans to room temperature; drain and transfer beans to a glass container and cover. Refrigerate beans, 8 hours to overnight. Combine beans, tahini, olive oil, salt, citric acid powder, garlic powder, onion powder, allspice, cumin, coriander, and cayenne pepper in a food processor; add 1/2 cup water. Process mixture for 1 minute. Check consistency of hummus and add 1/4 cup water if hummus is too thick; process again until smooth. Continue processing hummus in the food processor until hummus is warm, about 15 minutes more.
