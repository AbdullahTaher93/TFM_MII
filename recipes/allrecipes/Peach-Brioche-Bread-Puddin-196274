Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Butter a 13x9 inch-baking dish, set aside. Slice brioche and place on a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 2-4 minutes. Set aside. Place filling ingredients in a large saucepan. Simmer over medium low heat for 35-45 minutes or until beginning to thicken. Remove from heat, pour into a heat resistant bowl and refrigerate about 30-40 minutes or lightly chilled. Place half of the brioche slices in the prepared pan. Spoon peach mixture over brioche and top with remaining brioche. Prepare custard. Whisk LACTAID(R) Low Fat Milk, vanilla, eggs and yolks together in a small mixing bowl. Pour over brioche in the baking dish. Let stand 5 minutes before baking so bread can partially absorb LACTAID(R) Low Fat Milk mixture. Sprinkle brown sugar over the pudding and bake 40-45 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from oven and cool at room temperature about 30 minutes before serving.
