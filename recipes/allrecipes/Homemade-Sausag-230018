Stir salt, sage, black pepper, nutmeg, red pepper flakes, and ginger in a small bowl. Place turkey into a separate bowl and thoroughly mix in the spices. Form sausage into patties. Fry the sausage patties in a skillet over medium heat until browned and the meat is no longer pink inside, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
