Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 2-quart casserole with cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine all ingredients except the bread crumbs and butter until well mixed. Spoon the mixture into the casserole dish. Mix the bread crumbs and melted butter; sprinkle over the potatoes. Bake the casserole for 50 to 60 minutes or until bubbly and potatoes are tender.
