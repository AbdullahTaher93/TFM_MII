Prepare charcoal grill, preheat gas grill or conventional oven to 400 degrees F. Brush pizza crust with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Combine hummus, ricotta cheese and chopped olives in a medium bowl. Spread evenly over crust; top with feta cheese, thyme and rosemary. Place halved olives cut side down around pizza; top with parmesan cheese. Place on grid and grill covered over medium heat 10 minutes or bake in preheated oven directly on oven rack for 12 minutes or until crust is brown. Drizzle remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over pizza. Arrange basil leaves around pizza. Season to taste with salt and pepper if desired.
