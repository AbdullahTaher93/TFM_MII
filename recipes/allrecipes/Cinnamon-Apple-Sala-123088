In a bowl, dissolve candies in water (reheat if necessary). Add gelatin; stir to dissolve. Stir in applesauce. Pour half into an 8-in. square pan that has been lightly coated with nonstick cooking spray. Refrigerate until firm. Cover and set remaining gelatin mixture aside at room temperature. Meanwhile, combine the cream cheese, mayonnaise, pecans and celery; spread over chilled gelatin mixture. Carefully pour remaining gelatin mixture over cream cheese layer. Chill overnight.
