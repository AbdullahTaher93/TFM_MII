Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil a heavy skillet over medium heat. Saute onion until translucent, 10 minutes. Stir in garlic and parsley, and continue cooking until onions begin to brown. Remove from heat, and allow to cool. In a medium bowl, combine bread crumbs, Romano cheese, raisins, pine nuts and pepper. Pound steak to 1/2 inch with a moistened mallet or the side of a cleaver. Spread onion mixture evenly over meat, leaving a 1 inch border around the edges. Spread bread crumb mixture in an even layer, and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Roll up from the narrow end, and tie tightly with kitchen twine. Heat remaining olive oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown roll on all sides, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Pour in spaghetti sauce, reduce heat to low, and simmer, covered, for 2 hours, until tender.
