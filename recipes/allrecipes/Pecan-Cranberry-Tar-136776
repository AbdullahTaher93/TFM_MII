Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly oil a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom or coat it with nonstick spray. To make crust: Spread oats in another pie pan and bake, stirring occasionally, until toasted, 6 to 12 minutes. Let cool. Place the oats in a food processor and process until coarsely ground. Stir together oats, flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Drizzle oil onto dry ingredients and use a fork or your fingers to blend until crumbly. Using a fork, stir in water, 1 Tbsp. at a time, until dough just comes together. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead 7 to 8 times. Roll dough out to an 11-inch circle, dusting with flour if necessary. Transfer dough to prepared pan, pressing to fit. Trim edges. (If necessary, use scraps to patch any holes in crust.) To make filling and bake: Spread 1/2 cup pecans on a baking sheet and bake for 5 to 10 minutes, or until fragrant. Let cool and coarsely chop. Whisk brown sugar, eggs, egg whites, corn syrup, vinegar, butter, vanilla and salt in a medium bowl until smooth. Stir in dried cranberries and chopped pecans. Spoon filling into crust. Arrange remaining 1/2 cup pecans on top of filling. Bake tart for 20 to 25 minutes, or until filling is set and crust is golden. Cool completely in the pan on a wire rack.
