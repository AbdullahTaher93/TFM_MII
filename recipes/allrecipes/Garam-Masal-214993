Toast the cumin seeds, coriander seeds, cinnamon sticks, bay leaves, nutmeg, anise pods, cardamom pods, cloves, peppercorns, and mace together in a skillet over medium heat until very fragrant and you can literally see the scent rising into the air, 8 to 12 minutes; remove from heat and allow the mixture to cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Pour the spice mixture into a grinder; grind into a fine powder. Store in an airtight container.
