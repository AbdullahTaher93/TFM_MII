Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, combine sour cream, cheese, chile peppers, corn, and chicken. Mix together well. Dip 9 tortilla halves in enchilada sauce, and arrange them in the bottom of a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Spread 1/2 chicken mixture over the tortilla layer. Repeat. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until center is heated through.
