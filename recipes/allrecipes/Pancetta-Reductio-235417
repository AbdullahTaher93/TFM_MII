Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir pancetta in melted butter until crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove pancetta with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towel to drain. Stir onion and garlic into the pancetta drippings in the skillet; season with salt. Cook and stir until onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Stir tomato paste with the onion mixture until smooth; season with oregano, turmeric, curry powder, herbes de Provence, and black pepper. Pour Merlot wine over the mixture and stir; bring to a full simmer and cook, stirring frequently, until the volume of the liquid is reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Melt remaining butter into the sauce; stir. Pour the reduced mixture into a blender; add the reserved pancetta and blend until smooth.
