Bring broth and rice to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the rice is very tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in spinach. Place artichoke hearts, eggs and lemon juice in a blender; cover and puree. With the motor running, ladle about half of the rice mixture into the blender and puree until smooth. (Use caution when pureeing hot liquids.) Return the pureed mixture to the pan and cook, stirring constantly, until an instant-read thermometer registers 160 degrees F, reducing the heat as necessary to prevent the soup from boiling. Stir in dill and pepper.
