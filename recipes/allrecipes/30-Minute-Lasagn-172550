Melt butter in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart pan over medium-high heat. Add flour and stir until bubbly. Remove pan from heat and gradually add milk, whisking until smooth. Return to heat and bring to a boil, stirring; then boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Season to taste with nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Remove from heat. Choose a small baking dish in which 2 egg roll wrappers will fit snugly side by side. In dish, layer a fourth of the marinara sauce, two egg roll wrappers, a third of the bechamel sauce, a third of the mozzarella cheese, and a fourth of the parmesan cheese. Repeat layers twice more, ending with marinara sauce, egg roll wrapper, and Parmesan. Bake in a 500 degrees F oven until lasagna is golden brown on top and sauce is bubbly around edges (about 15 minutes). Let stand about 5 minutes before cutting in fourths to serve.
