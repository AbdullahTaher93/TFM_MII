Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Line large shallow baking pan with nonstick aluminum foil. Tear bread into large pieces. Pulse in food processor to make crumbs. Transfer to pie plate. Combine mustard, vinegar, onion powder, and cayenne. Brush drumsticks with mustard mixture, then gently roll in crumbs. Place chicken in prepared pan; lightly spray with nonstick cooking spray. Bake 40 minutes, or until juices run clear when thickest part of chicken is pierced and temperature on instant-read thermometer reaches 180 degrees F. (Refrigerate leftovers.)
