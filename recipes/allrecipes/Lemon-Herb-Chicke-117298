In a nonstick skillet, brown chicken in oil on both sides over medium heat. Add the broth, basil, garlic, lemon juice, rosemary, lemon peel and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 10-15 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink. Remove chicken and keep warm. Combine cornstarch and water until smooth; stir into pan juices. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until slightly thickened. Serve over chicken.
