Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease cookie sheet. Remove wrappers from chocolate pieces. Beat butter, shortening, brown sugar and granulated sugar in large bowl until fluffy. Add egg and almond extract; beat until blended. Stir together flour, baking soda and salt; add to butter mixture, beating until well blended. Stir in cherries. Roll dough into 1-inch balls. Combine egg white and water; beat with fork until foamy. Roll balls in egg white, then in walnuts. Place on prepared cookie sheet. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from oven and immediately place chocolate piece on top of each cookie, pressing down gently so that cookie cracks around the edge. Cool 1 minute; remove from cookie sheet to wire rack. Allow cookies to cool until chocolate piece is set, about 3 hours.
