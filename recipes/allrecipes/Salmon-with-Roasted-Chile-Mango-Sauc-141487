Position oven rack in upper third of oven; preheat broiler. Coat a broiler pan with cooking spray. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add shallot, coriander and chile(s); cook, stirring, until the shallot begins to brown and the spices smell fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the shallot mixture to a food processor or blender. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons oil and mango. Process until almost smooth (it will be slightly gritty from the bruised coriander seed). Transfer the sauce to a small bowl; stir in 1 tablespoon cilantro. Combine garlic and salt in a small bowl. Spread the salted garlic on top of the salmon. Place the salmon, garlic side up, on the prepared broiling pan. Broil, 3 to 4 inches from heat, until opaque in the center, 8 to 14 minutes, depending on the thickness. Serve the salmon topped with the sauce and sprinkled with the remaining 1 tablespoon cilantro.
