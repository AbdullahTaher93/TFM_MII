Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8x8-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Combine cornbread, celery, pears, onion, parsley, pecans, dried cranberries, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix well. Pour apple cider over cornbread mixture and stir until evenly moistened; spread into the prepared baking dish. Top cornbread mixture with butter pieces. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
