Drain tomatoes on paper towels for 10 minutes. In a saucepan, combine tomatoes, 1 cup of brown sugar and lemon juice. Simmer, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat and stir in extract; set aside. In a mixing bowl, cream the butter and remaining brown sugar. Add flour, baking soda and salt; mix well. Stir in oats and nuts. Press 2-1/2 cups on the bottom of a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Spread tomato mixture over crust. Crumble remaining oat mixture on top. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Cool.
