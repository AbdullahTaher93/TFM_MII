Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the stew meat; drain and set aside. In a mixing bowl, combine the tomatoes, water, tapioca, beef bouillon granules, sugar, salt and pepper. Stir in the beef, carrots, celery, potatoes, onion, and bread cubes. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Cover and bake for 2 hours, or until meat and vegetables are tender.
