Heat the oven to 450 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs, sage, parsley, butter, and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Season the turkey breast with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and the pepper. Set the turkey breast in a roasting pan and then brush the top and the sides of the breast with the mustard. Pat the seasoned bread crumbs onto the mustard. Roast the turkey for 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and continue to roast the turkey breast until just done, 15 to 20 minutes longer. Transfer the turkey to a carving board and leave to rest in a warm spot for about 10 minutes. Cut the turkey into slices.
