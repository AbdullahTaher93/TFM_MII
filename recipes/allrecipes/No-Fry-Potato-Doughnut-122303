Place potatoes in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil; cook until tender. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup cooking liquid; set liquid aside to cool to 70 degrees F-80 degrees F. Mash potatoes; set aside 1 cup to cool to room temperature. (Refrigerate any remaining mashed potatoes for another use.) In bread machine pan, place dough ingredients in order suggested by manufacturer, adding reserved cooking liquid and potatoes. Select dough setting (check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; some flour may remaining on top; add 1 to 2 tablespoons water or flour if needed). When cycle is completed, turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in an addition 1/4 to 1/2 cup flour if necessary. Roll out to 1/2-in. thickness. Cut with a 2-1/2-in. doughnut cutter. Place on greased baking sheets; cover and let rise until almost doubled, about 25 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until lightly browned. Combine sugar and cinnamon. Brush warm doughnuts with butter; dip in cinnamon-sugar.
