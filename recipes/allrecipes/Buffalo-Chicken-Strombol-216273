Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Stir the chicken, cheese and hot sauce in a medium bowl. Unfold the pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface. Roll the pastry sheet into a 10x14-inch rectangle. With the short side facing you, spoon the chicken mixture down the center of the pastry. Fold 2 opposite sides of the pastry to the center over the filling and press to seal. Place the pastry, seam-side down, onto a baking sheet. Tuck the ends under to seal. Bake for 30 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown. Cut the pastry in quarters to serve.
