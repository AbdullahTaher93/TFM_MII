Soak skewers in white wine for 10 to 15 minutes. Thread onto a skewer in the following order: beef-mushroom-onion, using 1 piece of each. Repeat 1 more time. Repeat with remaining skewers. Let sit for 10 to 20 minutes in refrigerator. Lightly brush skewers on each side with olive or salad oil and season to taste with salt and pepper. Place on a preheated medium-high grill and cook until beef is cooked to desired doneness, about 4 to 5 minutes per side.
