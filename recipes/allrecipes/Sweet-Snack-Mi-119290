In a large bowl, combine the cereal, pretzels and nuts; set aside. In a microwave-safe bowl, heat the chips at 70% power for 1 minute; stir. Microwave 30-45 seconds longer or until chips are melted; stir until smooth. Immediately pour over the cereal mixture and toss to coat evenly. Spread on waxed paper-lined baking sheets to cool; bread into pieces.
