Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). On a medium baking sheet, place the squash halves cut side up. Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until tender. In a medium saucepan, mix the brown sugar, white sugar and water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes. Mix the cranberries and port into the saucepan. Cook until the cranberriess begin to burst, about 5 minutes. Spoon the cranberries into the squash halves and serve.
