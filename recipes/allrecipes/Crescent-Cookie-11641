Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and chopped pecans. Stir in the margarine and vanilla until a dough forms. Knead by hand for a few turns. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough out to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into triangles, and roll from the square end up to the point. Bend into a crescent shape, place on an unprepared cookie sheet, and bake for 15 to 18 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar for decoration.
