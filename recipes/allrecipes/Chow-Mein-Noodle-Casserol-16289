Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet over medium high heat, saute the ground beef for 5 minutes. Add the onion and celery and saute for 5 more minutes. In a separate medium bowl, combine the almonds, rice, soup, water and soy sauce. Mix together well and add to the beef mixture. Place this into a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Top with chow mein noodles. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 minutes.
