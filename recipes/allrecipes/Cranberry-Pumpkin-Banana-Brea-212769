Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg into a large bowl. Beat the butter, brown sugar, pumpkin, cranberry sauce, egg, and banana with an electric mixer in a bowl until smooth. Gradually stir in the flour mixture, mixing until just combined. Pour batter into a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
