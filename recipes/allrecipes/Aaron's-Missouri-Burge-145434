Mix the ground beef, onion powder, honey mustard, garlic powder, crushed red pepper, salt, and brown sugar in a large bowl. Shape into 4 patties. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the burgers, turning occasionally, to desired temperature, 15 to 20 minutes for well done. Top each patty with a slice of Swiss cheese shortly before removing from the skillet; serve on hamburger buns.
