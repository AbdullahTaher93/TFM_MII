In a large skillet, cook onion and sugar in oil over medium-low heat until onion is tender and golden brown, about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Place the pork in a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Top with onion mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let stand for 5 minutes before slicing.
