In a small bowl, mix together lemon juice, garlic, Dannon(R) All Natural Plain Yogurt and mustard. Spread the mixture over the lamb, cover lamb and marinate in refrigerator for 3- 4 hours. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Sprinkle lamb with salt and pepper and place on a rack in a roasting pan. Bake for 15 minutes, turn the lamb, then roast for another 15 minutes. Reduce oven to 275 degrees and cook for 1-2 hours, or until internal temperature reads 130 degrees for medium. Remove from oven and cover loosely with foil. Let rest 15 minutes before carving. Temperature will continue to rise as the lamb rests.
