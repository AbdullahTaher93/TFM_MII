Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prepare the dressing by combining the fish sauce, lime juice, brown sugar and chopped chiles in a small bowl; set aside. Place the salmon filet on a baking sheet, and rub with olive oil. Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until easily flaked with a fork. Let cool for at least 15 minutes. Place salmon in a large bowl, and break into chunks. Add onion, tomato and basil; pour dressing over, and toss lightly until well mixed. Place equal amounts of the tuna salad mixture on 8 slices of bread, top with lettuce leaves, and top with remaining bread slices to form sandwiches.
