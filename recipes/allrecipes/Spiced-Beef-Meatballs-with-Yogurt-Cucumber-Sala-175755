In a medium bowl, combine beef, 1 tablespoon garlic, onion, feta, salt, cumin, black pepper, cayenne, and cinnamon. Mix to blend, then form mixture into 1-inch balls. Roll each ball in flour to coat; discard remaining flour. Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat and add olive oil. When oil is hot, put meatballs in pan in a single layer; do not crowd. If necessary, cook meatballs in two batches, using half of the oil per batch. Reduce heat to medium and cook, turning meatballs occasionally, until well-browned on all sides and no longer pink in center (cut to test), about 8 to 10 minutes total. Transfer meatballs to a plate, cover, and keep warm. Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, mix cucumber, yogurt, remaining 1 tablespoon garlic, lemon juice, cilantro, and mint. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve meatballs with warm pita and yogurt-cucumber salad.
