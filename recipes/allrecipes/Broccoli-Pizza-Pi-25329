Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes; drain. When cool enough to handle, slice potatoes. Meanwhile, place broccoli in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water, and cover. Cook until tender but still firm, about 2 to 6 minutes; drain. In a large bowl combine potatoes, broccoli, cheese, lemon juice, garlic, basil, oregano and parsley. On a pizza pan or baking sheet, roll out 1 pizza dough. Top with potato mixture; season with salt and pepper. Cover with second pizza dough; with moistened fingers, seal edges of dough together. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve with warmed pizza sauce.
