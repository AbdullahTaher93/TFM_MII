Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic. Cook and stir until the vegetables have softened, about 5 minutes. Add the ground beef, increase the heat to medium-high, and stir until crumbly and browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in the ketchup, chili sauce, water, parsley, vinegar, brown sugar, salt, pepper, mustard powder, chili powder, paprika, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
