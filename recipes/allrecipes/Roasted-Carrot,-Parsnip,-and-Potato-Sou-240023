Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Beat olive oil, Italian seasoning, and rosemary together in a bowl with a whisk; add potatoes, carrots, and parsnip and stir to coat. Pour vegetables into a baking dish. Roast vegetables in the preheated oven until tender and browning, about 30 minutes. Cool vegetables at room temperature until cool enough to handle. Put vegetables, chicken stock, and milk in a blender. Blend until smooth. Add more stock or milk to achieve your preferred texture. Pour soup into saucepan over medium heat; cook until hot, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
