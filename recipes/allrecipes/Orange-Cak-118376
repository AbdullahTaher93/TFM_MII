In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the orange juice, water, orange peel and almond extract; mix well. In another bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt; add to creamed mixture. Beat for 2 minutes. Pour into a greased 8-in. square baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Remove to a wire rack to cool completely. For the frosting, combine the confectioners' sugar, butter and enough orange juice to achieve spreading consistency. Frost cake.
