In a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over high heat, mix orange juice, sugar, ginger, garlic, and chili flakes to taste. Boil until reduced to 1 cup, about 10 minutes; stir often. While sauce boils, rinse chicken, pat dry, and cut into 1/2-inch chunks. When sauce is reduced, pour it into a small bowl and set aside. Clean frying pan and return it to high heat. When pan is hot, add chicken and oil. Stir until chicken is lightly browned and no longer pink in center of thickest part (cut to test), 4 to 5 minutes. Add orange sauce to chicken and stir just until boiling, 1 to 2 minutes. Spoon chicken and sauce onto rice. Sprinkle with green onion and season to taste with soy sauce.
