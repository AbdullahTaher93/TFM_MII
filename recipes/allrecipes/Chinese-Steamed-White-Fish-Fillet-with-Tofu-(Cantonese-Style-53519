Bring about 1 1/2 inches of water to boil in a pot fitted with a steamer basket. In a large bowl, stir together the chile, garlic, ginger, and black bean sauce. Stir in dark and white soy sauces, vegetable oil, sugar, and white pepper. In a small cup, mix together the cornstarch and water. Stir into the sauce. Cut fish fillets into thin strips, add to bowl, and coat well. When water in steamer has reached a boil, carefully place the tofu cubes in a single layer in the basket, and steam, covered, for 2 minutes. Place the fish strips on top of the tofu; cover and steam for another 3 minutes. Remove and garnish with chopped green onion. Serve with steamed white rice and stir-fried or steamed Asian vegetables.
