In a large bowl, soak the raisins in water for 5 minutes; drain. Add rice, ham and onions. In a small bowl or jar with tight-fitting lid, combine oil, vinegar, salt and pepper; mix well. Pour over rice mixture and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Serve on lettuce; garnish with pecans.
