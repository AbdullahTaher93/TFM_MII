Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Mix ground beef, tomato sauce, tomato paste, celery, diced tomatoes, onion, black beans, hot pepper sauce, and chili powder together in a slow cooker crock. Cook on High, stirring frequently, for 1 hour. Reduce heat to Low and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, for 2 hours.
