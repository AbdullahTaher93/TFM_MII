In a large bowl, add the chicken, lemon juice, and olive oil. Toss to coat and let stand for 30 minutes. Preheat the grill. Remove the chicken from the marinade and cut into 1-inch pieces. Discard the used marinade. Arrange the chicken on four wooden skewers alternately with the red onion. Grill the skewers for 5 to 7 minutes on each side or until the chicken is crispy and an internal temperature of 165 degrees F has been reached. Lightly toast the pitas for 1 to 2 minutes or until lightly golden and heated through. Place a skewer on each pita, then top with tomatoes. Drizzle each pita with 2 tablespoons of Hidden Valley(R)Original Ranch(R)Cucumber Dressing.
