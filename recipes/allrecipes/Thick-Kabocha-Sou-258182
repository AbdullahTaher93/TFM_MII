Combine cornmeal, flour, seasoned salt, and pepper in a bowl. Dredge onion slices in cornmeal mixture. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook breaded onion, turning occasionally until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add kabocha squash, sweet potato, carrot, garlic, and bay leaf; cook until kabocha squash is tender, about 10 minutes. Drain most of the water; discard bay leaf. Mash kabocha squash mixture with a potato masher, adding soy milk, until mixture is the consistency of a thick soup. Stir in garam masala, salt, and pepper. Garnish with fried onions.
