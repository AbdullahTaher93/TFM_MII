Heat oil in skillet on medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion in the hot oil until it begins to soften, about 5 minutes; add garlic and continue to cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir grated tempeh into onion mixture; cook and stir until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Pour vegetable broth over the tempeh mixture and reduce heat to low; season with taco seasoning, oregano, and ground red pepper. Cook, stirring regularly, until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes.
