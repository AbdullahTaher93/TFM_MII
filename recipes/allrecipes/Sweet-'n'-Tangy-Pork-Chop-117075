Sprinkle pork chops with salt and pepper. In a large nonstick skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, brown chops for 3 minutes on each side. In a small bowl, combine the beer or broth, ketchup and brown sugar. Pour over pork; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 10-15 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove chops and keep warm. Simmer sauce until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 5 minutes. Serve with pork chops.
