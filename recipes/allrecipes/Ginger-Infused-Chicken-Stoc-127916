Put chicken, ginger, scallions, and 5 quarts of water in a stockpot. Bring to a boil over high heat, skim off and discard any foam, then reduce heat to low. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Simmer, uncovered, occasionally skimming off any foam, until stock is reduced by about 2 quarts, about 3 hours. (Take care to keep stock from boiling. Disturbing the ingredients will cause the stock to be cloudy and keep it from developing a clear, clean, rich flavor.) After 1 1/2 hours, transfer chicken legs and breast from stock to a cutting board. Remove meat from bones, return bones to stock, then finely shred meat, using two forks to pull meat apart. Wrap meat in wax paper and refrigerate. Strain stock through a coffee-filter- lined sieve, removing fat in the process. Discard solids. Allow the stock to cool, then refrigerate it.
