Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for direct heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is directly under the food). For charcoal grill: Before you put the grill over the hot coals, brush it with a light coat of oil. For gas grill: When hot, brush grill with a light coat of oil. Cut pineapple crosswise into 1/2inch thick slices; cut out the core from each slice and discard. In a small bowl, mix brown sugar and lime juice; brush onto both sides of pineapple slices with a pastry brush. Lay pineapple slices on lightly oiled grill over a solid bed of medium hot coals or medium high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand just above grill level for only 3 to 4 seconds). Keep charcoal grill uncovered; close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning once with a wide spatula, until pineapple is hot and tinged with brown on both sides, about 8 minutes total. With spatula, transfer 1 or 2 pineapple slices to each of 4 dessert bowls; top with a scoop of ice cream and sprinkle equally with coconut and peanuts, if using.
