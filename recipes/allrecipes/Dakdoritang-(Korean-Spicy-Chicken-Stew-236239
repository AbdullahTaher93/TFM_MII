Stir water, soy sauce, rice wine, red chili pepper paste, red chili pepper flakes, honey, sugar, and black pepper together in a large pot; add chicken and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, place a lid on the pot, and cook at a simmer until the chicken is browned, about 15 minutes. Stir potatoes, carrots, onion, garlic, and ginger into the chicken mixture; replace cover atop the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove cover and cook until the chicken is tender and the liquid has thickened slightly, about 10 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into a piece of chicken near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Stir scallions, sesame oil, and sesame seeds into the stew and remove pot from heat.
