Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Brown meat; drain. Add seasoning mix; prepare as directed on package. Stir in 1/2 cup of the sour cream. Spread beans down center of each tortilla; top with meat mixture and 1/2 cup of the cheese. Fold bottom and top of each tortilla about 1 inch over filling. Fold each side about 2/3 over filling to completely enclose filling. Place, seam sides down, in greased 13x9-inch baking dish; cover. Bake 25 minutes. Uncover; sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake an additional 5 minutes or until cheese is melted. Serve each with about 1 Tbsp. sour cream and about 1 Tbsp. salsa.
