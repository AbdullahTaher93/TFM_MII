Place tomato halves, cut side up, in a 9- by 13-inch baking pan. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, stir together 3 teaspoons of the oil, the garlic, and parsley; pat mixture evenly over cut sides of tomatoes, then drizzle with 2 more teaspoons of the oil. Bake in a 425 degrees F oven until tops of tomatoes are lightly browned (about 20 minutes). Meanwhile, bring about 3 quarts water to a boil in a covered 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat; stir in pasta and cook, uncovered, until just tender to bite (8 to 10 minutes). Or cook pasta according to package directions. Also while tomatoes bake, whirl bread in a food processor or blender until coarse crumbs form. Spread crumbs in an 8-inch baking pan and drizzle with remaining 3 teaspoons oil; stir well to coat completely with oil. Place in oven alongside tomatoes and bake until crumbs are crisp and golden brown (about 8 minutes). Remove from oven and let cool. Drain pasta well and return to pan. Add tomatoes, half the bread crumbs, and the basil; mix gently using 2 forks. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide pasta mixture between 4 warm dinner plates and sprinkle with remaining bread crumbs. Offer cheese to add to taste.
