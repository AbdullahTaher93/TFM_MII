Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch casserole dish. In a large mixing bowl combine tater tots, soup, onion, sour cream, cheese, garlic powder, seasoning salt and softened butter; mix well. Transfer to casserole dish. In a medium bowl combine cereal and melted butter; spread over casserole. Sprinkle the top with parmesan cheese (use more or less according to your taste) and paprika. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until browned. (Note: It's a good idea to put a cookie sheet under the casserole dish, in case it bubbles over while cooking.)
