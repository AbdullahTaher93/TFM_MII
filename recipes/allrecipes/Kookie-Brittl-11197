Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease one 15x10x1 inch pan (jelly roll pan). Cream butter and salt and vanilla. Beat in the sugar until light and fluffy. Mix in the flour until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips and pecans. Pat dough with hands into the prepared pan. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 25 minutes or until light brown at the edges. Cool in pan on a wire rack. Once cool, break with hands into pieces.
