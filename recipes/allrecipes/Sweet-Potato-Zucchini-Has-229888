Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir sweet potatoes into butter to coat. Add brown sugar and stir until integrated. Increase heat to medium-high; cook and stir until brown sugar caramelizes on surface of the sweet potato cubes, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Stir zucchini into the sweet potato mixture; cook and stir until zucchini is tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain excess liquid to serve.
