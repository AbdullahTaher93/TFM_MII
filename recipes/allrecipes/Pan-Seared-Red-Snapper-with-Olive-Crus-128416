In a shallow bowl, combine the bread crumbs, oregano, olives, Parmesan, and pepper. Firmly press the fillets into the mixture to create a uniform coating on both sides. Coat the top of the fillets with nonstick spray. Coat a large cast-iron skillet with nonstick spray. Set over medium-high heat until hot. Add the fillets and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until the fish is opaque and flakes easily when tested with a fork.
