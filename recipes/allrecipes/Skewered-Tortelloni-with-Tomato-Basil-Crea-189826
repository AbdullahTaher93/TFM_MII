Cook tortelloni according to package directions. Drain well, then place in a bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon of pesto sauce. Put 1 tortelloni on the end of a small wooden skewer (about 6 inches long) and place on a warmed ovenproof platter; cover and keep warm. Repeat to skewer remaining tortelloni. To make dipping sauce, heat marinara sauce, half and half, and remaining pesto in a microwave oven or over medium heat, stirring often, until hot. Transfer sauce to a small bowl and set on platter beside tortelloni.
