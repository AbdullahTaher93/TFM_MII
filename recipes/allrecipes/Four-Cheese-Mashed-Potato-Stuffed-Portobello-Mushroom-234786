Preheat oven to 350 degrees F or grill to 400 degrees F. Clean the mushrooms and rub with oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and place on a foil lined baking tray. Bake for 5 minutes until tender. Or if grilling, turn mushrooms once or twice while cooking on the grill until tender. While mushrooms are cooking, prepare Idahoan Four Cheese Mashed Potatoes according to package instructions. Fold in the cheddar cheese and the peppers. When mushrooms are cooked, sprinkle with a bit more salt and pepper and stuff with the mashed potatoes. Top with the scallions and serve hot.
