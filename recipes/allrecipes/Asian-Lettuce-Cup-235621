Cook the turkey in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat. Add the carrot, garlic, ginger and red pepper to the skillet and cook and stir for 1 minute. Add 1/2 cup broth and heat to a boil. Stir the remaining broth and the cornstarch in a small bowl until the mixture is smooth. Add the cornstarch mixture to the skillet. Cook and stir for 2 minutes or until the mixture boils and thickens. Stir in the cilantro and lime juice just before serving. Spoon about 1/4 cup turkey mixture into each lettuce leaf. Sprinkle with the green onions and peanuts.
