To make rub, combine all ingredients in a large bowl. Mix well with a fork. Reserve 1/4 cup of the rub to use in the barbecue sauce. To make sauce, combine all ingredients in a large Mason jar, stirring well. Cover with tight-fitting lid and give it one more good shake. Place in refrigerator overnight. Place pork rub in a large casserole dish. Using a fork, pierce the pork several times all over. Rub the spice blend into the pork, covering all surfaces. Wrap rubbed pork tightly in plastic and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight. At cooking time, unwrap the pork and place in a slow-cooker. Pour 1 cup of the Barbecue Sauce on the pork, covering all surfaces. Cover and cook until tender, 9 to 11 hours on Low or 5 to 7 hours on High. Transfer pork to a large, deep, wide casserole dish and cool for 15 to 20 minutes. Using two large forks, shred the pork into bite-size pieces, discarding excess fat. Cover to keep warm. Skim any fat from the liquid in the pot. Transfer 2 to 3 tablespoons to a bowl and stir in the remaining barbecue sauce. Stir well and add more of the braising liquid if you prefer a thinner sauce. Warm buns in the oven at 400 degrees, turning over once, just until slightly toasty. Pile pulled pork onto buns, top with some of the Barbecue Sauce and some Tangy Slaw (recipe below) and enjoy. For the slaw: In a large bowl, whisk together vinegar, oil, brown sugar, garlic, salt and pepper. Add cabbage, carrots, cucumber and parsley, mixing well. Allow to sit, loosely covered with plastic, for about 30 minutes. Toss once before serving, adjusting seasonings, if desired.
