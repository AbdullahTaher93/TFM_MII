Boil 2 cups broth and vermouth in large saucepan until reduced by half. Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside. In the same skillet over medium high heat, melt 3 tablespoons butter. Add flour; mix and cook until golden brown. Add broth mixture and boil until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Add bacon; season with salt and pepper. Remove pork from oven and fill cavity with stuffing; cover stuffing with foil. Transfer remaining stuffing to prepared baking dish.
