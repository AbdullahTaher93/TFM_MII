Bring water to a boil in a large pot; add salt. Pour cavatappi into the boiling water and cook until tender but firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes; drain and rinse cavatappi. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in the hot oil until onion is softened and transparent, 5 to 10 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high and stir ground beef into onion mixture. Cook and stir until ground beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease and return skillet to heat. Mix tomato sauce, chili powder, and cumin into ground beef mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until tomato sauce is heated through, about 3 minutes. Stir cavatappi into meat sauce until evenly coated; add black beans and pepper. Cook and stir over medium-low heat until flavors have blended, about 5 minutes.
