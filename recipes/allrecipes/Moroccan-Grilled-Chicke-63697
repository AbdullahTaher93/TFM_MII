Combine the oil, oregano, allspice, cumin, cloves, and garlic in a large bowl. Add the chicken breasts and cover with the olive oil mixture. Cook on a preheated grill over medium heat for about 30 minutes or until the juices run clear when the chicken is pierced. Remove from the grill and keep warm. Meanwhile, prepare the couscous according to package directions. When the couscous is ready, divide it among 4 plates. Thinly slice each chicken breast and fan over the couscous on each plate. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of the sauce over each chicken breast.
