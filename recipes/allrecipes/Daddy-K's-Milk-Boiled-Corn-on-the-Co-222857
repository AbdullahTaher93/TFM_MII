Bring water to a boil in a large stock pot; stir in milk, sugar, cream, and butter until sugar dissolves and butter melts. Gently place ears of corn into the mixture and reduce heat to low. Simmer corn until tender, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from the liquid with tongs and set aside under aluminum foil until serving time.
