In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, orange juice, sugar, wasabi powder and ginger. Pour sesame oil into a shallow dish and add the asparagus. Sprinkle with pepper. Roll asparagus in oil to coat. Grill asparagus over medium heat 4 to 6 minutes, or until crisp tender. Place shredded cabbage on a serving platter. Arrange grilled asparagus on top, and pour dressing over asparagus and cabbage.
