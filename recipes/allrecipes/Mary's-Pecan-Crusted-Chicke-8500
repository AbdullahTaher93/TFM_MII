In a small bowl, mix the eggs with the milk. Put aside. In a medium bowl, mix together flour, seasoning, cinnamon, pecans, sugar, and salt and pepper. Dip the chicken in the egg mix, and press in the pecan mix. Fry in hot olive oil until golden, about 5 minutes per side. Check to make sure pecans don't burn. Place on paper towel to drain.
