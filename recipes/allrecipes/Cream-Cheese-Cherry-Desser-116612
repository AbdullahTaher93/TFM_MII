In a large bowl, combine the cereal, brown sugar, walnuts, coconut and butter; set aside 1 cup for topping. Press remaining crumb mixture into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish; set aside. In a mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Pour over the crust. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until center is almost set. Cool completely on a wire rack. Spread pie filling over cream cheese layer; top with whipped topping. Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.
