In a 12-inch nonstick skillet, bring 1/4 cup water and butter to a boil over high. Add snap peas; cover, and cook until bright green, about 2 minutes. Remove lid; reduce heat to medium. Continue cooking, tossing occasionally, until peas are crisp-tender and water has evaporated, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Toss with mint leaves; season with coarse salt and ground pepper.
