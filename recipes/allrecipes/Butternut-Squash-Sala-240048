Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prepare a roasting pan with cooking spray. Spread squash cubes into the prepared roasting pan. Spray cubes with cooking spray and season with salt and pepper. Cover squash with aluminum foil. Roast squash for 30 minutes, remove aluminum foil, and continue roasting beginning to brown, about 15 minutes. Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat. Toast almonds in skillet until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Toss squash, lettuce, bell pepper, and carrot together in a large bowl; top with almonds and goat cheese.
