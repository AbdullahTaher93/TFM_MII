Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Stir in cold water and vegetable oil until dough comes together into a ball. Set dough on a floured surface. Pinch off ten pieces the size of golf balls, roll into balls, and flatten each into a round. Make a small hole in the center of each round. Fill a deep skillet with oil to 3/4 inch; heat over medium-high heat. Add dough rounds in batches and fry until golden brown, about 20 seconds per side. Drain on paper towels.
