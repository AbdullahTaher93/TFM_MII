Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil and coat with cooking spray. Stir together nuts, brown sugar and honey (or corn syrup) in a small bowl until the nuts are well coated. Spread out on the prepared baking sheet. Bake on the center rack, stirring occasionally, until the nuts are fragrant and lightly brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cool for 15 minutes. Using your fingers, crumble the praline into small pieces.
