Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour potato chips into a shallow dish. Beat egg and milk together in a separate shallow dish. Dip chicken cubes in egg mixture and press into potato chips until evenly coated; transfer coated chicken to a baking sheet. Drizzle coated chicken with melted butter. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the coating is golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes.
