In a skillet, brown the chops in oil; remove and set aside. Add the water, vinegar and cabbage to the drippings; cover and cook over medium-low heat for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in the applesauce, cranberry sauce and caraway seeds. Pour into a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish; top with pork chops. Cover and bake a 350 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until pork is tender.
