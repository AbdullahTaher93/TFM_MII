Combine Italian seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, celery seed, parsley, thyme, basil, oregano, salt, black pepper, and bay leaf in a small bowl. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain. Heat olive oil and butter together in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir carrot, celery, and onion until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, zucchini, and Italian seasoning mixture; stir to combine. Stir tomatoes and their juice, tomato sauce, three bean salad, green beans, and chicken stock into seasoned vegetable mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors are blended, about 30 minutes. Stir in elbow macaroni before serving.
