Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir onion, lemon juice, garlic, and jalapeno pepper into skillet; bring to a simmer and cook until onions soften, about 3 minutes. Stir eggplant, cumin, paprika, chili powder, black pepper, and seasoned salt into onion mixture; drizzle remaining olive oil over the top. Cook, stirring occasionally, until eggplant reduces in size and softens, about 15 minutes. Spoon eggplant mixture into tortilla shells.
