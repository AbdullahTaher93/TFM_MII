Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. For stuffing, melt the 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat in an extra-large skillet. Cook onion, garlic, and mushrooms in hot butter for 5 to 7 minutes or until onion is tender and most of the liquid is evaporated. Add spinach, thyme, the 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the 1/8 teaspoon pepper to skillet; cook for 2 minutes or just until spinach is wilted. Stir in cherries and Parmesan cheese. Trim fat from chops. Make a pocket in each chop by cutting horizontally from the fat side almost to the bone on the opposite side. Divide stuffing among pockets in chops. If necessary, secure the openings with wooden toothpicks. Sprinkle chops with additional salt and pepper. Melt the 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat in the same skillet. Cook chops in hot butter for 4 minutes or until browned, turning once. Place chops in a single layer in a baking dish just large enough to hold chops. Bake, uncovered, for 30 to 40 minutes or until juices run clear and chops register 145 degrees F on a meat thermometer. [Cleaning tip: Once the stove top is cool, wipe up any oil splatters or spills with Clorox(R) Disinfecting Wipes*.]
