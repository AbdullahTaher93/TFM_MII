Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat. Let cool until lukewarm. In a large bowl, stir together yeast, warm water, and 1 teaspoon sugar. Set aside to proof. Add milk, 2 2/3 tablespoons sugar, salt, butter or margarine, flour, and soup mix to the yeast in the bowl. Combine until dough forms, and then turn out on a lightly floured surface. Knead until dough is elastic. Oil a large bowl. Place the dough in the bowl, and turn several times to coat. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth, and set aside in a warm place to rise for 30 minutes. Divide dough in half. Shape into loaves, and place into two greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 inch bread pans. Set aside to rise for 30 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 40 minutes. Loaf will sound hollow when done.
