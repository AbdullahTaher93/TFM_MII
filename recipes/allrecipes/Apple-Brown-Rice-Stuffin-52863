Prepare rice according to package directions, using 3 1/4 cup apple juice for the liquid. Cook diced apple, chopped onion, sliced celery, raisins, poultry seasoning, thyme, and pepper in margarine in a large skillet until the vegetables are tender-crisp. Stir in the cooked brown rice, bran, slivered almonds, and remaining apple juice. Use as stuffing for poultry or pork roast, or bake at 350 degrees for 35 minutes.
