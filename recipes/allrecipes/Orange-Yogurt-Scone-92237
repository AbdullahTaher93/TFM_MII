In a bowl or food processor, mix or whirl together flour, 1/3 cup sugar, baking powder, soda, and salt. Cut in or whirl in butter until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Mix yogurt, peel, and juice; add to flour mixture and stir just until evenly moistened. Mound dough on an oiled 12- by 15-inch baking sheet. With well-floured hands, pat mound into an even 9-inch round. With a floured knife, cut through dough to make 8 wedges; leave in place on pan. Sprinkle with remaining sugar. Bake in a 375 degrees F oven until scones are golden brown, about 25 minutes. Serve hot, or slide onto a rack and let cool until warm. Cut into wedges.
