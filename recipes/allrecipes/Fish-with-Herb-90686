Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Rinse fish, pat dry, and arrange, overlapping slightly, in a shallow 9- by 13-inch casserole. Pour wine and broth over fish; sprinkle with shallots and chopped herbs. Lay lemon slices and herb sprigs on fish. Bake, uncovered, until fish is opaque but still moist-looking in thickest part (cut to test), about 15 minutes. Tilt dish, and ladle or siphon pan juices into a 1- to 2-quart pan; keep fish warm. Boil juices over high heat, uncovered, until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 5 minutes. Mix cornstarch with 1 tablespoon water, and stir into pan juices. Stir over high heat until sauce boils. Pour a little sauce over fish; pour remainder into a small bowl. Season portions with sauce, salt, and pepper to taste.
