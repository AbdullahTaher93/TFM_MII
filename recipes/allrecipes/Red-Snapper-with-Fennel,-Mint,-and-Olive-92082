Rinse fennel. Cut off stalks; trim and discard base and any discolored or bruised parts of fennel head. Then cut fennel into matchstick-size pieces. In a bowl, combine fennel, 1 tablespoon of the oil, onion, olives, mint, lemon juice, and lemon peel. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Rinse fish and pat dry. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a wide frying pan over medium-high heat. Add fish, a few pieces at a time (do not crowd pan). Cover and cook, turning once, until just opaque but still moist in thickest part; cut to test (about 8 minutes). With a wide spatula, transfer fish to a platter or individual plates. Top with fennel mixture.
