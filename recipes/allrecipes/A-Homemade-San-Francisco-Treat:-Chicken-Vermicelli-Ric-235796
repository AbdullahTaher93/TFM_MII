Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook rice and vermicelli in hot butter until browned, about 3 minutes. Pour water over the rice mixture. Stir chicken bouillon, parsley, garlic powder, and onion powder into the water; bring to a boil, place a cover on the saucepan, reduce heat to low, and cook until the water has absorbed into the rice and pasta, about 25 minutes.
