For maple butter, in a small saucepan, bring maple syrup to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 2-3 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in butter until melted. Refrigerate until mixture is spreadable. In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Combine the egg, maple syrup, milk and butter. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in hazelnuts. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 375 degrees F for 18-22 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm with maple butter.
