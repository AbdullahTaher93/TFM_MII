In large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and chicken in hot oil and cook, tossing frequently until chicken is browned, 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, thyme, pepper, and broth. Bring to a boil. Stir in rice and lemon juice. Return to a boil. Reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Add vegetables. Cover and simmer until liquid is absorbed, chicken is cooked through, and vegetables are tender, 3 to 5 minutes.
