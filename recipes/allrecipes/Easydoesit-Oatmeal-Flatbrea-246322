Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Combine 1 cup water and 1/4 cup quick-cooking oats together in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on full power until mixture is thick and creamy, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Mix oatmeal, flour, milk, vegetable oil, and salt together in a bowl. Spread evenly on a baking sheet; top with bits of butter. Bake in the preheated oven until brown on top, about 30 minutes.
