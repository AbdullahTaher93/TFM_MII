In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add extract. Combine flour, baking powder and salt; add to creamed mixture and mix well. Spread half of the batter onto a greased baking sheet, forming an 11-in. x 5-in. rectangle. Repeat with remaining batter on a second baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15 minutes. Remove from baking sheets; cut into 1-in. slices. Place with cut side down on baking sheets. Bake 15 minutes longer or until lightly browned. Cool on wire racks.
