Spread peanut butter on both slices of bread. Sandwich the honey and banana between the two slices. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Lightly coat the bread with butter-flavored cooking spray just before putting the bread on the skillet. Grill each side of the sandwich for 2 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve warm.
