Cake: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Sift powdered sugar generously over a 12"x17" area of a clean thin kitchen towel. Grease a 15x10x1 inch jelly roll pan. Line pan with waxed paper. Grease only the surface of the wax paper. Sift together flour, baking powder and salt; set aside. Beat the eggs in medium bowl until frothy, about 3 minutes. Gradually add sugar, water, vanilla and sifted flour mixture, scraping bowl occasionally. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake for 9 to 11 minutes or until toothpick inserted near center comes out clean. Immediately loosen the cake around the edges and invert cake onto the prepared towel. Carefully remove paper. Roll the cake beginning at the narrow end. Cool on a wire rack for 45 minutes. Filling: Beat cream cheese, powdered sugar, peanut butter and almond extract in a medium bowl until well combined. Unroll cake; first spread peanut butter cream evenly to edges of the cake. Reserve 2 tablespoons fruit in a resealable plastic bag for garnish; spread remaining fruit over peanut butter. Roll cake; wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate several hours before serving. Sprinkle with powdered sugar before serving, if desired.
