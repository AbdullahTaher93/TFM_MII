Cupcake Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line muffin pans with baking cups. Empty contents of large pouch into a large bowl. Blend cake mix, water, oil and eggs in a large bowl at low speed until moistened (about 30 seconds). Beat at medium speed for 2 minutes. Spoon batter evenly into the 12 cupcake liners (approximately 1/2 full). Bake in centre of oven at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) for 18-23 minutes. Cupcakes are done when toothpick inserted in centre comes out clean. Cool 5-10 minutes in pan, then remove and place on wire rack to cool completely. Frosting Instructions: Mix softened butter with electric mixer on high for 1 minute or until light and fluffy. Scrape. Slowly add frosting mix to butter while mixing on low speed for an additional 1 minute. Scrape. Add water. Start mixing on low. As frosting starts to come together, gradually increase speed to high. This step may take up to 3 minutes. Mix on high for an additional 3 minutes. Fill provided pastry bag with frosting (place bag in tall glass to make filling with frosting easier). Cut approximately 1/2 inch (1.5 cm) from the tip of the pastry bag. Insert cut pastry bag into top of cupcake and squeeze gently to fill cupcake with approximately 1 tablespoon of frosting. Slowly remove pastry bag and swirl approximately 1 tablespoon of frosting on top.
