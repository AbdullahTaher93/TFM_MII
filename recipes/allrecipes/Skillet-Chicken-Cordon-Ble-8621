In a 10 inch skillet over medium high heat cook the chicken breasts in the butter for 10 minutes or until browned. Remove chicken and set aside. In the same skillet add the wine and stir to deglaze the pan. Add the soup, cheese and ham. Heat to boiling, stirring often. Return chicken to skillet. Reduce heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 to 7 minutes or until chicken is completely cooked, stirring occasionally. Serve over hot cooked egg noodles if desired.
