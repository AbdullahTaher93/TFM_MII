Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix ham, egg, mayonnaise, and half the breadcrumbs together in a bowl; shape into 6 meatballs. Spread the remaining breadcrumbs onto a plate; roll the balls in the breadcrumbs to coat. Arrange the balls in a baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
