Toss chicken with thyme. In large skillet over medium-high heat, melt margarine. Add chicken and garlic; cook 5 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink inside. Add 1-1/3 cups water and milk; bring to a boil. Slowly stir in pasta, Special Seasonings, salami and olives; reduce heat to medium. Gently boil uncovered, 4 to 5 minutes until pasta is tender, stirring occasionally. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
