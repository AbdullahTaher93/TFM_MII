In a medium bowl, use a fork to mix together oats, walnuts, brown sugar, flour, cinnamon and ginger. Drizzle with butter and combine to form a coarse crumb mixture. Set aside. In a large bowl, toss apples with sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon and ginger. Arrange apples in prepared piecrust. Sprinkle walnut streusel over top, completely covering the apples. Bake pie on a baking sheet, covered loosely with foil in centre of a 375 degrees F oven for 50 minutes. Remove foil and bake until streusel is golden and apples are tender, about 10 minutes more. Let sit 15 minutes before serving.
