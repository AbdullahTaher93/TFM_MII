Bring broth and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, about 15 minutes. Combine cucumber, tomatoes, parsley, green onions, mint, and garlic in a large bowl. Add quinoa, olive oil, lemon juice, and salt to cucumber mixture; toss to combine. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until flavors combine, at least 1 hour.
