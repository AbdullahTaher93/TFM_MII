Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Cook and stir olive oil and garlic in a large skillet over high heat just until brown and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add chicken and mushrooms; stir to coat with garlic and olive oil. Cook chicken until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in cream of mushroom soup; gradually add 1/2 cup of water about 1 tablespoon at a time, adding enough to make sauce light and creamy. Reduce heat to medium-low heat and gently fold pasta into the chicken and sauce until coated. Add garlic salt and red pepper to taste; remove from heat and serve.
