Place beans in a large pot and cover with plenty of water. Cover pot with a lid and soak beans for 8 hours or overnight. Drain and fill pot with fresh water. Cook beans over medium heat until tender, about 1 hour. Drain beans, reserving the water for later use. Place beans, ketchup, ham, 1 1/2 cup water, brown sugar, molasses, onion powder, mustard, salt, Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, and 1 cup reserved bean water in a slow cooker. Add more bean water as needed if beans get too dry. Cook on Low for 7 to 9 hours.
