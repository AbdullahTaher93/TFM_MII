In a large saucepan, combine the chili and soup; stir in 1/4 cup cilantro, jalapeno and garlic. Add hot dogs. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 35-40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the remaining cilantro. To assemble, place hot dogs in buns; top with chili sauce, olives, onion and chips.
