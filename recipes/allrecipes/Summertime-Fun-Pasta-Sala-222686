Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and cool. Mix tuna and cucumber together in a salad bowl; stir in cooked bow-tie pasta and ranch dressing. Chill at least 1 hour.
