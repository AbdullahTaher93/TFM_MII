Place cauliflower and carrots in a large pot of lightly salted water; bring to a boil until vegetables are soft, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and transfer vegetables to a large bowl. Mash sour cream, vinegar, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and butter into cauliflower and carrots by hand or using a food processor, until desired consistency.
