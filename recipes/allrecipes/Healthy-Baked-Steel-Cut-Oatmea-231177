Bring milk to a boil in a saucepan; immediately reduce heat to medium-low. Stir oats and vanilla into the milk. Stirring occasionally, cook at a simmer until the oats are soft, about 20 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly. Mix bananas, eggs, and applesauce in a large bowl. Mix baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl; stir into the banana mixture. Add oats mixture to the bowl; stir. Fold raisins through the oat mixture; pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover dish with plastic wrap; refrigerate 8 hours to overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove plastic wrap from baking dish and bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 45 to 60 minutes.
