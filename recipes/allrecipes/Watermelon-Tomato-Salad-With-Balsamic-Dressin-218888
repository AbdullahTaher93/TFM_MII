Place watermelon cubes, tomato, sweet onion, and green onion into a salad bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and sweetener until the sweetener has dissolved. Pour the dressing over the salad, and lightly toss; sprinkle with salt and black pepper to taste. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes before serving.
