Bring water to a boil in a small pot. Crack eggs into a big coffee mug or jar; season with salt. Whisk eggs, slowly pouring in 1 cup boiling water. Remove bubbles from the top of the eggs using a spoon. Lower coffee mug or jar gently into the pot of boiling water. Cover mug with a small plate. Cover pot with a lid and cook until eggs are set, about 10 minutes. Garnish with carrot and green onion.
