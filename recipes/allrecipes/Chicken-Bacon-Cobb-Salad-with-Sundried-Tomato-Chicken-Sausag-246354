Place eggs in a saucepan and cover completely with cold water. Bring water to a boil. Cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and quarter. Meanwhile, prepare a medium skillet with cooking spray, pan brown or grill the al fresco Sundried Tomato Chicken Sausages over medium high heat. Turn frequently while cooking. Slice sausages on the diagonal 1/4-inch thick. Place 6 slices of al fresco fully cooked chicken bacon on a microwave safe plate and heat in the microwave for 30 to 50 seconds, or until desired crispness is achieved. To assemble, place chopped lettuce in a large bowl. Evenly divide and arrange chicken sausage, blue cheese, chicken bacon, eggs, avocado and tomatoes in a row on top of the lettuce.
