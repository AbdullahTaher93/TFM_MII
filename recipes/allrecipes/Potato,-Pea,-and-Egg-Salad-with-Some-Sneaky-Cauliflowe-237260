Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water; cool under cold running water, about 5 minutes. Place potatoes into a large pot, cover with salted water, and bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender but still firm, about 10 minutes. Remove potatoes with a slotted spoon, reserving hot potato water; place potatoes into a bowl to cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes. Place peas and cauliflower florets in a metal strainer; place strainer into the hot potato water to blanch vegetables, about 3 minutes. Drain; allow to cool to room temperature, about 10 minutes. Peel and chop eggs; place into bowl with potatoes. Place peas, cauliflower, salad dressing, green onions, Dijon mustard, parsley, and pickle relish; stir to coat all ingredients evenly with dressing. Season with salt and pepper; chill in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
