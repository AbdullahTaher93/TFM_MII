In a small bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, and tomato paste until foamy; add salmon and broccoli. Coat a 10-inch skillet with nonstick spray and heat it over medium heat for 30 seconds. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Cover; let cook 8 to 10 minutes, until the eggs are firm. Remove the lid and sprinkle the omelet with cheese. Cut the omelet into four pieces and place each on a slice of toast. Top each with 1/2 teaspoon horseradish.
