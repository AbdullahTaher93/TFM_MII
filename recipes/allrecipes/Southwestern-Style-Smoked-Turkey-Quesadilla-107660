Lightly brush one side of each tortilla with oil. Lay tortilla, oiled side down, on a clean surface. Top four tortillas with equal amounts of cheese, turkey, green onion, and jalapeno pepper. Cover with remaining tortillas, oiled side up. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Place quesadillas in skillet and saute 2 minutes or until lightly browned and cheese begins to melt. Turn and cook 2 minutes longer or until golden brown. Cut in quarters or eighths. Serve with salsa.
