Season the steaks with lemon pepper, onion powder and garlic powder on both sides. Wrap in plastic wrap and marinate for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator. Preheat the grill for medium-high heat and allow the steaks to come to room temperature. Unwrap steaks and place on the preheated grill. Cook to your desired degree of doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium rare. Allow steaks to rest for a few minutes before serving.
