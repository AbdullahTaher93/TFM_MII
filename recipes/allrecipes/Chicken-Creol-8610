Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the garlic, onion, celery and bell pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender (about 4 minutes). Add the tomatoes, bay leaf, salt and cayenne pepper. Cook this Creole sauce 3 minutes longer, stirring often. Arrange the chicken breasts in an 8 x 11 inch baking dish. Pour the Creole sauce over the chicken. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, until the chicken is tender and white throughout.
