In a 2- to 3-quart pan, mix 7/8 cup of the sugar (reserve remaining sugar), gelatin, cinnamon, and ginger. Add 1/2 cup of the milk; stir often over medium-high heat until milk is steaming. Add remaining milk, sour cream, pumpkin, and liqueur (if using). Set pan in ice water and stir often until mixture just begins to set, about 20 minutes (if mixture gets too stiff, stir over low heat to soften). In a small bowl, combine whipping cream and the reserved 2 tablespoons sugar. Beat with a mixer on high speed until soft peaks form; cover and chill 1/3 cup of the cream until serving. Gently fold remaining cream into pumpkin mixture. Divide mousse evenly among 6 to 8 glasses or ramekins (about 1-cup size). Lightly cover; chill until mousse is set, at least 4 hours or up to 1 day. Garnish each with reserved cream and crushed hazelnuts.
