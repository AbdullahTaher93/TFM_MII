Place the sun-dried tomatoes in a bowl and cover with boiling water. Let plump for 10 minutes. On a cutting board, mash the garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt with the side of a knife until it's a smooth paste. Transfer to a bowl and whisk in 1 tablespoon oil, the lemon juice and crushed red pepper. Drain the tomatoes and finely chop. Add to the bowl with the dressing, along with the olives; mix well. Spread the tomato mixture on half the bread. Layer on cheese slices, some pepper, then the tomato slices; season with salt and vinegar. Top with several basil leaves. Brush the remaining 1 tablespoon oil over the remaining bread slices and set them on the sandwiches.
