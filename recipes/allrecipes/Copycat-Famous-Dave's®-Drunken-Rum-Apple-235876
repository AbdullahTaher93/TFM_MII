Stir apples, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a large saucepan. Pour rum into apple mixture and stir until apples are evenly coated and a thick sauce forms. Bring apple mixture to a boil over medium heat and cook, stirring frequently, until apples are soft, about 20 minutes. Cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
