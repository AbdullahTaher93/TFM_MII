To ready breading, place flour in a shallow, medium-sized bowl. Beat eggs with milk in a small bowl. On a separate flat dish, spread out breadcrumbs. Evenly coat ravioli with flour, then egg mixture, and lastly, breadcrumbs. Use a baking sheet to keep ravioli until ready for frying. In the meantime, heat oil in a frying pan on medium. Once oil begins to sizzle and pop, it is ready to fry. Fry ravioli in batches, turning to cook evenly, about 1 minute on each side. Once golden brown, remove ravioli with a slotted spoon to a paper-towel lined plate to drain. Sprinkle ravioli with Parmesan (and basil, if desired) and serve with Marinara for dipping.
