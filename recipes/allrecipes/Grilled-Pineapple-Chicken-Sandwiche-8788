Grill or broil the chicken breasts and pineapple slices, brushing occasionally with honey mustard. Cook the chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve the chicken on sandwich rolls, topped with pineapple slices and red bell pepper rings.
