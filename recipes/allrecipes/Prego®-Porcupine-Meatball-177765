Thoroughly mix the turkey, rice, egg, oregano, garlic powder and black pepper in a large bowl. Shape the mixture firmly into 25 meatballs. Heat the sauce in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the meatballs and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the meatballs are cooked through.
