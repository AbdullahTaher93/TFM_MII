Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until tender, about 5 minutes. Season with basil, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Stir in fresh tomatoes and canned tomatoes; simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. Add red wine and lemon juice; simmer for 5 minutes more. Stir shrimp and mushrooms into tomato mixture; cook and stir until mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes. Serve sauce over linguine and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
