Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water. Combine cooked macaroni, kidney beans, celery, light mayonnaise, onion, red wine vinegar, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until well mixed. Chill in refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
