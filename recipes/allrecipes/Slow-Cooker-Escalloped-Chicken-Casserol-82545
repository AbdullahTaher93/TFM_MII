Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spread bread cubes in a single layer on 2 baking sheets. Bake for about 10 minutes, or until lightly toasted. In a medium bowl, stir together chicken broth, mushroom soup, melted butter, and olive oil. Mix in celery and onion. Season with poultry seasoning, sage, and pepper. Place bread cubes in a large bowl or pot. Pour chicken broth mixture over bread cubes, and stir to coat. In a slow cooker, layer the cooked chicken with the dressing mixture. Cook on Low for 4 to 6 hours. Serve.
