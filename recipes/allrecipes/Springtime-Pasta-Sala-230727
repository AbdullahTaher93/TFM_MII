Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook pasta at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Rinse pasta with cold water until cool; drain. Transfer pasta to a large bowl. Stir cucumber, black olives, red onion, mayonnaise, sour cream, dill, salt, dry mustard, and garlic salt together in a bowl; pour over the pasta and gently mix to coat evenly. Cover bowl with plastic wrap; refrigerate for 2 hours before serving.
