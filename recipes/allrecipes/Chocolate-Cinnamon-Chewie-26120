Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease cookie sheet with solid vegetable shortening. Place the dry cake mix, water, melted butter and egg in large bowl. Blend with mixer on low speed for 1 minute; scrape down sides of bowl. Increase speed to medium; beat for 1 minute (dough will be thick). Stir in cinnamon chips and nuts. Drop scant teaspoons of dough on prepared cookie sheet. Bake 7 to 8 minutes or until set. Let stand on cookie sheet 3 minutes; remove from cookie sheet to wire rack. Cool completely.
