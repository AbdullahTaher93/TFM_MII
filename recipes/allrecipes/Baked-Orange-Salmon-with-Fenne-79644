Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (150 degrees C). In a medium skillet over medium heat, cook fennel in olive oil until translucent, about 20 minutes. Place the fillets skin side down in a glass baking dish. Pour the orange juice over the fillets. Sprinkle fennel over in an even layer, and season with OLD BAY. Cover the dish with aluminum foil. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
