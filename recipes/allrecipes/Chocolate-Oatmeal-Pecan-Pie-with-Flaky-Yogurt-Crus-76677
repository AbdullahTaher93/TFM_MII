Make the crust: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large mixing bowl, using a pastry blender or two knives, thoroughly blend all crust ingredients together. Press crust mixture into bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie plate, leaving about 1/4-inch rim along top edge for crimping. Using tines of a fork, gently press down crust all around top edge of pie plate; set aside. Make the filling: In a double boiler, over barely simmering water, melt chocolate and butter; stir with a wooden spoon to combine. Remove from heat and cool to lukewarm on the counter. Meanwhile, in a medium mixing bowl, using an electric mixer, blend brown sugar, corn syrup, eggs and salt until smooth. Using a wooden spoon, stir in oats and pecan halves until combined. Add cooled chocolate and butter mixture to the filling and stir well. Assemble the pie: Transfer filling to the unbaked crust. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool pie on a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature, garnished with whipped cream, if desired.
