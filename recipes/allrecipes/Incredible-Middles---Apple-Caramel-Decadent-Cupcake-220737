Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place 14-16 liners in muffin cups. (Baking tip: Spray top of pan with cooking spray for cupcakes to release from pan easier.) Mix batter according to directions. Spoon batter into muffin tin, about two-thirds of the way full. You will have enough batter for 14-16 cupcakes. Mix caramel pouch as directed on box. Spoon a heaping teaspoon of caramel on top of the batter. Do not mix into batter. Gently swirl caramel into surface of cupcake using a knife. Bake for 21-24 mins. Cupcakes will be golden brown and spring back when touched in center. Allow to cool completely before frosting. Frost with Duncan Hines(R) Creamy Home-Style Vanilla Frosting and decorate.
