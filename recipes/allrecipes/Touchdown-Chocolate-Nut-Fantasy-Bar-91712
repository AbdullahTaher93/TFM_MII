Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease 13x9-inch-baking pan. In large bowl, combine cake mix, oil and egg; beat on medium speed until crumbly. Stir in nuts. Reserve 1 1/2 cups crumb mixture. Firmly press remaining crumb mixture on bottom of prepared pan. In small saucepan, over medium heat, combine remaining ingredients. Cook and stir until chips melt. Pour evenly over prepared crust. Sprinkle reserved crumb mixture evenly over top. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until edges are firm. Cool. Cut into bars. Drizzle with icing (optional). Store loosely covered at room temperature.
