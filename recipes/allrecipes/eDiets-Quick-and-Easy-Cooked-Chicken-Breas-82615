Rinse and pat dry chicken breast. Lightly brush a small non-stick skillet with olive oil and heat on medium-high. When skillet is hot, add chicken and wine; cover and cook about 3-4 minutes on each side. Add broth and Worcestershire sauce, reduce heat to medium, cover again, and continue to cook for about 5 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink in center and sauce has reduced by about half.
