Preheat a sandwich/panini press according to manufacturer's instructions. Set one slice of bread on a work surface. Top bread with 1 slice cheese, apple slices, bacon slices, and remaining 1 slice cheese. Place remaining bread slice on top. Cook sandwich in the preheated panini press until bread is lightly toasted and cheese begins to melt, about 5 minutes.
