In a bowl, combine butter, onion, poppy seeds and garlic. Separate each tube of biscuits into 10 biscuits; dip in butter mixture and stand up on end in a lightly greased 10-in. fluted tube pan. Bake at 400 degrees F for 14-16 minutes or until golden brown. Immediately invert onto a serving plate. Serve warm.
