Heat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread 1/3 of the potatoes onto bottom of 2-L casserole dish sprayed with cooking spray; top with half each of the onions and flour, then 1/2 cup cheese. Repeat layers. Cover with remaining potatoes. Pour milk over all layers; cover. Bake 1 hour or until potatoes are tender, uncovering and sprinkling with remaining cheese for the last 20 minutes.
