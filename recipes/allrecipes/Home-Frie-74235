Scrub the potatoes clean and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. In a medium saucepan, cover potato cubes with cold salted water and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until the potatoes are tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain in a colander. In a large bowl, toss together the potatoes, Mann's Broccoli Cole Slaw, onion and bell pepper. On an oiled griddle or in a large skillet, working in batches if necessary, spread a single layer of the potato and broccoli mixture on the hot griddle, pressing down gently with the back of a spatula. Cook, turning once, until golden on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes total. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve warm.
