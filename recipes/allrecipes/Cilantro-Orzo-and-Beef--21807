Mix broth, pasta, corn and chilies in 2-quart saucepan. Heat to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer about 10 minutes or until pasta is just tender; remove from heat. Let stand about 5 minutes or until almost all liquid is absorbed. While pasta mixture is cooking, spray 10-inch nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Add oil; heat over medium-high heat. Cook beef and bell pepper in oil about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until beef is brown. Stir beef mixture into pasta mixture. Stir in cilantro.
