Heat the sunflower oil in a large, deep skillet that has a lid, or in a Dutch oven, over medium-high heat. Add the sausages and quickly brown on all sides. Remove the sausages from the pan with 1-inch tongs and leave to cool slightly. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat remaining in the pan. Add the onions and garlic to the pan and stir well. Cover, reduce the heat, and cook slowly 5 minutes. Add the carrots, peppers, and celery and stir well to mix. Stir in the flour, then gradually mix in the stock. Bring to a boil, stirring. Cut the sausages into thick slices and return them to the pan. Stir in the crushed chiles and marjoram, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the pappardelle in boiling water until al dente, 10 to 12 minutes, or according to package directions; drain and keep warm. Sprinkle the paprika over the sausage mixture and stir in. Taste and add more crushed chiles or seasoning, if liked. Drizzle the sour cream over the top of the sausage mixture and serve with the noodles.
