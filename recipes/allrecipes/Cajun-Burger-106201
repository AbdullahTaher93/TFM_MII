Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. In a small bowl, mix mayonnaise with 1/2 teaspoon of Cajun seasoning and set aside. In a large bowl, mix beef, 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, jalapeno, onion, salt and pepper. Divide into 4 equal portions and form into patties. Place burgers on hot grill, cover and cook until grill marks appear, about 4 minutes per side for medium, or until internal temperature is 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Place cheese slices on burgers; cover and continue to grill until cheese melts, about 1 minute longer. Spread the Cajun mayonnaise onto the insides of the buns. Put burgers in the buns, top with lettuce and tomato and serve.
