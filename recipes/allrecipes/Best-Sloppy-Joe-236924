Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Mix ketchup, chili sauce, onion, green bell pepper, brown sugar, and mustard powder into ground beef; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors have blended, about 15 minutes; serve on hamburger buns.
