Beat egg yolks, vinegar, lemon juice, sugar, mustard, and salt together in a chilled bowl with an electric mixer. Increase mixer speed to high and slowly pour oil into egg mixture, beating until mayonnaise is thick and creamy. Transfer mayonnaise to a jar and refrigerate until flavors blend, at least 1 hour.
