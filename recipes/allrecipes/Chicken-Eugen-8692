Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Line a 9x13 inch glass baking dish with dried beef. Wrap the chicken breasts with the bacon strips and place the wrapped chicken breasts onto the beef. Mix together the sour cream and cream of mushroom soup and pour evenly over the chicken. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 3 hours and enjoy, enjoy!
