In a large bowl, combine the saltine crackers, celery, onion, eggs, parsley and pepper. Set aside. Measure the half-and-half into a small cup and stir in the cornstarch. Bring the chicken broth to a boil in a small saucepan. Stir in the half-and-half and simmer for a few minutes to thicken. The gravy will be somewhat thin. Pour hot gravy over the cracker mixture one cup at a time, stirring each time, until the dressing is moist but not soupy. Cover the bowl tightly with aluminum foil and let rest for 10 minutes before serving.
