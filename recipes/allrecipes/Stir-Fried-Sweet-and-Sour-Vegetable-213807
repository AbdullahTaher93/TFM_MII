Stir the palm sugar, lime juice, fish sauce, oyster sauce, and soy sauce together in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until the sugar is completely dissolved; bring to a simmer. Set aside. Heat the oil in a large skillet; fry the garlic in the hot oil until browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the onion; cook for 1 minute. Stir the cauliflower and carrot into the mixture; cook and stir for 1 minute. Mix the cucumber, corn, and peas into the mixture; cook for 1 more minute. Stir the bell pepper and tomato into the mixture; cook 1 minute. Pour the sauce over the mixture, add the pineapple, and toss so the entire mixture is evenly coated in sauce; cook another minute. Serve hot.
