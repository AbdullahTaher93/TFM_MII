Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the chicken, garlic, lime juice, and taco seasoning mix in a bowl, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Mix well. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the chicken mixture and cook for 1 minute without stirring. Add the peppers and stir-fry over a high heat until the chicken is lightly browned, about 3-5 minutes. Add the beans and heat them through, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, place the tortillas on a baking sheet and warm in the oven for 2-3 minutes, or place them between paper towels and microwave on medium for 1 minute. Peel and dice the avocado. Spoon the chicken and pepper mixture into the tortillas. Add the avocado, lettuce, green onions, tomato, cilantro, and Tabasco or other hot sauce to taste. Serve at once, topped with the sour cream.
