Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Melt butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Saute onion and bell pepper until soft, about 5 minutes. Add ground pork and cook until evenly brown. Drain excess fat. In a large pot, heat spaghetti sauce until bubbling. Stir in pork mixture, pasta, and sour cream. Cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.
