Trim off excess fat from duckling pieces. Rinse pieces; drain and pat dry. Score skin with diagonal slashes 1 inch apart. Place pieces, skin side up, on rack in shallow, foil-lined baking pan. Bake in 350 degrees F oven 45 minutes. Meanwhile, combine teriyaki baste & glaze, marmalade, sherry and pepper; remove and reserve 1/4 cup glaze mixture. Drain off pan drippings. Turn oven temperature to broil and raise oven rack 5 to 7 inches from heat. Brush duckling pieces thoroughly with remaining glaze mixture. Broil, skin side down, 5 minutes. Turn pieces over; brush again with glaze mixture. Broil 5 minutes longer, or until skin is crisp. Blend reserved glaze mixture with water in small saucepan; bring to boil. Serve duckling pieces with warm sauce.
