Place potatoes into a large pot and add enough water to cover; bring to a boil and cook until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute onion and turkey bacon until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix water and chicken bouillon together in a bowl, stirring and breaking cubes apart with a fork, until dissolved. Stir evaporated milk and garlic salt into bouillon mixture. Drain potatoes, setting about 1/8 aside in a bowl. Mix the potatoes, evaporated milk mixture, onion-bacon mixture, and butter together in a pot until soup is creamy and smooth. Add the reserved potatoes to soup, breaking potatoes apart for desired texture. Bring soup to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until soup is heated through, 15 to 20 minutes.
