Place sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir broccoli in hot oil until tender yet still crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir sweet potatoes, lentils, cumin, cayenne pepper, and salt into broccoli; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Add diced tomatoes and cook until hot, about 3 minutes. Drizzle 1 tablespoon barbeque sauce into each pita round. Scoop about 1 cup of sweet potato mixture into each pita and wrap each, folding up the bottom of the pita first, followed by the sides. Secure with toothpicks, if necessary.
