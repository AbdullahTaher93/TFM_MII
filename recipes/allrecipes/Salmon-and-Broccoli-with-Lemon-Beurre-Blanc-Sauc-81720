To make the sauce: In a sauce pan over medium-high heat, boil the wine, vinegar and shallots until it reduces to about 1/4 cup (15 or 20 minutes). Stir occasionally. While the sauce base is reducing, prepare the salmon and broccoli. Preheat broiler with a rack about 8 inches away. Cut the broccoli into spears, put in a bowl and pour about 1/2 of the dressing over them and toss. Use the rest of the dressing to brush onto the salmon steaks. On a foil lined sheet pan (to make clean-up easier) place the salmon steaks and broccoli spears. Broil for 5 minutes, turn the steaks and broccoli and broil another 5 minutes. Turn off the heat, but leave in the oven until the sauce is ready. Once the sauce has reduced, set heat to lowest setting and whisk in the cream. Then add the butter, about 3 Tbsps at a time, whisking thoroughly (do not let it boil). Whisk in the lemon juice. Pour over the salmon and broccoli and serve immediately, garnished with the lemon zest.
