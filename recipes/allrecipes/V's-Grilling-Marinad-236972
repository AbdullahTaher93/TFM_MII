Pour boiling water over tea leaves in a mug and steep for 3 minutes; strain and discard tea leaves. Dissolve brown sugar into the tea and set aside to cool. Combine pineapple juice, tamari, canola oil, ginger, garlic, sherry, and honey in a jar; add tea mixture. Seal jar and shake until the oil emulsifies into the marinade.
