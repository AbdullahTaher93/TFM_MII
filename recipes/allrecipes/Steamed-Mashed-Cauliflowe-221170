Place cauliflower florets in a large microwave-safe bowl with enough water to just cover the bottom of the bowl. Cover bowl loosely with waxed paper or a paper towel and steam cauliflower in microwave on high until tender, 4 to 5 minutes; drain. Place drained cauliflower in a food processor with goat cheese and puree until completely smooth; season with black pepper.
