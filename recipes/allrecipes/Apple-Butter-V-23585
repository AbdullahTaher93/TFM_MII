In a 5 quart saucepan, bring apple cider and apples to a boil. Reduce heat. Cover and, stirring often, simmer 10 minutes, or until the apples are very tender. Sieve the mixture through a strainer or food mill, then return to simmer in the saucepan. Stir sugar and brown sugar into the mixture. Simmer uncovered 2 hours, stirring often, until the mixture reaches a spreadable consistency. Transfer to sterile containers and refrigerate or freeze until serving.
