Preheat grill for medium heat. Spray a 24-inch piece of aluminum foil with cooking spray. Place potatoes on the prepared piece of aluminum foil; spray with cooking spray. Mix bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, seasoned salt, and pepper together in a bowl; sprinkle over potatoes. Fold aluminum foil over potato mixture and seal edges together. Cook on the grill until potatoes are tender, 20 to 30 minutes.
