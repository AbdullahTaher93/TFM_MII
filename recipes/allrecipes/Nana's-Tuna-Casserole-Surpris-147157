Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Mix the tuna, cereal, onion, mushroom soup, and olive oil together in a bowl until blended. Spoon mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle evenly with cheese and peanuts. Bake in preheated oven until cheese melts, about 30 minutes. Cut into squares to serve.
