Arrange 1/4 of the grapefruit sections and 1/4 of the diced avocado decoratively on a salad plate. Top with 1/4 cup of sprouts. Repeat with remaining grapefruit sections, avocado, and sprouts to make 4 salads. Mix lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and black pepper in a small bowl; drizzle dressing over each salad.
