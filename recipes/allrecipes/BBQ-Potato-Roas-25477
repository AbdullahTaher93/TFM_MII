Preheat grill for high heat. Place potatoes in a large saucepan with enough lightly salted water to cover. Bring to a boil. Cook 15 minutes, or until tender but firm. Drain potatoes, and pat dry. Coat thoroughly with vegetable oil and seasoned salt. Place potatoes on the preheated grill. Cook approximately 20 minutes, turning periodically.
