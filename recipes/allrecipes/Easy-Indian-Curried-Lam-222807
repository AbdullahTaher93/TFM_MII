Heat canola oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, garlic, and cumin seeds in the hot oil until onion is browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Add lamb, tomato paste, coriander, salt, garam masala, turmeric, and red chile powder; stir to coat. Cover saucepan and simmer until meat is tender and no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour.
