Warm the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat, add the onion and garlic; cook and stir until golden brown. Stir in the chile paste, tomato sauce, water, parsley, salt, pepper, paprika, and sausage. Bring the sausage mixture to a boil over high heat; reduce the heat to low and simmer for 40 minutes. Mix in the fava beans and cook 10 minutes for firm beans, or up to 30 minutes for softer beans.
