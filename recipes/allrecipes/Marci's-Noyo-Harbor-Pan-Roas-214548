Heat the butter in a stock pot over medium heat. Stir in the celery, onion, and potato; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for about 1 minute. Pour in the vegetable broth and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are just tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Combine heavy cream, paprika, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and sea salt in a small bowl. Pour 1/2 cup of hot broth into the cream mixture; stir. Whisk in the flour. Stir the cream mixture into the soup and bring to a boil. Add the fish and shellfish, cover and simmer until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 3 to 4 minutes.
