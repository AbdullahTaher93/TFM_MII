Place half of the potatoes in a greased 2-qt. or 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Top with onion and remaining potatoes; drizzle with butter. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Bake, uncovered, at 450 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until the potatoes are golden brown and tender.
