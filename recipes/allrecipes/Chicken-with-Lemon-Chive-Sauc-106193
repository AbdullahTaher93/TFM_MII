Heat oil in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Add garlic and cook until golden, about 5 minutes. Remove garlic with a slotted spoon and transfer oil into a larger skillet. Mash garlic in the small skillet and add broth, lemon zest and juice. Turn heat on low and allow to simmer. Reheat oil in larger skillet over medium heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper and dredge in flour. When oil is hot, cook chicken turning once until golden brown or until internal temperature is 180 degrees F (80 degrees C), about 4 minutes per side. Transfer chicken breasts to individual plates. Pour lemon sauce and chives into large skillet and cook until sauce thickens, less than a minute. Drizzle sauce over chicken and serve.
