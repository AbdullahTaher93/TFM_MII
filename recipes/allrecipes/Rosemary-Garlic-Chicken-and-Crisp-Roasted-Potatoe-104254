Place chicken, breast side up, in a 12 x 8 x 1 1/2 inch roasting pan. Stuff the cavity of the chicken with half the lemon, garlic and 1-1/2 teaspoons rosemary. Brush the chicken with oil. Season cavity and skin with remaining half lemon, Morton(R) Kosher Salt and pepper and remaining rosemary. Rub into skin to coat all sides. Place pan in the oven and roast at 375 degrees F for about 30 minutes. Add potatoes and shallots that have been coated with oil. Continue to roast chicken with potatoes until juices run clear (thermometer registers at 175 degrees F) and potatoes are crisp, about 30 minutes. Remove chicken and potatoes to platter; cover. Let chicken stand 15 minutes before carving. Skim off grease from roasting pan and place pan on top of the stove. Add enough water to remaining juices to cover bottom of pan. Bring to boil while scraping bottom of pan vigorously with wooden spoon, loosening all the crisp bits on the bottom of the pan. Let reduce by half; adjust seasoning. Serve over chicken pieces, potatoes and shallots.
