In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, poppy seeds, lemon peel and baking soda. Combine remaining ingredients; stir into flour mixture just until moistened. Spoon into three greased 5-in. x 2-in. mini loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
