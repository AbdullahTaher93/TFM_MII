Line a 9-in. pie plate with bottom pastry; trim even with edge. In a skillet, saute the mushrooms and onion in butter; drain. Arrange half of the cheese slices in the crust. Top with half of the mushroom mixture; repeat layers. Place remaining pastry over filling; trim, seal and flute edges. Cut slits in the top. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand for 10 minutes. Cut into wedges.
