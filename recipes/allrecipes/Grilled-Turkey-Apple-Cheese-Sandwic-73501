Spread one side of each slice of bread with honey mustard and the other side with margarine. Top the honey mustard side of 4 bread slices with 2 slices of turkey, 2 apple slices, and 2 slices cheese. Cover with second slice of bread, mustard facing cheese. Place a large skillet over medium heat until hot, add sandwiches and cook until bread is golden, about 4 minutes. Turn and grill second side of sandwiches.
