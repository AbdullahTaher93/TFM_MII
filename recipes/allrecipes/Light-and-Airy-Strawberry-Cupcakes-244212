Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners. Stir flour, sugar, and baking soda together in a large bowl; make a well in the center. Add water, mayonnaise, strawberry preserves, and vanilla extract to the well and mix until batter is just blended. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups. Press 1 strawberry into each. Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when pressed, 20 to 25 minutes.
