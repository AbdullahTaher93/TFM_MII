Rinse the rice in several changes of cold water. Drain. In a medium pot, combine the rice, stock, and salt. Add enough water to cover the rice by about 2 inches. Bring to a boil over moderate heat. Cover, reduce the heat, and cook at a gentle boil until the rice is tender. The cooking time can vary from 35 to 60 minutes. If necessary, drain the rice. Let cool. Put the cranberries and boiling water in a small bowl. Let soak until softened, about 10 minutes. Drain and let cool. In a large bowl, combine the rice, cranberries, turkey, Belgian endive, scallions, and parsley. Add the vinaigrette and toss.
