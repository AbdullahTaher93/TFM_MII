Light a grill. In a small skillet, heat the olive oil until shimmering. Add the onion and garlic and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the water and cook, stirring, until the onion is lightly browned, about 5 minutes longer. Scrape the onion into a medium bowl and let cool. Add the ground turkey, panko, 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. Knead the ground turkey mixture lightly and form it into 4 patties. Grill the burgers over a hot fire, turning once, until lightly charred on the outside and cooked through, about 6 minutes per side. Brush the cut sides of the rolls with the sun-dried tomato oil and grill until toasted, about 1 minute. In a small bowl, mix the mayonnaise with the pesto and sun-dried tomatoes. Spread the mayo on the rolls and top with the burgers, red onion slices and arugula. Close the burgers and serve.
