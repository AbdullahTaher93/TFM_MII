Preheat grill for high heat. Puncture potatoes on all sides with a fork. Coat each potato with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Place each potato on the end of a separate sheet of aluminum foil. Crush thyme and rosemary sprigs by hand, and place 2 sprigs of each and 1/4 of the crushed garlic next to each potato. Roll potatoes and herbs in the foil and fold over sides to seal. Place potato packets on the preheated grill, and close lid. Cook 40 minutes, turning occasionally, until tender.
