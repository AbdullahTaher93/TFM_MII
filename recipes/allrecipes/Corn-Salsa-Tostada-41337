Using a 2-inch-round cookie cutter, cut 12 circles from each tortilla. Coat both sides of circles with nonstick cooking spray. Place in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees for 4 - 5 minutes or until crisp. Cool. In a small bowl, combine the sour cream, onions, 1 teaspoon cilantro and garlic powder; cover and refrigerate. In another bowl, combine the corn, tomato, jalapeno, orange juice, oil, salt and remaining cilantro; cover and refrigerate. Just before serving, spread 1 teaspoon sour cream mixture over each tostada. Using a slotted spoon, top each with a teaspoonful of corn salsa.
