Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add farfalle pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. In a large skillet over medium heat, saute cabbage in olive oil. If skillet gets dry add a bit more oil. Saute about 10 minutes then add cooked farfalle pasta. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes more. Sprinkle on pepper to taste.
