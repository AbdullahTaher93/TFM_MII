In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add molasses, salt, caraway, squash, and 2 cups flour; mix well. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down; turn onto a floured surface and shape into a loaf. Place in a greased 9 x 5 x 3-inch loaf pan. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from pan to cool on a wire rack.
