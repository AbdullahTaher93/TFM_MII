Stir together onion, mustard powder, pepper, pepper flakes, and sugar in a large bowl. Add garlic, ginger, rice vinegar, liquid smoke, honey, and tomato puree; mix thoroughly. Toss venison with marinade, cover, and marinate in refrigerator 30 minutes to overnight. Preheat a grill for medium heat. Skewer the venison pieces, alternating with red pepper, yellow pepper, red onion, mushroom, and cherry tomatoes. Grill until the venison is no longer pink, about 15 minutes, depending on the grill. Alternatively, the kabobs may be baked in a preheated oven at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for about 10 minutes.
