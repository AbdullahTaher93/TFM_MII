Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Coat beef with flour. Place in the pot, and evenly brown on all sides. Place 2 cups boiling water, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic powder into pot with beef. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low, and simmer beef for 2 hours, or until tender. Add onion, carrots, diced tomatoes and potatoes to pot. Continue cooking 30 minutes to 1 hour, until vegetables are soft.
