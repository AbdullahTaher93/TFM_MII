Bring a large stockpot of salted water to a boil. In a large skillet, over medium high heat, heat the tablespoon of olive oil. Saute the broccoli florets, stirring, for about 2 to 3 minutes. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Deglaze the pan with the chicken stock, and add the thyme or basil leaves. Bring to a boil and reduce by half. Add the butter and the goat cheese and stir together until the cheese melts. Stir in the broccoli. Keep warm. Cook the angel hair pasta in the boiling salted water until it is al dente, about 1 minute for fresh pasta. (Cook dry pasta according to the package directions.) Drain the pasta well and add to the sauce and broccoli in the skillet. Cook over medium heat for about 1 minute, until heated through. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Note: To toast pine nuts, place the nuts in a small skillet in a single layer. Over low heat, toast for about 3 to 4 minutes until lightly golden, stirring often to prevent burning. Drain on paper towels.
