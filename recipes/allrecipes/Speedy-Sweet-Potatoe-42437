In a 1-1/2-qt. microwave-safe dish, layer sweet potatoes, salt, pineapple, pecans, brown sugar and 1/2 cup marshmallows. Cover and microwave on high for 5-7 minutes or until bubbly around the edges. Top with the remaining marshmallows. Heat, uncovered, on high for 1-2 minutes or until marshmallows puff. Sprinkle with nutmeg.
