Grease an 8 inch square baking pan. In the top of a double boiler, melt the chocolate chips with the peanut butter, stirring until smooth. Remove from the heat and gradually blend in the cereal. Spread the mixture evenly in the prepared baking pan. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, then cut into large or small bars.
