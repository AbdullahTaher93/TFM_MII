Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the squash, cut side down, in a large baking dish. Bake the squash in the preheated oven for 50 minutes. Scrape flesh of squash from the rind using a fork and place in a bowl. Add the pine nuts, cheese, sage, butter, salt, and pepper; toss to combine. Serve immediately.
