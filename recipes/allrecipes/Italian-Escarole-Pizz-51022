Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly brush pizza crust with olive oil. Spread with a thin layer of pizza sauce, and sprinkle with minced garlic. Remove thick stems from escarole, and arrange leaves over pizza. Cover with shredded mozzarella. Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly.
