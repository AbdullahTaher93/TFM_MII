Combine vinegar, wine, and shallot in a shallow saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and whisk 2 tablespoons butter into shallot mixture. When butter is almost melted and blended into sauce, whisk in another 2 tablespoons butter. Repeat this process until all the butter is incorporated and the sauce is thick. Stir cream into sauce and season with salt.
