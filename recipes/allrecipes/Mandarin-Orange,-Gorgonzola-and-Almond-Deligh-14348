Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add almonds, and cook, stirring frequently, until lightly toasted. Remove from heat, and set aside. In a small bowl, whisk together 2 tablespoons reserved mandarin orange juice, oil, and vinegar. In a large salad bowl, toss together the toasted almonds, mandarin oranges, mixed salad greens, and Gorgonzola cheese. Just before serving, pour dressing on salad, and toss to coat.
