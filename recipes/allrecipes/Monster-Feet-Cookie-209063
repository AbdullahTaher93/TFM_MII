Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line sheet pans with foil. Prepare the cookie mix according to package instructions. Knead in the flour and some of the green food coloring. Pull off walnut-size nuggets of dough. Shape into 1 to 1 1/2-inch ovals and roll in sugar. Place on the foil-lined sheet pans about 2 inches apart. Press M&M'S Brand Peanut Chocolate Candies onto one end as the toenail. Bake at 350 degrees F for approximately 9-12 minutes, or until just golden and cookies have puffed and spread. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. Meanwhile, tint 1 cup of frosting green and spoon into a re-sealable bag. Snip a very small corner from bag and pipe wavy curly lines on top of the cookies to resemble knuckles.
