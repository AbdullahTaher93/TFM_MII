Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2 1/2-quart baking dish. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes; drain. Combine cream of chicken soup, milk, dried minced onion, parsley, and Worcestershire sauce in a large bowl; add cooked angel hair pasta and ham. Transfer pasta mixture to the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the pasta mixture. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes; remove foil and continue baking until top is lightly browned, about 5 minutes more.
