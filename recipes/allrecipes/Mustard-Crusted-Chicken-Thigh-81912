Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare a roasting rack with cooking spray or an oiled paper towel. Remove the skin from the thigh. Rinse and pat dry with a paper towel. Mix together the mustard, Mrs. Dash and the salt in a shallow bowl. There are a couple of approaches to coat the chicken pieces. You can roll them in the mustard mixture, you can spoon it on or you can brush it on. I personally prefer using a spoon. Place the chicken pieces on the oiled rack set inside a pan (I like to line my pan with aluminum foil for an easier clean up). Bake for 35 minutes. Serve at once.
