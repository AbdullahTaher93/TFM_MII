Heat the oil in a medium skillet. Add the beans and cook over moderately high heat, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the water; season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook the beans until crisp-tender, 2 minutes. Add the zest and chives and cook, stirring, until the beans are tender, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Stir in the lemon juice and serve.
