Separate breadsticks into 12 sections but leave coiled. Place in a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Brush generously with butter and sprinkle with sugar. Make an indentation in the top of each; fill with about 1 tablespoon of pie filling. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Combine confectioners' sugar and water; drizzle over warm rolls.
