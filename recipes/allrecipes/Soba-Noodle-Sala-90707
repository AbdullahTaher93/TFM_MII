In a 5- to 6-quart pan, bring about 3 quarts water to a boil over high heat. Add noodles and cook, uncovered, just until barely tender to bite, about 5 minutes for soba, 2 to 3 minutes for capellini. Meanwhile, make dressing by mixing together sesame oil, oyster sauce, soy sauce, and lemon juice. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water until cool; drain. In a serving bowl, mix noodles, bell peppers, celery, onions, and dressing; sprinkle with cashews.
