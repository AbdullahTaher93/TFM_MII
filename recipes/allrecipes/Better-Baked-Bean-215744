Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Empty the cans of beans into a colander in the sink. Rinse thoroughly and set aside to drain. Place a large (10 to 12 inch) skillet over medium heat and wait about a minute. Add the olive oil and swirl to coat the pan. Add the onion, spices, and half the salt, and cook, stirring often, over medium heat for 5 minutes or until the onion begins to soften. Add the carrots, garlic, and bell pepper, plus the remaining salt. Stir to blend, then cover, turn the heat down to medium-low, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the carrots are tender. Stir in the mustard, molasses, and vinegar. Cook for 1 minute, then pour in the canned tomatoes with all their liquid. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to a simmer, and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and gently stir in the beans (careful not to break them). Transfer to a 9 X 13-inch baking pan, and cover it tightly with foil. Bake undisturbed for 45 minutes. Serve hot, topped with parsley and walnuts.
