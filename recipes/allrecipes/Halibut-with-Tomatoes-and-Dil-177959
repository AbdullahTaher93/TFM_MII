Mix the onion, garlic, dill, and oil. Place tomatoes, cut side up, in a 9- by 13-inch baking pan or dish. Distribute onion mixture evenly over tomatoes. Bake, uncovered, on top rack in a 425 degrees F oven for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, rinse fish, pat dry, and place in a 9- by 13-inch baking pan. Drizzle lemon juice over fish and cover with foil. After tomatoes have baked 25 minutes, place fish on bottom rack. Bake until tomatoes are browned and fish looks just barely translucent in thickest part (cut to test), 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer fish to a platter. Stir fish juices into tomatoes; spoon mixture over fish. Garnish with dill sprigs. Add salt and pepper to taste.
