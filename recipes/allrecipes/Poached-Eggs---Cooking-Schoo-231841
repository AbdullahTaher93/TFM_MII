Fill a saucepan with 2 to 3 inches of water and bring to a boil. Crack the eggs into individual small bowls; gently pour each egg into the boiling water. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer. As the eggs cook, gently nudge them with a spoon to raise them off the bottom of the pan. Test an egg for doneness by pulling it out with a slotted spoon. For runny yolks and firm whites, the eggs will be ready after about 3 minutes. For firmer yolks, cook the eggs for about 5 minutes. Transfer eggs to a plate lined with paper towels. Trim off any loose ends of whites.
