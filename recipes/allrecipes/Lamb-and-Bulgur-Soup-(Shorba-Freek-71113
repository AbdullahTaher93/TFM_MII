Heat oil in a stock pot over medium-high heat. Add the lamb, onion, garlic, and cinnamon. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Cook stirring frequently, until meat is browned and onions are almost tender. Pour in water and garbanzo beans, and bring to a boil. Simmer over low heat for 45 minutes to an hour, skimming the scum from the top occasionally. Meanwhile, pour the tomatoes into a blender or food processor, and puree until smooth. When the meat is tender, remove the pieces with a slotted spoon. Remove the fat and bones from the meat, and return it to the pot. Discard the fat and bones. Remove cinnamon sticks. Add the tomato puree and bulgur wheat. Simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the bulgur is puffed and tender. Transfer to a soup tureen, and garnish with parsley and mint before serving.
