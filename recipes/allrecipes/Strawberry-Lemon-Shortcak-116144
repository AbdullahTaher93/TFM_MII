In a small bowl, combine strawberries and sugar; cover and refrigerate until serving. In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Combine the milk, egg yolk and lemon peel; stir into crumb mixture until a soft dough forms (dough will be sticky). Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead 10 times. Divide dough in half. Gently pat or roll each half into a 3/4-in.-thick circle. Place 2 in. apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to a wire rack; cool for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine butter and lemon peel; set aside. In a small mixing bowl, beat cream until it begins to thicken. Add sugar; beat until stiff peaks form. To assemble, split shortcakes in half. Place cake bottoms on dessert plates; spread with lemon butter, then top each with a fourth of the strawberries and whipped cream. Cover with shortcake top and remaining berries and cream.
