In a bowl, combine the biscuit mix, cheese and onion. Stir in milk until a soft dough forms; stir 30 seconds longer. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls 2 in. apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 450 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown. Combine butter and garlic powder; brush over biscuits. Serve warm.
