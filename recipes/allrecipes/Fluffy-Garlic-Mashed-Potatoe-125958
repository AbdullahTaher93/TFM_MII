Place a steamer basket in a large saucepan with 1/2 inch of water. Place the potatoes and garlic in the steamer. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are very tender. Place the potatoes and garlic in a bowl and mash with a potato masher. Add the buttermilk, butter, salt, pepper, and chives, dill, or scallion greens; mash until well-blended.
