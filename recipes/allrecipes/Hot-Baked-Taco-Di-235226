Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir bell pepper and taco seasoning into ground beef. Spread ground beef mixture into prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle tomato and green onions over ground beef mixture; top with taco sauce. Spread sour cream over taco sauce layer and top with Cheddar cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, 10 to 20 minutes. Serve with tortilla chips.
