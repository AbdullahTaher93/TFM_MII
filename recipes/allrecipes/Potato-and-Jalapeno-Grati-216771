Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread 1/4 of the sliced potatoes into the bottom of the casserole dish, followed by 1/3 of Gruyere cheese, and about 2 tablespoons of minced jalapeno peppers. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Repeat the layers 2 more times; top casserole with last 1/4 of the sliced potatoes. Pour the cream evenly over the casserole. Sprinkle top with paprika. Bake in the preheated oven until the casserole has browned and the potatoes are tender, about 1 1/2 hours.
