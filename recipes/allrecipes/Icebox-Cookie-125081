In a mixing bowl, cream the butter and brown sugar. Add egg and vanilla; beat well. Combine dry ingredients; add to creamed mixture. Stir in nuts if desire. On a lightly floured surface shape the dough into three 10-in. x 1-in. rolls. Tightly wrap each roll in waxed paper. Freeze for at least 12 hours. Cut into 3/8-in slices and place on greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 6-8 minutes. Remove to a wire rack to cool.
