Peel some, but not all, skin from eggplant. Place eggplant in a shallow dish and cover with soy sauce. Allow to marinate for 1 hour, turning eggplant occasionally. In a medium saucepan, mix together coconut cream, tomato sauce, miso paste, and lime juice. Place over low heat and allow to simmer, stirring occasionally. When sauce comes to a boil, remove from heat and cover with lid. Heat vegetable oil and sesame oil in a wok over high heat. Fry eggplant filets a few at a time, until golden brown on both sides. You may need to replenish oil between batches. Serve eggplant over rice or noodles, with sauce spooned over top.
