In a bowl, gently toss together the kidney beans, black beans, green bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, tomatoes, and green onions. In a separate bowl, mix the salsa, vinegar, and cilantro. Pour dressing over the bean mixture, and gently stir to coat. Chill at least 1 hour in the refrigerator before serving.
