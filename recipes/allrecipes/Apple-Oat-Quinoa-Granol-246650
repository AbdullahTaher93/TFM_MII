Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spread diced apples on baking sheet. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons cinnamon and 1 teaspoon nutmeg on top. Bake apples in the preheated oven, stirring at 10-minute intervals, until tender but not over-crisp, about 40 minutes total. Mix honey, applesauce, coconut oil, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon nutmeg, ginger, and cloves together in a large bowl. Stir in quinoa. Let sit, about 5 minutes. Stir oats, almond, and coconut into the honey mixture. Spread evenly over baked apple pieces. Bake in the preheated oven, stirring at 10-minute-intervals, until granola is golden brown and crispy, about 40 minutes. Cool completely before storing, 30 minutes to 1 hour.
