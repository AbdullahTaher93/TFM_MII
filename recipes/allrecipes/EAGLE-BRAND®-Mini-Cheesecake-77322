Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar and butter; press equal portions onto bottoms of 24 lightly greased* or paper-lined muffin cups. In large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese until fluffy. Gradually beat in sweetened condensed milk until smooth. Add eggs and vanilla; mix well. Spoon equal amounts of mixture (about 3 tablespoons) into prepared cups. Bake 20 minutes or until cakes spring back when lightly touched. Cool. Chill. Garnish as desired. Refrigerate leftovers. *If greased muffin cups are used, cool baked cheesecakes. Freeze 15 minutes, remove from pans. Proceed as above.
