Remove casings from sausage and crumble meat into a wide nonstick frying pan. Cook over medium-high heat until sausage is browned (7 to 9 minutes), stirring sausage to break it into small chunks. Spoon off and discard all but 1 teaspoon of the drippings from pan. (If there are no drippings, add 1 teaspoon of the olive oil instead.) Add garlic, tomato sauce, basil, and oregano; bring to a boil. Then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring often, until almost all liquid has evaporated (about 5 minutes). Meanwhile, lightly brush both sides of each tortilla with remaining olive oil (make sure to oil edges). Arrange tortillas well apart on 2 12- by 15-inch baking sheets. Distribute sausage mixture equally over tortillas; then sprinkle evenly with bell pepper, mushrooms, onion, and olives. Sprinkle with jack and parmesan cheeses. Bake in a 475 degrees F oven until tortillas are crisp and golden brown and cheese is melted (6 to 8 minutes); switch positions of baking sheets halfway through baking time.
