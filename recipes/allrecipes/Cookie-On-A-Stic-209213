Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Shape cookie dough into eight 2-inch balls. Place four balls at a time onto an ungreased baking sheet. Insert wooden sticks into each ball to resemble a lollipop; flatten dough slightly. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes or until edges are crisp. Cool on baking sheet for 1 minute; remove to wire racks to cool completely. Decorate as desired. Tie ribbons around sticks and give as a cookie bouquet.
