In a large skillet, heat corn oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken pieces and saute for 5 minutes, until lightly browned. Add onions and saute for 2 minutes more. Add juice, broth, salt and pepper. Stir all together. Cover skillet and reduce heat to low. Let simmer for 45 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
