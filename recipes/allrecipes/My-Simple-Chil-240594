Combine ground beef, onions, and garlic in a large stockpot; cook and stir over medium heat until beef is browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Add celery and carrot to beef mixture; cook and stir until celery and carrot are slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Stir stewed tomatoes, tomato sauce, chili powder, Italian seasoning, and salt into beef mixture, breaking up tomatoes while stirring. Bring liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover stockpot, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend, about 1 hour. Stir beans into chili and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes.
