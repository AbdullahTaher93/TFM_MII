Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet; cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, and hot sauce in a small bowl. Spread both halves of the bread with the mayonnaise mixture. Place chicken on bottom half of bread; layer bacon and cheese on top of chicken. Fold the top half of the bread over the bottom, and wrap with foil. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Add a layer of red pepper slices on top of the bacon and cheese, if desired. Cut into slices, and serve.
