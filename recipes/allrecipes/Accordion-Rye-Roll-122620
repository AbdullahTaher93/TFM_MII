In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add milk, molasses, 2 tablespoons butter, sugar and 1 tablespoon salt. Add 2 cups all-purpose flour; beat until smooth. Add rye flour and enough remaining all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Let stand for 20 minutes. Divide dough into four portions. On a lightly floured surface, roll each portion into a 14-in. x 6-in. rectangle. Brush with remaining butter. With the blunt edge of a knife, make creases in dough at 2-in. intervals, beginning at a short side. Fold dough accordion-style back and forth along creased lines. Cut folded dough into 1-in. pieces. Place each piece cut side down in a greased muffin cup. Brush with oil. Cover loosely with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 4-24 hours. When ready to bake, uncover and let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes. In a small mixing bowl, beat egg white until stiff peaks form; brush over dough. Sprinkle with caraway seeds and remaining salt. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until lightly browned.
