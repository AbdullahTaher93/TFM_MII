In a Dutch oven or slow cooker, bring to a boil the applesauce and apple juice. Reduce heat and simmer 1 hour. In a small bowl, mix the sugar, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Stir the mixture into the simmering applesauce. Continue simmering 2 hours more, creating a thick, rich butter. Ladle the apple butter into sterile jars and refrigerate.
