Grate 1/2 teaspoon zest from the orange. Heat 1 package raspberries, the blueberries, water, 4 tablespoons sugar and half the orange zest in a 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let cool for 25 minutes. Stir in the remaining raspberries. Beat the heavy cream and the remaining sugar in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until stiff peaks form. Spoon the raspberry mixture into the pastry shells. Top with the whipped cream. Sprinkle with the remaining orange zest. Top with the pastry "tops".
