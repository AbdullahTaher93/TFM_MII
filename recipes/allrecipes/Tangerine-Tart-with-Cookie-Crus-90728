Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. To make cookie crust, in a food processor or a bowl, combine flour, powdered sugar, and grated tangerine peel. Whirl or stir to blend. Add butter and whirl or rub in with your fingers just until dough holds together. Press over bottom and up sides of a 10-inch tart pan with removable rim. Bake until crust is lightly browned, 25 to 35 minutes. To make filling, in a medium bowl, with a mixer on high speed, beat eggs and granulated sugar until well blended. Add 2 teaspoons tangerine peel, tangerine juice, lemon juice, and half-and-half. Beat until blended. Pour into baked cookie crust. Bake tart until filling no longer jiggles in center when pan is gently shaken, 30 to 40 minutes. Let pan cool completely on a rack, about 1 hour. In a bowl, combine whipping cream, remaining 1 teaspoon tangerine peel, powdered sugar, and vanilla. Beat with a mixer on high speed just until cream holds soft mounds. Cut tart into wedges. With a wide spatula, transfer to plates. Offer flavored whipped cream for topping portions.
