Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat, and brown the pork chops about 5 minutes on each side. Transfer to a baking dish. In a bowl, mix the honey, water, soy sauce, onion, ginger, and pepper. Pour over the pork chops in the baking dish. Bake pork chops 1 hour in the preheated oven, to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
