Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat; saute onion in hot oil until softened and slightly golden, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic; saute until golden and fragrant, 2 to 4 minutes more. Stir sage and thyme in onion mixture and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir vegetable broth, squash, water, kidney beans, quinoa, barley, and salt into onion mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until barley is tender and soup flavors combine, about 35 minutes. Stir kale into soup; simmer until kale is tender, about 10 minutes.
