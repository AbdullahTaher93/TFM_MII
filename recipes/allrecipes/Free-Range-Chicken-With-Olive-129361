Heat 1/4 cup oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Saute the onions, leeks, bay leaf, thyme, and oregano for 8-10 minutes, or until the onions and leeks are lightly browned. Pour in the vinegar, water, and remaining 1/4 cup oil. Add the chicken to the saucepan. Cover and cook over low heat for 50 minutes, or until tender. Add the olives 5 minutes before the chicken is cooked. Remove the bay leaf. Bone the chicken and serve hot with beans.
