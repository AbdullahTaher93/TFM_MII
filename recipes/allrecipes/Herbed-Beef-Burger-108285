In a bowl, combine broth, egg, bread crumbs, parmesan, parsley, rosemary, oregano, salt, and pepper to blend. Add ground beef and gently mix with a fork just until ingredients are evenly blended. Divide beef mixture into 4 equal portions. With your hands, shape each portion into a 3/4inchthick patty. If making ahead of time, lay patties side by side on a plate, cover airtight, and chill up to 24 hours. Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for direct heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is directly under the food). Lay patties on grill over a solid bed of medium hot coals or medium high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand just above grill level only 3 to 4 seconds). Keep charcoal grill uncovered; close lid on gas grill. Cook 6 to 7 minutes, then turn burgers with a wide spatula. Continue to cook cooking until meat is no longer pink in center (cut to test), about 6 minutes longer. Transfer burgers to buns and garnish to taste.
