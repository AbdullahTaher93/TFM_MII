In a large saucepan cook pasta and beans in a large amount of lightly salted boiling water about 14 minutes or until the pasta and beans are tender. Drain; return to saucepan. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan cook onion and garlic in hot oil over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until onion is tender. Reduce heat to low and add tomatoes and wine; cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Add tomato mixture to pasta mixture; toss lightly to combine. Transfer to a serving dish. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and parsley. If desired, season to taste with freshly ground pepper.
