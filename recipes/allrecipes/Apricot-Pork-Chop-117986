Place apricots in a food processor or blender; cover and process until coarsely chopped. In a large skillet, brown pork chops in butter over medium-high heat. Add apricots. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 7-10 minutes or until meat juices run clear. Remove the chops and keep warm. Combine cornstarch and cold water until smooth; stir into apricot mixture. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1 minute or until thickened. Season with salt and pepper. Serve over pork chops.
