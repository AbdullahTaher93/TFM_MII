In a large bowl, combine softened cream cheese, crab meat, red and green peppers, green onion and chopped herbs. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of Morton(R) Nature's Seasons(R) Seasoning Blend. Mix well and set aside. Preheat grill to medium-high (about 450 degrees F). Lightly brush asparagus with 2 teaspoons olive oil and season with 1/2 tablespoon of Morton(R) Nature's Seasons(R) Seasoning Blend. Set aside. In a bowl toss shrimp in 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with 1/2 tablespoon of Morton(R) Nature's Seasons(R) Seasoning Blend. Set aside. Place steak in a glass dish. Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and cracked black pepper, turning to coat. Season with remaining 1 tablespoon Morton(R) Nature's Seasons(R) Seasoning Blend, pressing the spices into the meat to adhere. Place steaks onto grill and cook for 3 to 4 minutes per side, for medium-rare doneness. (An instant read thermometer should register 145 degrees F.) Equally divide cream cheese and crab mixture into 4 and top each steak. Move steaks to upper rack or indirect heat and grill-roast for 2 to 3 minutes until cheese turns lightly golden in color and is melted. Meanwhile, place seasoned asparagus and shrimp onto grill over direct heat and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until asparagus stalks are lightly charred and tender, and shrimp are pink, opaque, and just cooked through. Remove steaks from grill; top each steak with 2 grilled shrimp. Serve with grilled asparagus. Drizzle with Nature's Season's Hollandaise Sauce.
