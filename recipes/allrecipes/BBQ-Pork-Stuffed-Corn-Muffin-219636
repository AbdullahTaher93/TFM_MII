Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line muffin tin with paper baking cups. Spray each cup with cooking spray. Stir together muffin mix, egg, milk, and 1/4 cup of shredded cheese in a bowl until combined. Fill muffin cups halfway with batter. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of pulled pork to each cup. Top with remaining batter. Use the remaining 1/4 of shredded cheese to top each muffin. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the batter comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
