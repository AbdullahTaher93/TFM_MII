In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, oil, sugar, garlic, ginger and mustard. Pour 1/4 cup marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add the turkey. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for up to 4 hours. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade for basting. Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill. Drain and discard marinade from turkey. Grill turkey, covered, over medium heat for 8-10 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 170 degrees F, turning twice and basting occasionally with reserved marinade. Cut into slices.
