In a small non-metallic bowl, add the vinegar, lemon juice, lime juice, lemon pepper, orange extract, cumin, chili powder, allspice and a pinch of salt. Vigorously whisk the vinaigrette while you (or a helper) slowly add the canola oil. (This can also be done in a food processor). Rinse chicken and pierce deeply several times with a fork or knife. In a baggie pour 1/2 of the vinaigrette (reserve the remainder) and add the skinless chicken pieces. Squish it around to get the pieces coated. Do this every 5 minutes for 15 or 20 minutes. Discard marinade. With the reserved vinaigrette add 2 Tbsp of water, mustard and Splenda. This will be used as the basting sauce. Meanwhile prepare your grill; just fire up one side of the grill. Over a medium-high heat, sear the chicken pieces on both sides. About 2 minutes per side with the lid up. Then move the chicken to the non-heated side of the grill, close the lid and cook for about 30 minutes. With a spoon or basting brush start basting chicken after about 10 minutes and then continue every 5 minutes or so until done.
