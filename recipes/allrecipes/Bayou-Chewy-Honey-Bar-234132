Line the base of a 9-by-13-inch pan with parchment paper and spray generously with cooking spray. In a large bowl combine the oats, crispy rice, peanuts and raisins; stir to combine. Set aside. In a large, 2-quart saucepan combine the brown sugar, honey, butter, peanut butter, vanilla and salt. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, over medium-high heat, until the mixture reaches 220 degrees on a candy thermometer. Immediately pour the hot liquid over the oat mixture, stirring until all of the dry ingredients are coated. Transfer the bar mixture to the prepared pan and press into place using your hands. Chill in the refrigerator for about an hour. To serve, cut into half lengthwise; then horizontally into twelve 2-inch bars.
