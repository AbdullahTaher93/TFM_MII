Brown the sausage in a skillet over medium heat; drain grease from the skillet. Set sausage onto a plate lined with paper towels. Melt the butter in the skillet. Cook the jalapeno pepper, bell pepper, and garlic in the melted butter until the peppers are tender. Bring the chicken broth and cream to a boil in a large saucepan. Gradually add the grits to the broth mixture while whisking. Continue cooking and whisking until the grits are cooked and the mixture thickens. Add the bell pepper mixture, sausage, and Monterey Jack cheese and stir until the cheese melts.
