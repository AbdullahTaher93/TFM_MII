Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine chicken, mayonnaise, celery, water chestnuts, almonds, pimento peppers, dried onion, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a 2-quart casserole dish. Top with Cheddar cheese and French fried onions. Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbly, about 30 minutes.
