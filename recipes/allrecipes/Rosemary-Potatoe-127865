In a 5-quart pot, bring 1/2 inch water to a boil; add salt and potatoes. Cover; cook, turning occasionally, until tender, about 14 to 16 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer potatoes to a bowl. Sprinkle potatoes with rosemary and oil. Season with salt and pepper. Break up potatoes with a fork or spoon, tossing to coat; cover to keep warm.
