Mix olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, mustard seeds, honey, black pepper, and allspice together in a bowl. Cut small slits in a crosswise-pattern in each chicken breast to help the mustard marinade soak into the chicken. Add chicken to the mustard marinade; toss to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 6 hours. Remove chicken from marinade and sprinkle with salt. Discard the leftover marinade. Lightly oil a grill pan and place over medium-high heat. Cook chicken in the grill pan until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 7 minutes per side.
