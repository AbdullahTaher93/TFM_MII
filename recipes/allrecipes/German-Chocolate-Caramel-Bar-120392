In a bowl, combine cake mix and oats; cut in butter until crumbly. Set aside 1 cup. Stir the egg into remaining oat mixture (mixture will be crumbly). Press into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12 minutes or until almost set. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Combine filling ingredients; spread over crust. For topping, combine the pecans, brown sugar, oats, butter and reserved oat mixture until crumbly. Sprinkle over filling. Bake 15 minutes longer. Cool on a wire rack. Refrigerate until firm before cutting.
