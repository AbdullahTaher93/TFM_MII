Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Place baguette slices on a baking sheet. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until toasted, turning once. Meanwhile, combine tomatoes, olives, parsley, vinegar, oil and red pepper in a medium bowl. Place 1 cheese slice on each toasted baguette slice; return to the oven. Bake for 2 to 3 minutes or until the cheese begins to melt. Top each with about 1 tablespoon of the tomato mixture. Serve immediately as an appetizer.
