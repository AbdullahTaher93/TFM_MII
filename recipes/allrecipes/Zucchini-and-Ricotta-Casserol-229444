Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Mix zucchini, garlic, mint, olive oil, smoked paprika, and salt in a large bowl until zucchini is evenly coated; transfer to a baking dish. Drop dollops of ricotta cheese atop zucchini mixture. Season with cayenne pepper. Bake in the preheated oven until zucchini is tender and cheese is browned, about 30 minutes.
