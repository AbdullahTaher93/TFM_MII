Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Mix flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in large bowl. Beat egg, milk and oil with wire whisk until well blended. Add to flour mixture; stir just until moistened. (Batter will be lumpy.) Stir in cereal and blueberries. Spoon evenly into 12 greased or paper-lined medium muffin cups, filling each cup two-thirds full. Bake 18 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
