Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add cumin seeds and stir until lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Cook and stir garlic and ginger in hot oil until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir in onion and cook until nearly caramelized, about 15 minutes, stirring often. Stir tomatoes, tomato paste, coriander, turmeric, chili powder, and garam masala into onion mixture and bring to a simmer. Cook until tomatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour tomato mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth and transfer to a saucepan. Add cloves, sugar, bay leaves, and cardamom. Bring spiced tomato sauce to a simmer over medium heat; add paneer cubes. Simmer until paneer is heated through, about 10 minutes. Beat yogurt until very smooth; stir into paneer and tomato sauce. Simmer until hot, about 10 minutes more. Season with salt.
