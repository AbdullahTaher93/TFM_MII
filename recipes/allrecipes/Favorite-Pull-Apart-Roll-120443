In a mixing bowl, cream shortening and sugar. Add boiling water; mix well. Cool to 110 degrees F to 115 degrees F. Dissolve yeast in warm water. Add yeast mixture and eggs to creamed mixture; mix well. Add salt, baking powder, baking soda and 5 cups flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Do not let rise. Divide into 32 pieces; shape each into a ball. Place in two greased 9-in. round baking pans. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours. Bake at 400 degrees F for 18-22 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks.
