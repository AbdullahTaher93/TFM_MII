Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Beat egg and dressing in large bowl with wire whisk until well blended. Add crabmeat; mix well. Gently stir in remaining ingredients. Let stand 3 min. Shape into 24 cakes, using about 1 Tbsp. of the crabmeat mixture for each cake. Place in single layer on lightly greased baking sheet. Bake 5 to 7 min. on each side or until cakes are golden brown on both sides and heated through.
