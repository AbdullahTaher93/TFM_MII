Cut meat into 1 inch cubes, and roll in seasoned flour. Place meat in a saucepan, and add enough water to cover. Cook until meat is tender, about 3 hours. Remove the meat, leaving the liquid in the pan. Thicken gravy with 1 tablespoon flour, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Return meat to the pan. Spoon into a pie dish. Allow to cool. Take a small portion of the pastry, and roll into 1 inch wide strips. Moisten the edges of the pie dish, and press pastry around the rim. Roll out the rest of the pastry to size of the dish. Moisten the strip pastry, and cover with pastry. Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes, or until nicely browned.
