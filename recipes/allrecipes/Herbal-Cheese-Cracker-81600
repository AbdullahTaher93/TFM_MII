In a small bowl, toss together the cheese and herbs. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle two or three little circles of the cheese blend, about 1 heaping Tbsp worth. Allow to heat until the edges start to turn a light golden brown, then flip with a spatula. Brown the other side. Then transfer to a paper towel and repeat with remaining cheese. The cracker is easy to mold as soon as it comes out of the skillet. Lay them on top of spice jars or shot glasses to form a nicely curved cracker great for stuffing.
