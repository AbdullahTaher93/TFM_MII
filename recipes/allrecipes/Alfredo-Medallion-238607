Mix together salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and cayenne. Sprinkle evenly over each side of the pork slices. Heat butter and olive oil in a 13-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork medallions and brown on both sides until pork is almost done (about 4 minutes per side). Remove from skillet; cover to keep warm. Pour wine and thyme into the skillet. Simmer over medium-high heat until wine is reduced by half. Pour Alfredo sauce into wine reduction; stir in lemon zest and capers. Stir until sauce is heated through. Place pork slices into the sauce and heat until internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F.
