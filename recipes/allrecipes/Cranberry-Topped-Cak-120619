Grease the bottoms of two 8-in. square baking dishes; sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon sugar. Sprinkle 2 cups of cranberries over the bottom of each pan; sprinkle with remaining sugar. Cover and bake at 325 degrees F for 30 minutes. Uncover; cool for 1 hour. For cake, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add egg yolks, water, oil, vanilla and lemon peel; beat until smooth, about 1 minutes. In another mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Add cream of tartar; beat until stiff peaks form. Fold a fourth of the egg whites into batter. Fold in remaining whites. Spoon batter over cranberries. Bake at 325 degrees F for 45-55 minutes or until cake springs back with lightly touched. Cool in pans 10 minutes before inverting on wire racks to cool completely. For frosting, beat cream until soft peaks form. Add the sugar and vanilla; beat until stiff peaks form. Spread between layers and over top and sides of cake. Cover and store in the refrigerator.
