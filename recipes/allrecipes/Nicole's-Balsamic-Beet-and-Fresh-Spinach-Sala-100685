Whisk together the balsamic vinegar, white wine vinegar, Chardonnay, and sugar in a small bowl. Place the beets and onions in a small, sealable container. Pour the vinegar mixture over the beets and onions to completely cover. Seal top; marinate in refrigerator for 4 to 5 hours. When ready to serve, divide spinach leaves between four salad plates. Top with beet mixture, and drizzle salads with a bit of the marinating liquid.
