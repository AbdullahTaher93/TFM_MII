Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Mix ground beef, beer, serrano pepper, and butter together in a bowl; form into 4 patties. Cook the burgers on the preheated grill for 5 minutes. Flip and continue cooking for 3 minutes. Top each burger with 1 slice Monterey Jack cheese and cook until burgers are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 2 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
