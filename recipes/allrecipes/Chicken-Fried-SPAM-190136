Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Whisk the eggs, milk, and hot pepper sauce together in a bowl. Stir the flour, salt, and pepper together in a separate bowl. Dip the sliced luncheon meat into the beaten egg, then press into the flour mixture. Cook the meat on both sides in the hot oil until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
