Generously butter a 9x13-inch baking dish. Whisk eggs, half-and-half, milk, white sugar, vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon nutmeg, and salt together in a bowl. Dip each bread slice into egg mixture and arrange in overlapping rows in the prepared baking dish. Cover dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix pecans, brown sugar, butter, corn syrup, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1 teaspoon nutmeg together in a bowl; spread evenly over bread in the baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and golden brown, about 45 minutes. Generously top French toast with confectioners' sugar.
