Whisk whole wheat flour and baking powder together in a bowl. Whisk in milk gradually until batter is smooth. Add kefir, egg, and oil; mix for 1 minute. Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop 1/4 cup onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until lightly browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
