Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow rice to cool. Whisk together the eggs and milk in a large bowl. Stir in the cooked rice, salt, pepper, and chives or onions, if desired. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium high heat. Using a 1/2 cup measure, spoon pancake shaped scoops of rice mixture into hot skillet. Cook until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes per side.
