Stir the antelope, bell pepper, onion, and chives together in a large pot over medium heat until the vegetables are very tender and the antelope has browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in the corn, red potatoes, celery, tomato, beef broth, water, and macaroni. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes more. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and garlic powder before serving.
