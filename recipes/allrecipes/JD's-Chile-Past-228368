Combine chicken broth, white onion, garlic, chipotle peppers, roasted red jalapeno peppers, pepperoncini peppers, dried Chinese hot peppers, and long hot chile peppers in a pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the peppers have softened, about 15 minutes. Transfer mixture to a blender. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth.
