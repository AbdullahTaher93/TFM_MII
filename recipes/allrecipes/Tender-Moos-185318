Place a steamer insert into a saucepan, and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Add the bay leaves and onion flakes to the water. Cover, and bring the water to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium low to maintain a simmer. Add the moose, recover, and steam until fork tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours depending on thickness, adding water to the pot as needed. Pour the barbecue sauce into a large sauce pan over medium heat; once warm, add the moose and reduce heat to low; simmer 45 minutes.
