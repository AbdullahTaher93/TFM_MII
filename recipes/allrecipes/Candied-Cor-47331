Pour the corn and liquid into a medium saucepan, and stir in sugar. Bring to a boil, then cook over medium heat so that the mixture is only simmering, not boiling. Simmer, stirring often, until the liquid has dried up, and corn is coated, about 20 to 30 minutes. Be patient and don't let it get too hot, or the corn will have a harder texture. Serve this right away and enjoy!
