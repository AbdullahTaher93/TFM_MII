Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Place rice into the bottom of a Dutch oven; add water, tomatoes, onion, green chile peppers, ancho chile peppers, chicken bouillon, oregano, and cloves. Place roast on top of the rice mixture; season with salt and pepper. Pour salsa verde over roast. Cover Dutch oven. Bake in the preheated oven for 6 hours. Discard pork bones and ancho chile peppers. Shred pork and return to Dutch oven; stir. Transfer pork mixture to a serving plate using a slotted spoon, draining well.
