Melt the butter or margarine in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, celery and carrots and saute for 5 to 10 minutes, or until onion is translucent and carrots start to get tender. Add the rice and stir to coat. Then add the chicken stock and the bay leaf. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour, or until rice is tender, stirring occasionally. Add the heavy cream and puree 2 cups of the soup in a blender or food processor. Return this to the pot and add the chicken. Stir well and allow to heat through. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
