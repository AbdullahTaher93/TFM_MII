Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, green bell pepper, and garlic until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add brown sugar, Italian seasoning, salt, oregano, basil, black pepper, and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until brown sugar dissolves and seasoning is fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and white wine into the seasoned onion mixture; bring to a boil for 10 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors have blended, at least 30 minutes.
