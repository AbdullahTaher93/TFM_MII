In a resealable plastic bag, combine the flour, salt, and pepper. Add the beef, seal the bag, and toss to coat well. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the beef in batches to prevent overcrowding, and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes, or until browned. Remove to a plate and repeat with remaining beef. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan. Add the onions, mushrooms, and garlic. Cook, stirring often, for 10 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the wine, broth, tomato paste, cocoa, bay leaves, and beef. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours. Add the carrots and simmer, covered, for 40 minutes, or until the beef and vegetables are tender. Add the peas and cook for 5 minutes. Discard the bay leaves. Sprinkle with the parsley.
