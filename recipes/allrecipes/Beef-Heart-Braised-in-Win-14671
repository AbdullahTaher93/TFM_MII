Wash the heart and remove any fat and arteries. Slice the heart in half, then slice it into 1/2 inch thick slices. Dredge heart in flour and season with salt and pepper. Heat the butter in large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the heart slices and cook for 30 to 45 seconds per side. Stir in the onion, carrots, potatoes, thyme, beef broth and wine. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 1 hour. Serve.
