Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. To make salsa, in a small bowl combine cucumber, chili, pineapple, lime peel, lime juice, and cilantro; mix lightly, then set aside. For tacos, in a wide nonstick frying pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until onion begins to brown (about 5 minutes). Add garlic, tomato, and green chilies; continue cooking and stirring until tomato is soft (about 5 more minutes). Remove from heat and mix in shrimp. Meanwhile, stack tortillas, wrap in foil, and heat until warm (about 10 minutes). To assemble each taco, spoon about 1/3 cup shrimp filling onto a tortilla; add salsa and other toppings to taste. Fold to enclose and eat out of hand.
