Coat a large nonstick skillet with nonstick spray and set over medium heat. In a small bowl, combine unbleached or all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, oat bran, pecans, baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, combine molasses and water. Stir in yogurt, eggs, and oil. Pour molasses mixture into flour mixture. Mix just until moistened. Gently stir in blueberries. Pour batter by 1/3 cupfuls into the skillet, making a few at a time. Cook 2 to 3 minutes, or until bubbly and edges look dry. Turn and cook 1 minute, or until underside is golden. Serve immediately.
