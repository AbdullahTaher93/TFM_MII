Mix soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, and garlic together in a small bowl. Pound chicken breast with a meat mallet to 3/8-inch thickness; cut into medallions. Place in a glass dish or resealable plastic bag. Pour in marinade, reserving 2 tablespoons for the bok choy. Refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours. Preheat Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven on the "Grill" setting. Brush the cut sides of the bok choy with the reserved 2 tablespoons marinade. Pat chicken medallions dry and place in the center of the grill. Place the bok choy cut-side down on either side of the chicken medallions. Grill for 2 1/2 minutes. Turn the chicken medallions and continue to grill for 2 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
