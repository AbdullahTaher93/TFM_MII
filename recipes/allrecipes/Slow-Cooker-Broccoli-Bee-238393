Pour sauce mixture over the beef. Cook on Low for 6 to 8 hours (or on High for 4 hours). Spoon 2 tablespoons liquid from the slow cooker into a bowl. Whisk cornstarch into the liquid and stir the cornstarch mixture into the liquid in the slow cooker until consistent in color. Cook on High until the sauce thickens, about 30 minutes.
