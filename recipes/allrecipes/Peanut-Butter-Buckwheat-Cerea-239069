Stir buckwheat groats, peanut butter, sugar, and sea salt together in a bowl to coat the groats completely. Set a food dehydrator to 118 degrees F (244 degrees C). Spread coated groats onto a sheet and dry in the dehydrator, occasionally breaking larger clumps into smaller bits, until dried, 12 to 24 hours.
