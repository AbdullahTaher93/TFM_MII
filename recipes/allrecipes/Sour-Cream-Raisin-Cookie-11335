In a large bowl, beat the butter or margarine, 1 1/2 cups sugar, eggs, and vanilla until fluffy. Sift flour with baking powder, baking soda and salt. At low speed, beat sour cream into the egg mixture, gradually beat in the flour until well mixed. Add raisins and mix by hand. Refrigerate dough for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets. Mix the 1/2 cup white sugar with the ground cinnamon. Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle cookies with the cinnamon sugar mixture. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks to cool.
