In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in banana, milk, orange peel and extracts. Combine flour, baking soda and salt; add to the creamed mixture just until moistened. Fold in the coconut, nuts and pineapple. Transfer to a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
