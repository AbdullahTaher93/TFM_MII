Bring a large pot of water to a boil. In a large skillet, cook garlic in olive oil for 1-2 minutes or until slightly yellow in color. Add kale and saute for 3-4 minutes. Deglaze with white wine. ADD the roasted red bell peppers and season with salt and pepper. In a separate skillet, toast pine nuts until slightly browned, then remove and set aside. Cook pasta, drain and toss with sauce. Remove from heat and add pine nuts and cheese. Stir to combine and serve.
