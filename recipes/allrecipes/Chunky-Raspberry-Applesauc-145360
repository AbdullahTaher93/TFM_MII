In a medium saucepan, combine apples, raspberry juice, and cinnamon. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until apples are tender when pierced with a fork. Melt preserves in a small saucepan or microwave in a small bowl. Strain to remove seeds; set aside. With electric mixer, beat apple mixture lightly to form a chunky sauce. Stir in preserves. Serve warm, or cover and refrigerate until serving time.
