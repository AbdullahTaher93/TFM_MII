Place 10 of the wafers in large resealable plastic bag; seal bag. Use rolling pin to roll over wafers in bag until finely crushed. Break remaining 4 wafers in half; set side. Pour milk into medium bowl. Add dry pudding mix. Beat with wire whisk 2 minutes or until well blended. Spoon 1/3 of the pudding evenly into 4 clear dessert cups; top each with about 1 Tbsp. of the crushed wafers. Repeat layers of pudding and crushed wafers; top with remaining pudding. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or until ready to serve. Decorate with gumdrops and licorice to resemble the antennae, stingers and eyes of bumble bees. Insert 2 of the reserved wafer halves into each cup for the "wings."
