In a bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, combine egg whites, milk and applesauce. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Pour into a 9-in. square baking pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Serve warm.
