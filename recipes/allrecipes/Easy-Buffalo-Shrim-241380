Combine butter and hot sauce in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until butter is melted, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and keep warm. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place cornstarch in a shallow bowl and lightly dip shrimp into the cornstarch. Fry shrimp, working in batches, in the hot oil until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer shrimp to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon. Add shrimp to the butter-hot sauce and allow to sit for 3 to 4 minutes.
