Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir in rice, and cook for 2 minutes. Pour in the coconut milk, chicken stock, cumin, coriander, red pepper flakes, salt, turmeric, bay leaf, raisins, and cashew halves. Bring to a boil, then cover, and reduce heat to low. Cook until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.
