Heat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine the mustard seeds and Dijon mustard. Cut a pocket, horizontally, in the side of each chop. Spread the inside of the pockets with the mustard mixture and stuff each with a slice of the cheese. Close each pocket with a toothpick or small skewer. Put the chops in a baking dish and sprinkle them with the pepper. Bake the chops until the cheese melts, about 15 minutes. Remove toothpicks or skewers before serving.
