In a large skillet, fry the chicken pieces and onion rings in hot oil until browned. Salt and pepper to taste. Add the sliced mushrooms and bell pepper and continue to saute for 5 minutes over medium heat. Add 1/2 of the garlic, 1/2 of the cilantro and 1/2 of the pepper flakes and stir until mixed. Add the other 1/2 of the garlic, cilantro and chile flakes, then add the sour cream and mix well. Add the hamburger relish and saute for another 5 to 10 minutes. Let cool and serve.
