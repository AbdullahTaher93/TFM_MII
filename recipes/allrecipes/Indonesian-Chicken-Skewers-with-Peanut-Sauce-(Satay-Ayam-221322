Combine chicken thighs, 3/4 teaspoon salt, white pepper, and sunflower seed oil in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. Soak wooden skewers in water to prevent burning during cooking. Bring water, peanut butter, kecap manis, brown sugar, garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a boil in a small saucepan; stir to combine. Remove from heat and add lime juice. Thread marinated chicken onto skewers. Set about 2 tablespoons peanut sauce aside in a small bowl and brush the sauce in the bowl over chicken. Heat a grill pan or large skillet over medium-high heat. Arrange chicken skewers in batches on grill pan and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Serve skewers with remaining peanut sauce from the saucepan.
