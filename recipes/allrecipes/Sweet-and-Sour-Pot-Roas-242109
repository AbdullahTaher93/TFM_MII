Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir roast and onions in hot oil until roast is browned and onions are soft, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir honey, sugar, lemon juice, black pepper, cloves, and salt into pot. Bring roast mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot with a lid, and simmer, turning roast every 45 minutes, until roast is tender, 3 to 3 1/2 hours. Remove the cover and continue simmering until cooking liquid reduces, about 15 minutes more.
