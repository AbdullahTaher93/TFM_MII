Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Coat a 2-quart (2-litre) baking dish with nonstick spray, and add the rice and coconut. In a medium bowl, whisk the milk, maple syrup, cinnamon, and eggs, and pour over the rice. Stir to combine. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F (160 degrees C) until set, 45 to 50 minutes.
