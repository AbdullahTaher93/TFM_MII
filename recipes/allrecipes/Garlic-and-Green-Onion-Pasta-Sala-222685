Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Let cool and transfer to a large salad bowl. Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat; cook and stir green onions and garlic until garlic is tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir butter mixture into the bow tie pasta and mix in parsley.
