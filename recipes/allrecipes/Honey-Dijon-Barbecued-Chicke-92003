If using charcoal, ignite 60 briquets on the firegrate of a barbecue with a lid. When briquets are dotted with gray ash, in 15 to 20 minutes, push equal amounts to opposite sides of firegrate. Set a drip pan on firegrate between mounds. If using a gas barbecue, turn all burners to high and close lid for 10 minutes. Adjust burners for indirect cooking (heat on opposite sides of grill, not down center); keep heat on high. Rinse chicken and pat dry. Set chicken on grill, not directly over heat. Cover (open vents for charcoal) and cook 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix honey, mustard, ginger, garlic, and Worcestershire. Brush drumsticks generously with honey mixture. Cover and cook another 5 minutes. Turn drumsticks; baste with honey mixture. Cover and cook until meat is no longer pink at bone in thickest part (cut to test), about 5 minutes longer. Transfer to a platter. Add salt and pepper to taste.
