Place 3 tortillas on a large greased baking sheet. Sprinkle each with sausage, red pepper, green onion and cheese. Top each with a tortilla. Place baking sheet on the center oven rack; preheat the oven's broiler. Broil for 2 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Cut into wedges. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Serve with salsa, if desired.
