In a mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda. Cut in shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in cheese. Add buttermilk; stir just until dough clings together. On a lightly floured surface, knead dough lightly until easy to handle. Roll into a 12-in. circle. Cut into eight wedges. Begin at wide end of wedge and roll toward point. Place biscuits, point side down, on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 450 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
