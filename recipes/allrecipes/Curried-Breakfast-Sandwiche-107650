Toast English muffins. Spread with butter, if desired. Poach eggs to desired doneness. Top 4 English muffin halves with 1 slice of ham, 1 poached egg, 1 ounce of cheese, of the sliced garlic, and a dusting of curry powder. Salt and pepper to taste. Top with remaining muffin haves, buttered side down. If you prefer the cheese completely melted, warm muffin on low for about 1 minute.
