Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer blackberry mixture for 10 minutes. Add whole habanero peppers and continue to simmer until sauce is thickened, about 20 minutes more. Remove and discard habanero peppers. Pour barbecue sauce into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth.
