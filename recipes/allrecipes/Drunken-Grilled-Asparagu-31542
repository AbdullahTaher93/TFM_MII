In a medium bowl, whisk together Burgundy wine, olive oil, brown mustard, garlic powder, black pepper and salt. Place asparagus in a large glass bowl, and cover with the Burgundy wine mixture. Cover bowl, and marinate asparagus in the refrigerator at least 2 hours, turning occasionally. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate. Grill asparagus 10 minutes, or to desired tenderness.
