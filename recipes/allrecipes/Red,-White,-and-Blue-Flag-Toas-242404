Toast slices of bread. Spread each piece of toast with 2 tablespoons cream cheese. Spread 1 teaspoon strawberry jam over the cream cheese except on the upper left quarter. Make 3 rows of 3 blueberries each in the upper left quarter, creating "stars." Make 3 rows of banana pieces, starting adjacent to the middle row of berries. Place the remaining 2 rows beneath the last row of berries, creating the "stripes."
