Bring a medium sized skillet to medium heat, add 2 tablespoons oil and allow to warm through. Add garlic and saute until it turns lightly brown or for 1 minute. Add sauce and season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low and allow mixture to simmer for 5 minutes to develop the flavor. Meanwhile cook pasta according to package directions. Drain pasta and toss with the sauce. Remove the skillet from the heat and add the cheese, basil and remaining olive oil; stir to combine.
