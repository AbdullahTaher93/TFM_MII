Toast the wheat germ in a skillet over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until browned and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Pour wheat germ onto a plate, and set aside to cool. Place yogurt, peanut butter, and sugar into a blender, and blend until smooth. Toss sauerkraut with peanut dressing; refrigerate for 30 minutes to allow the flavors to blend. Toss with toasted wheat germ just before serving.
