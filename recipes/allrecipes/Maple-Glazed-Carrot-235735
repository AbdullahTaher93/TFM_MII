Place carrots into a pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and transfer carrots to a serving bowl. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir maple syrup into melted butter and cook until warmed, 1 to 2 more minutes. Pour butter-maple syrup over carrots and toss to coat; season with salt and pepper.
