Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and maple sausage, and cook until no longer pink. Gradually mix in flour, while stirring continuously, until the mixture is thick and pasty. You may not need all of the flour. Slowly whisk in the milk using a fork so that lumps do not form. Stir in bouillon. Continue cooking and stirring constantly until the mixture reaches your desired consistency. The longer it cooks, the thicker it will get. Toast slices of white bread, and top with the meat gravy. Garnish with a little fresh parsley, and serve.
