In a large saucepan over medium heat, cook the garlic, onion, and 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of the broth for 5 minutes, or until the onion is translucent. Stir in the chickpeas, carrots, curry powder, turmeric, salt, ginger, pepper, and remaining broth. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Let cool slightly. Transfer to a blender or food processor, working in batches if necessary. Process until smooth. Return to the pan. Stir in the milk and parsley. Toast the bread and serve atop each serving.
