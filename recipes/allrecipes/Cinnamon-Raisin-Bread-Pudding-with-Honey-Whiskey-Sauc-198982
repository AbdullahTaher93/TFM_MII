To make pudding: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Coat an 8 8-inch baking dish with non-stick cooking spray. Set aside. Place bread cubes into prepared pan. Beat eggs with a whisk. Add salt, milk, SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend, margarine, vanilla, and nutmeg. Beat to blend. Pour evenly over bread cubes. Press bread with the back of a fork until bread absorbs liquid. Let stand 15 minutes at room temperature. Bake 35 to 40 minutes, or until risen and only slightly jiggly in center. If top is browning too fast during baking, cover lightly with a sheet of aluminum foil. To make sauce: While pudding is baking, place a small skillet over medium heat, and add honey, SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend, whiskey, and cinnamon. Cook, stirring, until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Add 1 to 2 teaspoons water until sauce reaches desired consistency. (Remember: It will become thicker as it cools.) To serve: Spoon warm pudding onto 9 dessert plates. Drizzle each with honey whiskey sauce.
