In a bowl, combine the spinach, soup mix, mayonnaise and sour cream; cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. In another bowl, combine the crab, cream cheese, chutney, garlic powder and onion powder; cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Spread the spinach mixture on six tortillas. Spread the crab mixture on remaining tortillas. Place one crab tortilla over each spinach tortilla. Roll up tightly, jelly-roll style, and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Cut each roll into seven slices. Refrigerate any leftovers.
