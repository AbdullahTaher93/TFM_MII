Preheat broiler. Arrange pepper strips and onion slices on a broiler rack above a baking pan. Drizzle vegetables evenly with oil and sprinkle with salt to taste. Broil vegetables 4 to 6 inches from heat until lightly charred in spots, 12 to 13 minutes. While vegetables cook, in a bowl combine beef, 3 tablespoon barbecue sauce, green onions, hot pepper seasoning, and salt to taste. Mix gently just until blended. With your hands, divide meat mixture into 4 equal portions. Shape into patties roughly 4 inches wide and 3/4-inch thick. When pepper and onions are done, transfer them to a plate and keep warm. Arrange burgers on broiler rack and broil 4 to 6 inches from heat until tops are well browned, about 6 minutes. With a spatula, turn burgers over and broil 4 more minutes. Brush tops equally with remaining barbecue sauce and broil until meat is no longer pink in center, 1 to 2 more minutes. Arrange bread slices on individual plates. If desired, spread with blue cheese dressing to taste. Top each slice with a burger and equal portions of peppers and onions. Drizzle with more dressing if desired.
