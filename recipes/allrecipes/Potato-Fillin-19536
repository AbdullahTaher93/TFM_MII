Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease one 2 quart casserole dish. In a large bowl, mix together the potatoes, white bread, onion, celery, salt and pepper.
