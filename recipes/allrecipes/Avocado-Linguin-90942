In a 6- to 8-quart pan, bring about 4 quarts water to a boil over high heat; stir in pasta and cook, uncovered, until just tender to bite (8 to 10 minutes). Or cook pasta according to package directions. Meanwhile, pit and peel avocado, then cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Place slices on a plate, sprinkle with lemon juice, and set aside. Drain pasta well, then return to cooking pan. Set pan over low heat. Add cheese, yogurt, and broth; mix, lifting with 2 forks, until cheese is melted and almost all liquid has been absorbed. Season to taste with salt and pepper. To serve, pour pasta onto a platter. Arrange avocado slices atop pasta; sprinkle with sunflower seeds and parsley.
