In a saucepan, simmer the water, lime zest and cinnamon until the water turns golden, 15 minutes. Strain into a heatproof bowl and refrigerate until chilled, for 1 hour or up to 1 week. Whisk in the sugar, coconut milk, evaporated milk, vanilla, egg yolks and rum until the sugar dissolves. Refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour. Stir and serve in small glasses.
