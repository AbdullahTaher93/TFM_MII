Pierce meat with a fork so marinade can penetrate. Combine teriyaki sauce and oil. Reserve 2 tablespoons in separate bowl. Pour remainder of marinade over meat cubes and marinate 1 hour, turning occasionally. Thread meat on skewers alternating meat with vegetables and pineapple chunks. Place on grill 4 to 5 inches from heat and cook 15 minutes. Turn skewers and brush ingredients with reserved marinade, and cook to desired doneness.
