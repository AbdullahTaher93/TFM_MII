Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place pecans in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet; toast in oven until they are light golden and aromatic, about 7 minutes. Shake pan halfway through baking to make sure the nuts toast evenly. Set aside to cool. In a medium saute pan set over medium-high heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter. Add apples; cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons sugar over apples; cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar has dissolved and caramelized, about 8 minutes. Stir in lemon juice, cinnamon, and raisins. Remove pan from heat; set aside. Break matzo sheets into 3-inch pieces, and place in a colander set in the sink. Pour 3 cups boiling water, one cup at a time, over the matzo, and drain. In a medium bowl, whisk eggs. Add salt and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. Stir in the soaked matzo; mix until well coated. Melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a large skillet set over medium-high heat. Add matzo mixture, and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 10 minutes. Stir in two-thirds of the apple mixture until warm; transfer to a serving plate. Garnish with the reserved toasted pecans and the remaining apple mixture. Serve immediately.
