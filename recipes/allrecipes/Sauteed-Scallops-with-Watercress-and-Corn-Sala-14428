Whisk together the mustard, vinegar and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Salt and pepper to taste. In a large skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil over moderately high heat and saute the scallops until they are golden and cooked through. With a slotted spoon transfer the scallops to a bowl and keep them warm. To the skillet add the shallot and about 1 tablespoon of the vinaigrette and cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring, until the shallot is softened. Remove skillet from the heat, add the scallops, and shake the skillet to coat with the vinaigrette. In a mixing bowl toss the remaining vinaigrette with the watercress, carrot, and corn, divide the salad between 2 dinner plates, and arrange half the scallops around each salad.
