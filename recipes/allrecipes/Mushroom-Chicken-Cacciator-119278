In a large skillet, brown chicken in oil on both sides. Transfer to a slow cooker. In a bowl, combine the tomato sauce, mushrooms, onion, wine or broth, garlic, oregano, thyme, salt and pepper; pour over chicken. Cover and cook on low for 4-5 hours or until chicken juices run clear. Serve over spaghetti.
