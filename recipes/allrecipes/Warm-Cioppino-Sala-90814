In a small bowl, whisk together lemon juice, Worcestershire, basil, oregano, and garlic. Set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add shrimp and stir constantly until shrimp are pink and no longer translucent in center (cut to test), about 2 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer cooked shrimp to a small bowl and set aside. Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil, the mushrooms, and zucchini to pan. Stir often until zucchini is tender-crisp to bite, about 3 minutes. Return shrimp to pan along with tomatoes and their juices, olives, and the lemon juice mixture. Stir often until heated through. Put spinach in a large, wide bowl; pour hot mixture over greens, top with crab, and mix gently. Serve immediately. Add salt to taste.
