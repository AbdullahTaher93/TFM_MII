Using a sharp knife, peel the oranges, tangerines and clementines, removing all the bitter white pith. Slice the clementines crosswise 1/2 inch thick and remove the pits. Transfer the clementines to a medium bowl. Working over the bowl, cut between the membranes of the oranges and tangerines, releasing the sections into the bowl. Add the shallot and mint. In a large bowl, whisk the lime juice with the walnut oil and creme fraiche. Add the arugula, season with salt and pepper and toss gently. Using tongs, transfer the arugula to plates. Add the citrus fruits to the remaining dressing, season with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Top the arugula with the citrus and serve.
