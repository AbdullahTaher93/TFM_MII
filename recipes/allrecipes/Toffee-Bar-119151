Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10x15-inch baking pan. Cream butter and brown sugar in a bowl; beat in egg yolk and vanilla extract. Gradually add flour and salt, beating dough until smooth. Press into prepared baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown, 17 to 19 minutes. Remove from oven and place chocolate bar pieces on top; return to the oven just until chocolate is shiny and melted, about 1 minute. Spread melted chocolate in a layer, making decorative swirls; sprinkle with pecans. Allow to cool until chocolate topping is set, about 1 hour. Cut into bars to serve.
