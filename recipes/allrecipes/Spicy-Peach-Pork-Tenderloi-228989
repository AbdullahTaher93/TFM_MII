Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix honey, olive oil, lime juice, chipotle pepper, 3 tablespoons adobo sauce, and garlic together in a bowl. Place tenderloin in a baking dish; top with peach slices. Pour honey sauce over tenderloin. Cover with a lid or aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until meat is no longer pink in the center, 30 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let rest for 10 minutes; cut into very thin slices. Serve topped with the cooked peaches and pan juices.
