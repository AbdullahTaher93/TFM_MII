Heat olive oil in a stockpot over low heat; cook and stir onion in the hot oil until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Cook and stir tomatoes, za'atar, paprika, cumin, garlic powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper into onion mixture; stir to coat. Add carrot juice, water, chicken bouillon cube, tomato-flavored bouillon cube, lentils, and bulgur; cook over low heat until lentils are tender and bulgur has absorbed liquid, 30 to 40 minutes. Ladle about 2/3 the lentil mixture into a blender and puree until smooth. Return puree to stockpot and stir. Simmer over low heat for about 5 more minutes to blend flavors. Remove from heat; stir lemon juice and cilantro into soup. Top individual servings with a dollop of sour cream.
