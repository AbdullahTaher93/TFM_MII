Cook bacon in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until crisp. Remove bacon from pan. Add onion, carrots and garlic to drippings in pan; saute 5 minutes. Add beans, broth, and water; and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add kale; simmer 10 minutes, or until kale is tender. Stir in crumbled bacon just before serving.
