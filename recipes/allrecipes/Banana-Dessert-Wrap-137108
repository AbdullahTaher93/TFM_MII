Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Spread coconut and pecans separately on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 5 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until light golden brown; set aside. Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F. Remove pie crust from pouch; place flat onto work surface. With rolling pin, roll crust until 12 inches in diameter. In small bowl, mix sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Reserve 1 tablespoon sugar mixture; sprinkle remaining sugar mixture evenly over crust. Cut crust into 4 wedge-shaped pieces. Place 1 banana lengthwise on each crust wedge, about 3/4 inch from curved edge (if banana is too long, trim ends to fit within crust, at least 1/4 inch from each edge). Push about 1 rounded tablespoon chocolate chips, points first, into top and sides of each banana. Bring curved edge and point of each crust wedge up over banana to meet; pinch seam and ends to seal, shaping crust around banana. Sprinkle tops of wrapped bananas with reserved 1 tablespoon sugar mixture; place on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 10 to 14 minutes or until golden brown. Immediately remove from cookie sheet. Cool 5 minutes. To serve, drizzle or spread about 2 tablespoons warm caramel topping on each individual dessert plate. Top each with baked banana, whipped cream and additional caramel topping, if desired. Sprinkle coconut and pecans over top of each. Serve with ice cream.
