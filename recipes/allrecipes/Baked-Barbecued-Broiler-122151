Place chickens, breast side up, in a large shallow roasting pan. Combine the remaining ingredients; pour over chickens. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1 hour. Cover and bake 20-30 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees F and juices run clear. Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting.
