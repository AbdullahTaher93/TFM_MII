Spread 1 ounce cheese on a tortilla. Top with another tortilla and place in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until the bottom is lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Turn over and cook until the cheese is melted and the second side is lightly toasted. Transfer to a plate and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and the remaining cheese to make 4 quesadillas altogether. Cut each into quarters and serve with salsa.
