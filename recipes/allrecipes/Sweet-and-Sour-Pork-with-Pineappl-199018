For pork and pineapple: Drain pineapple, reserving juice. Pour 1/4 cup of juice into 1-gallon zipper-lock plastic bag. Reserve remaining juice. To the bag, add soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and pork. Press air out of bag, seal, and refrigerate 3 to 4 hours. (Refrigerate remaining pineapple juice.) After marinating pork, combine flour, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Remove pork from marinade to paper towels and pat dry. Reserve marinade. Add pork to flour mixture and toss until well-coated. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large, deep non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add half of pork and cook until browned all over, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove and keep warm. Repeat with remaining oil and pork. Remove cooked pork to a plate. For sauce and vegetables: Add reserved marinade to pan and simmer over medium-high heat 4 to 5 minutes. In a medium bowl, whisk ketchup, SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, and remaining pineapple juice. Pour into pan and simmer 2 to 3 minutes, scraping pan bottom to loosen any browned bits. Add onions and peppers and simmer 1 minute. Add pork and pineapple, reduce heat to medium, and simmer 4 to 6 minutes, or until vegetables are crisp-tender, and sauce is slightly thickened.
