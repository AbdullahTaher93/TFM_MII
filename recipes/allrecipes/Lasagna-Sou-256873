Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook hot and mild sausage, stirring to break up into pieces, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add onions; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir tomato paste into the paste. Fill tomato paste can with water and pour in; mix well. Pour in beef broth, diced tomatoes, crushed tomatoes, and wine. Stir in basil sprigs, salt, and pepper. Bring soup to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until flavors combine, at least 30 minutes. Mix ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain. Divide pasta among serving bowls; spoon some of the ricotta cheese mixture on top. Ladle soup over cheese mixture.
