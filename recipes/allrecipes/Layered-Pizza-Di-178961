Spread the ricotta cheese in an even layer in a 9 inch pie plate. Top with 1/4 cup of the pepperoni and 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. Carefully spread the pasta sauce over the cheese. Sprinkle with the remaining pepperoni and mozzarella cheese. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15 minutes or until hot. Let cool for 5 minutes. Serve with the garlic bread or crackers for dipping.
