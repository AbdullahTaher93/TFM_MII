Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Spray a cookie sheet with cooking spray. Arrange the polenta slices on the sheet and spray them lightly with cooking spray. Broil until lightly browned about 5 minutes; turn and broil other side for 5 minutes. Keep warm. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the sausage, breaking it up as it browns. When sausage has lost any pink color, add the onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, zucchini, and Italian seasoning. Cook until vegetables are crisp tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the spaghetti sauce and cook until heated through and just starting to simmer. To serve, spoon the sauce on slices of polenta. Top with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese.
