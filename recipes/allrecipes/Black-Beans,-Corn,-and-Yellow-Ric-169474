Bring the rice, water, and olive oil to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Mix together the beans, corn, lime juice, and cumin in a large bowl. Stir in the cooked rice and serve.
