Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Arrange asparagus pieces on a baking sheet. Drizzle 2 tablespoons olive oil over the asparagus; toss gently to coat and spread into a single layer. Roast asparagus in preheated oven until tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside to cool. Combine honey, white wine vinegar, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and garlic in a jar; seal tightly and shake vigorously to blend into a salad dressing. Arrange salad greens onto a large platter; top with apple slices, shredded white Cheddar cheese, and cooled asparagus. Drizzle the salad dressing over the salad greens and toppings.
