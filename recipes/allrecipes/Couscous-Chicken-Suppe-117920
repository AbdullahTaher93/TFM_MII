Place the squash and peppers in an ungreased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Sprinkle with rosemary, salt and pepper. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil; gently stir to coat. Broil 4 in. from the heat for 10-15 minutes or until tender, stirring every 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, cook chicken and garlic in remaining oil until chicken juices run clear; remove and keep warm. Add broth and onion to the skillet; bring to a boil. Stir in couscous. Cover and remove from the heat; let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Cut chicken into strips. Serve with couscous and vegetables.
