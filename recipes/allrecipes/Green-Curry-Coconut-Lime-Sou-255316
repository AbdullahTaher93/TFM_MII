Warm coconut milk in a saucepan over medium heat, about 5 minutes. Whisk in green curry paste, lime juice, salt, pepper, hot sauce, and cumin. Stir in chicken, mushrooms, and white part of the green onion. Simmer soup until flavors combine, 5 to 10 minutes. Ladle soup into bowls and garnish with remaining green onion.
