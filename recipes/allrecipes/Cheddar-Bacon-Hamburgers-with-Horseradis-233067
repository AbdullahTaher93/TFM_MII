Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Mix ground beef, Cheddar cheese, bacon bits, horseradish, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Divide beef mixture into 4 equal parts and shape into patties. Grill on the preheated grill until patties are no longer pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) for well-done. Serve patties with hamburger buns.
