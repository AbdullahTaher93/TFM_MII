Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Line large cookie sheet with foil; lightly spray foil with cooking spray. In medium bowl, mix bread crumbs, raisins, brown sugar, coconut and walnuts. In small bowl, beat egg white and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla with wire whisk about 30 seconds or until frothy. Stir into brown sugar mixture until well blended. In another small bowl, place fruit spread; stir with fork to break up any large pieces of fruit. Cut 16x12-inch sheet of waxed paper; place on work surface. With fine strainer, sift 1 tablespoon powdered sugar onto paper. Unroll dough onto sugared paper; press into 14x7-inch rectangle, firmly pressing perforations to seal. Spread fruit spread over dough to edges. With pizza cutter, cut dough in half crosswise to make 2 (7-inch) squares. Top 1 dough square with brown sugar mixture, spreading evenly over fruit spread to edges of dough. With waxed paper, lift remaining dough square and turn upside down over brown sugar mixture; lightly press. Remove paper. With pizza cutter, cut filled dough into 7 (1-inch-wide) strips. Carefully twist each strip 3 times; shape into loose knot, tucking ends under (dough will be sticky). Place 3 inches apart on cookie sheet. Bake 17 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove pastries from cookie sheet; place on wire racks. Cool 15 minutes. In small bowl, blend 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1/8 teaspoon vanilla and enough water for desired drizzling consistency. Drizzle glaze over cooled pastries. If desired, place small bowl of softened butter in center of serving platter; arrange pastries on platter around bowl.
