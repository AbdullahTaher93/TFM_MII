In a blender container, combine yogurt, Nakano seasoned rice vinegar and remaining ingredients except chicken. Cover and run on high until smooth. Place chicken in a non-metallic bowl or sealable plastic bag. Add marinade and stir to coat chicken. Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight, stirring chicken one or more times while marinating. If using wood skewers, soak skewers in water 30 minutes. Drain chicken well and discard marinade. Thread chicken onto skewers. Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Grill kebobs about 8 minutes over direct heat with cover closed. Use a metal spatula to turn kebobs. Grill with cover closed 6-8 minutes more or until chicken is no longer pink inside
