Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. Combine the beef, capers, eggs, olives, garlic powder, oregano, feta cheese, and bread crumbs in a bowl. Divide and form the mixture into 4 patties. Cook burgers on preheated grill about 6 minutes, turning once, to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), or to desired doneness.
