Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir shallot in the melted butter until translucent, about 3 minutes. Pour wine into the skillet. Add mussels, increase heat to high, cover and cook, shaking the skillet occasionally, until the mussels completely open, about 5 minutes. Discard any unopened mussels. Transfer mussels to a bowl and garnish with parsley.
