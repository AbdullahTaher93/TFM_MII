Place the olive oil in a deep, heavy pot, and heat over medium-high heat. Stir in the onion, garlic, and 1 red pepper; cook until onion is transparent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the black beans. Add the mango, banana, cumin, ginger, and hot pepper sauce; stir and cook until fruit softens. Pour in the coconut milk and vegetable broth. Bring soup mixture to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low, and simmer until liquid reduces, about 1 hour. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Place soup in batches into a blender, and blend until smooth; or use a stick blender to blend in the soup pot. Serve garnished with dollops of sour cream and sprinkled with red bell pepper.
