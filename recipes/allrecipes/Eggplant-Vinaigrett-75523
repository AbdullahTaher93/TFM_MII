Rinse eggplants, and remove the stems. Place in a large pot of lightly salted water. Bring to a boil, and cook for 10 minutes. Drain, and set aside to cool. In a medium bowl, stir together the garlic, salt, pepper, and cayenne. Cut a slit lengthwise down the center of each eggplant, and pack full of the garlic mixture. Place the eggplants in a glass jar, or glass baking dish. Whisk together the oil and vinegar, and pour over the egg plants to cover. Refrigerate for 2 days before slicing and serving.
