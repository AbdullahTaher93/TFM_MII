Preheat oven to Broil/Grill and line broiler pan with aluminum foil. Place chicken on pan. In a small bowl combine the butter, garlic, parsley, rosemary and thyme and mix together, then evenly spread a dollop of mixture on each chicken breast. Broil in preheated oven, turning and frequently coating with remaining herb/butter mixture, for about 15 minutes or until chicken juices run clear.
