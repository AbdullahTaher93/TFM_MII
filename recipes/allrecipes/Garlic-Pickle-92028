In a 3-quart pan, combine vinegar, sugar, salt, and pickling spices. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Drop in garlic, then boil, uncovered, stirring several times, for 1 minute. Remove from heat and let cool. Pour into jars, cover tightly, and refrigerate for at least 1 day or up to 2 months.
