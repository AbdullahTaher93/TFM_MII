Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease an 11x7 inch baking pan. In a large mixing bowl, combine cornmeal mix and salt. In a separate bowl, mix together eggs, cottage cheese, onion and butter. Stir the egg and cheese mixture into the flour mixture. Fold in the broccoli. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the pan comes out clean.
