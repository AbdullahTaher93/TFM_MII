Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Combine brown sugar, butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla and salt in large bowl. Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until well mixed (1 to 2 minutes). Reduce speed to low; add flour, 1/4 cup chocolate chips and milk. Beat until well mixed (1 to 2 minutes). Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Place 1 inch apart onto ungreased cookie sheets. Make indentation in center of each cookie with thumb. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until lightly browned. (If necessary, make indentation in top of cookie again.) Cool completely. Sprinkle cookies with powdered sugar. Melt 3/4 cup chocolate chips and shortening in 1-quart saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally, until smooth (1 to 2 minutes). Cool slightly. Stir in corn syrup, water and vanilla. Spoon about 1 teaspoon filling into each cookie indentation.
