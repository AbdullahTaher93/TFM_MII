Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Pierce the sweet potato in several places with a fork. Roast the sweet potato in preheated oven until easily pierced with a fork, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, place the poblano pepper, soy butter, lime juice, and pepper in the bowl of a food processor. Process until well blended, about 1 minute. If not using immediately, place poblano-soy butter in a covered container and refrigerate up to 1 month. To serve, slice the sweet potato in half and spread with 1 tablespoon poblano butter.
