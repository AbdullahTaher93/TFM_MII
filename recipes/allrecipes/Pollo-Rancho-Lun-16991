Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and saute for 1 minute; set aside. In a separate medium bowl, combine the remaining oil, onion, orange juice, lemon juice and wine. Add the heated garlic and oil to this and mix well. Place chicken pieces in a 9x13 inch baking dish and pour the juice mixture over the chicken, coating well. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour, basting occasionally with the sauce.
