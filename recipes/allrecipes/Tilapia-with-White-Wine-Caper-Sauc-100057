Place flour in a shallow dish. Season fish with salt and pepper and dredge in flour. Heat oil and 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When butter starts to turn nutty brown, add fish; fry until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes each side. Transfer fish to plates and cover to keep warm. Add wine to the hot empty skillet and using a spatula, scrape any browned bits from the bottom. Let the wine reduce by half and then stir in the garlic, remaining butter and capers. Let sauce simmer for 1 to 2 minutes to blend the flavors. Pour a portion of sauce over each piece of fish and serve immediately.
