In a covered 5- to 6-quart nonstick pan over high heat, bring 2 1/2 to 3 quarts water to a boil. Add shrimp and linguine to boiling water; cook, uncovered, until pasta is barely tender to bite and shrimp are opaque but still moist-looking in center of thickest part (cut to test), 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer pasta and shrimp to a colander, rinse with hot water, and drain. Break off and discard tough stem ends from asparagus. Rinse asparagus and cut diagonally into 1 1/4-inch lengths. Rinse pan and return to high heat. When dry, add oil, garlic, and asparagus. Stir often until garlic begins to brown, about 2 minutes. Add tomatoes, cilantro, and 1/2 cup broth; bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium. Pour drained pasta and shrimp into pan. Mix until pasta is hot, 1 to 2 minutes. For a moister dish, add 2 to 4 more tablespoons of broth. Divide pasta and shrimp among individual plates to serve. Offer salt and pepper to add to taste.
