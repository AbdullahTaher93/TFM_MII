In a shallow dish, stir together bread crumbs, cheese, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon pepper and 1 teaspoon salt. In another shallow dish, mix egg with water until blended. Squeeze juice from lemon over turkey slices. Dip turkey slices into egg mixture and then into crumbs. Dip each a second time in egg, then crumbs, to coat completely. Set aside. Heat oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Place slices in pan without crowding. (It may be necessary to do this in batches.) Cook on each side until golden and cooked through, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove to towels. Serve with lemon and capers if desired.
