Cook ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes; drain excess grease and transfer ground beef to a large saucepan. Mix tomato juice, yellow mustard, black pepper, hot pepper sauce, chili powder, red pepper flakes, and salt into the beef. Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 1 hour, stirring frequently.
