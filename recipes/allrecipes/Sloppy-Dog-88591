Crumble the ground beef into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until evenly browned. Drain off grease, and reduce the heat to medium. Stir in the sloppy joe sauce, and bring to a simmer. Add the hot dogs, and cook until heated through. Place hot dogs into buns and cover with the sloppy joe mixture. Eat with a fork, or use just a little bit of the sauce and eat like a regular hot dog.
