Heat your grill to medium. On the stove, heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the peppers, onions, and garlic. Cook for 10 minutes, or until soft. Stir in the tomatoes, mushrooms, and rosemary. Boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for about 20 minutes. Slice the polenta into 1/2-inch-thick pucks. Coat both sides of each puck with cooking spray. Slap the pucks and sausage on the grill and close the lid (with the vents open). Grill, turning a few times, for about 5 minutes per side, or until cooked through. Remove the sausage to a cutting board, slice it up, add it to the sauce, and cook for 10 minutes. Dump the sauced sausage over the pucks.
