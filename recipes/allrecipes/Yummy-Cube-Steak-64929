In a large resealable plastic bag, place the cube steak, flour, salt, and pepper. Seal, and shake to coat. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and brown the cube steak. Reduce heat to low, and mix in the tomatoes, tomato sauce, onion, and Italian seasoning. Cover, and simmer at least 1 hour, stirring once. Place the zucchini in the skillet, and coat with the tomato sauce. Continue to simmer uncovered 10 minutes, or until zucchini is tender.
