For the vinaigrette, mix all ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside. In another small mixing bowl, mix hamachi with jalapenos, Chilean Hass avocados, chives and salt. Add two to three ounces of the vinaigrette, stir with spoon to incorporate. Place a 1/2 ounce of tar tare onto the top of each taro root chip and serve.
