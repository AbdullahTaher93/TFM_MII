Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Pour crumbled saltine crackers into a large bowl. Press chicken pieces into crackers to coat completely; let rest for 10 minutes. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute chicken pieces in hot butter until browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer chicken to a casserole dish. Saute mushrooms and onion in the same skillet until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour chicken broth, white wine, salt, pepper, and tarragon into onion mixture and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Pour mushroom mixture over chicken into the casserole dish. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is cooked through and sauce is bubbling, about 45 minutes.
