Bring about 1/2 inch water to boil in large skillet. Add asparagus; cover. Simmer 3 to 4 min. or until asparagus is crisp-tender; drain. Rinse asparagus with cold water; drain well on paper towels. Meanwhile, mix mustard and lemon juice in small bowl. Gradually add oil, whisking constantly until well blended and thickened. Place asparagus on plate; top with mustard sauce, cheese and lemon zest.
