In a self-closing plastic bag, combine flour and Jamaican jerk seasoning. Add chops, 2 at a time; shake to coat. Reserve flour mixture. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet. Brown chops on both sides over medium-high heat; remove from skillet. Stir in reserved flour mixture, brown sugar and vinegar; bring to a boil. Stir in pineapple, bell pepper and beans. Return chops to skillet. Reduce heat; cover and simmer 10 minutes or until chops are done. Garnish with chopped green onions.
