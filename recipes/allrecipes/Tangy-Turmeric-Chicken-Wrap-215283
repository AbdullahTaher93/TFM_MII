Whisk together the yogurt, onion, lemon juice, turmeric, cumin, paprika, salt, ginger, cayenne pepper, and black pepper in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add the chicken and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the chicken from the marinade, and shake off excess. Cook the chicken on the preheated grill until well-browned and no longer pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. Set aside. Pour the water, oil, and remaining marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until thickened and bubbling, about 10 minutes; stir in the chicken. Serve chicken on the pita breads, and top with cucumber and parsley.
