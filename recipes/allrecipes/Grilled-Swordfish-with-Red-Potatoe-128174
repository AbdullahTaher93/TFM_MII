In a shallow baking dish, combine 2 tablespoons (25 mL) of the lemon juice, 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of the oil, the herbal seasoning, and bay leaves. Add the fish and turn to coat both sides. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, turning occasionally, for 2 to 4 hours. Fire up the grill and coat a grill rack with nonstick spray. Place the rack over medium-hot coals and grill the fish and potato halves, brushing with the marinade, until the fish is cooked through and the potatoes are tender, about 5 to 7 minutes on each side. In a cup, combine the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons (22 mL) of lemon juice, the remaining 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of oil, and the parsley. Drizzle the seasoned juice over the fish and potatoes before serving.
