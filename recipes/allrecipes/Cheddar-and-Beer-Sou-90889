In a 4- to 5-quart pan, combine butter, celery, carrots, and onion over medium-high heat. Stir often until vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes. Stir in flour, mustard, and thyme; cook for 1 minute. Gradually add broth, whisking well after each addition until smooth. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are very tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Stir in cheddar and parmesan cheeses; when melted, add beer and heat until steaming. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Garnish with parmesan crisps.
