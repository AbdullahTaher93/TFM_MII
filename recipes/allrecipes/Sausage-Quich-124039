Unroll one tube of the rolls; press dough onto the bottom and up the sides of a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking pan to form a crust. Seal perforations. Sprinkle sausage over crust. In a skillet, saute onion in butter until tender; add mushrooms. Spoon over sausage. Top with cheeses and pimientos. In a bowl, beat eggs, cream, parsley, salt, pepper and garlic powder; pour over all. Unroll second tube of rolls; seal perforations. Cut dough into 1/2-in. lengthwise strips. Use strips to form a lattice crust over top of quiche. Sprinkle with paprika. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-55 minutes; cover loosely with foil if browning too quickly. Let stand 10-15 minutes before cutting.
