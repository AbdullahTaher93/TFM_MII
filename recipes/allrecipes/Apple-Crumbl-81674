Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Prepare the topping first. In a mixing bowl, add the almond meal, rolled oats, Splenda and cinnamon. Stir until blended. Add the softened butter and cut through forming a crumble about the size of peas or smaller. Place in the refrigerator while you prepare the apples. I like to leave the skin on the apple, but I think many people will want to peel their apple (to each their own). Cut the apple into cubes. Place in the mixing bowl with the pecan. In a sauce pan over high heat, add the water, Splenda, cinnamon, allspice and vanilla. Bring to a boil. Pour over the apples and pecans and stir. Let sit for 1-2 minutes. Stir in the sour cream. Stir until incorporated. Divide apple mixture between the two ramekins (or place in a single casserole dish). Crumble the topping over each and bake in a 375 degrees F oven for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 or 10 minutes before serving.
