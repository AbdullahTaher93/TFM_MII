Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a saucepan over medium-low heat, brown breadcrumbs with butter until golden, about 8 minutes. Once cooled, combine with tomatoes, parsley, garlic, Romano and salt in a large bowl. Mix with beaten egg and milk to incorporate. Add ground turkey to the mixture and combine by hand. Form into medium-sized balls and arrange on a large baking sheet. Bake for about 25-28 minutes, or until cooked through. Be sure to turn halfway through cook time. In the meantime, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for pasta. Cook according to package directions. Pulse tomatoes, pine nuts, garlic and Romano in a food processor until just roughly chopped. Add basil leaves, olive oil and salt, then pulse to smooth pesto consistency. In a large saucepan, combine tomato pesto mixture, goat cheese and cream. Stir over low heat until incorporated. Toss hot pasta with sauce and cook together for another 2 minutes to coat. Serve meatballs with sun-dried tomato pasta and sauce.
