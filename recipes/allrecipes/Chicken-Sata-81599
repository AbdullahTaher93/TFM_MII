Making the Sauce: In a dry pan over medium-high heat, add the coriander and cumin stirring until they are toasted and fragrant (less than a minute). Add sesame oil, garlic and chili powder. Stir for a minute. Then add the peanut butter and stir. Then add the water, soy sauce, and lemon juice. Stir until it boils then reduce heat and simmer until thickens. Remove from heat. Separate the sauce into two equal portions. One is for brushing onto the chicken. The second portion, once it has cooled, is mixed with the yogurt and used for dipping. Making the Satays: Be sure to soak the skewers before using them, so that they don't burn. Place them in a baking pan and cover with water for at least 30 minutes (but overnight is better). Place 1 boneless chicken breast between two sheets of plastic wrap and using a smooth mallet, pound to flatten the chicken until about 1/4 inch thick. Repeat. Several common items can be used instead of a mallet such as a small cast iron frying pan, the side of a wine bottle, a rolling pin, etc. Slice each chicken breast into thin strips. You should be able to get about 6 strips per breast half. Weave the chicken strips onto the skewers. Try to get at least 4 punctures per strip. Arrange skewers in a single layer in a broiling pan. Brush thoroughly with the brushing sauce. Cover and refrigerate for 20-30 minutes. Brush chicken again just prior to cooking. Preheat either the broiler or the grill. Broil or grill for 1-2 minutes per side. Serve warm with the reserved dipping sauce.
