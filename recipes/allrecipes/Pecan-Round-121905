In a mixing bowl, cream the butter and 1/2 cup sugar. Beat in vanilla. Combine flour, pecans and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Shape into two 8-in. rolls; wrap each in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 2 hours or until firm. Unwrap and cut into 1/4-in. slices. Place 1-1/2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Meanwhile, combine cinnamon and remaining sugar. Roll warm cookies in cinnamon-sugar. Cool on wire racks.
