Place garlic, ginger, sesame paste, 1/2 cup sesame oil, mirin, chile paste, honey, lime juice, and chicken stock in the bowl of a food processor, and process until smooth. Transfer to a small bowl; season with salt to taste, and set aside. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add rice-stick noodles, and cook until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain noodles in a colander, and transfer to a medium bowl. Add remaining 2 tablespoons sesame oil, and toss to coat. Divide noodles among serving dishes, and drizzle with reserved sesame sauce. Sprinkle with scallion slices and chopped cilantro, and serve.
