Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Place salmon filets skin side down in a 13-by-9-inch baking pan. Pour enough olive oil into pan to completely cover the salmon. Sprinkle with the sliced shallots and lemons, pressing them down to submerge them in the oil. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil; bake until firm to the touch, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow to cool in the oil. Using a metal spatula, remove from the oil (reserving 1 tablespoon), cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 to 45 minutes. In a medium bowl toss the arugula, salt and the reserved olive oil. To serve, divide the greens between four plates. Top with chilled salmon and coat with 1/4 cup of the honey-yogurt dressing (recipe follows). Serve immediately. For the honey yogurt dressing: In a medium bowl combine the yogurt, dill, honey, lemon juice, salt, lemon zest and mustard; whisk together. Cover and refrigerate if not using right away. You can make the honey-yogurt dressing a few days in advance if kept in airtight containers.
