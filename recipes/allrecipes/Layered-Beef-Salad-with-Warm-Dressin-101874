Whisk together the soy sauce, sukiyaki sauce, water, ginger, and garlic in a small bowl. Arrange the sliced steak in the bottom of a shallow baking dish. Pour about 1/2 of the soy sauce mixture over the steak. Allow to marinate 30 minutes. Build the salad by layering onto a platter the lettuce, onion, radish, cucumber, tomato, jicama, and eggs in that order. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the marinated steak strips in the hot oil to desired doneness, 3 minutes each side for medium-well.
