In a small saucepan, cook onion and garlic in oil and butter over low heat until tender. Add the tomatoes, sugar, salt and pepper; cook over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in tomato paste. Combine flour and 1/4 cup of water until smooth; stir into tomato mixture. Gradually stir in remaining water until smooth. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Place a sieve over a bowl; pour tomato mixture into sieve. Press with the back of a spoon to remove tomato seeds and skin. Return puree to pan. Add half-and-half and dill; cook over low heat just until heated through (do not boil).
