Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Mix spinach, cottage cheese, 1/2 cup of the mozzarella cheese, the egg white, red peppers and salad dressing mix until well blended. Spoon evenly into pasta shells, using about 1 heaping tablespoonful of the spinach mixture for each shell. Spoon half of the sauce into 13x9-inch baking dish. Place shells, filled sides up, in baking dish; spoon remaining sauce over shells. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. Cover with foil. Bake 30 to 40 min. or until heated through.
