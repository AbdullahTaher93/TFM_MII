Combine rice, orzo, butter, and onion together in a pot over medium heat; cook and stir until light brown, about 3 minutes. Add water, chicken bouillon, onion powder, garlic salt, and ground turmeric; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
