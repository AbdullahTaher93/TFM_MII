Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 8-1/2x4-1/2-inch loaf pan. Combine flour, baking soda, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Beat eggs, white sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Beat in pumpkin and oil. Add flour mixture; mix until batter is blended and smooth. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is dark brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean, about 70 minutes. Let cool in the pan, about 30 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack and slice it into 1-inch thick slices.
