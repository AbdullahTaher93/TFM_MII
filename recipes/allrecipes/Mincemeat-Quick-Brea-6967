Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 x 5 x 3 inch loaf pan. Mix together the egg, oil, orange peel, juice, and mincemeat, blending well. Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; add gradually to the egg mixture. Mix just until moist. Pour into prepared pan. Bake for 1 hour. Remove the loaf from the oven, and cool on a wire rack.
