Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine the rice, mushroom soup, chicken broth, mushrooms, green bell pepper, basil, onion, oregano, garlic, ground black pepper and 1/4 cup cheese. Stir until all ingredients are well mixed. Pour this mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place the chicken on top of the mixture and cover with foil. In a separate small bowl, combine the bread crumbs and remaining cheese and set aside. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 1 hour, remove from oven, uncover and sprinkle with the reserved bread crumb mixture. Return to oven and bake, uncovered, for 20 more minutes, or until golden brown.
