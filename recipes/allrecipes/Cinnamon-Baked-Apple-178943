Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Core apples, leaving whole. Slice apples into 1/4-inch horizontal rounds, keeping shape intact. Assemble whole apples and place in shallow 8 or 9-inch baking dish (round, oval or square). Stir walnuts, butter and apricots. Stuff mixture into cored apples. Insert cinnamon stick into stuffing. Bake 35 to 40 minutes, basting occasionally with accumulated juices, or until apples are tender. Serve with whipped cream or ice cream.
