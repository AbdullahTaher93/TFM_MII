Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare syrup. Combine SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend, water and the cloves in a heavy saucepan. Cook over high heat 10 to 12 minutes, allowing mixture to reduce and thicken. Remove cloves and set aside to cool. Peel plantains and cut in 1/4 inch slices. Heat olive oil over medium high heat. Fry plantains on medium high heat until golden brown. Remove from oil and place fried plantains on paper towel to remove any excess fat. Spray an 8x8 inch baking dish with nonstick spray. Place one layer of fried plantain slices on the bottom of the baking dish. Cover the plantains with half of the mozzarella and parmesan cheeses. Pour 1 cup of the sugar syrup on top of cheese. Place remaining plantain slices over the previous layer of plantains and cheese. Cover the new layer of plantains with the rest of the mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Mix eggs, water, and SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend together in a small bowl. Pour evenly over the top of the plantains. Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until golden brown.
