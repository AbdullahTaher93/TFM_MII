Stir butter, sriracha sauce, honey, garlic, salt, and pepper with a rubber spatula in a bowl until smeared and blended together. Scoop butter mixture onto a large piece of plastic wrap. Roll up into a log; twist ends of the plastic together to tighten up the log. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, about 1 hour. Slice into 1/4-inch pats and place on a chilled plate.
