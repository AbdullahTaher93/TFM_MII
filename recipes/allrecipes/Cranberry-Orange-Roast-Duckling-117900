Prick skin of ducklings well. Place four orange quarters, one sprig of rosemary and 1/4 cup of cranberries in each cavity; tie drumsticks together. Place breast side up on a rack in a roasting pan. In a large bowl, combine the orange juice, broth, soy sauce, sugar, ginger and garlic; mix well. Refrigerate 1/2 cup for the glaze. Pour 1 cup over the ducklings; sprinkle with the remaining cranberries. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour. Uncover; bake 1-1/2 hours longer basting frequently with the remaining orange juice mixture. (Drain fat from pan as it accumulates.) Combine the marmalade and reserved orange juice mixture; spread over ducklings. Bake, uncovered, 30-40 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees F. Discard the oranges, rosemary and cranberries from cavities. Let ducklings stand for 10 minutes before carving.
