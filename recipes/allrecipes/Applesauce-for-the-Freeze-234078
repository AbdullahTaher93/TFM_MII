Stir apples, water, brown sugar, white sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon stick, lemon zest, and salt together in a large pot. Place a cover on the pot and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until the apples are soft, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove pot from heat. Remove and discard cinnamon stick and lemon zest strips. Mash apples with a potato masher.
