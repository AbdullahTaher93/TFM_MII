Place the sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Place the potatoes into a bowl and add the butter, chipotle chiles, adobo sauce, and half-and-half. Mash well with a potato masher, and season to taste with salt to serve.
