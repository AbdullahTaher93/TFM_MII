Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees F). Butter an 8-inch (20 cm) casserole or glass baking dish. In a bowl, combine beef, peas, 1/4 cup (50 ml) of the cream, tomato paste, herbes de Provence and 1/4 tsp (1 ml) each, salt pepper. Spread into prepared baking dish. In another bowl, using a fork, whisk remaining 1/2 cup (125 ml) cream with egg, flour and 1/4 tsp (1 ml) each, salt and pepper. Add potatoes and toss to evenly coat. Spread evenly over beef mixture. Cover and bake for about 1 hr or until filling is bubbling and potatoes are tender. Uncover and bake for about 15 min or until top is golden.
