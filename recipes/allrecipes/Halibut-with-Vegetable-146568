Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Wash halibut and pat dry. Cut into serving size pieces, and place in a 9x13 inch baking pan. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Stir together the olive oil, parsley, onion, celery, bell pepper, tomatoes, capers, and garlic; pour over the halibut. Bake until halibut is slightly opaque in the center, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven; let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
