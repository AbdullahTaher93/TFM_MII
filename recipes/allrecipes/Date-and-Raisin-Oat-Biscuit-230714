Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Mix the milk and lemon juice in a small bowl and let sit for 5-10 minutes. Mix all dry ingredients together, add dried fruit and mix well into the flour. Pour milk mixture, oil, and stevia into the dry mix and stir to combine. The batter will look like a thick cookie dough. If too sticky, let sit for a few minutes to allow the oats to absorb the moisture. Roll out a ball of dough, almost like a very large cookie. Divide the dough into twelve 1/3-cup or palm-sized sections and place evenly on baking sheet, pressing down each one just slightly. Bake for 18-20 minutes on middle rack in oven, until bottoms are golden brown. Remove from oven and let sit for 5-10 minutes before serving.
