Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat a 13 x 9-inch (3-L) baking dish with nonstick spray. Cook the rice according to the package directions. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the sour cream, cream cheese, scallions, chile peppers, and cumin. Stir until well-blended. Add the beans and rice. Stir gently to mix. Place the tortillas on a work surface. Spoon some of the bean filling down the center of each tortilla. Sprinkle with Monterey Jack or Cheddar. Roll into cylinders. Place, seam side down, in the prepared baking dish. Drizzle with the taco sauce. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until heated through.
