In a large stockpot, over medium-high heat, melt butter until it just begins to bubble. Now toss in the chopped scallions and continue cooking on medium-high heat until the scallions are wilted. Add both packages of cream cheese, blending with a wooden spoon until the cream cheese has melted completely. Now blend in the seafood seasoning. Pour shrimp stock into the cream cheese mixture, blending together with a wire whisk until smooth. Blend in the warmed half-and-half. Allow the mixture to simmer, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until there is steam rising from the pot. Add the diced potatoes, keeping the heat on medium-high. Stir occasionally, allowing the potatoes to cook 25 min. or until fork-tender. Once potatoes are tender, add the steamed shrimp (see Tip); stir. Add drained corn and cream of potato soup; stir until blended. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 min., stirring frequently with a wooden spoon so soup does not scorch.
