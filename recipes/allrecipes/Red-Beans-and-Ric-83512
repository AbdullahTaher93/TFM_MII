Bring the rice and water to boil in a pot. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 20 minutes. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion and green bell pepper, and cook until tender. Stir in sausage, and cook until evenly browned. Mix in beans and tomatoes, and continue cooking until heated through. Serve skillet mixture over the rice.
