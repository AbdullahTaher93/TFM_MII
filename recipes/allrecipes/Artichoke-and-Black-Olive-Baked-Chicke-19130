Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken breasts and drumsticks in a 9x13 inch baking dish, bone side down. Spread artichokes and olives around chicken, then mix wine and broth together in a small bowl and pour mixture all over chicken. Sprinkle with tarragon and season with salt and pepper to taste. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour, or until chicken is cooked through (juices run clear) and browned.
