On a baking pan, spread shelled nuts (except macadamias) in a single layer and bake in a 350 degrees F oven, stirring often, until golden: 5 to 7 minutes for pine nuts; 8 to 10 minutes for pecans, pistachios, and walnuts; about 15 minutes for almonds and hazelnuts. Macadamias scorch easily so they need lower heat; roast them at 300 degrees F for about 20 minutes. Watch nuts carefully--they brown quickly. For more toasted flavor, bake nuts to a darker color. Line a 10- by 15-inch pan with foil; lightly butter foil. In a 10- by 12-inch skillet, mix sugar and cinnamon. Shake pan often over medium-high heat until sugar melts, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, and tilt pan to mix melted and dry sugar until combined and amber in color, 2 to 5 minutes more. Quickly stir nuts into melted sugar, then immediately pour mixture into the foil-lined pan. Working fast, use a spoon to spread the nut mixture into as thin a layer as possible. Let nut brittle cool until firm, at least 30 minutes. Peel brittle from the foil and break the candy into pieces. Serve, or package airtight up to 3 days.
