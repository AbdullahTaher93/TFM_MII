In large saucepan, saute leeks in butter or margarine until soft; season with Morton(R) Kosher Salt. Stir in vegetable broth; bring mixture to boil. Add diced potatoes and cream-style corn; return chowder to boil. Cover and reduce heat; simmer for 10 minutes. Carefully add fish; simmer chowder gently, uncovered, just until fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork, about 6 to 10 minutes depending on thickness** of fish. Do not overcook. Garnish with chopped leeks, if desired. Serve immediately.
