Soak rice in a bowl of water for 10 minutes. Drain. Bring chicken broth to a boil in a large saucepan. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add vermicelli; cook and stir until brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add rice; cook and stir until combined, about 1 minute. Pour into boiling broth. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Season rice with salt and pepper; fluff with a fork.
