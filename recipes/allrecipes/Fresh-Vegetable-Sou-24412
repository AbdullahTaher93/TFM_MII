In a large pot, combine celery, cabbage, bell pepper, zucchini, onions and tomatoes. Pour in enough water to cover by one inch. Stir in onion soup mix, garlic, peppercorns and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 90 minutes to 2 hours, until vegetables are tender and flavors are well blended.
