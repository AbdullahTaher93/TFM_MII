With a meat mallet, pound the tenderloin slices to 1/4-inch thick. Combine tarragon and garlic powder in a small bowl, and sprinkle the mixture over the cutlets. Rub the seasoning into the meat, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour to blend the flavors. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a skillet over medium heat until the foam disappears. Brown half of the tenderloin pieces in the butter, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Do not crowd pan. Repeat with the remainder of the pork pieces and 1 more tablespoon of butter. Set the pork pieces aside on a warm platter. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in the skillet over medium heat; stir in the flour until smooth and the mixture starts to fry. Gradually whisk in wine, stirring constantly until the flour mixture and wine are blended; stir in chicken bouillon granules and Dijon mustard. Allow the sauce to boil for 1 minute; whisk in the cream. Bring the mixture almost to the boiling point, and stir in the almonds and green onions. Pour sauce over the pork, and serve.
