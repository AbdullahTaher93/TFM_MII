In a 10 to 12 inch nonstick frying pan, saute chopped prosciutto over medium-high heat until crisp, about 1 minute. Remove from pan with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add garlic, chopped rosemary and 2 tablespoons water to pan. Saute until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds; do not scorch. Add beans and 1/3 cup water and sprinkle with salt. Cover and cook just until beans are tender to bite, about 3 minutes. Uncover and saute until liquid has evaporated. Arrange beans on a platter, sprinkle with chopped prosciutto and garnish with rosemary sprigs. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
