Cook pasta according to package directions; drain. Meanwhile place beef sausage in large skillet; add just enough water to cover bottom of skillet. Cook, uncovered, over medium heat about 7 minutes or until sausage browns slightly, stirring occasionally. Pour off drippings. Remove and reserve 5 or 6 slices of sausage. Add Alfredo sauce, beans and chopped basil to skillet; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer 5 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Combine pasta and sausage mixture in serving dish, tossing lightly. Sprinkle with pepper, as desired, and pine nuts. Top with reserved sausage slices. Garnish with basil sprigs, if desired.
