Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place tortilla strips in medium bowl. Drizzle with honey and sprinkle with cinnamon; gently toss to coat. Place strips in single layer on parchment-lined baking sheet; lightly spray with cooking spray. Bake 8 minutes, or until strips are lightly browned. Cool completely. Place strawberries and blueberries in serving dish; top with two servings (1/4 cup) Reddi-wip. Garnish with one fourth of the baked tortilla strips (reserve remaining for another use). Serve immediately.
