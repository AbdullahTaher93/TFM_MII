In small bowl, combine flour with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; set aside. Rinse prawns in cold water; drain. Dip prawns in flour mixture, shaking off excess. In large skillet, heat 1 1/2 tablespoons of the oil over medium-high heat. Add half of the prawns; stir-fry until pink, translucent, and lightly browned; transfer to large paper-towel lined plate. Heat remaining oil in skillet; cook remaining prawns and transfer to plate. To empty skillet, add rice vinegar, hot sauce, and butter; cook, stirring, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat; return prawns to skillet. Toss prawns in sauce to coat. Serve immediately.
