Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking dish with foil. Place the chicken in the baking dish. Coat with cooking spray and season with the salt and black pepper. Roast for approximately 30 minutes, or until cooked through. Set aside to cool. In a large bowl, combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, lemon juice, tarragon, mustard, and lemon peel. Remove the skin and bones from the chicken and shred by hand into bite-size pieces. Fold into the dressing, along with the celery, bell pepper, mango, pistachios, and parsley. Season with the salt and black pepper. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
