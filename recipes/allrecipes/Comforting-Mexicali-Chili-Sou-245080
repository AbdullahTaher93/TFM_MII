Place dried guajillo, cascabel, arbol, and California chiles and Swanson(R) Unsalted Chicken Broth in a large pot. Stir in chili powder, cumin, oregano, cocoa powder, adobo sauce, salt and pepper. Let mixture steep until the chiles soften, about 15 minutes. Discard the chiles. Place pot over medium-high heat. Add diced sweet potatoes. Bring to a simmer; cook at a low simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add corn, chicken diced tomatoes, and black beans. Bring back to a simmer; cook until piping hot and flavors are blended, 10 to 15 minutes.
