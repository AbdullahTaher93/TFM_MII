Stir coconut milk, coconut cream, corn syrup, and sugar together in a saucepan. Cook on medium-low heat until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Add coffee powder, cocoa, and vanilla extract; whisk until fully combined. Remove 2 tablespoons of the coconut mixture. Whisk with cornstarch in a bowl to make a slurry. Pour back into the coconut mixture. Stir until slurry is evenly distributed. Refrigerate until completely chilled, 3 hours to overnight. Freeze per manufacturer's directions, 8 hours to overnight.
