Blend goat cheese, butter, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract together in a blender until smooth. Slowly pour milk into the mixture, a few tablespoons at a time; blend until the desired consistency is reached. You will want it to be thin enough to drizzle over fruit. Blend cinnamon into the dressing at the end.
