Cut roasted red peppers into 16 large pieces. Starting at the edge of a serving platter, place a slice of tomato, a basil leaf, a slice of mozzarella cheese, a piece of roasted pepper, and another basil leaf. Continue in that pattern, forming a spiral from the outside in, until all the ingredients have been arranged; salad should end in the center of the platter. Drizzle the salad with olive oil and sprinkle with black pepper and black olives.
