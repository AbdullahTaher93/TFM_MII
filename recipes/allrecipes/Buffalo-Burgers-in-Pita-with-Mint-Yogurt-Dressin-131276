In a small bowl, stir together yogurt, mint, vinegar, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. In a medium bowl, combine buffalo, cumin, coriander, and salt until thoroughly mixed. Season with pepper. Shape mixture into two patties about 1/2 inch thick. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Coat with cooking spray and cook burgers to medium rare, turning once, about 5 to 6 minutes total (be careful not to overcook). Cut tops off pita pockets. Stuff each pita with one burger and several slices of cucumber. Drizzle with mint-yogurt dressing and serve.
