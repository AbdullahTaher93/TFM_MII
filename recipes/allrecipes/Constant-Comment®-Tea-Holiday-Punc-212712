In a saucepan, bring water to boil, add tea bags, cover and steep for 5 minutes. Remove tea bags. Allow tea to cool; then chill. Just before serving time, combine tea, ginger ale, juice concentrates, pineapple and cherries in a large punch bowl. Float scoops of sherbet on top. Garnish with mint leaves (optional).
