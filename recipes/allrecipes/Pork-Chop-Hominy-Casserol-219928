Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Pan-fry pork chops until browned, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Arrange pork chops in the prepared baking dish. Spread the hominy over the pork chops. Mix the cream of mushroom soup, milk, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until smooth. Pour the mushroom sauce over the hominy. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbling and the pork chops are tender, about 1 hour.
