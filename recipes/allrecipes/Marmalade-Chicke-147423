Whisk broth, vinegar, marmalade, mustard and cornstarch in a small bowl. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until golden, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon oil and shallot to the pan and cook, stirring often, until the shallot begins to brown, about 30 seconds. Whisk the broth mixture and add it to the pan. Bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer; cook until the sauce is slightly reduced, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add the chicken; return to a simmer. Cook, turning once, until the chicken is heated through, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and stir in orange zest.
