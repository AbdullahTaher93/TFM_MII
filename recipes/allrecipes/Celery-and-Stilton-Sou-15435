Melt the butter in a large pot over medium low heat. Add the onions and saute for 10 minutes, or until onion is translucent. Add the celery and the water. Cover and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes, or until celery is soft. Add 2 1/2 ounces of the Stilton cheese to the soup and mix well. Puree the soup in small batches in a blender or food processor and transfer it to a clean pot. Season with freshly ground pepper and salt to taste. Stilton can be very salty, so beware! Pour into individual bowls, sprinkle with the remaining cheese and garnish with the watercress.
