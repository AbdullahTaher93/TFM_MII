Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour buttermilk into a shallow dish or bow. Place tortilla chip crumbs in a large, resealable plastic bag. Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk, then place in bag, seal tightly and shake to coat thoroughly. Place coated chicken in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 35 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
