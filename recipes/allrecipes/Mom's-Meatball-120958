In a bowl, combine the onion, ketchup, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce and crackers. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Shape into 1-in. balls. Place in ungreased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pans. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 10 minutes or until meat is no longer pink. Serve meatballs immediately, or refrigerate or freeze for use in other recipes.
