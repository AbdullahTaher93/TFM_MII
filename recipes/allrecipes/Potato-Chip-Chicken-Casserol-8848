Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a large bowl combine the chicken, rice, soup, mayonnaise, onion, celery, water chestnuts, lemon juice, water, salt and pepper. Mix well. Spread this mixture into a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with cheese, then potato chips. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until the potato chips are lightly browned.
