Pour enough olive oil into a skillet to cover the bottom; turn heat to high. Saute garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add lime juice and cook for 45 seconds. Stir cream into garlic mixture; cook until mixture is slightly reduced, about 1 minute. Mix Greek seasoning, black pepper, and cayenne pepper into cream mixture. Add Parmesan cheese and stir until melted and sauce is smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.
