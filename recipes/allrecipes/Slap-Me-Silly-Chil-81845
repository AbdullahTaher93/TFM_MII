Chop chorizo sausage into small pieces. (If the chorizo has a casing, be sure to remove that first). In a large heavy pot over medium-high heat, add the chorizo and ground beef, stir frequently to break-up the beef. Cook until the beef starts to brown (8-10 minutes) and gives off its fat. Pour off excess fat. (If you use the extra lean beef as recommended then you should not have much). Add the onions, bell peppers and cook 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in the remaining ingredients (chipotle with its sauce, chili powder, mustard, garlic, cumin, oregano, cinnamon, salt, pepper, canned tomatoes with all of its juices and the barbecue sauce). Stir occasionally until it boils, then immediately reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 45 minutes. Check on it every 5-10 minutes with a thorough stir to redistribute heat and to make sure that it is not boiling. If it gets too thick, then add 1/2 cup of water or stock.
