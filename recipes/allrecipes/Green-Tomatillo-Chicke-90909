Mix together flour and salt to taste in a shallow bowl. One at a time, roll chicken thighs in flour to coat all sides. In a 12- to 14-inch frying pan (preferably nonstick) with a lid, heat oil over medium-high heat. When oil is hot, add chicken and cook, turning once, until chicken is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes total. Transfer browned chicken to a large plate or baking sheet and set aside. To frying pan add tomatillos, onion, jalapenos, garlic, and chicken broth. Bring to a boil over high heat; simmer, stirring often, for 3 minutes. Return chicken to pan. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink in thickest part (cut to test), 10 to 15 minutes. With tongs, transfer chicken to a serving platter. Bring sauce to a boil over high heat; stir until liquid is almost evaporated, about 3 minutes. Stir minced cilantro into sauce, then spoon over chicken. Garnish with cilantro sprigs.
