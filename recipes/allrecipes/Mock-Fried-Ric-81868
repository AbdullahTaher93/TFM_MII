In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, Splenda, orange extract, ginger and garlic powder. Set aside. Grate the cauliflower. This is accomplished best by using your grating wheel on your food processor. But you can do it by hand also with a cheese grater. Mince the celery and scallions quite finely. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the celery and saute for a minute. Add the cauliflower and scallions and saute, stirring occasionally until the cauliflower starts to take on a bit of brown color (generally about 3 minutes). Drizzle the soy sauce over the veggies (do not dump it all in one spot) and stir well. Taste and add more soy or pepper as needed.
