In a small mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in the egg, milk and vanilla. Add flour and mix well. On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut with 3-in. cookie cutters dipped in flour. Sprinkle with additional sugar. Place 1 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Reroll scraps if desired. Bake at 375 degrees F for 7-8 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.
