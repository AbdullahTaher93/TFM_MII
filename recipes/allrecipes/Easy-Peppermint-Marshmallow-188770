Line a 9x9 pan with plastic wrap, leaving enough overhang to cover the top. Spray plastic wrap lightly with cooking spray. Place the 6 tablespoons of warm water in a large bowl, and sprinkle gelatin on top. Let gelatin soften in the water for 5 minutes. Combine the white sugar, corn syrup, and 1/4 cup water in a tall saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Boil for one full minute, 240 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Pour the hot syrup over the softened gelatin, and add the salt. Beat at high speed with an electric mixer until the mixture increases in volume and holds a peak, about 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the vanilla and peppermint extracts. Pour into prepared pan, add several drops of red food coloring, and swirl with a toothpick. Cover lightly with plastic wrap, and let stand at room temperature for 4 hours. Cut into 18 squares, using a knife sprayed with cooking spray. Combine cornstarch and powdered sugar in a bowl. Toss cut marshmallows in the reserved powdered sugar mixture. Store in airtight container or resealable plastic bag.
