Coat insides of six half-cup heatproof custard cups or ramekins with non-stick cooking spray. Place cups on a baking tray and set aside. In a wide saucepan, combine SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, and cornstarch. Add coconut milk and whisk until mixture is smooth. Slowly add half and half or milk, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Add eggs and salt. Whisk until smooth. Set over medium heat. Cook, whisking constantly, 6 to 8 minutes, or until mixture bubbles and thickens. Remove saucepan from heat, continuing to whisk rapidly to cool down the mixture. Stir in coconut extract. Transfer custard to reserved dishes. With the back of a small spoon, smooth tops to flatten. Cover with plastic and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until cold. To serve, preheat broiler. Sprinkle brown sugar evenly over tops of chilled custards. Broil 6 inches from heat source for 3 to 5 minutes, or until sugar is caramelized. Watch carefully so the sugar doesn't burn.
