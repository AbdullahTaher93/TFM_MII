In a saucepan, bring water and salt to a boil. Remove from the heat; add rice. Cover and let stand for 3 minutes. Drain. Rinse with cold water; drain well. In a skillet, melt butter. Add rice and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently until butter is almost absorbed, about 5 minutes. Turn into a 1-qt. casserole; sprinkle with garlic salt. Pour chicken broth over rice. Cover and bake at 325 degrees F for 35 to 40 minutes or until most of liquid is absorbed. Add mint and fluff with a fork. Sprinkle almonds over top. Bake, uncovered, 5 to 10 minutes more.
