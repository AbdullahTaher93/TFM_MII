Cook and stir beef, garlic powder, and onion powder in a large pot until beef is browned, about 5 minutes. Drain excess grease. Pour beef stock, diced tomatoes, and Italian seasoning into the saucepan; bring to a boil. Stir in pasta. Cook, stirring occasionally, until pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Stir in Parmesan cheese.
