Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix crushed cookies with 1/2 cup butter in a bowl. Mash sweet potatoes with 1/4 cup butter in separate bowl; add brown sugar, marmalade, amaretto liqueur, and ginger to sweet potatoes. Mix well. Pour sweet potato mixture into a 9x9-inch baking dish; top with cookie mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and bubbling, about 30 minutes.
