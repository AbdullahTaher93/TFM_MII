Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Heat chicken broth, butter, wine, lemon juice, basil, salt, and black pepper in a saucepan over medium heat until butter is melted, about 5 minutes. Stir rice, onion, bell pepper, peas, and garlic in prepared baking dish. Arrange sole fillets over rice mixture and top with tomato slices. Pour butter mixture over fish, rice, and vegetables. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven until fish is easily flaked with a fork and rice is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges.
