In a large saucepan, bring carrots and water to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5-8 minutes or until tender. Drain. In a small skillet, saute onion in 3 tablespoons butter until tender. In a large bowl, combine the carrots, onion, soup, cheese and pepper. Melt remaining butter; toss with stuffing. Fold into carrot mixture. Transfer to a greased 2-qt. baking dish. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes. Uncover; bake 10 minutes longer or until lightly browned.
