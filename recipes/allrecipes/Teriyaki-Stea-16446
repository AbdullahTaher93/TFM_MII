Cut the skirt steak into individual strips for serving. Add the garlic to the teriyaki sauce. In a re-sealable plastic bag, combine the steak and the sauce. Seal tightly and refrigerate to marinate overnight. Preheat oven to broil OR preheat a barbecue grill. When oven OR grill is ready, remove meat from bag and discard remaining marinade. Place meat on a broiler pan for the oven OR directly on the grill for the barbecue. Cook for about 5 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.
