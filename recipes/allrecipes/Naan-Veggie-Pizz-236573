Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place naan on baking sheets and brush with olive oil. Bake naan in the preheated oven until light toasted, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir mushrooms, tomato, bell pepper, red onion, basil, oregano, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl. Fold garlic and 1 tablespoon olive oil into vegetable mixture. Spread mozzarella cheese onto each naan bread; top with vegetable mixture. Bake pizzas in the oven until cheese is melted and vegetables are cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes more.
