Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Mix the beans, half of the salsa, cheese, onion, and tomato in a small bowl. Place the tortilla on a large piece of aluminum foil. Spoon the bean mixture in the middle of the tortilla, but slightly off-center. Fold the tortilla. Wrap the foil around the burrito and bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until hot. Top with lettuce, remaining salsa, and sour cream.
