Place chicken legs in a large pot and cover with water. Add cabbage, carrots, celery, onion, bay leaves, parsley, garlic, thyme, marjoram, salt, and black pepper. Cover pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook for about 1 hour. Transfer 1 cup chicken and vegetable broth to a saucepan. Heat broth and pickles over medium-low for about 15 minutes. Return pickle broth to large pot. Mix flour and sour cream in a bowl. Stir into soup; bring to a boil until thickened, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.
