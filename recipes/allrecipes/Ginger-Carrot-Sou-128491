In a large saucepan, combine the broth, orange juice, carrots, potato, onion, ginger, and orange peel. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the carrots and potato are tender. Let cool for 5 minutes. Working in batches, puree the carrot mixture in a food processor or blender. Return to a saucepan. Stir in the buttermilk, honey, salt, nutmeg, and pepper. Cook for 3 minutes, or until heated through.
