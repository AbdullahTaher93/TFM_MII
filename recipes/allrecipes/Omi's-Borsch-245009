Place beets, potatoes, carrots, parsley root (greens reserved), celery, and vinegar in a large pot; season with salt and pepper. Pour enough water to cover vegetables into the pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer until vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes. Remove beets with a slotted spoon; set aside to cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Grate beets when they are cool enough to handle. Melt butter in a small saucepan, whisk in flour, and cook and stir until mixture is a light tan color, about 10 minutes; stir mixture into soup. Stir in grated beets and parsley root greens; bring to a simmer and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season soup with vegetable bouillon, salt, and pepper.
