Melt butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add onions, celery, mushrooms, garlic, salt and pepper. Cook 7 to 10 minutes, or until just beginning to brown. Add bread, sage, rosemary, thyme, parsley, celery seed, hazelnuts, and dried cherries. Cook 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat. Add broth and eggs, stirring well to combine. Set aside until cool enough to handle. To form Turkey Spiral: Bone out turkey breast lobes, keeping skin intact. Lay each lobe onto work surface, skin side down. Cutting from where center breast bone was, butterfly breast open. Open up butterflied turkey breast, keeping skin side down, and pound lightly to even thickness to about 1 inch overall. Divide stuffing mixture in half; place on flesh side of each turkey breast lobe. Spread mixture evenly and pat into place. Roll up turkey breast, jelly-roll style, so the skin ends up on the outside of the roll. Repeat with other lobe of turkey breast. Place each turkey spiral onto a large piece of aluminum foil. Brush turkey all over with melted butter. Tightly seal up turkey breast in foil. Place foil wrapped spirals onto a baking sheet. Bake in a preheated 375 degree F oven 30 minutes. Open up foil to expose top of spiral and baste with accumulated pan drippings. Bake another 30 to 45 minutes basting occasionally, until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Remove from oven and let rest 10 minutes before slicing. Then slice into 1/2 inch slices and serve. This also makes beautiful turkey sandwiches!
