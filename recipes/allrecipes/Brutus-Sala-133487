Preheat the broiler. Heat a grill pan over high heat. Drizzle the steak with EVOO and rub all over with the rosemary and grill seasoning. Grill the steak over high heat for 2 minutes on each side for medium-rare (these steaks are really thin). Let the meat rest to let the juices redistribute. Toast the split roll or bread under the broiler until golden, then rub with 1 of the garlic cloves. Drizzle EVOO over the bread and season with a little pepper, then cut into cubes to make croutons. Rub the inside of a bowl with the remaining garlic clove, then mince the garlic clove and add it to the bowl. Add the lemon juice, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce and anchovy paste and combine with the garlic. Whisk in 1/3 cup of EVOO, then add the romaine and croutons to the bowl and toss with the dressing to coat. Add the cheese to the salad and toss again. Season to taste with pepper. Slice the meat. Serve the salad on dinner plates topped with the sliced steak
