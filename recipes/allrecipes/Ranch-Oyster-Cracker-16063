Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). In a large mixing bowl, combine ranch dressing mix, dill weed, vegetable oil, lemon pepper, and garlic powder. Mix well. Add oyster crackers to the mixture and mix to coat the crackers. Pour the crackers onto a cookie sheet. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring gently halfway through the baking time.
