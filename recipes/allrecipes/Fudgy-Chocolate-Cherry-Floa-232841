Line a dinner-sized plate with foil. Place in freezer to chill for 10 minutes. Turn Magic Shell bottle upside down and shake for at least 20 seconds. Scoop 6 rounded servings of cherry vanilla ice cream onto chilled plate. Immediately coat with Magic Shell. (To assemble later, return to freezer until ready to serve.) Assemble by placing two scoops of ice cream into 1 of 3 tall (12 ounce) glasses. Fill glasses two-thirds full with black cherry soda. Serve immediately with iced tea spoons and straws.
