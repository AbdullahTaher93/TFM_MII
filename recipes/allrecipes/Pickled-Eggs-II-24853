Place eggs in a large saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool and peel. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, mix the tarragon vinegar, water, sugar, salt, celery seed, garlic and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, then simmer 30 minutes. Set aside to cool. Pour mixture over eggs; cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 days.
