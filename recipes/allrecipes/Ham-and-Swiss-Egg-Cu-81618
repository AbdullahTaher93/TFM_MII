Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease one 8 oz. ramekin with butter or canola oil. Toss the ham and Swiss cheese together and place in the bottom of the ramekin. If your cheese is sliced instead of shredded then layer the ham and cheese in a couple of layers. Whip together the eggs, cream and nutmeg. Pour eggs into the ramekin. Top with the Parmesan cheese. Bake for 20 minutes or until eggs are set.
