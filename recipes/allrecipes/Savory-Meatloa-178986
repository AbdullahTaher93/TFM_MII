Thoroughly mix the beef, 1/2 cup of the soup, bread crumbs, egg, onion, Worcestershire sauce and black pepper. Put the mixture into a 13x9 inch baking pan and firmly shape into an 8x4 inch loaf. Bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour or until the meatloaf is cooked through. Remove the meatloaf with a pancake turner from the pan to a cutting board. Heat 2 tablespoons of the pan drippings, the remaining soup and water in a 1 quart saucepan over medium-high heat until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Serve with the meatloaf.
