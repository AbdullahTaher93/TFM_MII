Heat a large skillet until hot to the touch. Add the spinach in handfuls and cook over high heat, tossing, until just wilted, about 1 minute. Transfer to a colander; let cool slightly. Press out as much liquid as possible. Wipe out the skillet with a paper towel. Melt the butter in the skillet. Add the mushrooms and shallots and cook over moderately high heat until golden, about 3 minutes. Add the ginger and jalapeno and cook until fragrant. Add the spinach and coconut milk and season with salt and pepper. Simmer over moderate heat until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Stir in the lime juice and serve.
