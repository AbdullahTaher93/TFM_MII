Combine oat bran, flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a small bowl. Mash two ripe bananas; combine with milk and egg. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture stirring until the ingredients are just combined. Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat. Spray surface with a no-stick spray. Pour a scant 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake onto hot surface. Cook until bubbly; turn and cook remaining side until golden brown. Melt preserves in a small microwave safe bowl; cook on HIGH for 15 seconds. Stir. Serve pancakes topped with sliced bananas, drizzled strawberry preserves and hot fudge; dollop with whipped topping.
