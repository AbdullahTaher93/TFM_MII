Place tofu between a few layers of paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Place a heavy plate on top; add a few books to the plate to press the tofu and drain excess liquid, 20 to 30 minutes. Unwrap tofu and slice into 2-inch slices that are 1/4-inch thick. Arrange slices in a large, shallow baking dish. Combine liquid aminos, canola oil, lemon juice, agave nectar, garlic, thyme, ginger paste, and cayenne pepper in a food processor; blend until smooth. Pour over tofu slices. Marinate tofu in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake tofu in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.
