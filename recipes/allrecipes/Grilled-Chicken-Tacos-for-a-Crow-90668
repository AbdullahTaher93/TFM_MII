Wearing gloves to protect your hands, remove and discard stems from jalapeno chilies. In a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium heat, roast chilies, turning regularly, until soft and well darkened in spots, 5 to 10 minutes. Place in a food processor or blender with the Worcestershire, the juice from 6 or 8 lime wedges, and 1 1/2 cups of the salsa. Process to a smooth puree. Arrange the chicken breasts in a large baking dish and pour salsa mixture over them. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight. Preheat barbecue grill. With a brush, lightly coat the green onions with oil, then set them on grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning occasionally, until they're soft and slightly browned, about 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a platter. Chop 4 of the largest green onions into 1/4-inch pieces, and stir into the remaining 2 1/2 cups of salsa. Squeeze another several wedges of lime over the remaining onions and keep them warm on the side of the grill or in a low-heat oven. Remove chicken breasts from the marinade. Discard marinade. Brush both sides of chicken lightly with oil and, with tongs, lay on grill. Cook until done through but still juicy, about 8 minutes per side. Transfer meat to a cutting board. Slice chicken into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Scoop onto a warm serving platter, flanked by the grilled onions and remaining lime wedges. Offer salsa along with hot tortillas kept warm in a towel-lined basket.
