Bring pork shoulder roast, onion, garlic, and 1 package taco seasoning to a boil in a large pot with enough water to cover. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender and no longer pink in the center, 2 to 3 hours. Check water level every 45 minutes, adding more as needed. Reserve about 1 cup cooking liquid. Shred pork with a fork, discarding excess fat and bone. Stir in tomatoes, refried beans, green chiles, and remaining package of taco seasoning. If the mixture is too dry, add reserved cooking liquid. Spread pork mixture evenly down the center of each tortilla; sprinkle with Cheddar cheese. Fold bottom and top edges of each tortilla over filling; roll sides up to enclose filling completely. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil a large skillet over medium heat; fry burritos in batches, seam sides down, until tortillas are golden, about 2 minutes per side. Drain fried burritos on a paper towel-lined plate.
