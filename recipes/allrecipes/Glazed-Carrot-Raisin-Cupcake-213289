Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place paper liners into 24 (2 1/2-inch) muffin-pan cups. Combine the cake mix, soup, water and eggs in a large bowl and mix according to the package directions. Stir in the carrot and raisins. Spoon the batter into the muffin-pan cups. Bake for 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove the cupcakes from the pan and cool completely on a wire rack. Stir the confectioners' sugar and juice in a small bowl until the mixture is smooth. Spread the glaze on the cupcakes.
