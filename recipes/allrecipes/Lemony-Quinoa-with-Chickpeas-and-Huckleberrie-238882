Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is soft and water has been absorbed, about 25 minutes. Heat a small skillet over medium heat; toast sunflower kernels in hot skillet until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer quinoa to a large bowl and fluff with a fork; add sunflower kernels, chickpeas, huckleberries, carrot, onion, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Gently stir the salad until thoroughly mixed; season with salt and pepper.
