Heat vegetable oil in a large stockpot over medium heat; stir in potatoes, tofu, yellow onion, carrots, celery, and garlic. Cook and stir until vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes. Pour water into stockpot, and add vegetable bouillon cubes; cover and bring to boil. Stir in egg noodles, broccoli florets, peas, parsley, and pepper; reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until egg noodles are cooked through and broccoli is tender, about 15 minutes.
