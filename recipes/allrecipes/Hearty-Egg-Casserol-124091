In a skillet, cook sausage and onion until the sausage is browned and the onion is tender; drain. Remove from the heat; stir in 1 cup cheese, spinach and mushrooms. Transfer to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. In a bowl beat eggs. Add cream and nutmeg; mix well. Pour over sausage mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Let stand 5 minutes before cutting.
