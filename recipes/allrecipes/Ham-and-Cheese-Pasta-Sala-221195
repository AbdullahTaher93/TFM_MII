Whisk mayonnaise, pickle relish, and milk in a bowl until combined; season with salt and black pepper. Chill in refrigerator while preparing remaining ingredients. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and transfer to a large bowl. Gently stir ham, Cheddar cheese, peas, onion, celery, and pimento into pasta. Pour mayonnaise mixture over pasta mixture and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 hours to overnight.
