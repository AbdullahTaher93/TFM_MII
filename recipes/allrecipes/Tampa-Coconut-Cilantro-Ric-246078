Bring 1 cup coconut water to a boil in a saucepan. Add basmati rice and salt, cover, and reduce heat to simmer. Stir occasionally, adding more coconut water as needed, until rice is soft but not mushy, about 15 minutes. Remove rice from heat, stir in cilantro and butter, and cover again. Let stand until coconut water is absorbed and flavors have blended, about 5 minutes more.
