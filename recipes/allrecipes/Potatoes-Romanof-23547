Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash. In a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish combine potatoes, sour cream, green onions and processed cheese. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until heated through.
