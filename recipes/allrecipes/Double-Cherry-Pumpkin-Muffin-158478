Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a 12-muffin tin with cooking spray. In a small bowl, combine 3 tablespoons chopped cherries, the ginger, brown sugar, and rum extract. Set aside. In a medium bowl, stir together flour, Splenda(R), baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Set aside. In another small bowl, stir together pumpkin, buttermilk, egg product, butter, and vanilla. Make a well in center of flour mixture and pour in pumpkin mixture. Stir just until flour mixture is partially moistened. Add 2/3 cup cherries and stir just until moistened. (Do not over mix.) Divide batter equally between the 12 muffin cups. Sprinkle chopped cherry mixture evenly on muffins. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes, or until golden brown and wooden toothpick inserted into center comes out clean.
