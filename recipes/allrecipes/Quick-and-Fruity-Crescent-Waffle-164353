Heat oven to 200 degrees F. Heat square or rectangular waffle maker. Spray with CRISCO(R) Original No-Stick Cooking Spray. Meanwhile, in 8-inch nonstick skillet, toast pecans over medium heat 5 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently, until lightly browned. Remove from skillet; set aside. Separate crescent dough into 8 triangles. Place 2 or 3 triangles at a time on waffle maker, leaving at least 1/2 inch of space around each triangle. Close lid of waffle maker; cook 1 to 2 minutes or until golden brown. Place cooked waffles on cookie sheet in oven to keep warm. In 1-quart saucepan, heat spreadable fruit and yogurt over medium heat 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until hot. To serve, stack 2 crescent waffles, slightly overlapping, on each of 4 serving plates. Spoon 1/4 of the fruit sauce over each serving; top each serving with 1/4 of the banana slices and 1 tablespoon of the pecans. Top with whipped cream; sprinkle lightly with cinnamon. Garnish with blueberries.
