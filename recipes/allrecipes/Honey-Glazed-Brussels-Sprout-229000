Bring a pot of water to a boil; dissolve bouillon cube in the boiling water. Add Brussels sprouts; cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate, leaving bacon drippings in the skillet. Cook and stir onion in bacon drippings until transparent and tender, about 10 minutes. Add honey and soy sauce; stir until liquid starts to bubble, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in Brussels sprouts, bacon, raisins, and pine nuts; cook until Brussels sprouts are heated through and well coated, 3 to 5 minutes. Garnish with sesame seeds before serving.
