Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix together the Italian cheese blend, artichoke hearts, spinach, sour cream, cream cheese, jalapeno pepper, garlic, and crushed red pepper in a bowl until well blended. Spread the dip into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese has melted and is bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve warm.
