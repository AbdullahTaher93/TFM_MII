Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the green pepper and oregano and cook until the green pepper is tender-crisp, stirring often. Stir the soup, water, garlic powder, black pepper and red pepper into the skillet. Heat to a boil. Place the fish into the soup mixture. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Serve with the rice.
