Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut each potato into 4 thick slices, stopping before you cut through the bottom. Drizzle butter over slices; season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon bacon bits between the slices. Wrap potatoes in aluminum foil; transfer to a rimmed baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until tender, 45 to 60 minutes. Garnish potatoes with sour cream, Cheddar cheese, and chives.
