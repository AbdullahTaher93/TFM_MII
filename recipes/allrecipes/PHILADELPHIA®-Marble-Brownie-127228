Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare brownie mix as directed on package; spread into greased 13x9-inch baking pan. Beat cream cheese with electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Add sugar, mixing until well blended. Add egg and vanilla; mix just until blended. Pour cream cheese mixture over brownie batter; cut through batter with knife several times for marble effect. Sprinkle with chocolate chunks. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until cream cheese mixture is lightly browned. Cool; cut into squares.
