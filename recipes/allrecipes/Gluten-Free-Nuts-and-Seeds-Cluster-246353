Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a miniature muffin tin. Combine oats, oat flour, sesame seeds, cornstarch, quinoa, coconut, flax meal, chia seeds, walnuts, raisins, sunflower seeds, white chocolate chips, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk honey, applesauce, coconut oil, egg, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; stir into oats mixture. Scoop mixture into the prepared muffin tin, pressing gently to fit into each muffin cup. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.
