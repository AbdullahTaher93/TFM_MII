Cook the sausage in a 6-quart saucepot over medium-high heat until the sausage is well browned, stirring frequently to break up meat. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion and garlic to the saucepot and cook until tender. Pour off fat. Stir the soup, milk, broccoli and 1/4 cup of the cheese into the saucepot. Heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the broccoli is tender, stirring occasionally. Put the pasta in a large serving bowl. Pour the sausage mixture over the pasta. Toss to coat. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Serve with red pepper, if desired.
