Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat, and stir in the brown sugar. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, and toss with flour to coat. Add chicken and bananas to the skillet, and cook stirring occasionally until chicken is almost cooked through. Stir in the amaretto and rum, and heat through. Remove from the burner, and use a long match or lighter to flambe. Allow to burn until the alcohol cooks off and the flame goes out. Serve and enjoy!
