In a large mixing bowl, combine the first five ingredients. In another bowl, beat the egg whites, egg, yogurt and oil until blended. Stir in zucchini and 3 teaspoons vanilla. Add to dry ingredients; mix well. Coat a 10-in. fluted tube pan with nonstick cooking spray; sprinkle with bread crumbs. Pour a third of the batter into pan. Combine the brown sugar, walnuts, raisins, cinnamon and allspice; sprinkle half over batter. Top with another third of the batter. Sprinkle with remaining brown sugar mixture; top with remaining batter. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-65 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely. In a small bowl, combine confectioners' sugar, milk and remaining vanilla; drizzle over cake.
