Place cauliflower in refrigerator to slowly defrost. Flatten thighs and cut into pieces about 2x3-inch. Roll or fold smooth side out; secure with toothpicks. Place chicken in large plastic bag. Combine jerk sauce, onions, lime juice and zest, and chile (optional). Add slightly more than half the marinade to the chicken, gently massaging bag to coat chicken well. Refrigerate at least four hours, preferably overnight. About 1 hour before cooking, transfer cauliflower to large plastic bag and add about 1/4 cup of the remaining marinade; coat cauliflower well. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F or prepare gas or charcoal grill. For oven-roasting, place chicken and cauliflower in separate pans, in a single layer. For grilling, place chicken directly on grill. Place cauliflower on perforated foil tray or pan designed for grilling vegetables. Discard bags with residual marinade. Grill or roast cauliflower just until crispy (about 10-15 minutes). Grill or roast chicken about 30 minutes, 'mopping' with remaining marinade, turning frequently.
