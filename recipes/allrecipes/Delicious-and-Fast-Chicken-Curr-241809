Mix curry powder, seasoned salt, and onion powder in a bowl; add chicken and toss to coat chicken in seasoning mix. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes; add chicken, potato, and spinach and stir. Pour coconut milk over the mixture and stir. Place a lid on the skillet, bring the mixture to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the potato is tender and the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes.
