Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crispy, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels and crumble once cooled. Mix bacon, celery, mayonnaise, onion, relish, mustard, chile-garlic sauce, dill, Worcestershire, black pepper, paprika, and salt together in a large bowl; add eggs. Break egg whites and yolks with a potato masher into the bacon mixture. Stir broken egg pieces into the salad. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour.
