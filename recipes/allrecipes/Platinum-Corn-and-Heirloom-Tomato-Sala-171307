Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat, add corn, and boil 5 minutes. Drain and rinse to cool. Cut kernels from cobs into a medium bowl. Peel and pit avocado, coarsely chop, and stir into corn with basil and shallots. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Arrange tomato slices on individual plates. Drizzle each with 1 teaspoon olive oil and 1/4 teaspoon cider vinegar. Spoon corn mixture over tomatoes and add additional salt and pepper to taste.
