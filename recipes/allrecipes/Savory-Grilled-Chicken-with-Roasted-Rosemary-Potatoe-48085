PREP: CLEAN: Wash hands. Place chicken in a glass baking dish. In bowl, combine remaining ingredients. Reserve 1/2 cup marinade. Pour remaining marinade over chicken; cover with foil. Refrigerate 1 hour or overnight, turning chicken once. When ready to cook, line grill with heavy duty foil and puncture at vent openings. Heat grill. Remove chicken from marinade; discard marinade. COOK: Grill chicken over medium-high heat, turning and basting frequently with reserved 1/2 cup marinade, 40 to 50 minutes or until internal juices run clear. (Or insert instant-read meat thermometer in thickest part of chicken. Temperature should read 180 degrees F.) SERVE: Serve with roasted red potatoes, diced and seasoned with garlic and rosemary. CHILL: Refrigerate leftovers immediately.
