Lightly oil grill and preheat to high. Place onion slices on a large sheet of aluminum foil; bring up edges of foil a bit to form a foil 'package'. Add corn and snow peas to onions. Place butter or margarine on top, spread out. Season with seasoned salt to taste, then lay ice cubes on top of the whole thing. Seal well in a foil 'packet'. Place foil packet on top shelf of preheated grill while cooking your favorite meats; grill until corn is firm but tender. Open foil packet and serve!
