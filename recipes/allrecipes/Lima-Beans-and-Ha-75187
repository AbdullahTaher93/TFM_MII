Place the lima beans in a large pot, and pour in the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and cook 15 minutes. Mix the potatoes, corn, tomato, onion, and celery into the pot, and continue cooking 15 minutes. In a small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in the milk. Stir into the pot, and mix in the ham. Continue cooking until heated through. Season to taste with salt and pepper and sprinkle with parsley before serving.
