Place tilapia in a medium skillet. Cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, remove from the heat, cover and let stand for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, place jalapeno to taste in a small bowl and whisk in lime juice, 2 tablespoons cilantro, oregano and salt. Transfer the tilapia to a large, shallow, nonreactive dish with a slotted spoon and pour the lime juice mixture over the top. Add bell pepper, tomato, onion and olives; gently mix to combine. (It's OK if the tilapia breaks apart.) Cover and chill for at least 20 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining cilantro and avocado just before serving.
