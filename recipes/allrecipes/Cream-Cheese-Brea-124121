In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir in sour cream, butter, sugar, eggs and salt. Add flour; stir until smooth. Cover and refrigerate overnight. The next morning, combine all filling ingredients and set aside. Meanwhile punch dough down and divide into six equal portions. Turn one portion onto a floured surface and roll into a 12-in. x 8-in. rectangle. Spread with a sixth of the filling. Roll up from one of the long sides; seal seams and fold ends under. Place on a greased baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Using scissors, cut 3/4 in. deep into sides of each roll at 3/4-in. intervals, alternating from one side to the other. Cover and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or golden brown. Cool 10 minutes before removing to wore racks. For glaze, combine sugar and vanilla. Gradually add milk until glaze is of spreading consistency; drizzle over warm bread.
