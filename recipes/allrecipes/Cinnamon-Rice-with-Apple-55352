In a saucepan, combine rice, apple juice, chopped apple, and raisins. Season with cinnamon and salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cover for about 17 minutes. Lift lid, and see if rice is moist enough for your taste; if not, cook another couple minutes. Mix in fresh parsley. Serve immediately.
