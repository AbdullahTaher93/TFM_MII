Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a bowl, mix the cream cheese, walnuts, onion, eggs, oats, and soy sauce. Form into patties. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the patties 2 minutes on each side, just until firm. Place the patties in a baking dish. Pour in the cream of mushroom soup. Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven.
