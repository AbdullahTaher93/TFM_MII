In a medium nonstick skillet, cook bacon until crisp. Remove bacon; crumble and set aside. Add potatoes, onion and green pepper to drippings. Cook and stir over medium heat for 7-10 minutes or until potatoes are lightly browned and vegetables are tender. In a bowl, beat eggs, milk, salt and pepper; pour over potatoes. Sprinkle with cheese and bacon. Cover and cook over medium-low heat for 10-15 minutes or until eggs are set. Do not stir. Fold in half.
