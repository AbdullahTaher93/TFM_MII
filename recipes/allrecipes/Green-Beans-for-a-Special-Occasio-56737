Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and pine nuts, and saute until lightly browned. Place the green beans in a medium saucepan with enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper. Cook 5 minutes, or until tender. Drain, and toss with the garlic and pine nuts to serve.
