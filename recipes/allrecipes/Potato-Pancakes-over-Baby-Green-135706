In large bowl, combine potatoes, egg substitute, onion, and red-pepper flakes. Coat large nonstick skillet or griddle with cooking spray and heat to medium-high. Spoon 1/4 cup mound of potato mixture onto hot pan. Repeat with 7 more mounds. Cook 15 minutes, turning once halfway through, until golden brown. (You may need to do this in batches, depending on the size of your skillet. Recoat pan with cooking spray in between batches.) Transfer to plate and keep warm. Evenly divide greens among 4 serving plates. In medium bowl, whisk vinegar, oil, and mustard. Add tomatoes. Drizzle over greens. Top each plate with 2 pancakes and sprinkle with cheese.
