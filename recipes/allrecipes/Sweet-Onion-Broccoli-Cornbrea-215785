Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch metal baking pan. In a bowl, mix together the sweet onion, broccoli, cottage cheese, eggs, corn bread mix, and margarine. Scoop the mixture into the prepared baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is browned and the casserole has risen, about 45 minutes.
