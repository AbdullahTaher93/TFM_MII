In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add milk, sugar, butter, egg, cornmeal and salt. Beat in 1-1/2 cups flour until smooth. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Punch dough down. Divide in half and shape into two loaves. Place in greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to cool on wire racks.
