Place the tomatoes, zucchini, pepper and onion into a large bowl. Add half the dressing and toss to coat. Lightly oil a grilling platter or vegetable basket. Place the vegetables onto the platter. Grill the vegetables for 15 minutes or until tender, turning them over once halfway through the grilling time. Remove the vegetables to a large bowl. Add the remaining dressing and toss to coat. Stir in the cheese. Split the rolls and grill until toasted. Divide the vegetable mixture among the buns.
