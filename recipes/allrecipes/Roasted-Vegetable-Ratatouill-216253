Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the eggplant, zucchini and mushrooms onto a rimmed baking sheet. Add the olive oil and toss to coat. Roast for 25 minutes or until the vegetables are lightly browned, stirring occasionally. Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Pour the sauce over the vegetables and stir to coat. Sprinkle with the oregano. Roast for 5 minutes more. Sprinkle with the parsley. Serve with the cheese.
