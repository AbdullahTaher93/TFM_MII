Position oven rack in upper third of oven; preheat broiler. Coat a broiler pan with cooking spray. Gently combine ground beef, beans, cilantro and jalapenos in a medium bowl (do not overmix). Shape into four 5-by-2-inch oblong patties and place on the prepared pan. Broil the patties until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 165 degrees F, 12 to 14 minutes. Meanwhile, mash together avocado, salsa and garlic powder in a small bowl. Place tortillas on a clean work surface. Spread each with the guacamole, then sprinkle with lettuce and cheese. Top each with a burger and roll into a wrap. Serve immediately, with lime wedges.
