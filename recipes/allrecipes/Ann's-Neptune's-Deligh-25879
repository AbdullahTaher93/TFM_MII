Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt 3 tablespoons of butter. Remove from heat and whisk in flour. Pour in 1/2 cup of heavy cream and whisk well, return to heat. Add cheese and stir until creamy. Remove from heat and pour in remaining cream. Stir in sherry, paprika, crabmeat, and shrimp. Spoon mixture into 6 large individual ramekins. In a food processor or blender, blend together croutons and parsley. Top each filled ramekin with crouton mixture. Drizzle melted butter over the top. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes or until top is browned and bubbly.
