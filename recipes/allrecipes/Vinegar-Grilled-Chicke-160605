Place the water, vinegar, pepper, salt, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and melted margarine into a large, resealable plastic bag. Shake to combine ingredients, then add chicken, seal, and shake to coat. Place in refrigerator to marinate at least 4 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil grate. Remove chicken from marinade, and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade. Cook on preheated grill until no longer pink in the center; about 10 minutes per side.
