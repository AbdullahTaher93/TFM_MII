Heat the broiler. Slice the rolls or bread horizontally in half and toast both sides lightly under the broiler. Rub the cut sides of the garlic over the toasted sides of the bread; reserve the garlic cloves. Cut the bread into bite-size cubes; set aside. Separate the yolk and white of the hard-boiled egg. Roughly chop the white and set it aside. Mash the yolk with the mustard in a small bowl, then gradually stir in the lemon juice and yogurt, with seasoning to taste, to make a smooth dressing. Using a cheese knife or vegetable peeler, cut fine shavings or very thin slices from the Gruyere and Parmesan cheeses. Alternatively, coarsely grate the cheese. Rub the inside of a salad bowl with the reserved garlic cloves, then discard the garlic. Place the lettuce in the bowl and add the tomatoes, scallions, and fennel. Add the dressing to the salad and toss lightly. Sprinkle the egg white, bread cubes, and cheese on top. Mix gently and serve at once, before the bread begins to soften.
