Place bacon in a large saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until bacon is evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Stir occasionally while cooking. Drain the bacon grease from the pan, and transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and stir in asparagus and peas; stir occasionally and cook until the vegetables are slightly softened but still bright green, about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside. Cook and stir onion until translucent over medium heat in the same pan as bacon, about 5 minutes; stir in asparagus, peas, and bacon pieces. Squeeze lemon juice over the asparagus mixture; season with salt and black pepper. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and stir in the fettuccine; cook, stirring often, until fettuccine are tender, about 5 minutes. Drain well. Stir hot fettuccine into the pan with asparagus mixture over medium-low heat and toss gently to combine. Stir in cream and bring mixture to a simmer. Sprinkle cheese blend over the mixture and allow to stand until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes; stir cheese lightly into the fettuccine and vegetables to serve.
