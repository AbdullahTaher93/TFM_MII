Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 minutes or until al dente; drain but no need to cool. Transfer to a large bowl. Add the lemon yogurt, mayonnaise, mint, green onion, grapes, salt and pepper. Stir to coat the pasta evenly and distribute the grapes. This can be served warm or cold, but I prefer it cold during the summer because it makes such a refreshing treat.
