Heat olive oil in a skillet or wok over medium heat. Add chicken cubes, 1/4 cup honey, and ginger. Cook and stir until chicken is golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add bell peppers, onion, broccoli, pineapple, and remaining 1/2 cup honey. Cover and cook over medium-high heat until vegetables are tender, 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
