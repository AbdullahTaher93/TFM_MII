Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan. Whisk cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Mix buttermilk, beer, and melted butter in a separate bowl; gradually stir into the cornmeal mixture to incorporate into a batter. Add eggs and sugar to the batter; stir. Fold green onions and jalapeno pepper through the batter; pour into prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
