Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until tender but firm, about 10 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water until cooled. Set aside. Toast pine nuts in a small dry skillet over medium heat, stirring almost constantly, until golden and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Set aside. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a wok over high heat. Add chicken pieces and saute until no longer pink inside, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon oil to the wok. Add peppers, shallots and garlic, and saute; until the peppers are tender-crisp, about 2 minutes. Add to the reserved chicken. Add broth, vinegar and rosemary to the pan and bring to a boil. Add artichokes and the reserved pasta and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Return the reserved chicken mixture to the pan and toss with the pasta. Taste and adjust seasoning and sprinkle with pine nuts. Serve warm.
