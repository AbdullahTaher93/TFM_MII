Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Mix first 6 ingredients in a medium mixing bowl. Add salmon; turn to coat both sides with mixture. Place salmon fillets on an 18 X 24 inch sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Pour remaining mixture over salmon; seal and place on a cookie sheet pan. Bake until just opaque throughout, about 20 to 25 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges.
