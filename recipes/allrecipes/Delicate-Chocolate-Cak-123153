In a saucepan, combine oil, water, butter and cocoa. Bring to a boil over medium heat; boil for 1 minute. Remove from the heat. In a mixing bowl, combine flour and sugar; gradually add cocoa mixture, beating well. Add buttermilk and eggs; mix well. Pour into a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 28-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. Cut cake into four 7-1/2-in. x 5-in. rectangles. Wrap two of the rectangles separately in foil; refrigerate or freeze. Set the other two rectangles aside. For frosting, combine butter, cocoa and milk in a saucepan. Bring to a boil; boil for 1 minute (the mixture will appear curdled). Pour into a mixing bowl. Gradually add sugar and vanilla; beat until frosting is cooled and reaches desired spreading consistency. Frost the top of one cake rectangle; top with the second rectangle. Frost the top and sides of cake.
