Season potatoes with salt and pepper to taste. Place flour in a shallow dish or bowl; coat potatoes with flour. Add onion to potato/flour mixture and set aside. Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is hot add potato/onion mixture and cook until golden brown, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. When mixture has browned, reduce heat to low, add water and cover skillet. Simmer for 20 minutes, or until tender.
