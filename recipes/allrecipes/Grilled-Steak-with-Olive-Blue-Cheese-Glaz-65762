Heat butter in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add shallots; cook 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add broth and wine; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer uncovered until sauce has reduced to 1/2 cup, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, season steaks with salt and pepper. Grill over medium-hot coals or in a ridged grill pan over medium heat until cooked as desired, 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium rare depending on thickness of steaks. Remove reduced sauce from heat; stir in olives, cheese and thyme. Arrange steaks on warm serving plates; top with glaze.
