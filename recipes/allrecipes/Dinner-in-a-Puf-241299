Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cut puff pastry into 6 equal squares about 4 inches diagonally and 1/4-inch thick. Push each square into a muffin cup and gently press down. Place 1 tablespoon goat cheese into each pastry. Spoon 1 tablespoon avocado into 3 of the pastries and 1 tablespoon jam into the other 3 pastries. Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Top the avocado puffs each with 1 slice sun-dried tomatoes. Sprinkle pine nuts over all the puffs.
