Place salmon in a shallow microwave bowl. Add 2 cups water. Cover and microwave on high 7-9 minutes or until salmon is cooked as desired. Remove from water; refrigerate until cool. In a small bowl, combine remaining ingredients (except lime). Refrigerate 30 minutes. Serve salmon surrounded by the salsa and lime wedges.
