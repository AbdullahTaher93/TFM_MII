Place cornstarch and sugar in a small saucepan. Add lemon juice and water and whisk until smooth. Keep whisking constantly, over medium heat, until thick (5-8 minutes). Remove from heat and transfer to a medium-sized bowl. Stir in the lemon rind. Let cool to room temperature. Use an electric mixer and beat egg whites until stiff but not dry. Fold this into the lemon mixture, cover tightly, and chill at least 1 hour. Without cleaning the beaters, whip the LACTAID(R) Fat Free Milk for 2 minutes. Stir 1/3 of beaten egg whites into the mousse; then fold the remaining whites into the mousse. Cover tightly and chill until serving time.
