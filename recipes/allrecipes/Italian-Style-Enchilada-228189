In a small saucepan, heat Classico(R) Tomato and Basil pasta sauce until heated through. Meanwhile, remove bones from chicken; cut meat into bite-size strips. Finely chop dried tomatoes. Toss together the chicken, tomatoes, 1/2 cup of the cheese, and green onion. To assemble enchiladas, coat a 2-quart rectangular baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Spread 2 tablespoons of the Classico(R) Tomato and Basil pasta sauce over bottom of the dish. Spoon about 1/4 cup of the chicken mixture just below center of each tortilla. Roll up. Place seam-side down in dish. Repeat with remaining chicken mixture and tortillas. Pour remaining pasta sauce over enchiladas. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake in a 450 degree F oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until heated through and cheese is melted. If desired, garnish sliced green onions.
