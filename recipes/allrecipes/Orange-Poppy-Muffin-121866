In a bowl, combine the first five ingredients. In another bowl, beat egg, sour cream, butter, orange juice and peel. Stir in dry ingredients just until moistened. Fill paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Combine spread ingredients in a small mixing bowl; beat until smooth. Serve with muffins.
