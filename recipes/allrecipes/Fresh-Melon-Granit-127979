Heat water and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves; cool until barely warm. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade, combine melon, lemon juice, and the cooled sugar mixture. Puree until smooth (makes about 4 cups). Transfer mixture to two cake pans and place in freezer. Freeze 1 1/2 to 2 hours, stirring every half hour, until frozen solid. Break into chunks and return to food processor. Process mixture until smooth, stirring occasionally if granita is thick. Transfer to a plastic container. Return to freezer 20 to 30 minutes, until granita is firm. Serve in prechilled dessert bowls or glasses.
