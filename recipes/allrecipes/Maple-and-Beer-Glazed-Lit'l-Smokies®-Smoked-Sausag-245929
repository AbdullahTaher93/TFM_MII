Combine the beer, syrup, honey, cornstarch, cinnamon and black pepper in a large skillet and bring to a boil, stirring frequently; reduce heat and simmer for 15 - 17 minutes, stirring frequently, until it has been reduced by half. Add smoked sausages and continue cooking for 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove smoked sausages from the skillet and place into a serving dish, drizzle with sauce. Serve with cheese and crackers.
