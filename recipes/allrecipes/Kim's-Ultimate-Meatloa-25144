Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium bowl combine the ground meat, egg, onion, 1/2 cup tomato sauce and cracker crumbs. Season with salt and pepper to taste and mix well; press mixture into a loaf pan and make a depression in the center. Set aside. In a small bowl combine the remaining 1/2 cup tomato sauce, vinegar, mustard, brown sugar and water. Mix together until sugar has dissolved and pour liquid over meatloaf. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour.
