Place beets in a large saucepan, and cover with water. Bring to a boil, and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the size of the beets. Drain, cool, peel, and dice. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute onion until tender. Stir in flour, and cook for about 2 minutes. Gradually stir in chicken stock. Add the diced beets, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in brown sugar and vinegar. Cook for 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
