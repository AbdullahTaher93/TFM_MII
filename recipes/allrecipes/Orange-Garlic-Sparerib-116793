Place ribs in a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan; season with salt and pepper. Cover tightly with foil; bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes. Drain off any fat. In a saucepan, combine the remaining ingredients; bring to a boil. Pour over ribs. Bake, uncovered, for 45-60 minutes or until ribs are tender, basting frequently.
