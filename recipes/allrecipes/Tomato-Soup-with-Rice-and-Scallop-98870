Heat oil in a Dutch oven or small soup kettle over medium-high heat. Add the onion, celery, and carrot; saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Add rice and basil and cook, stirring until rice is evenly coated in oil, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in undrained tomatoes. Add chicken broth and season with salt and pepper. Simmer until rice is almost tender, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, rinse the scallops. Stir scallops and lemon juice into the soup and simmer until scallops are opaque, about 8 to 10 minutes longer.
