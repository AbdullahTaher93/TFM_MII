In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan, bring 1 inch of water to boiling over high heat. Add beans and cook, uncovered, until barely tender when pierced, 7 to 8 minutes. Drain and immediately immerse beans in ice water until cool (this keeps them bright green); drain and set aside. Return frying pan to medium heat. Add butter; when melted, stir in onion and garlic. Stir occasionally until they begin to brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Add tomatoes, basil, and drained green beans. Stir gently just until heated through, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
