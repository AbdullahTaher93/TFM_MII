In a 2-qt. microwave-safe bowl, combine sugar and corn syrup. Heat, uncovered, on high for 4 minutes; stir. Heat 3 minutes longer. Stir in peanuts, butter and cinnamon. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 30-60 seconds or until mixture turns a light amber color (mixture will be very hot). Quickly stir in baking soda and vanilla until light and foamy. Immediately pour onto a greased baking sheet and spread with a metal spatula. Refrigerate for 20 minutes or until firm; break into small pieces. Store in an airtight container.
