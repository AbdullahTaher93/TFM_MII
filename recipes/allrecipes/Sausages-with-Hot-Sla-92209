Slash each sausage 3 or 4 times on each side. Pour oil into a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Add sausages and cook, turning often, until hot in thickest part (5 to 7 minutes; cut to test). Lift sausages from pan and keep warm on a serving plate. To same pan, add vinegar, sugar, cumin seeds, and onion; bring to a boil, stirring to loosen pan drippings. Remove pan from heat and add coleslaw mix. Mix lightly to coat with onion mixture. Spoon coleslaw alongside sausages. Offer mustard to add to taste.
