Stir green beans, olive oil, garlic, sugar, and salt in a large skillet. Place a cover on the skillet and cook over low heat until green beans are slightly tender, about 15 minutes. Pour beef broth over the green bean mixture; continue cooking uncovered about 5 minutes more. Increase heat to medium-high. Stir tomatoes and parsley through the green bean mixture; continue cooking until beans are cooked through and tender, about 5 minutes more.
