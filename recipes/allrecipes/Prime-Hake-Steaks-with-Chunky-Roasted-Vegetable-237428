Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place onion wedges and garlic in a roasting pan; drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over mixture. Turn onions a few times to evenly coat with oil. Add tomatoes to onion mixture and drizzle remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over tomatoes. Season mixture with salt and basil. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Add hake steaks and wine to onion mixture; sprinkle brown sugar over the onion mixture. Bake in the oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 30 minutes more.
