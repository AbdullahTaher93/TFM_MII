Prepare the noodles according to package directions. Meanwhile, bring the sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, wine (if using), lemon juice, lemon zest (if using) and oregano to a simmer in a large skillet set over medium heat. Stir in the shrimp and cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until no pink remains. Season to taste with pepper. Serve the shrimp mixture over the hot cooked noodles. Garnish each serving with feta cheese and parsley.
