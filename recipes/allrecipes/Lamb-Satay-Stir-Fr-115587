To prepare satay sauce: Whisk peanut butter, soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, ginger and crushed red pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Whisk broth and cornstarch in a small bowl until combined and add to the peanut butter mixture; whisk until smooth. To prepare lamb and vegetables: Coat a Dutch oven with cooking spray and place over medium-high heat. Add lamb and cook, stirring, until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon. Add oil to the pan, then green beans and carrots; cook, stirring, until tender-crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Add cabbage (or coleslaw), scallions and garlic; cook, stirring, until tender-crisp, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Stir the satay sauce and add it to the pan along with the lamb. Cook, stirring often, until the sauce bubbles and thickens, about 1 minute.
