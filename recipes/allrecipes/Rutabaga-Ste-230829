Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir chicken in hot oil until completely browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add rutabagas, beets, carrots, celery, and red onion to the pot. Pour enough water over the vegetable mixture to cover completely. Reduce heat to low and cook at a simmer for at least 4 hours, adding water as needed to keep vegetable submerged.
