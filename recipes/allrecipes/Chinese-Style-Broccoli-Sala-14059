Separate broccoli into bite-sized florets. Peel tough skin off stem and quarter it into 2 inch pieces cut slantwise. Bring 2 1/2 quarts water, 2 tablespoons oil and 1 tablespoon salt to boil. Add broccoli and boil quickly for 1 minute; plunge into cold water to set color; drain and place on platter or in a bowl. In a small bowl combine soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and sugar. Pour mixture over broccoli, toss. This salad can be served hot or cold, your choice!
