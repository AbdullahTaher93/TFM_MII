In a medium saucepan, combine the water, sugar, mint leaves and stems or dried mint, and lemon zest. Bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 20 minutes. If using fresh mint, remove it and the lemon zest with a slotted spoon and discard. If using dried mint, strain the syrup. Bring the syrup back to a simmer. Remove from the heat and add the berries. Stir gently and then pour into a bowl. Let cool to room temperature. Serve the berries and syrup in bowls topped with the fresh mint sprigs, if using.
