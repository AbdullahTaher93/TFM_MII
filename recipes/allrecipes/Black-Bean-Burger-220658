Blend black beans and jalapeno pepper in a food processor until the beans are completely pureed; transfer to a large mixing bowl. Mix breadcrumbs, red bell pepper, onion, eggs, cumin, chili powder, garlic, liquid smoke flavoring, and ranch dressing mix into the black bean mixture until evenly combined. Chill mixture in freezer until firm enough to shape into patties, about 1 hour. Divide mixture into 8 portions; shape into patties. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook burgers in hot oil until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Top burgers with smoked Gouda cheese to serve.
