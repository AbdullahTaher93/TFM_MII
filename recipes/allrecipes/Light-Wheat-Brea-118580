In a mixing bowl, combine 2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, sugar, salt and yeast. In a saucepan, heat water and butter to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to the dry ingredients; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining all-purpose flour to form a stiff dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Cover and let rest for 20 minutes. Divide dough in half; shape into loaves. Place in two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Cover and refrigerate for up to 12 hours. Remove from the refrigerator; let stand in a warm place for 30 minutes. Bake at 400 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
