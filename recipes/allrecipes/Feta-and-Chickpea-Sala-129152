Put all the dressing ingredients into a large salad bowl, adding pepper to taste (there is no need to add salt, because the cheese is salty); whisk together. Add the lettuce, tomatoes, green bell pepper, onion, cucumber, chickpeas, and olives. Toss gently and coat everything with the dressing. Sprinkle the cubes of feta cheese over the salad, toss again gently, and serve immediately.
