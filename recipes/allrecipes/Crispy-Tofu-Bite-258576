Drain tofu, place on a plate, and stack heavy plates on top of it to drain any extra moisture, at least 15 minutes. Slice into 24 bite-size pieces. Combine flour, cornstarch, salt, and pepper in a gallon-size resealable plastic bag. Toss tofu into bag, seal completely, and shake to coat. Transfer tofu pieces to a plate, shaking off any excess flour. Pour vegetable oil into a skillet; heat on medium-high until just smoking. Cook tofu, turning often, until golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes per side.
