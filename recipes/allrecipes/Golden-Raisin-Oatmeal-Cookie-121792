In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Beat in egg, water and vanilla. Combine the oats, flour, orange peel, cinnamon and baking soda; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Stir in the raisins (dough will be stiff). Drop by level tablespoonfuls 2 in. apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.
