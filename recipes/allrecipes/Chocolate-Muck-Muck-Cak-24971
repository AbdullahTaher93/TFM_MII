Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly spray 6 - 3 inch muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray. Place chopped chocolate and butter in a metal bowl. Set bowl above a saucepan of lightly simmering water and melt until completely smooth and even. Remove from heat and stir in eggs and yolks with a whisk. Lastly, stir in powdered sugar and flour. Bake in preheated oven for exactly 7 minutes. The cake may appear under-baked. Remove from oven and serve immediately.
