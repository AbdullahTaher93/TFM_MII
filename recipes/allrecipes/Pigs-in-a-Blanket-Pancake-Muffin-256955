Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Add the pancake mix, milk, eggs, oil, and syrup to a medium mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Chop the cooked sausage links into small pieces and stir into the batter. Pour batter 2/3 full into a greased or lined muffin tin. Bake for 13 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Serve with extra syrup, as desired.
