Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8x4-inch loaf pans. Mix flour, wheat bran, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer using the whisk attachment. Beat brown sugar, applesauce, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; fold in zucchini. Pour zucchini mixture into flour mixture and mix well; pour into prepared loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a loaf comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Cool bread in pans on a wire rack for 20 minutes; remove bread from pans and completely cool.
