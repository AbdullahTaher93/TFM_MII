Stem eggplant, quarter lengthwise, then slice thinly crosswise. In a 12-inch nonstick frying pan (use one that has a lid) over medium-high heat, stir together eggplant and oil. Cover and cook 10 minutes; stir once or twice. Reduce heat to medium and add garlic, onion, zucchini, and red bell pepper. Stir often, uncovered, until zucchini is tender-crisp to bite, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and basil; stir until tomatoes are soft, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Pour eggs into pan, cover, and cook until eggs are set, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle cheese onto eggs. Cook, covered, until cheese melts, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Cut frittata into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature. Add salt and pepper to taste.
