Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a 15x10x1 inch jelly roll pan, spread the coconut out in a thin layer. Toast at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), stirring and shaking often to toast evenly, until golden about 5 to 7 minutes. In a small sauce pan, mix the sugar, honey, cream, butter and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the syrup reaches 248 degrees F (121 degrees C) on a candy thermometer (or when a drop or two dropped into a cup of cold water will form a firm ball that will not flatten when removed from water). Remove from heat and stir in the toasted coconut. On a sheet of buttered wax paper, drop level tablespoons of the mixture well apart. Let stand until cold. Melt chocolate chips and drizzle over cookies. Let stand until chocolate hardens. Store in a single layer in an airtight container.
