Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and dust a standard size loaf pan with whey protein powder. If you don't have whey powder, then just skip the dusting. Pyrex or ceramic loaf pan work better than metal. Put the loaf pan in the refrigerator while you prepare the rest. Slice the zucchini and yellow squash about 1/4 inch thick (or thicker) then slicing the rounds into halves, keeping the two squash separate. Set aside. Cheese layer: In a mix bowl, beat the egg well. Add the dried onion, oregano, rosemary, pepper and salt. Mix. Fold in the cottage cheese and the shredded parmesan cheese. Set aside. Pumpkin layer: In a separate small mixing bowl, beat the other egg and add the pumpkin, basil, cinnamon, salt and pepper. (No I didn't forget sweetener, this is a savory dish). Mix until well combined. Get the pan from the refrigerator. First form a flat layer on the bottom of the pan with the zucchini, starting at the corners, then along the edge then filling in the middle. You may need to cut a few into smaller pieces to fit into the gaps. You may have a few slices left over (save them for your next salad). Next add 1/2 of the cheese mixture, spreading it evenly over the zucchini and forming a smooth surface using a spatula or large spoon. The next layer is the pumpkin mixture. I find it easiest to place small spoonfuls all over the cheese layer then carefully smooth it out with the spatula. Then place the yellow squash on top of the pumpkin in the same manner as you did the zucchini layer. Then add the remaining cheese mixture. For the topping you can sprinkle each ingredient separately (that's what I do) or blend them together and then sprinkle on top. Place loaf pan in a 350 degrees F oven and cook for 30 minutes. As soon as it comes out, run a knife along the edges. Let cool for about 3 minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature. Simply spoon out each serving and enjoy the different flavors of each layer.
