Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and pan-fry chicken breasts until browned and no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes per side. Sprinkle chicken breasts with red wine vinegar, lime juice, sugar, salt, black pepper, 1 chopped green onion, garlic, and oregano; pan-fry until green onion is soft, an additional 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken breasts to a plate and keep warm. Place light mayonnaise and chipotle pepper into a blender and blend until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and stir in 1 1/2 tablespoon of chopped green onion and sweet pickle relish. Toast sourdough bread slices. Layer 4 bread slices each with 1/4 cup of lettuce, a chicken breast, and 1 mozzarella cheese slice. Spread remaining slices with chipotle mayonnaise and place on top to make sandwiches. Serve while still warm.
