Toss parsnip, carrot, and scallion together in a mixing bowl; add flour, salt, and pepper and toss to coat. Beat half-and-half and eggs together in a separate bowl until smooth; slowly stream over the parsnip mixture while stirring. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Shape pancake mixture into patties and put into hot skillet. Flatten patties with the back of a spatula and cook until browned, about 5 minutes per side.
