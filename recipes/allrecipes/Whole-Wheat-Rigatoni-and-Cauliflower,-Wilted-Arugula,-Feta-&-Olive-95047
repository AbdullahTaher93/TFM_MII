Bring a generous 2 quarts of water and salt to a boil in a large soup kettle; add pasta and cook, partially covered, for 4 minutes. Add cauliflower and cook, partially covered, until pasta and cauliflower are tender, about 6 minutes longer. Reserve 1 cup of cooking liquid, drain pasta and return top pot. Meanwhile, heat oil in a 10-inch skillet. Add peppers, and saute until tender, about 4 minutes. Add garlic; continue to saute until golden and fragrant, about 1 minute longer. Add tomatoes, seasoning and olives; simmer sauce about 5 minutes. Add sauce to pasta, along with reserved cooking liquid, arugula and 1/2 cup feta. Toss, seasoning to taste with pepper. Serve with additional feta. For lunch, pack pasta and extra feta in leakproof containers. Warm pasta in microwave and top with feta.
