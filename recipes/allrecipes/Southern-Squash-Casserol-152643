Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place the squash, carrots, onions, bell pepper, and mushrooms in a pan. Pour in enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until tender and easily pierced with a fork, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and drain well using a sieve or colander. Mix the sour cream, chicken broth, cream of chicken soup, eggs, Italian seasoning, and red pepper together in a large bowl. Toss the sour cream mixture with the chicken, cornbread, and 2 cups Cheddar cheese until evenly blended. Stir in the vegetable mixture. Spread the mixture evenly over the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until the center sets, about 50 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup of Cheddar cheese. Bake until the cheese melts, about 10 minutes more. Serve immediately.
