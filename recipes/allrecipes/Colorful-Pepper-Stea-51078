Trim excess fat from beef. Cut beef into 2x1/4-inch strips. (Beef is easier to cut if partially frozen, about 1 hour.) Heat oil in wok or 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Cook beef in oil about 5 minutes, turning frequently, until brown. Stir in water, onion, garlic and gingerroot. Heat to boiling; reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer 12 to 15 minutes for round steak, 5 to 8 minutes for sirloin steak, adding bell peppers during last 5 minutes of simmering, until beef is tender and peppers are crisp-tender. Mix cornstarch, sugar and soy sauce; stir into beef mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and boils. Boil and stir 1 minute. Cut each tomato into 8 wedges and place on beef mixture. Cover and cook over low heat about 3 minutes or just until tomatoes are heated through. Serve with rice.
