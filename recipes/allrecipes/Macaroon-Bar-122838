Sprinkle 1-1/2 cups coconut into a well-greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Combine milk and extract; drizzle half over the coconut. Unroll crescent dough; arrange in a single layer over coconut. Drizzle with remaining sweetened condensed milk and sprinkle with remaining coconut. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Cool completely before cutting. Store in the refrigerator.
