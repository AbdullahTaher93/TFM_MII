Heat olive oil and curry paste in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, carrot, celery, red bell pepper, and red pepper flakes until onion is softened and translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Break the bouillon cubes into onion mixture; add lentils and stir. Pour enough water into the pot, so the water line is 1 inch above the lentil and onion mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until lentils are fully cooked, about 40 minutes. Stir spaghetti sauce into the soup and simmer 5 minutes. Stir cilantro and black pepper into soup right before serving.
