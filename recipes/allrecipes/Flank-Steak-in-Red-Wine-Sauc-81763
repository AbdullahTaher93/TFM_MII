Slice the flank steak across the grain into 1/4 inch thick slices. Coarsely chop the fresh herbs; set aside. In a deep skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat and add steak strips to sear them for 1 minute. Add the garlic, tomato sauce, wine and some black pepper. Reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes, covered. Add the mushroom and fresh herbs, stir well and simmer another 15 minutes. If you are using any dried herbs, add them in step 3 when you add the wine. Taste test and add salt and pepper as desired.
