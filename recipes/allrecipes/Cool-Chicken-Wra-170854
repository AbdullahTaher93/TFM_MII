Spread 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise on one side of each tortilla and sprinkle with dill weed. Layer equal amounts of lettuce, chicken, RED GOLD(R) or REDPACK(R) DICED TOMATOES, green onions and cheese in the center of each tortilla. Fold the bottom of each tortilla up 2 inches and then roll to enclose the filling. Wrap each tortilla tightly with plastic wrap. Store in refrigerator until serving time. Cut each wrap into halves before serving.
