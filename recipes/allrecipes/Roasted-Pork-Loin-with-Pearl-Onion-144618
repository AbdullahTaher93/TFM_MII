Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Rub pork with salt, pepper, and 2 teaspoons mustard. On a plate, season breadcrumbs with salt and pepper. Coat top and sides of roast with breadcrumbs, leaving ends uncoated. In a 9-by-13-inch roasting pan, toss onions with oil; season with salt and pepper. Place pork in center of pan; roast 15 minutes. Turn onions; cook 10 minutes. Add 1/4 cup water; stir onions to coat. Continue cooking until onions are caramelized, pork juices run clear, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat registers 140 degrees;, 10 to 15 minutes more. Remove pork and onions from pan; let meat rest 20 minutes before slicing. While meat is resting, add 1/2 cup water and remaining teaspoon mustard to pan. Cook over medium heat, scraping up browned bits. Stir until sauce is fully blended, 3 to 5 minutes; serve with pork and onions.
