Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow to cool. Stir the rice, tuna, corn, sweet pickle relish, and salad dressing in a large bowl to combine. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.
