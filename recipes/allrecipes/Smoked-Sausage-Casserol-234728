Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bring a pot of water to boil; cook peas in the boiling water until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Drain. Mix peas, sausage, corn, chili sauce, onion, basil, black pepper, and 1 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese together in a 3-quart casserole dish. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling, 30 to 40 minutes. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese over casserole and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 more minutes.
