In a 12-inch skillet, cook ground beef and onions over medium-high heat for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently, until beef is thoroughly cooked. Stir in tomatoes, chili beans and corn. Heat to boiling, then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer uncovered for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, heat oven to 375 degrees F. Unroll dough and separate at perforations into 12 breadsticks. Cut 4 of the breadsticks in half lengthwise, shape into 8 coils on ungreased cookie sheets. Cut each remaining breadstick lengthwise into 3 strips, making 24 long strips. Cut each in half crosswise, making 48 short strips. Place 3 short strips on each side of each coil, placing ends under coil; pinch to attach. Bend strips in center to resemble spider legs or place a small piece of crumpled foil under 3 legs to make them stand up in the center. Brush spider breads with beaten egg white and sprinkle with Italian herbs. Place 2 olive slices on each to resemble the eyes. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until spider body and legs are light golden brown. Top individual servings of chili with cheese, and serve with warm spider bread.
