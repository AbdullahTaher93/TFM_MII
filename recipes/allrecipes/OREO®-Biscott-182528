Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix sugar, butter, eggs and vanilla in large bowl until well blended. Add flour, baking powder and salt; mix well. Stir in chopped cookies. Divide dough in half. Shape each half into 9x3-inch loaf on lightly greased baking sheet with floured hands. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown and toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean. Remove from oven; cool 10 minutes. Cut each loaf diagonally into 16 (1/2-inch-thick) slices. Place slices, cut sides up, on same baking sheet. Bake an additional 10 to 12 minutes on each side or until lightly toasted on both sides. Cool completely on wire rack. Drizzle cooled biscotti with melted chocolate.
