Remove chicken from skillet; cut into 1-inch pieces. Cover to keep warm. Heat remaining tablespoon oil in same nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add 3 tablespoons soy sauce mixture, garlic, and frozen vegetables and noodles from meal starter; cook 6 to 8 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender, stirring frequently.
