In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, lemon juice, basil, yogurt, lemon peel, garlic, ginger and red pepper flakes. Remove 1/4 cup to another bowl; cover and refrigerate. Pour the remaining marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add chicken. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate overnight. Drain and discard marinade. Place chicken in a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Spoon reserved marinade over chicken. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 20 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 170 degrees F.
