In a large bowl, cream butter, white sugar, and brown sugar. Add eggs and beat until smooth. Sift together flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir dry ingredients into the creamed mixture until well blended. Stir in walnuts last. Shape dough into logs about 2 inches in diameter, wrap them in wax paper, and refrigerate until firm. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice dough logs into 1/2 inch slices, and place on baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes. Mmmm nuttylicious!
