Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix ground beef, chorizo sausage, bread crumbs, 1/2 cup pasta sauce, egg, garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until well combined. Shape meat mixture into a loaf pan. Spread 1 tablespoon prepared pasta sauce over top of loaf. Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
