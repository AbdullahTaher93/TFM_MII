Prepare grill for indirect heat, using a drip pan. Place ribs over drip pan. Grill, covered, over indirect medium heat for 60 minutes, turning occasionally. Meanwhile, in a blender or food processor, combine the remaining ingredients; cover and process until smooth. Baste ribs with some of the sauce. Grill 15-20 minutes longer or until meat is tender and juices run clear, basting occasionally with remaining sauce.
