Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Line large cookie sheet with cooking parchment paper. In medium bowl, mix sausage, cheese and cranberries. Separate dough into 8 triangles. Slightly stretch shortest side of dough triangle. Gently press filling into tablespoon, and place at shortest side of triangle. Fold corner of dough over filling to make small cone to surround filling; press edge to seal. Wrap remaining point around front of filled crescent on cookie sheet. Press bottom layer of opening of dough cone to lengthen slightly. Add remaining filling to remaining crescents, dividing evenly. Curve tip of each crescent slightly for cornucopia appearance. Brush with beaten egg. Bake 13 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
