Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine tomatoes, mango, peaches, bell pepper, onion, cilantro, and chile pepper in medium bowl. Whisk lime juice, vinegar, sugar, orange juice, and salt in small bowl. Add to tomato mixture and stir well. Chill, covered, at least 1 hour to blend flavors. Place pita wedges on large baking sheet and coat lightly with cooking spray. Sprinkle wedges with seasoning blend. Bake 5 to 6 minutes or until edges just start to brown. Cool and serve with salsa.
