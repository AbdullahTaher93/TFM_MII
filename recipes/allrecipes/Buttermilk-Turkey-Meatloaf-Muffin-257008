Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray 12 muffin cups with cooking spray. Combine turkey, stuffing mix, chicken broth, buttermilk, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Divide mixture among the muffin cups. Bake in the preheated until cooked through, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
