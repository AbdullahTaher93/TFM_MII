Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Mix Cheddar cheese, rye flour, walnuts, butter, salt, white pepper, paprika, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl until dough kneads easily. Roll dough onto a flat work surface using a rolling pin until dough is very thin. Cut dough into squares and place on baking sheet 1/2-inch apart. Puncture each cracker with a fork a few times. Place the baking sheet in the oven and reduce heat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cook crackers until crisp, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool crackers on baking sheet, about 3 minutes.
