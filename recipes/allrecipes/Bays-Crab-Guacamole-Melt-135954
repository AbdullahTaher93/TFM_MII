Place six Bays English Muffin halves split-side up on a sheet pan and spread each muffin half with one tablespoon of ready-to-serve guacamole. Then layer a generous spoonful of your favorite supermarket deli crab or shrimp salad mixture on each of the halves. Top with a generous sprinkling of shredded cheddar cheese and broil for two to three minutes, or until cheese melts, and enjoy!
