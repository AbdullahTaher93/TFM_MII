Pour whole box of pasta into a large skillet (approximately 12 inches in diameter). Pour 3 cups of cold water into the pan, ensuring that the liquid covers the pasta. Turn the burner to high, then set your timer for 10 minutes (optional: add a bit of salt to taste). Cook on high, stirring occasionally, until 3/4 of the liquid has evaporated. Add olive oil and sauce to skillet and continue to cook for approximately 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and stir in basil, cheese and salt and black pepper. Serve immediately.
