Place melon, mint, 2 cups yogurt, and 2 tablespoons SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener into blender and puree until smooth. Transfer puree to plastic container. Repeat with blueberries, remaining 2 cups yogurt, and remaining 4 tablespoons SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener. Transfer to a different plastic container. Cover both containers of puree with lids and freeze for 2 hours, stirring each every 30 minutes to break up ice crystals. Remove from freezer a few minutes before serving. Spoon mounds of each frozen puree into glass dessert cups or wine glasses and garnish with mint leaves. (If purees are too firm to serve, microwave about 10 seconds on medium power to soften slightly.)
