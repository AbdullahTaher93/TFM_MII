Combine all ingredients for barbecue sauce in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 20 minutes, or until slightly thickened. (Top with a splatter guard during cooking.) Use immediately or cool, cover, and refrigerate for up to 1 month. Combine SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, salt, and hot water in 1-gallon zipper-lock bag and shake to dissolve SPLENDA(R) and salt. Add cold water and chicken. Press air out of bag, seal, and refrigerate 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Remove chicken from brine and discard brine. Refrigerate chicken until half an hour before you want to grill it (up to 1 day). Pat chicken dry with paper towels and sprinkle all over with pepper. Let rest at room temperature for 20 minutes. Heat grill to medium-high. Brush grill grate and coat with oil. Put chicken on grill, cover, and cook 5 to 7 minutes on one side. Flip chicken and brush with barbecue sauce. Cook another 5 to 7 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear (about 170 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer). Coat chicken with 1 1/2 cups Sweet and Smoky Barbecue Sauce.
