Place cucumber slices between 2 paper towels set in a colander. Allow liquid to drain, about 10 minutes. Mix cream cheese, mayonnaise, garlic powder, onion salt, and Worcestershire sauce in a bowl until smooth. Spread cream cheese mixture evenly on one side of each bread slice. Divide cucumber slices over half of the bread slices; sprinkle lemon pepper on cucumber. Stack the other half of the bread slices with spread sides down over the cucumber slices to make sandwiches.
