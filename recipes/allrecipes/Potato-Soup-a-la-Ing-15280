In a large pot over high heat, combine the potatoes, bouillon, water, salt and pepper, garlic powder and nutmeg. Cook for about 15 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Add the heavy cream and the green onions. Stir well and allow soup to bubble up, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and pour into individual bowls. Garnish with bacon bits and enjoy!
