Combine the ground cookies, 1/4 cup sugar, and the melted butter in a small bowl. Press into the bottom of a lightly greased, 9-inch spring-form pan. Beat together the eggs and the remaining 1 cup sugar. Add the vanilla and flour, and mix to blend thoroughly. Gently whisk in the yogurt. Pour batter into the prepared pan, and bake 45-50 minutes or until barely set in center. Turn oven off and cool cake in oven. Bring cake to room temperature, then refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. Serve cake with berries.
