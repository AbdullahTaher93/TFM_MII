Mix sugar, corn starch and salt in a large microwaveable bowl. Whisk in milk and egg yolks until well blended. Microwave on HIGH (100%) for about 5 to 7 minutes, stirring every 1 to 2 minutes. Cook until pudding is thick and has boiled at least 1 minute. Remove from microwave. Stir in butter and vanilla. Cover surface with plastic wrap. Chill 30 minutes. Layer pudding with bananas and fudge topping in individual clear serving bowls. Garnish with whipped topping, chopped pecans and cherries, if desired.
