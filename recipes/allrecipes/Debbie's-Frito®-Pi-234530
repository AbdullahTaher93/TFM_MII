Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread corn chips in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Sprinkle olives evenly over chips. Mix chili with water in a large bowl; pour mixture over olives and corn chips. Top chili with Cheddar cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.
