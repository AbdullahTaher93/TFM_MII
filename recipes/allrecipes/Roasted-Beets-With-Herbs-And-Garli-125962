Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cut each beet into 8 wedges. Place the beets, broth, oil, garlic, shallot, sage, allspice, salt, and pepper in an 11 inch X 7 inch baking dish. Toss to coat well. Cover tightly with foil and bake, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour, or until the beets are very tender.
