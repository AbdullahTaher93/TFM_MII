Place potatoes in a 6-qt. pressure cooker. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and garlic powder; add broth. Close cover securely; place pressure regulator on vent pipe. Bring cooker to full pressure over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-high; cook for 6 minutes. (Pressure regulator should maintain a slow steady rocking motion; adjust heat if needed.) Remove from the heat; immediately cool according to manufacturer's directions until pressure is completely reduced. Sprinkle with parsley.
