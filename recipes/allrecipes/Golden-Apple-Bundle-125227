In a bowl, combine the apples, walnuts, brown sugar, raisins, flour, lemon peel and cinnamon; set aside. Roll pastry to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut into 5-in. circles. Spoon about 1/4 cup apple mixture into center of each circle. Moisten edges of pastry with water. Fold over and seal edges with a fork. Place on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 450 degrees F for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 400 degrees F bake 10 minutes longer. Brush each with milk and sprinkle with sugar; return to oven for 5 minutes.
