Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over low heat; sweat garlic and shallots until they start to become aromatic. Increase heat to medium and add mushrooms and thyme; saute until mushrooms begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Deglaze pan with wine and simmer 2 minutes. Stir in artichokes and capers and simmer 2 to 3 minutes more. Pour mushroom mixture over pasta and serve.
