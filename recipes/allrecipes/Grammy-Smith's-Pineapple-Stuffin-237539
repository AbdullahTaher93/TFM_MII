Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 1 1/2-quart baking dish. Beat sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; add eggs and beat until smooth. Stir crushed pineapple and juice into creamed butter mixture until evenly incorporated. Fold bread into pineapple mixture; transfer to the prepared baking dish. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and set, about 1 hour.
