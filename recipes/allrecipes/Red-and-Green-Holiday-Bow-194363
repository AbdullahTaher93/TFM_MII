Stir 2 cups of the boiling water into each flavor of gelatin in separate bowls at least 2 minutes until completely dissolved. Stir 1 cup of the cold water into dissolved gelatin in each bowl. Refrigerate lime gelatin 1-1/2 hours or until thickened (spoon drawn through leaves definite impression). Let cherry gelatin stand at room temperature. Add pineapple to thickened lime gelatin; mix well. Pour into 4- to 5-quart glass serving bowl. Refrigerate 30 minutes or until set but not firm (gelatin should stick to finger when touched and should mound). Beat cream cheese and sugar in medium bowl with wire whisk or electric mixer until well blended. Stir in 2 cups of the whipped topping. Gently spoon over lime gelatin layer in bowl; refrigerate. Meanwhile, refrigerate cherry gelatin 1-1/2 hours or until thickened. Add oranges to cherry gelatin; gently spoon over cream cheese layer. Refrigerate 3 hours or until firm. Serve topped with remaining whipped topping. Store leftover dessert in refrigerator.
