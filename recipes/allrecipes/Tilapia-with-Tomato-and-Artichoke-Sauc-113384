In a large deep frying pan, heat the oil over moderately low heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the wine, tomatoes, rosemary, 3/4 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper. Bring to a simmer and continue simmering, covered, for 10 minutes. Sprinkle the fillets with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Nestle the fish in the sauce, bring back to a simmer, and continue simmering gently, covered, until just done, about 6 minutes for 1/2-inch-thick fillets. Carefully remove the fish from the pan. Stir the artichoke hearts and parsley into the sauce and cook until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Stir in any accumulated juices from the fish. Spoon the sauce over the tilapia.
