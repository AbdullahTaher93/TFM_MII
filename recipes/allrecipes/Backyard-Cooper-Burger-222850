Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Mix ground beef, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, olive oil, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and onion powder together in a large bowl. Divide into 15 portions, roll into balls, and flatten into patties about 1/2-inch thick. Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, 6 to 8 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
