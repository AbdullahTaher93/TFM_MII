Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Gently press each biscuit over the bottom of a lightly greased standard-size muffin tin; carefully pressing and forming the dough over the sides of each cup. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand 2-3 minutes before removing cups from the muffin tin. Meanwhile, in saucepan, combine chili, hot dogs and onion. Heat chili mixture until warmed through. Spoon chili mixture into each cup. If desired, top with shredded cheese, pickle relish, ketchup and mustard. Serve immediately.
