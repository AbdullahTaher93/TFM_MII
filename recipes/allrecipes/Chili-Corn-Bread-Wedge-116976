Place corn bread mix in a large bowl. Combine the egg, milk, chilies and sugar; stir into mix just until moistened. Fold in corn. Pour into a greased 9-in. round baking pan. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Cut into wedges; serve warm.
