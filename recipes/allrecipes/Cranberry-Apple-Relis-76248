Place cranberries, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, water and orange juice concentrate in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil and boil 3-4 minutes or until cranberries start to thicken and water has reduced by about half. Remove from pan and place in medium bowl. Cover and refrigerate 2-3 hours or overnight. Add diced apple and half of the raisins to cranberries. Stir well. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Just before serving, sprinkle remaining raisins over cranberries as a garnish. Serve chilled as an accompaniment to roast meats or poultry.
