Heat a skillet to medium-high, add bacon. Cook and stir to release fat, about 5 minutes. Remove bacon from skillet with a slotted spoon, reserving bacon fat in the skillet. Place onion in hot skillet with remaining bacon fat; cook and stir until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add tomatillos, peas, and bell pepper to the skillet; cook and stir until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Place jalapeno peppers, paprika, saffron, and rice in the skillet; pour in broth. Cover and cook over low heat until rice is tender, 30 to 35 minutes. Add cilantro and reserved bacon, stir to combine.
