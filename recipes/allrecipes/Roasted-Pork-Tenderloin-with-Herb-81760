Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Rinse and pat dry the tenderloins. Finely dice the garlic (smashed roasted garlic can be used for a milder taste). Remove herb leaves from stems, discarding the stems (or save them for making soup stock). Coarsely chop through the herbs to slightly bruise them. You should have about 3 tablespoons of herbs. Add a few drops of the oil to the herbs and garlic to form a paste. Rub the herb paste onto the tenderloins. Place one tenderloin on top of the other in opposite direction so that the large end of one mates with the smaller end of the other, making a uniform thickness. Any herbs that have fallen off should be stuffed between the two tenderloins. Carefully wrap the bacon around the tenderloin. Be careful not to lose any of the herbs. Use kitchen butcher's twine to secure the bacon and tie the two tenderloins together. First tie the twine around the two ends (and in the middle, if the tenderloin is fairly long). Then tie the twine lengthwise wrapping it snuggly around the previously tied twine, as illustrated. In a heavy skillet over medium-high heat, add the remaining olive oil and the butter. Sear the roast on all sides until nicely browned (about 10 minutes). Place the tenderloin in an uncovered roasting pan and place in 400 degrees F oven. Roast for about 20 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 150 degrees F. Remove from oven immediately and let rest for 10 minutes (loosely covered before removing the twine and carving. Strain pan juices and skim off excess fat. Serve juices with the pork roast.
