Bring chicken broth, onion, bell pepper, carrots, celery, jalapeno pepper, rice, parsley, chili powder, garlic, and oregano to a boil in a large pot. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until vegetables and rice are tender, about 25 minutes. Add turkey; simmer until turkey is heated through, about 10 minutes more.
