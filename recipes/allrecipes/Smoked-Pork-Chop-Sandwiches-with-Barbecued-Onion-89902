Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add chops and cook 3 to 6 minutes, turning once. Remove chops from pan and cover to keep warm. Add onions and cook 8 to 10 minutes or until onions are very tender and beginning to brown. Stir in barbecue sauce. Remove from heat. For each sandwich, place two chops on a bun, top with 1 slice cheese and divide onions evenly among sandwiches.
