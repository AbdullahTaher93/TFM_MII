Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a skillet with cooking spray. Cook and stir onion and green pepper over medium heat until onions are translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Combine cooked onion, green pepper, potatoes, broccoli, ham, mushrooms, and celery in the prepared baking dish, stirring to distribute the vegetables and ham. Stir cream of mushroom soup, sour cream, and cream cheese together in the same skillet used for onion and green pepper; mix until combined and smooth. Stir soup mixture into vegetable and ham mixture until combined. Mix in the Monterey Jack cheese. Bake in preheated oven until vegetables are tender and sauce is bubbling, about 35 minutes. Sprinkle with cracker crumbs and return to oven until topping is lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
