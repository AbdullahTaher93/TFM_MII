Arrange twelve 2-ounce plastic cups on a baking sheet that will fit in the refrigerator. Empty cherry-flavored gelatin into a bowl; whisk in water slowly until gelatin is dissolved. Mix in vodka and chocolate liqueur. Pour gelatin mixture into the plastic cups. Refrigerate gelatin mixture until set, at least 4 hours and preferably overnight.
