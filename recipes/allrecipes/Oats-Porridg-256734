Heat a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir oats until toasted and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add water and cook until water is warm, about 5 minutes. Pour in milk and bring liquid to a boil. Add 1 teaspoon almond flour and saffron and boil until porridge thickens, 2 to 4 minutes. Mix cardamom into porridge and remove from heat. Allow to cool to room temperature or slightly warm, about 5 minutes. Garnish with apple, mango, ground almonds, and raisins.
