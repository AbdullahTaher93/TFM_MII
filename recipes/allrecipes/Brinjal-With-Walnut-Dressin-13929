Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place walnuts on a baking sheet. Bake for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the smell of the nuts fills the kitchen. Cut eggplant into 1/2 inch thick rings, and soak in salted water for 15 minutes. Heat oil in a heavy pan or deep fryer to 365 degrees F (170 degrees C). Slide eggplant into hot oil, and deep fry until golden brown. Fry in batches to maintain oil temperature. Remove from oil, drain, and cool. In a medium bowl, mix together yogurt, green chile peppers, 1 tablespoon cilantro, and walnuts. Season to taste with salt. Chill for 30 minutes in the refrigerator. Place eggplant rings in a serving dish, and spoon dressing evenly over top. Garnish with red pepper and remaining 1 tablespoon cilantro.
