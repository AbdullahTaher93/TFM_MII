For pudding, combine first five ingredients in a large bowl. Add bread and raisins; mix well. Turn into a greased 9-in. x 9-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50 minutes. Meanwhile, for sauce, combine yolks, sugar and cornstarch in the top of a double boiler. Gradually add milk, stirring until smooth. Cook over boiling water, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and coats a metal spoon. Remove from the heat and stir in vanilla. Serve pudding and sauce warm or chilled.
