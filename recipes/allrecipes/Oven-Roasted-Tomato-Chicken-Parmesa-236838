Heat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Combine tomatoes, shallots, garlic and 1 tablespoon oil; spread onto parchment-covered rimmed baking sheet. Bake 25 minutes, stirring after 15 minutes. Remove from oven. Increase oven temp to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place flour in pie plate or shallow dish. Beat egg in separate pie plate. Mix panko crumbs, Parmesan and remaining oil in third pie plate. Coat chicken with flour, then dip in egg, then crumb mixture, turning to evenly coat both sides of each breast. Lightly press crumb mixture into chicken to secure; place on wire rack sprayed with cooking spray. Place wire rack on baking sheet. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until chicken is done (170 degrees F / 77 degrees C). Top with tomato mixture and shredded cheese; bake 5 minutes or until heated through. Sprinkle with basil.
