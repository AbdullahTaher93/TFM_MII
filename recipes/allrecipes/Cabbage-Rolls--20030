Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Bring a large pot of water to boil, introduce cabbage leaves and cook 2 minutes. Drain. Combine the rice and water is a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes or until rice is tender. Remove from heat and set aside. In a large bowl, combine beef, bread crumbs, cinnamon, drained and chopped tomatoes, onion and salt; stir until well combined. Spoon equal amounts of beef mixture onto the center of each cabbage leaf. Place a spoonful of rice onto the beef. Roll up leaves, tucking in edges, and seal with a toothpick. Wrap each roll in aluminum foil and place in a shallow baking dish. Bake 40 minutes, or until beef is cooked through. Serve warm.
