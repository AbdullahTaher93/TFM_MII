Beat cream cheese with electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Add 1 cup of the cheddar cheese and onions; mix until blended. Spread 1/4 cup cheese mixture down center of each tortilla; roll up. Place, seam-side down, in 11x7-inch baking dish. Pour salsa over tortillas. Sprinkle with remaining cheddar cheese; cover. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes or until thoroughly heated.
