In a bowl, combine the first six ingredients; cut in the shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in raisins. Add buttermilk; stir just until moistened. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead 4-5 times. Roll to 1/2-in. thickness; cut with a 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter. Place with sides barely touching on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 425 degrees for 12-17 minutes or until golden brown. Combine the icing ingredients; drizzle over biscuits. Serve warm.
