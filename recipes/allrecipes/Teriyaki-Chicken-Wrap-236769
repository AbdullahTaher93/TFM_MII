Combine cabbage and carrots in bowl; set aside. Melt Saute Express(R) squares in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat just until bubbles begin to form. Add chicken. Cook, stirring occasionally, 5 to 7 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink in center. Add cashews and green onions; stir. Continue cooking 1 to 2 minutes or until heated through. Place 1/4 chicken mixture onto each tortilla; top with 1/4 cabbage mixture. Fold 2 opposite sides of tortilla over filling. Starting at open end, roll up tightly to enclose filling.
