In large microwave safe bowl, melt margarine and marshmallows on HIGH for about 2 minutes, stirring after 1 minute. Stir mixture until smooth. Stir in vanilla. Add KELLOGG'S* RICE KRISPIES* cereal, stirring until well coated. Spread cereal mixture into a buttered 36 cm pizza pan. Allow to cool. To make pizza: spread strawberry jam on top of cereal mixture for tomato sauce. Leave edges plain to resemble pizza crust. Spread yellow frosting over jam for cheese. Decorate with fruit roll type snack circles for pepperoni. Top with candy sprinkles for spices. Cut into slices and serve.
