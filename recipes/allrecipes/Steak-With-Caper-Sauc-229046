Rub the steak with salt and pepper and allow to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Pour the olive oil into a large saute pan, add the onions and cook over low heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Transfer the onions to a bowl. Increase the heat to medium-high and add the steak to the pan. Brown the meat on both sides. Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the capers and lemon juice. Cook to taste. Serve with some of the pan juices over the steak.
