Place turkey bacon, onion, garlic, and jalapeno in a saucepan over medium heat, and cook until the onions are transparent. Turn the heat to low and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the onions have caramelized to a deep brown, about 1 hour. Pour in the beans, and mash roughly with a potato masher. Pour in 1 cup of chicken stock and bring to a simmer; simmer about 1 hour, stirring occasionally, adding more chicken stock as needed to achieve desired consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and stir in cilantro just before serving.
