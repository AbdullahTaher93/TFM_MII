Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Wrap eggplant in foil, and bake 35 minutes, or until soft. Remove from heat, and cool slightly. Skin and chop. Heat olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Stir in the tomatoes and garlic, and cook until tender. Mix eggplant into the skillet, and mash together with the tomato and garlic. Stir in the eggs, and cook until no longer runny. Season with salt and pepper.
