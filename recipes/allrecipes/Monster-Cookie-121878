In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugars. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Combine flour, baking powder and baking soda; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Transfer to a larger bowl if necessary. Stir in the remaining ingredients. Drop by heaping tablespoonfuls 3 in. apart onto lightly greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks to cool.
