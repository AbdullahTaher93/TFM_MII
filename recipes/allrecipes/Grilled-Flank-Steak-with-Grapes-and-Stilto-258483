Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Sprinkle steak with salt and pepper. Combine olive oil, vinegar, shallot, and mustard in a blender or small food processor. Sprinkle salt and pepper to taste; puree dressing until smooth. Grill steak until medium-rare, or when internal temperature reaches 130 degrees F (55 degrees C); 6 to 7 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board; let rest for 5 minutes. Place watercress in a large bowl. Pour in dressing to coat; toss to combine. Sprinkle additional salt and pepper. Slice steak thinly across the grain; transfer to a serving platter. Top with watercress, grapes, and Stilton cheese. Serve with any additional dressing.
