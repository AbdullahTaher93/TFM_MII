Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until brown and crumbled, 7 to 10 minutes; drain grease. Add taco seasoning; mix well. Stir in salsa and black beans; remove from heat. Grease a 9-inch pie pan or casserole dish. Mix corn bread mix, milk, egg, honey, and corn oil together in a bowl until batter is smooth; stir in corn. Pour batter into pie pan. Layer ground beef mixture over batter; sprinkle with Cheddar cheese. Top with corn chips. Place in a cold oven; set temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake until sides are golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.
