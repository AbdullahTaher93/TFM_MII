Place tomatoes and their juice in a blender or food processor, and pulse to the consistency of chunky sauce. Add red pepper and salt and pulse to blend. In a skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant and golden. Add tomato sauce, raise heat to medium high, and bring to a vigorous simmer. Cook 5 minutes, adjust seasoning to taste with additional salt or red pepper flakes, and reduce heat to medium low. Crack one egg into a saucer. Using a spoon, make a small well in tomato sauce on one side of pan and gently slide the egg from the saucer into well. Repeat with the remaining egg. Cover pan and cook until egg whites are fully cooked but yolks are still runny, about 5 minutes (or 8 minutes if you prefer your yolks fully cooked). Serve each egg with a generous spoonful of tomato sauce.
