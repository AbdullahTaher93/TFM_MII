Pour the water into a large pot. Separate cabbage into leaves, and place in a steamer basket. Set the basket into the pot with the water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and place the ear of corn over the cabbage. Cover, and steam for 15 to 20 minutes, or until corn is tender. Remove the basket from the pot, and cool slightly. Cut the ear of corn into four pieces and place them in a serving bowl with the cabbage. Combine the butter, vermouth, shallots, garlic, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes; pour over the cabbage, and stir to coat evenly. Separate the salad onto four plates, and garnish each one with a piece of the corn.
