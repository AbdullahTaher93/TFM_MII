In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in sour cream and orange juice. Combine flour and baking powder; stir into egg mixture. Set aside. Combine filling ingredients in a small mixing bowl; beat until blended. Pour half of the batter into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Top with filling and remaining batter. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 40-50 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Meanwhile, for syrup, drain blueberries, reserving juice; set berries aside. In a saucepan, combine cornstarch, corn syrup, lemon juice, salt, cinnamon and reserved blueberry juice until smooth. Bring to a boil over medium heat; boil and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Add blueberries; heat through. Serve warm with the souffle.
