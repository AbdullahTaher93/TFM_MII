To prepare sauce, in a blender container blend all ingredients until smooth. (Sauce may be refrigerated for several days.) Serve at room temperature. Makes 2/3 cup. Rinse lentils several times; place in a bowl. Add enough water to cover by 2-inches. Cover bowl and refrigerate for 10 hours or overnight. Drain well. Process garlic in food processor until minced. Add lentils and 1/3 cup water and process until smooth, scraping bowl as needed. Remove to large bowl. Add half the spinach to same processor bowl. Pulse until chopped. Remove to lentils and repeat with remaining spinach. Add green onions, cilantro, cayenne, flour, salt and baking powder to lentils. Stir well. (Batter may be refrigerated for several hours, if desired.) In a large non-stick skillet over high heat, heat 2 tablespoons oil until hot. To test oil, drop a small amount of batter in, it should bubble immediately. Drop lentil mixture by tablespoons into pan, flattening them slightly. Cook until browned on bottom, about 3 minutes. Turn and brown on other side, about 3 more minutes. Remove from pan to baking sheet. Repeat with remaining oil and lentil mixture. (Pancakes may be refrigerated for 2 days. Do not freeze. Reheat at 425 degrees for 5 minutes or until hot and crisp.) Arrange on spinach leaves and serve with sauce.
