In a bowl, mix the tomato puree, hot sauce, jalapeno pepper, red pepper, and sage. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat, and brown pork chops on both sides. Remove chops from heat and set aside. Place the onion and green bell pepper in the skillet, and saute 2 to 3 minutes. Return pork to skillet, and cover with the tomato puree mixture. Cover skillet, and continue cooking 30 minutes, or to desired doneness.
