Combine potatoes and sauce mix according to package directions. Spoon into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish; set aside. In a large skillet, brown pork chops in oil; arrange over potatoes. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until meat juices run clear and potatoes are tender. Sprinkle cheese and bacon over chops. Bake 2-3 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.
