Cook DeBoles Gluten Free Rice Spaghetti according to package direction; drain, reserving 1 cup of cooking liquid. In a large skillet heat the Spectrum Extra Virgin Olive Oil over a medium high heat, add the garlic and cook until golden, about 3 minutes. Add the calamari and cook an additional 3 minutes or until calamari turns opaque, add the clams and mussels, cook 1 more minute. Add the tomatoes, wine, oregano, pepper flakes, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook stirring occasionally until the sauce thickens slightly, bring to a simmer and cook another 4 minutes until the clams and mussels start to open. Add the shrimp and scallops and cook for 2 more minutes. If the sauce is too thick add a few tablespoons of the water from the cooked pasta. Add the drained DeBoles Gluten Free Rice Spaghetti to the sauce, coating evenly. Arrange pasta on platter and spoon mussels and clams around the rim. Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately.
