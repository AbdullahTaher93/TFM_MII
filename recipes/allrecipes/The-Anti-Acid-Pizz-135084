Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Unroll the dough and press it into a thin crust. Bake the crust at 425 degrees F for 7 minutes or until it begins to brown, then remove from the oven. Mix together the mango chunks, black beans, ginger, and mint. Top the crust with the cheese, then layer it with the bean mixture. Bake at 425 degrees F for 6 minutes or until the cheese is slightly melted.
