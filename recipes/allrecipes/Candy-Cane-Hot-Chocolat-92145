In a 5- to 6-quart heavy pan over medium heat, combine whole milk, low-fat milk, and 1/2 cup sugar. Whisk often, just until milk is steaming, about 10 minutes; do not boil. Reduce heat to low and add chocolate chips. Whisk constantly until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth; keep warm. While milk heats, place the 4 ounces of peppermint candies in a food processor and whirl just until coarsely crushed. (Or place candies in a heavy resealable plastic food bag and pound with a mallet or rolling pin until coarsely crushed.) Set aside. Pour whipping cream into a medium mixing bowl. Beat on high speed with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar; beat until stiff peaks form. With a spatula, gently fold crushed peppermint candy into whipped cream. To serve, divide hot chocolate among mugs. If desired, add peppermint schnapps or extract to each mug to taste. Top each with a dollop of whipped cream and garnish with a candy cane.
