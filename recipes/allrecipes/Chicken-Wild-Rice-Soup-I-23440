Soak rice in 1 cup water for 6 to 8 hours. Drain. Bring 1 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan. Stir in drained rice. Boil until water level dips below rice, 10 minutes. Set aside. In a medium saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat. Cook chicken, onion and celery in butter until browned and slightly crispy, 10 to 15 minutes. Set aside. In a large pot, combine cream of chicken soup, milk, chicken mixture, carrots, almonds, 5 tablespoons butter and parsley. Bring to a boil, stirring, then reduce heat to low and stir in rice. Simmer, uncovered, 15 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding more water or milk to thin if needed. Serve at once.
