In sealable plastic bag, combine olive oil, 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper. Add lamb. Seal bag and turn to coat lamb completely. Refrigerate 1 hour. For relish, in small bowl stir together cucumbers, olives, onion, the remaining 3 tablespoons lemon juice and oregano. Stir to mix. Gently stir in avocado pieces. Cover tightly by placing plastic wrap directly on the surface of the relish. Remove lamb cubes from marinade and thread 4 cubes onto each of 8 skewers. Grill or broil about 4 minutes per side, or until desired degree of doneness. Serve kabobs with relish.
