Coat bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie pan with butter. Set aside. In a large bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar with an electric mixer on high speed until frothy. Beat in sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time; continue to beat until meringue holds stiff, glossy peaks. Spread meringue in pan, pushing it up pan sides to resemble a pie shell and smoothing with a spatula dipped in cold water. Bake in a 275 degree F oven until lightly browned and dry to the touch (about 50 minutes). Transfer pan to a rack; let crust cool. In a food processor or blender, whirl Neufchatel cheese, yogurt, dry milk, honey, and almond extract until smooth. Chop 2 peaches until you have enough to make 1 1/2 cups; reserve remaining chopped peaches for another use. Add chopped peaches to yogurt-cheese mixture and whirl just until blended. Spread mixture in crust, cover airtight, and freeze until firm (about 8 hours). To serve, let pie stand at room temperature for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, peel and slice remaining 2 whole peaches (you should have about 2 cups). Arrange peaches on pie; brush with lemon juice.
