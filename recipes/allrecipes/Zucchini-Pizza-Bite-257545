Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread zucchini slices in 1 layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until zucchini is tender, about 20 minutes. Spoon pizza sauce over each zucchini slice and top with pepperoni and mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle parsley over each. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes more.
