Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add sausage and cook, breaking up clumps with a wooden spoon, until no pink remains, about 3 minutes. Add wine and stir, scraping up any browned bits. Add tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, about 6 minutes. Stir in beans, reduce heat to low and simmer until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, brush remaining 1 teaspoon oil over bottom of large cast-iron skillet (preferably one with ridges) and heat pan over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook polenta slices until crusty, about 3 minutes per side. Divide polenta slices among 4 plates and spoon stew over the top. Serve immediately.
