Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook, stirring often, for 8 minutes, or until no longer pink. Add the garlic, onion, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender but not browned. Add the broth, tomatoes, sherry, basil, chili powder, cumin, bay leaf, and 2 tablespoons of the cilantro. Bring just to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. Discard the bay leaf. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Arrange the tortilla strips on a baking sheet. Mist with olive oil cooking spray. Bake for 10 minutes, or until lightly browned. Stir the lime juice and remaining 2 tablespoons of cilantro into the tomato mixture. Serve the soup with the tortilla strips, cheese, sour cream, and avocado.
