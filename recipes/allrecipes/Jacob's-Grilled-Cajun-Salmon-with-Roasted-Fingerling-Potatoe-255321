Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). (If using a countertop induction oven, use "Auto-Cook" option 2. Choose setting and enter fish weight.) Pour 1 tablespoon olive oil over fingerling potatoes in the bowl. Season with 1 teaspoon garlic powder, salt, and pepper; toss to combine. Rub 1 1/2 teaspoon olive oil over each salmon fillet. Season each with 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning. Arrange salmon, skin-side up, in center of a cast iron skillet or baking dish. (Place salmon on the grill pan if using countertop induction oven.) Bake in the preheated oven until bottom of salmon is lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip salmon and continue cooking until fish flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes. (For countertop induction oven, cook on medium-high grill setting for 1 1/2 minutes with skin side up. Flip and grill salmon until fish flakes easily with a fork, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes more.) Heat cast iron skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir potatoes until browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Combine remaining 1 teaspoon garlic powder, butter, thyme, and sage in a small microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave until butter is melted, 20 to 30 seconds. Mix well. Pour over cooked potatoes. Whisk 1 tablespoon olive oil and lemon juice together in a bowl until dressing is well mixed. Toss microgreens and dressing together in a bowl. Place salmon on serving plates; garnish with micro greens. Serve potatoes alongside.
