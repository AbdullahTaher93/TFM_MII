Place squash in a large bowl and pour in creamy salad dressing. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Remove squash from refrigerator and sprinkle in the parmesan cheese; mix to coat well. Stir in the flour, coating well. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Carefully place squash in oil and fry until lightly browned. Turn once, and add onions. Fry until squash is browned on both sides. Using a slotted spoon, transfer squash and onions to paper towels to drain.
