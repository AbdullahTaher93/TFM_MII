Crush the ramen noodles and set the seasoning packets aside. Heat a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook and stir ramen noodles and sunflower seeds in the hot skillet until toasted and fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes. Combine broccoli coleslaw mix, pineapple, cilantro, and green onions in a large bowl. Whisk sugar, vinegar, olive oil, sesame oil, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and ramen seasoning packets together in a bowl until dressing is smooth. Pour dressing over slaw mixture and toss to coat. Add toasted ramen noodles and sunflower seeds just before serving.
