Saute chicken pieces in olive oil and set aside. In the same pan saute wild rice, green onions and red pepper pieces (about 3 minutes). Add chicken broth, cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the chicken and cooked spaghetti. Cook another 10 to 12 minutes covered (stir at least once to prevent spaghetti from sticking). When ready, chicken should be very tender and have a nice creamy sauce to dish onto the plate.
