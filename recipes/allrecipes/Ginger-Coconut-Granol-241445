Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Combine coconut oil and honey together in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until smooth and melted, about 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Mix oats, coconut, almonds, cranberries, pecans, flax seeds, crystallized ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a separate bowl. Add coconut oil-honey mixture and stir to coat. Spread oat mixture in 1 even layer on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 10 minutes, until granola is dark brown, 20 to 30 minutes. Cool completely.
