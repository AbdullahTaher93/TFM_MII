Cook and stir for about 5 minutes or until the cabbage is pink. Add the wine, salt and pepper. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat for 45 minutes. Mix the brown sugar and cornstarch together. Stir into simmering liquid. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat and add the sausage. Cover and cook for 30 minutes.
