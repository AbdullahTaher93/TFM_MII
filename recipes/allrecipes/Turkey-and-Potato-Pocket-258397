Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets. Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until softened but not fully cooked, about 5 minutes. Drain. Cook and stir turkey in a skillet over medium-high heat until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; stir in potatoes, onion, salsa, Worcestershire sauce, steak sauce, mustard, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Simmer until sauce is reduced and no longer soupy, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in cilantro. Place 1 puff pastry sheet on each baking sheet. Cut pastry into thirds using the fold lines as a guide. Cut each third into 2 rectangles. Drop large spoonfuls of turkey-potato mixture on one side of each pastry rectangle. Fold pastry over filling and pinch edges to seal. Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is puffed up and golden brown, about 1 hour.
