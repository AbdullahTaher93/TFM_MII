Bring water, quinoa, amaranth, wild rice, cumin, and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until grains are tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes. Mix celery, carrot, chickpeas, raisins, olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; add grain mixture and mix well.
