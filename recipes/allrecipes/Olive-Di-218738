Chill a serving bowl in the freezer while you make the salsa. In a mixing bowl, combine the chopped green chiles, onion, green olives, and black olives. Lightly mix in the Cheddar cheese and tomatoes; season to taste with garlic salt and black pepper. If desired, mix in a little bit of the olive brine. Serve in the chilled bowl.
