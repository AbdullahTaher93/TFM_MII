In an ovenproof Dutch oven or greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish, layer the potatoes and carrots. Crumble beef over carrots. Layer with the tomatoes, peas and onions. Dot with butter. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours or until the meat is no longer pink and the vegetables are tender.
