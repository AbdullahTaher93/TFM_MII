Cut zucchini into spiral shapes with a spiralizer. Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat. Mix in chile pepper and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Add turkey; cook, flipping once, until turkey is pale, 4 to 5 minutes. Mix green beans, bell pepper, and soy sauce into the skillet. Cook until turkey is longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in zucchini; cook, stirring constantly, until just softened, 2 to 3 minutes.
