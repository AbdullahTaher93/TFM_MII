Preheat oven to 350 degrees F with rack in lower third. Grease sides and line bottom of 9-inch spring form pan with parchment. In a food processor, pulse chocolate, nuts, salt, orange zest and 2 Tbsp of sugar to consistency of crumbs. Beat egg whites and cream of tartar until it holds a soft shape. Gradually beat in 1/2 cup sugar until eggs whites are glossy and stiff but not dry. Transfer to larger bowl. Fold in chocolate mixture. Scrape batter into prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake until torte is puffed and golden and springs back when gently pressed, 25-30 minutes: toothpick inserted in center will emerge moist and stained melted chocolate, but not thickly coated with batter. Cool on rack. Remove pan sides. Invert and remove pan liner. Serve right side up garnished with whipped cream and berries.
