Combine pomegranate and lemon juice with sugar in a large, stainless steel saucepan. Bring to boil over high heat, and at once stir in liquid pectin. Bring to a full rolling boil, and boil exactly 1/2 minute. Remove from heat, and skim off foam. Ladle into hot, sterilized jars to within about 1/4 inch of the top. Seal, and process in a boiling water canner for 5 minutes.
