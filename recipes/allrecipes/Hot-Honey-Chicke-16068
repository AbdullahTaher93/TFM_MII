Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. In a small bowl, combine the honey, hot pepper sauce and ground black pepper and mix well. Cover each chicken breast with the sauce and put on the grill, basting occasionally. Grill for 10 to 15 minutes per side, or until internal temperature reaches 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Chicken will have a nice, brown color from the sauce.
