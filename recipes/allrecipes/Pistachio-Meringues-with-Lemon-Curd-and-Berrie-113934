MAKE THE MERINGUES: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and lightly spray them with vegetable oil. In a large bowl, using a handheld electric mixer, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Beat in the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until firm peaks form. Add the vanilla and continue to beat at high speed until the meringue is thick and glossy, about 2 minutes longer. Spoon 8 round mounds of the meringue onto each of the prepared baking sheets. Using the back of a spoon, make small decorative peaks on each meringue. Sprinkle the chopped pistachios on the meringues. Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through, until the meringues are lightly browned at the tips. Turn the oven off and leave the door slightly open. Let the meringues cool in the oven for 1 hour. MEANWHILE, MAKE THE LEMON CREAM: Fill a saucepan with 2 inches of water and bring to a simmer. In a medium stainless steel bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar, lemon juice and zest and ginger. Set the bowl over--not in--the simmering water and whisk constantly, until the curd is thick, about 20 minutes. Remove the bowl from the heat and whisk in the butter, a few pieces at a time, until fully incorporated. Press the lemon curd through a fine strainer set over a medium bowl. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the lemon curd and refrigerate it until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour. In a medium bowl, beat the heavy cream until stiff. Whisk one third of the whipped cream into the lemon curd, then fold in the remaining whipped cream. Refrigerate until ready to use. Set the meringues on plates. Spoon about 1/3 cup of the lemon curd on each meringue, top with the sliced strawberries and serve.
