Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Rub a 10-inch iron skillet with oil. In a large bowl, combine the unbleached flour, cornmeal, whole wheat flour, baking powder, and salt and blend well. In another bowl, combine the milk, eggs, oil, and honey and whisk them for 1 minute. Stir in the sage and onions. Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients along with the cheese and stir until just mixed. Pour the batter into the oiled skillet and place in the preheated oven. Bake for 30 minutes or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the corn bread cool in the skillet for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving.
