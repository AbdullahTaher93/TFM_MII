Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Place celery, onion, and green pepper into the skillet, and saute until tender. Press biscuits into the prepared baking dish to form a crust. Layer with the tomatoes. Top with the sauteed vegetables. In a medium bowl, mix Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream, and salt-free seasoning blend. Spread evenly over the vegetables. Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly and lightly browned. Cool 15 to 20 minutes before serving.
