Bring 3/4 cup water, sugar, and cinnamon to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat and simmer until sugar is dissolved, 3 to 4 minutes. Add cherries; bring back to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until cherries soften, about 5 minutes. Mix 2 tablespoons water and cornstarch together in a small bowl; pour over the cherry mixture in the saucepan. Stir until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Let cool, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a container and refrigerate.
