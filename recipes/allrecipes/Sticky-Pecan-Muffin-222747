Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups. Combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl. Mix the eggs, milk, oil, applesauce, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Stir the egg mixture into the flour mixture until the batter is just moistened. Combine the melted margarine or butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and pecans; divide it into each prepared muffin cup. Portion about 1/4 cup muffin batter into each muffin cup, on top of the pecan mixture. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Invert pan onto a piece of aluminum foil; let stand 2 minutes then remove pan.
