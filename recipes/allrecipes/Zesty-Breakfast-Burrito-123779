Combine pork, vinegar, chili powder, oregano, salt and garlic; mix well. Cover and chill overnight. In a skillet over medium heat, cook pork mixture until no longer pink. Drain; keep warm. Beat eggs and milk. In another skillet, heat oil. Cook eggs over low heat until set, stirring occasionally. Spoon about 1/4 cup pork mixture and 1/4 cup eggs down the center of each tortilla. Top with taco sauce and roll up.
