A Safeway SELECT Spiral Sliced Honey Glazed Ham can be served at any temperature, including cold or room temperature. But if you want the ham to taste freshly baked, heat it in a 325 degree oven until a thermometer inserted in the thickest part reaches 140 degree (about 2 1/2 hours for an 8-pound ham; about 31/2 hours for a 16-pound ham). Garnish with shavings of orange peel. Or offer Safeway SELECT Mustards alongside. Flavor Dijon Mustard with a few drops of lemon juice and fresh herbs, such as dill, rosemary, or tarragon; then garnish the ham platter with sprigs of the same herb. To Honey Spice Mustard, add chopped dried cranberries and grated orange peel; orange slices make an attractive garnish. Another tempting accent for hot or cold ham is a horseradish sauce made by folding prepared horseradish and snipped fresh chives or thinly sliced green onions into unsweetened whipped cream, sour cream, or plain yogurt.
