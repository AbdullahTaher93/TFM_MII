Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add onion, garlic, and jalapeno; cook and stir until onion turns translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir flour into onion mixture until vegetables are evenly coated. Pour in milk; cook and stir until mixture thickens slightly, 3 to 4 minutes. Add processed cheese food, stirring constantly, until melted and smooth, about 15 minutes more. Stir in pickled jalapeno juice.
