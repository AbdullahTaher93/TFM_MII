To a 10- to 12-inch nonstick pan over medium heat, add oil; when oil is hot, add red bell pepper and chili flakes. Stirring, cook just until soft, about 3 minutes. Add rice, broccoli, and carrot. Stir to mix ingredients, then cover and cook until broccoli is just tender to bite, about 4 minutes. Stir in ginger sauce and green onion. Cook until hot, about 1 minute more. Remove pan from heat and stir in cilantro. In a second 10- to 12-inch pan over high heat, heat one tortilla at a time. When both sides of the tortilla are blistered and golden, sprinkle one fourth of the shredded cheese, if using, on tortilla. Transfer tortilla to dinner plate and top with one fourth of the broccoli-rice mixture and one fourth of the chopped peanuts; fold tortilla in half (or fold bottom, then sides of tortilla over filling to enclose like a traditional burrito) and keep warm while cooking remaining tortillas. Serve.
