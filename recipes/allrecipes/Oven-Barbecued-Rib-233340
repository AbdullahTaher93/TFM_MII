Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange spareribs in a large, lidded roasting pan. Mix onion, ketchup, water, celery, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, Dijon mustard, and salt in a bowl; pour mixture over spareribs. Cover. Bake in the preheated oven for 90 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until pork is tender and sauce is thickened, about 30 minutes more.
