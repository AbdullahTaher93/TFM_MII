In a medium sized stock pot place undrained tomatoes, celery, oregano, basil, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Place frozen fish filets in pot. Reduce heat and cook for 10 to 15 minutes. Cook until mixture is heated through and fish is opaque and flaky. Thin with a little water if desired.
