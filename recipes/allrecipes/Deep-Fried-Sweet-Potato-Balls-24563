In a mixing bowl, knead together potatoes, 2 teaspoons cornstarch, salt and water to form a stiff dough. In a separate bowl, combine coconut and brown sugar. Form potato dough into small balls; make a well in the center and fill with coconut mixture; close up hole and reshape balls. Roll in sesame seeds, then in remaining cornstarch. Heat oil in deep-fryer or deep, heavy-bottomed pan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry balls in oil until golden. Drain on paper towels. Serve.
