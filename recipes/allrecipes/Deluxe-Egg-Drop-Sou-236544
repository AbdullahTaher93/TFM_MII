Heat 3 1/4 cups chicken broth in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add carrots, ginger, and white parts of green onion; bring soup to a boil. Whisk remaining 3/4 cup broth and cornstarch together in a bowl until dissolved. Stir cabbage and green parts of green onion into the soup. Drop beaten egg, a spoonful at a time, into soup, stirring after each addition to prevent clumping. Stir cornstarch mixture into soup and season with salt and pepper. Stir soup until cornstarch thickens the soup, about 2 minutes.
