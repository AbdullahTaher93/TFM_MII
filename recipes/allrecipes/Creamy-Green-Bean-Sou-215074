Place the water, ham, green beans, potatoes, and onions into a large saucepan or soup pot, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until the ham and vegetables are very tender, about 45 minutes. Skim off any excess fat. Pour in the cream, season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve.
