Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Saute onion and garlic in oil until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and smoked sausage and cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes. Add the diced tomatoes, broth, tortellini, salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer gently for 5 minutes, then stir in spinach and cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes. Serve with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese, if desired.
