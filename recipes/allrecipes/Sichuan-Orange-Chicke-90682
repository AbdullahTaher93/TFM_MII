To make blood orange sauce, in a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over high heat, mix orange juice, sugar, garlic, ginger, and chili flakes to taste. Boil until reduced to 1 cup, about 10 minutes; stir often. Meanwhile, rinse chicken, pat dry, and cut into 1/2-inch chunks. In a 12-inch nonstick frying pan or a 5- to 6-quart nonstick pan over high heat, stir chicken in oil until lightly browned and no longer pink in center of thickest part (cut to test), 4 to 5 minutes. Add blood orange sauce and stir until boiling, 1 to 2 minutes. Spoon chicken and sauce onto rice. Sprinkle with green onions and season to taste with soy sauce.
