Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk eggs and salt together in a large bowl with a fork. Stir in mozzarella cheese. Sift tapioca flour and baking powder together over cheese mixture; mix well until cheese softens into the eggs and flour. Add enough milk to make a moist, slightly crumbly dough. Dust your work surface with tapioca flour. Scrape dough out of the bowl and knead gently until it begins to feel smooth, about 3 minutes. Shape dough into a log; divide into 4 equal pieces. Carefully roll the pieces of dough under your cupped fingers until round. Transfer to the lined baking sheet. Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden, 15 to 20 minutes.
