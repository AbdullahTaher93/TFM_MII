Heat oil in a heavy large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook until brown, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Add onion, celery and garlic and saute until onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes with juices and all remaining ingredients except the parsley. Cover and simmer until meat is tender, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Sprinkle soup with parsley and serve.
