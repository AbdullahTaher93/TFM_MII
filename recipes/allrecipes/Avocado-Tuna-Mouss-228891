Stir together the fat-free sour cream, creamy salad dressing, pickle relish, yellow mustard, and minced onion flakes in a bowl until well mixed. Add the drained tuna and mix well. Add the avocado in small amounts and stir gently, just enough to distribute the avocado without mashing. Chill before serving.
