Mix all-purpose flour, cricket flour, brown sugar, nutritional yeast, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir water and flaxseed meal together in another bowl. Let stand until thickened, about 5 minutes. Mix in soy milk, almond milk, coconut butter, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Pour over flour mixture; blend with an electric mixer until batter is smooth. Let batter rest until thickened, at least 1 hour. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour 1/4 cup batter into the skillet; swirl skillet to spread batter out in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the crepe looks dry and the bottom is light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge to loosen crepe; flip crepe and cook until the other side is light brown, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter.
