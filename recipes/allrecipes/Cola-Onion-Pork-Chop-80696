Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the pork chops in a shallow glass baking dish. Pour the cola over them, and sprinkle with onion soup mix. Bake uncovered for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Turn over, and continue baking for another 30 minutes, until sauce is thickened and chops are fork tender.
