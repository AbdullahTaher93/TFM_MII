In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in extract. Sift together flour, cardamom and soda; add alternately with sour cream to creamed mixture. Fold in almonds. Divide dough into six parts; shape into rolls (like refrigerated cookie dough). Place three each on two greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for about 30 minutes or until light brown. Remove rolls to cutting board. Using a sharp knife, slice rolls diagonally 1/2 in. thick. Place cookies on sheets; return to oven and bake until light brown. Cool; store in tightly covered containers.
