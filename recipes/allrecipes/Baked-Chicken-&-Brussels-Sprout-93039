Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a skillet, heat oil and brown chicken. Lay chicken in a shallow baking dish and surround with Brussels sprouts. Sprinkle onions and rosemary over chicken. Add broth, salt and pepper. Bake, covered, for 20 minutes. Uncover, increase oven temperature to 400 degrees, and bake 30 to 40 minutes, until sprouts are cooked firm, not mushy. Serve
