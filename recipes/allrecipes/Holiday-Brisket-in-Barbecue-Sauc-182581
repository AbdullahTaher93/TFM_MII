Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place meat in roasting pan. Mix preserves, steak sauce, ketchup and sugar in large bowl until well blended. Add onions; toss to coat. Pour evenly over meat. Cover with foil; pierce foil in several places with sharp knife or fork to vent. Bake 3-1/2 to 4 hours or until meat is tender. Let stand, covered, 10 min. before slicing. Serve with the meat drippings.
