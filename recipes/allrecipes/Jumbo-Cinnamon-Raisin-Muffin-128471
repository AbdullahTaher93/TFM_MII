Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 C). Coat a 6-cup jumbo muffin pan with nonstick spray. In a large bowl, combine flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, and nutmeg. Stir in raisins. In a small bowl, beat egg whites slightly. Add yogurt, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Mix well. Stir egg white mixture into flour mixture just until flour is moistened. Spoon batter into the prepared pan until muffin cups are about two-thirds full. Bake 35 minutes, or until a wooden stick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Remove muffins from the pan immediately. Cool on racks.
