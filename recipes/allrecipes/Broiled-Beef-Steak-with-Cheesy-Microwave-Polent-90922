Preheat oven broiler. Combine Italian seasoning, garlic, salt and pepper; press onto beef steak. Place steak on rack in broiler pan so surface of beef is 3 to 4 inches from heat. Broil 16 to 21 minutes for medium rare to medium doneness, turning once. While steak broils, combine 1 2/3 cups water, cornmeal and salt in 1-quart microwave-safe bowl. Cover; microwave on full power (100%) 6 to 8 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons each mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle with remaining mozzarella cheese. Microwave, uncovered, on medium power (50%) 2 to 3 minutes or until cheese is melted. Cover; let stand 5 minutes. Carve steak. Serve with polenta and spaghetti sauce.
