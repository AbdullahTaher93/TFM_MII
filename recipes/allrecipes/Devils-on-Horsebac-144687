Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place 24 toothpicks in a small bowl filled with water; let soak 15 minutes. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and fit with a wire rack; set aside. Halve dates lengthwise being careful not to cut all the way through. Place a small amount of cheese in the center of each date. Wrap a piece of bacon around each date. Secure bacon with a toothpick. Place dates on prepared baking sheet. Bake until bacon is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes.
