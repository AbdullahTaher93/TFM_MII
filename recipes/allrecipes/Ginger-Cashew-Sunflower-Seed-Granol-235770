Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Stir honey, coconut oil, and maple syrup together in a saucepan over low heat until completely melted and combined, 3 to 5 minutes. Combine cereal, oats, sunflower kernels, cashews, ginger, cardamom, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Pour honey mixture over cereal mixture and stir until completely coated. Pour cereal mixture in a layer on prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 40 minutes.
