In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and milk until blended. Mix in the sugar and peanut butter until smooth, then fold in the whipped topping. Spoon mixture into all 3 graham cracker crusts. Drizzle each with chocolate syrup and a sprinkle of peanuts. Cover and freeze for about 2 to 3 hours. Let stand 30 minutes at room temperature before serving.
