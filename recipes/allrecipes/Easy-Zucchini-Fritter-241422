Toss zucchini and salt together in a large colander and place in sink to drain for 10 minutes. Put zucchini in the middle of a piece of cheesecloth; wrap cheesecloth around zucchini and squeeze to drain as much moisture from zucchini as possible. Mix flour, Parmesan cheese, egg, garlic, kosher salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Stir in zucchini. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Scoop batter by the tablespoon into the hot skillet and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.
