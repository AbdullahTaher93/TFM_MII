Heat olive oil in a large stockpot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, celery, and garlic until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add green bell pepper and jalapeno peppers to onion mixture; cook and stir until peppers are softened, about 5 minutes. Pour tequila into vegetable mixture and simmer until slightly reduced, 3 to 4 minutes. Add fired-roasted tomatoes, vegetable stock, crushed tomatoes, lime juice, salt, and pepper to vegetable-tequila mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until flavors have blended, about 20 minutes. Stir cilantro into soup just before serving.
