Using a biscuit cutter, cut 2-1/2-in. circles from bread slices. Spread butter over one side of each circle. Press circles, buttered side down, into ungreased miniature muffin cups. In a bowl, combine the remaining ingredients; mix well. Spoon into bread cups. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35 minutes or until golden brown.
