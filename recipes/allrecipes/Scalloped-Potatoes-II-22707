Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium bowl whisk together mushroom soup, celery soup, onion soup mix, garlic powder and milk. In a large roasting pan layer potatoes and soup mix, ending with soup mix. Season with salt and pepper; sprinkle cheese over the top. Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 80 minutes, or until potatoes are cooked. Let stand 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
