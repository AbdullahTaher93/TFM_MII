Bring water to a boil in a saucepan. Stir instant white rice into boiling water. Cook rice until softened, about 5 minutes. Heat oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken in hot oil until cooked through and no longer pink in the middle, 5 to 7 minutes. Fry bacon in a large wok or skillet over medium-high until hot and cooked through but not yet crunchy, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove bacon to a plate lined with paper towels. Drain fat from wok, reserving 1 to 2 tablespoons of drippings in the bottom of the wok. Cut bacon into small pieces. Return wok to medium-high heat and heat reserved bacon drippings. Combine rice, chicken, bacon, green onions, and soy sauce in the wok; cook and stir until evenly mixed and hot, 2 to 3 minutes.
