In a greased 15-in. x 10-in x 1-in. baking pan, arrange eight slices of bread. Place a slice of cheese on each; top with chicken and another slice of bread. Beat eggs, milk and pepper; pour over the sandwiches. Combine crumbs and butter; sprinkle over sandwiches. Bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour and 20 minutes or until golden brown. Meanwhile, for sauce, saute mushrooms in butter. Add remaining ingredients; mix well. Heat through but do not boil. Spoon over sandwiches.
