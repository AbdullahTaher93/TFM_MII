Heat a small skillet over medium heat. Cook the sausages in the hot skillet, turning occasionally, until no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Put Cheddar cheese atop 1 toasted waffle. Arrange apple slices over the cheese. Sprinkle cinnamon-sugar over the apple slices. Put sausage links atop the apples and finish sandwich with remaining waffle. Cut sandwich into halves.
