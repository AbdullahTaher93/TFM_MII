Make crepes and cut into noodles: Blend milk, eggs, flours, salt, and pepper in a blender, scraping down sides occasionally, until smooth, then add parsley and 3 tablespoons butter and blend just until incorporated. Lightly brush a 10-inch nonstick skillet with some remaining butter and heat over moderate heat until hot. Fill a 1/4-cup measure three-fourths full of batter, then pour into skillet, tilting and rotating skillet to coat bottom. (If batter sets before skillet is coated, reduce heat slightly for next crepe.) Cook just until underside is set and lightly browned, 10 to 15 seconds, then loosen crepe with a heatproof plastic spatula and flip over with your fingers. Cook crepe until other side is just cooked through, about 15 seconds more. Transfer crepe to a large sheet of wax paper. Make more crepes in same manner, lightly brushing skillet with more butter as needed between batches and stacking crepes in 2 piles. Transfer crepe stacks to a cutting board and cut each stack into 1/2-inch-wide strips, then separate into noodles. Make chive butter and assemble dish: Put oven rack in upper third of oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Generously butter a baking pan. Mash together butter and chives with a fork in a small bowl, then add salt and pepper to taste. Spread noodles in baking pan and reheat in oven until hot, about 15 minutes. Melt chive butter (along with any remaining melted butter from crepes) in a small saucepan, then drizzle over noodles. Gently transfer noodles to a warmed serving bowl (noodles are delicate).
