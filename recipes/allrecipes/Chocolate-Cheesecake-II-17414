In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar until soft. Stir in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well between additions. Stir in the chocolate mixture until fully incorporated. Pour into the prepared crust. Bake for 55 to 60 minutes in the preheated oven. Let cake cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 8 hours before serving.
