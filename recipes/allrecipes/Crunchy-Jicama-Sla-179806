Peel jicama; cut into 3 or 4 pieces, then shred (preferably using food processor). Place shreds in a colander and rinse with cold water until water runs clear. Drain well. In a large bowl, combine jicama, sour cream, green onions, parsley, vinegar, and horseradish; mix lightly until well combined. Season to taste with salt.
