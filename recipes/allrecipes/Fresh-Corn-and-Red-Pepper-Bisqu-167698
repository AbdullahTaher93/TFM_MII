Heat oil in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Add corn and garlic; cook, stirring often, until the corn is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add broth and simmer until the corn is tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Stir in salt and pepper. Using a slotted spoon, transfer 1 1/2 cups of the corn mixture to a blender or food processor. Add sour cream and 1/2 cup cooking liquid and process until the mixture is smooth, about 2 minutes. Return the puree to the pan. Whisk in cornmeal; bring the soup to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until it thickens. Add bell pepper, scallion, parsley (or cilantro) and hot sauce; heat through. Serve with lime wedges.
