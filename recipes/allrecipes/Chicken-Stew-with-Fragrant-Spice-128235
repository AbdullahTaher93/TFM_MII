In a pot, combine curry and nutmeg. Warm spices over medium heat, stirring constantly, until they become fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape the spices into a bowl. Add chicken and toss until well coated. Let stand for 15 minutes. Coat the pot with nonstick spray, and stir-fry onions, garlic, gingerroot and lemon peel over medium-high heat until onions are lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add mushrooms and peppers; stir-fry for 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Recoat pot with nonstick spray. Stir-fry chicken and spice mixture until chicken is browned, about 5 minutes. Add juice, vinegar and sugar. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Stir in jicama and cooked vegetables. In a bowl, whisk water and cornstarch. Add to stew. Cook, stirring constantly, until stew thickens and boils. Cook for 1 minute.
