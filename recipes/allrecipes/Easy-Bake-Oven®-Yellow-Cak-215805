Run a thin spatula along the inner edge of the pan to loosen the cake. Turn the pan upside down and tap gently until the cake falls out. MIX THE FROSTING. Pour one vanilla frosting mix and 1 teaspoon of water into a bowl. If the frosting is too thick, add an extra drop or two of water. PREPARE AN ICING BAG. Spoon 1 1/2 teaspoons of the pink frosting from the devil's food cake recipe into a small plastic bag. Make a small snip in corner of the bag. FROST THE CAKE. Spread the vanilla frosting over the top and sides of the cake. Squeeze the pink frosting from the bag to make decorative stripes. FINISHING TOUCHES.
