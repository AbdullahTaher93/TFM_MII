In a mixing bowl, combine the first five ingredients; beat for 5 minutes. Stir in chocolate chips and half of the grated chocolate. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Sprinkle with remaining grated chocolate while slightly warm. Cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
