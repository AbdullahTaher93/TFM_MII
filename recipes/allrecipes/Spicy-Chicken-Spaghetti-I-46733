Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place spaghetti in the pot, cook 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain. In a separate pot, mix the Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, tomato sauce, green bell pepper, onion, brown sugar, and chili powder. Bring to a boil. Mix in the chicken, reduce heat to low, and simmer 10 minutes, or until chicken is heated through. Mix in the cooked spaghetti, and serve warm.
