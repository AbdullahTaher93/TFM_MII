Chop the scallions and keep the white and green parts separate. Set aside the green portion for the garnish. Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the shredded coconut and toast until a light golden brown. Stir frequently and don't get too far from it because once it starts to brown it can burn quickly. Remove to a saucer, bowl or paper towel. Toss with the Splenda (optional). In the same skillet over medium heat, add the coconut oil, coriander and cumin. Blend. Add the chicken pieces and increase the heat one notch to medium-high. Cook on each side about 2 or 3 minutes. Add the coconut milk, lemon pepper, salt and the white parts of the scallions. Stir and spoon the sauce over the chicken pieces until it comes to a boil. Then reduce heat to a simmer, lightly cover with a piece of foil and cook for 40 minutes, turning over the chicken after 20 minutes. (Reduce the time in half if you are using boneless chicken). Remove chicken to a platter and cover with the aluminum foil. Increase heat to medium-high and boil to reduce the sauce by about one half, stirring occasionally (10 to 20 minutes depending how humid the day is and how hot your stove is). Taste test and add more salt if needed. Place the chicken back into the skillet just to warm it up again. Garnish with the green portion of the scallions and the toasted coconut.
