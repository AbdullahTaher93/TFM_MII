In a small bowl combine the Sriracha, honey, and lime juice; set aside. In a large pot bring 4 to 6 quarts of water to a rolling boil; add salt to taste and the Spaghetti; stir gently. Cook pasta according to package directions; remove from heat and drain well. Meanwhile, in a large skillet heat the oil over medium heat; add the mushrooms, carrots, bell pepper, and sugar snap peas. Cook, stirring frequently, for 5 to 7 minutes or until tender; add the Spicy Marinara and stir; add the pasta and toss to combine. Serve in bowls and top with a drizzle of the Sriracha-honey mixture, green onions, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds, if desired.
