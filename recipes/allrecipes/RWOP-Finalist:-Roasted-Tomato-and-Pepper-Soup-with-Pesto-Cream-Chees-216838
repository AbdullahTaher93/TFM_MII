Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Core and cut tomatoes in half and place in a large oven roasting pan. Add chopped peppers, sliced onions, chopped garlic and uncooked bacon. Add 1 cup fresh basil leaves to the roasting pan mixture. Make sure the stems are removed and the leaves have been washed and patted dry. Salt and pepper all items in the roasting pan and toss. Pour the olive oil over the items in the roasting pan and toss lightly. Place the roasting pan full of veggies, bacon and herbs into an oven on the middle upper rack and bake for approximately 30 minutes until everything is soft and juicy. Cool 10 to 15 minutes. Blend veggies in batches in a blender on the liquefy setting. Pour the contents into a large stock pot or soup pan and heat over medium heat. Once everything is blended and in the pot, add 1/4 cup butter and the 8 oz. of PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese and stir until melted and incorporated. Salt and pepper to taste. Adjust the flavoring at this point according to taste, perhaps adding some Italian seasonings or red pepper flakes. For the pesto cream sauce garnish, pick up a jar of pesto at the local grocer. Mix 1/4 cup pesto with 4 oz. of cream cheese. When serving the soup, garnish with croutons and a dollop of the pesto cream cheese topping. Serve immediately and enjoy!
