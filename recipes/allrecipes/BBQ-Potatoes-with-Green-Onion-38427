Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Microwave potatoes on High 5 to 8 minutes, until tender but still firm. Cool slightly, and cube. Place cubed potatoes on a large piece of foil. Top with green onions. Dot with butter, and season with salt and pepper. Tightly seal foil around the potatoes. Cook on the prepared grill 20 to 30 minutes, until tender.
