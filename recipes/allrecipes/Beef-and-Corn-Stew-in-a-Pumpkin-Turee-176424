Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place rack in lower third of oven. Prepare pumpkin tureen: With a sharp knife, cut a hole in the top of the pumpkin, about 2 inches from stem. Set lid aside. With a metal spoon, scrape out seeds and strings. Place pumpkin and lid next to each other in a large rimmed baking pan and bake until pumpkin is tender when pierced inside, about 1 hour. Remove pan, but maintain oven temperature. While pumpkin bakes, season beef with salt and pepper. In a 4- to 5-quart pot over medium-high heat, brown meat in oil, about 4 minutes. (Work in 2 batches if necessary.) Use a slotted spoon to remove beef and set on plate. Add onion, garlic, bell pepper, cumin, chili powder, and coriander to pot, scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon. Stir often over medium heat until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Return beef and any juices to pot. Add tomatoes and their juices and beef broth, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes. Add sweet potato and simmer over medium heat until meat and sweet potato are tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in corn; cook 5 minutes more. Ladle stew into baked pumpkin; top with lid. (Keep any excess stew warm in pot.) Return pumpkin to oven for 30 minutes to blend flavors. With a pair of wide spatulas, carefully transfer the pumpkin to a platter.
