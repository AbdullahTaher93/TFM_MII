Remove wrappers from chocolates; set aside. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Line muffin cups (21/2 inches in diameter) with paper liners. Combine butter, sugar, eggs and vanilla in a large bowl. Using mixer, beat on high for 3 minutes. Stir together flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt and baking powder; add alternately with water to butter mixture, beating just until blended. Fill prepared muffin cups 1/2 full with batter. Place chocolate piece in center of each. Bake for 20 minutes or until top springs back when touched lightly in the center. Remove from cups to wire rack. Cool completely. Tint frosting with red and yellow food color to make orange and frost cupcakes. Cut candies and decorate to make monster faces.
