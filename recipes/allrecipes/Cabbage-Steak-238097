Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut the bottom off of the cabbage and set it so that the flat end is on the cutting board; cut into 1-inch thick slices. Arrange slices in a single layer in a large casserole dish. Drizzle olive oil over the cabbage slices and top with garlic. Season cabbage with salt and pepper. Cover the dish with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven until the cabbage core is easily pierced with a fork, about 45 minutes.
