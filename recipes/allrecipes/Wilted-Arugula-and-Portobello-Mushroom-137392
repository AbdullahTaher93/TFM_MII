Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in red pepper flakes and chopped mushrooms and cook until mushrooms are coated with oil and begin to soften. Pour in sherry and chicken broth. Simmer until liquid is reduced by half. Add arugula and cook until wilted, about one minute. Season with black pepper. Serve immediately.
