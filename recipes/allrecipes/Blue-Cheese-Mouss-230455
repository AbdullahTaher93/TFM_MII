Puree blue cheese and cream cheese together in a food processor until completely smooth; transfer to a bowl and season with kosher salt and black pepper. Beat heavy cream in a glass or metal bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the whipped cream will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. Fold whipped cream into the blue cheese mixture, stirring until the mixture is creamy with no lumps. Transfer mixture to a pastry bag with a round tip for piping.
