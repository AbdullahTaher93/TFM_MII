Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry. Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and pound each to 1/8-inch thickness. Coat chicken in flour. In large skillet, cook chicken in hot oil over medium-high heat 2 to 3 minutes per side or until cooked through. Remove chicken from pan; cover and keep warm. For sauce, add broth, cooking wine, and lemon juice to skillet; bring to a boil. Simmer, uncovered, for 2 minutes. Remove sauce from heat and stir in capers and parsley. Divide pasta among 4 plates. Top each with a chicken breast and spoon sauce over all.
