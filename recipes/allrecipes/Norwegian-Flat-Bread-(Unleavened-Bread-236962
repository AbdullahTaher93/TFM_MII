Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir flour and salt together in a bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture with a fork or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir milk into mixture and knead with hands to form dough. Turn dough out onto a lightly-floured work surface and roll to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut dough into sandwich-size pieces and poke each piece several times with a fork. Transfer slices to a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until just golden brown, about 30 minutes.
