Drain pears, reserving juice in a 1-cup measuring cup. Add enough water to measure 3/4 cup. Set pears aside. In a small bowl, combine the pear juice mixture, apple juice, brown sugar, soy sauce and garlic powder; set aside. In a large skillet, saute chicken in oil for 4-6 minutes or until no longer pink. Add parsley and pear juice mixture. Cover and simmer for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally. In a small bowl, combine cornstarch and cold water until smooth; pour into skillet. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1 minute or until thickened. Stir in walnuts and pears. Serve over rice if desired.
