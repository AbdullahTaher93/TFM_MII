Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add linguini pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. In a small bowl, combine nutmeg, cayenne pepper, onion powder and pepper; set aside. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter and add 1/2 of the spice mixture, milk and cream. Heat until sauce thickens; set aside. In a large skillet over medium heat, warm olive oil and add garlic, chicken, wine and remaining spice; cook until chicken is no longer pink. Remove chicken from pan and cook shrimp. Deglaze pan by adding some wine and heating it for 2 to 3 minutes; add the cream sauce and reheat if needed. Pour sauce over hot linguine and add chicken mixture and shrimp.
