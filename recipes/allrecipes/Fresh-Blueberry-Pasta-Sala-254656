Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain. Pour olive oil in to a bowl; add pasta. Toss until combined. Add broccoli, yellow pepper, lime juice, and thyme; toss until combined. Refrigerate until serving. Top with blueberries and feta cheese; season with salt.
