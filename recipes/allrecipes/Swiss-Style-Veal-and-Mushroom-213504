Stir the stock, soup, thyme, veal, mushrooms and green onions in a 3 1/2-quart slow cooker. Cover and cook on LOW for 7 to 8 hours or until the veal is fork-tender. Stir the flour and water in a small bowl until the mixture is smooth. Stir the flour mixture in the cooker. Turn the heat to HIGH. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the mixture boils and thickens. Stir in the cheese. Serve over the noodles. Season with the black pepper.
