Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place a large sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil in a shallow roasting pan. Place rump roast in the roasting pan. Pour mushroom soup over the roast and sprinkle with onion soup mix. Whisk wine and flour together in a small bowl; pour over the roast and top with mushrooms. Fold the foil over the roast and crimp edges together to seal. Bake in preheated oven for 4 1/2 hours. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
