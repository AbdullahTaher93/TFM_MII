Combine salsa, oil and garlic; brush over both sides of chicken. Cook chicken on preheated medium-hot grill 5 minutes per side or until chicken is no longer pink in center. Lay cheese slices over chicken and place rolls, cut-side down, on grill during the last 2 minutes of grilling. Arrange lettuce and tomato on each roll bottom. Top with chicken and cover with top half of roll. Serve with additional salsa, if desired.
