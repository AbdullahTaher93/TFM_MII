In a large resealable plastic bag or shallow glass container, combine the soy sauce, oil and juice; mix well. Remove 1/2 cup for basting; cover and refrigerate. Add the roast to remaining marinade; turn to coat. Seal or cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight, turning occasionally. Drain and discard the marinade. Grill roast, covered, over indirect heat, basting and turning every 15 minutes, for 1 hour or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F). Remove from the grill; let stand for 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Just before serving, prepare gravy mix according to package directions. Thinly slice roast; add to the gravy and heat through. Serve on rolls.
