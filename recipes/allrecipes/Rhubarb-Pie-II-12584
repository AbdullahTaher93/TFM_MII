Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Combine sliced rhubarb with sugar, flour and nutmeg and mix lightly. Add red food coloring, if using, and mix well. Place mixture into unbaked 9 inch pie shell and dot with butter. Cover with top pastry and cut design in top crust for steam to escape. Bake for 30 minutes or until crust is golden brown and fruit is bubbly. Let cool and serve.
