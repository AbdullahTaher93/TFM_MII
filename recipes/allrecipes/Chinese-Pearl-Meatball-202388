Place the rice in a bowl with enough water to cover. Allow to soak 2 hours. Drain and pour onto a platter. Mix the ground pork, water, wine, cornstarch, soy sauce, onion, ginger, garlic, salt, and pepper in a bowl until all ingredients are evenly mixed. Divide and roll the mixture into balls 1-1/2 to 2 inches in size. Roll the meatballs in the soaked glutinous rice to coat completely. Line a large bamboo steamer with the cabbage leaves. Arrange the meatballs atop the cabbage leaves. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat; place a bamboo steamer over the boiling water. Steam the meatballs until no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes.
