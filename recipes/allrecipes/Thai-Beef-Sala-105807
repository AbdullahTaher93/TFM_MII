Heat grill. In a small bowl, combine vinegar, lime juice, fish sauce, sugar, garlic, Serrano chile and basil; mix well. In a 2-gallon resealable plastic food-storage bag, combine 1/4 cup marinade with steak (reserve remaining marinade for dressing), turn to coat. Let stand until grill is ready. When ready to grill, remove steak from marinade. Discard plastic bag with remaining marinade. Place steak over medium heat; cover. Cook for 12 to 15 minutes, turning once, until steak is desired doneness. Let steak stand for 5 minutes, slice diagonally across grain. Place mixed greens on serving plates. Top with steak. Drizzle with dressing.
