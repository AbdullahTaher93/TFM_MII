Hollow out the core of the apples and fill with SNICKERS(R) Bars. Unfold the pie dough. Cut two 4-inch circles from each round of pie dough. Lay the circle flat on the counter; make five 2-inch slits towards the center of the circle. Lay the dough over the apple, shingling the slits for ease in covering the apple. Tuck edges of dough underneath apple. Beat the egg and water together and brush the pie dough with egg and water mixture. Gather up the dough scraps and re-roll them flat. Roll dough into a sausage shape and cut into 1 1/2 -inch pieces. Put one piece on top of each apple for a stem. Refrigerate while the oven is preheating to 350 degrees F. Bake for approximately 20 minutes.
