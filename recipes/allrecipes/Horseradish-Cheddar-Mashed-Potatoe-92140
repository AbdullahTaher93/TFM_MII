Place unpeeled potatoes in a 4- to 5-quart pan. Add enough water to cover by at least 2 inches. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and boil slowly until tender when pierced with a fork, about 15 minutes. Drain off water. Place potatoes in a large bowl. Mash with a potato masher or an electric mixer on medium speed. Add butter, milk, and cheese, and mix until fluffy. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
