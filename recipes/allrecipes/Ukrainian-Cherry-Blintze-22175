For each crepe, pour 2 tablespoons batter into skillet; immediately rotate skillet until batter covers bottom. Cook until golden brown. Run wide spatula around edge to loosen; remove from skillet. Stack crepes, placing waxed paper between each; keep covered. Mix cottage cheese, cream cheese, sugar, 1 tablespoon butter and the vanilla.
