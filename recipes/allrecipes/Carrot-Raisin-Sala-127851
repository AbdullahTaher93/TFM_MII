Peel and coarsely grate 1 pound carrots (to yield 4 to 5 cups). In a large skillet over high heat, bring 1 cup water, 2 tablespoons white-wine vinegar, 1 teaspoon coarse salt, 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon red-pepper flakes to a boil. Add carrots and 1/3 cup raisins; toss to coat. Reduce heat to medium; cover, and cook until carrots are crisp tender, tossing occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes. Mix in 1 tablespoon olive oil. Transfer to a covered container; chill until ready to serve.
