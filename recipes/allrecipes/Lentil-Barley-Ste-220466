Heat canola oil in a heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion in hot oil until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in water, green bell pepper, carrot, potato, corn, celery, rutabaga, and barley; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. Stir in lentils. Continue to simmer until lentils and vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more. Remove from heat. Stir in arugula and season with salt to serve.
