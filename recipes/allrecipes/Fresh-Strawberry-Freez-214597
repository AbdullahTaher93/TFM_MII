Combine hulled strawberries and sugar in a food processor and puree. Reserve 1 cup. Pour the remaining puree into a large bowl. Whip heavy cream in another bowl until soft peaks form. Gently fold into the puree using a rubber spatula until just incorporated. Pour into a loaf pan lined with plastic wrap, cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, about 2 hours. Remove the plastic wrap, scoop into bowls and garnish with berries, mint and some of the reserved puree drizzled on top.
