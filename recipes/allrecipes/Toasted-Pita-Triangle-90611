Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. With scissors, cut pitas in half horizontally, making 2 rounds. Cut each round into 8 triangles. Place on 2 or 3 baking sheets (not cushioned ones). Slowly drizzle with oil and toss to coat. Arrange in single layer. Bake until crisp and golden, 8 to 12 minutes, rotating sheets as needed. Watch carefully, they burn quickly.
