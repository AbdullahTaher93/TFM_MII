Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Cut dates in half, lengthwise. Cut brie into bite-size pieces, about the size of a peanut. Place a piece of brie and 4 almond pieces on open half of date. Place other half on top. Quarter bacon slices, wrap tightly around stuffed date and secure with a toothpick. Sprinkle with pepper. Line a baking sheet with foil and place wrapped dates on top. Bake for 15 minutes or until bacon is crispy. Serve warm.
