In a 3-quart saucepan, cover potatoes with cold salted water. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to a simmer and cook, covered, until tender, about 20 to 30 minutes. Test for doneness by inserting the tip of a sharp paring knife into a potato; it should fall off the knife easily. Remove from water with a slotted spoon and slice into quarters. While potatoes are cooking, combine yogurt, mustard, lemon juice, oregano, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. While potatoes are still warm, toss with vinaigrette. Add sliced onion, olives, and capers. Toss well to combine. Top with a sprinkling of chopped parsley and serve.
