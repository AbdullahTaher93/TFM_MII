Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Place walleye, skin-side down, in the center of one aluminum foil square. Brush fillet with butter; season with seasoned salt and garlic and herb seasoning blend. Place second aluminum foil square over the fish and fold edges of the two pieces of foil together to form a secure packet. Cook on the preheated grill until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 7 minutes per side.
