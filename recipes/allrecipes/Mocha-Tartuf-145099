Line a rimmed baking sheet with plastic wrap; place in freezer. Using a 1/4-cup ice cream scoop, make a slightly rounded ball of ice cream. Press your thumb into center to make an indentation, and fill it with 3 chocolate-covered espresso beans. From edges of indentation, spread and press ice cream over to seal; transfer ball to baking sheet in freezer. Repeat to make 18 ice cream balls in all. Freeze until hardened, 2 to 3 hours. Remove ice cream balls on baking sheet from freezer, and allow to soften at room temperature for 3 to 5 minutes. (This will help the crushed wafers adhere in next step). Put crushed wafers in a shallow dish; roll ice cream balls in wafers, and pat to coat. Place tartufo on baking sheet, and freeze for at least 2 hours before serving.
