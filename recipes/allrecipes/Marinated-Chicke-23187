In a large bowl, mix the soy sauce, brown sugar, sugar, and ginger. Place chicken into the mixture. Chill in the refrigerator 6 to 8 hours, or overnight. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. Place marinated chicken in the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven at least 1 hour, or until meat is no longer pink and juices run clear.
