Bring vinegar and salt to a boil in a saucepan. Add milk; reduce heat to low. Cook, stirring constantly, until milk separates and curds begin to form, 5 to 7 minutes. Line a strainer with cheesecloth. Spoon curdled milk into the cheesecloth, place over a bowl, and refrigerate until fully drained, at least 2 hours. Transfer strained curds to a bowl to serve.
