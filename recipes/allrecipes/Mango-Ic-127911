Remove the lime zest with a zester (or remove zest with a vegetable peeler, then finely mince). Squeeze and reserve juice from lime. Put mangoes into the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Process until mangoes are pureed, then add lime zest and juice and sugar, and process for 30 seconds more. Transfer mango mixture to a medium glass baking pan, then put it in the freezer. Stir with a fork every 30 minutes, breaking up any icy pieces as the mixture freezes, until ice is frozen but still slushy and smooth, about 4 hours. Transfer mango ice to freezer containers until ready to serve. Mango ice will keep its smooth consistency for about 1 week. Allow to thaw slightly before serving.
