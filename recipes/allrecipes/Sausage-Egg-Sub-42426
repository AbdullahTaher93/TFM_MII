In a large skillet over medium heat, cook sausage and onion until the meat is no longer pink; drain. Remove with a slotted spoon and keep warm. In the same skillet, cook and stir the eggs until nearly set, about 7 minutes. Add mushrooms, peppers and the sausage mixture. Cook until eggs are completely set and mixture is heated through. Serve on buns.
