Combine vegetable broth, kosher salt, brown sugar, peppercorns, allspice berries, and ginger in a large stockpot over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar and salt. Bring to a boil, remove brine from heat, cool to room temperature, and refrigerate brine until chilled, at least 4 hours. Add ice water, apple, onion, cinnamon stick, 1 cup water, rosemary, and sage leaves to brine just before using.
