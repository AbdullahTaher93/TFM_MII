Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, bell pepper, garlic, and oregano in the hot oil until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. Pour water into a pot and bring to a boil; add polenta and a pinch of salt. Whisk and cook polenta until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Spread and flatten polenta into a 9-inch pie plate, forming a crust. Cool to room temperature. Layer diced tomatoes into the cooled crust; top with onion mixture. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over filling. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.
