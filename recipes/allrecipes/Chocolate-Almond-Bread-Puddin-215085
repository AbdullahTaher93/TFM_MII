Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour melted butter over bread cubes in a 9x13-inch baking dish; toss to coat. Stir chocolate chips and almonds into bread mixture. Whisk eggs, milk, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla extract, almond extract, and nutmeg in a bowl; pour over bread mixture, lightly pressing bread with a spatula until egg mixture is absorbed. Bake in the preheated oven until the top of the bread pudding springs back when lightly pressed, about 45 minutes.
