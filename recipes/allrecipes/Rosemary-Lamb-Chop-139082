In a medium saucepan, heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil. Add the scallions and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the peas, lima beans, zucchini and crushed red pepper and season with salt and black pepper. Cover and cook over very low heat until barely softened, about 15 minutes. Add the lettuce and 2 tablespoons of the mint, cover and cook until the lettuce is very tender, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat a grill pan. Rub the chops with the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil and season with salt and black pepper. Rub the rosemary onto the chops. Grill the chops over high heat for 6 minutes, turning once or twice, for medium-rare meat. Spoon the vegetables onto plates and top with the lamb chops. Garnish with the remaining 2 tablespoons of mint and serve.
