Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Whisk baking mix, white sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl; stir in milk until dough is just combined. Fold raisins into dough. Knead dough about 10 times and roll out to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut round biscuits using a biscuit cutter or cookie cutter; arrange on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir confectioners' sugar, water, and vanilla extract together until glaze is smooth; drizzle over warm biscuits.
