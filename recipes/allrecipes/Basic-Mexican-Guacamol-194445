Mash together 1 tablespoon of the cilantro, 1 teaspoon of the onion, 1 teaspoon of the chile, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt in the bottom of a molcajete or medium-size bowl. Add the Avocados and gently mash with a fork until chunky-smooth. Fold the remaining cilantro, onion, and chile into the mixture. Stir in the tomato and lime juice, adjust the seasonings to taste, and serve with a basket of warm corn tortilla chips.
