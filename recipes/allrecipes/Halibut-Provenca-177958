If necessary, cut fish into 4 or 5 equal portions. Arrange fish in a single layer in a close-fitting casserole (about 8- by 12-inches) with a little space between pieces. (Use recommended casserole size; larger dish may cause sauce to dry out.) In an 8- to 10-inch frying pan over high heat, stir or shake garlic in oil until lightly browned, about 4 minutes; with a slotted spoon, transfer garlic to paper towels to drain. Leave 1 tablespoon oil in pan (discard remainder). Add pasta sauce. In a cup, blend cornstarch and water; stir into sauce. Stir on high heat until sauce begins to thicken but not boil. Spoon sauce evenly over fish. Sprinkle with garlic and olives. Bake in 400 degrees F oven until fish no longer looks wet in center of thickest part (cut to test), 20 to 25 minutes. Lift out portions with a wide spatula (discard skin if desired) and spoon sauce over fish.
