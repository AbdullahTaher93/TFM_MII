Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic in hot oil until sizzling, about 30 seconds. Add kale and 2 tablespoons water to garlic, cover the saucepan with a lid, and cook until kale softens, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir oats, red pepper flakes, and salt into kale mixture; pour in enough water to cover oats. Cook and stir oats until desired consistency is reached, about 3 minutes.
