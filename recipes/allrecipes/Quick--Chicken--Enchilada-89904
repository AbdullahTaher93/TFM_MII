To make enchilada sauce, in a 2-quart saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Cook onion for 5 minutes or until softened. Add garlic, chili powder, cumin, salt and sugar, stirring constantly for 30 seconds. Stir in tomato sauce, reduce heat and simmer for 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, make filling in a large mixing bowl. Combine chicken, cilantro, jalapenos and 11/2 cups cheese. Stir in 1/2 cup enchilada sauce. Spread 3/4 cup sauce in bottom of microwave-safe 13x9" baking dish. (If pan won't fit in your microwave use 8" or 9" square pans.) Arrange tortillas in single layer on work surface. Scoop about 1/3 cup filling onto center of each tortilla, roll and place seam side down in sauce-covered pan. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling. Pour remaining sauce over enchiladas. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup cheese down center of pan of enchiladas. Cover tightly with plastic wrap. Microwave enchiladas on high for 2 to 4 minutes until filling is hot and cheese is melted. Serve with toppings on the side, if desired.
