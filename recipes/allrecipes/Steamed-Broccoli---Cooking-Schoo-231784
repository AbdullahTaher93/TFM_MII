Place broccoli florets into a steamer insert. Pour about 1-inch of water into the bottom of a saucepan, cover the saucepan with a lid, and bring water to a boil. Place the steamer insert with the broccoli into the saucepan, cover the saucepan with a lid, reduce heat to medium, and steam until broccoli is tender, 3 to 5 minutes. A paring knife inserted in the thickest part of the broccoli should feel a little bit of resistance. Transfer immediately to a serving dish.
