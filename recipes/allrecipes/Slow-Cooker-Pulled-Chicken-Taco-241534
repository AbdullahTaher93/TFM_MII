Line a 4-6 quart slow cooker with a Reynolds(R) Slow Cooker Liner. Trim any large pieces of fat from chicken thighs. Season chicken with half the salt and pepper; add to slow cooker. Add onion, garlic, jalapeno, orange juice, lime juice, soy sauce, cumin, and the remaining salt and pepper to slow cooker. Stir gently with a wooden or silicon spoon to combine. Cover and cook on high setting for 2 to 3 hours or low-heat setting for 4 to5 hours, until chicken is done. Carefully remove lid to allow steam to escape. Use slotted spoon to transfer chicken to a large bowl or cutting board. Shred into bite-size chunks. The chicken should easily shred when it is cooked through. Ladle out some of the juices from the slow cooker, leaving enough to mix with shredded chicken. Spoon shredded chicken back into lined slow cooker. Season to taste with additional salt, pepper, and cumin, if necessary. Warm tortillas in oven or on stove top. To serve, top each tortilla with shredded chicken, diced red onion, chopped cilantro, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice.
