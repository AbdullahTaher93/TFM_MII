Place chicken in a large pot. Add water to cover, onion, bay leaf, thyme sprig, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and cook until chicken is tender, about 50 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cutting board or platter and let cool completely. Remove bones, fat, and skin from chicken. Chop chicken into bite-size pieces and set aside. Heat olive oil in a heavy pot over medium heat. Add sausage pieces; brown on all sides. Add rice and paprika to the pot; stir over medium heat until rice is coated with oil and browned bits are stirred from the bottom. Add Swanson(R) Chicken Broth and browned sausage pieces. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover and cook until rice has absorbed the broth, about 30 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork. Stir the chicken pieces into the rice. Top with chopped hard-cooked egg just before serving.
