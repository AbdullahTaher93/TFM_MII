Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Mix meat, stuffing mix, eggs, onion and water until well blended. Shape into 32 meatballs, each about 1 inch in diameter. Place half of the meatballs in single layer in each of 2 foil-lined 13x9-inch baking pans. Bake 20 min. or until cooked through. Mix beef gravy and sour cream in large saucepan. Add meatballs; mix lightly. Cook on low heat 5 min. or until sauce is heated through, stirring occasionally.
