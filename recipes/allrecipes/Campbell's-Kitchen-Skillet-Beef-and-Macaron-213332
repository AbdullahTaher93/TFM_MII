Cook the beef, celery and oregano in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until the beef is well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat. Stir the soup, picante sauce, corn and pasta in the skillet. Cook and stir until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Sprinkle with the cheese and cook until the cheese is melted.
