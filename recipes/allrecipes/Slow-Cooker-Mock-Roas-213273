Sprinkle the beef with seasoned salt and black pepper to taste. Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat, and brown the roast on all sides, about 3 minutes per side. Place the browned roast into a slow cooker, and sprinkle the onion, chopped carrot, and celery over the meat. Scatter the potatoes and carrot pieces over the other ingredients, sprinkle on the Italian seasoning, parsley, and celery salt, and pour the can of soda over everything. Sprinkle the steak sauce on top. Cover, and cook on Low setting for 8 hours.
