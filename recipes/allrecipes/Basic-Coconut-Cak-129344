Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch square baking pan. Line with waxed paper. Butter the paper. Stir together the flour, coconut, sugar, and almonds in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and stir in the buttermilk, eggs, vanilla, and butter. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes. Turn out onto a rack to cool completely.
