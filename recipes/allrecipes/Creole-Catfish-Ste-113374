In a large pot, heat the oil over moderate heat. Add the onion, celery, and bell pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the thyme, oregano, mustard, Tabasco sauce, pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Add the wine and cook until almost evaporated, about 4 minutes. Add the tomatoes and broth to the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, for 10 minutes. Add the lima beans and simmer for 3 minutes. Stir in the corn and simmer 4 minutes more. Add the catfish and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, bring back to a simmer, and cook until just done, about 2 minutes. Serve topped with the parsley.
