Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add green beans, return to a boil and cook 1 minute; the beans should still be crisp. Drain the beans; don't rinse. In a large skillet or wok, add oil. Heat until very hot (the skillet is ready when a drop of water in the oil sizzles). Add beans and cook about 1 minute, turning often with tongs or spatula. Sprinkle on pecans and Old Bay. Turn the beans and pecans to coat with oil and spices; cook about 2 minutes more, or until beans and nuts are slightly browned. Salt to taste and serve.
