In large Dutch oven heat olive oil and minced garlic on medium-high heat. Add sliced bell peppers and cook until they begin to soften. Add Italian sausage to the pot and cook through. Once cooked through, transfer sausage and peppers to a bowl (drain oil, if preferred). Return Dutch oven to stove and bring 2 cups water and package of Knorr(R) Rice Sides(TM) - Chicken to a boil; reduce heat, cover and simmer 7 minutes. Once rice is finished, add can of Italian-style diced tomatoes and the sausage and peppers. Cook until heated through; serve topped with Parmesan-Romano grated cheese and Italian flat-leaf parsley. Enjoy!
