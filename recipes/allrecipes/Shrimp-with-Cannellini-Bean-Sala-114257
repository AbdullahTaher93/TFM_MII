Light the grill or heat the broiler. Thread the shrimp onto four skewers. In a shallow glass dish, combine 1/4 cup of the oil with the garlic and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Add the skewers and turn to coat the shrimp. Set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the onion with the remaining 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt, the parsley, sage, vinegar, and pepper. Gently stir in the beans. Grill or broil the shrimp, turning once, until just done, about 5 minutes in all. Serve the shrimp with the bean salad.
