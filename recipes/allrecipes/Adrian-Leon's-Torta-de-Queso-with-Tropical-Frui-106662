Cake: Pre-heat oven to 325 degrees and butter 6 inch diameter spring form pan. Beat the goat cheese and cream cheese using an electric mixer in large bowl until fluffy. Gradually beat in SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener. Add vanilla. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Mix in mascarpone cheese and transfer filling to the spring form pan. Place the cheesecake in a roasting pan. Add enough hot water to roasting pan to come to 1 inch up the sides of the spongiform pan. Bake the cake until top is dry-looking and slightly puffed. Turn off the oven and let cake cool in closed oven for 1 hour. Remove from water bath and refrigerate uncovered until cold (6 hours). Topping: Mix all the fruit and the 2 tablespoons of SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and let it rest for about 5 minutes. Cut cooled cheese-cake and cover top with fruit salsa. Garnish with mint.
