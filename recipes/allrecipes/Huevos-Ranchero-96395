Cook sausage according to package directions. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Fry tortillas one at a time in hot oil until lightly brown and crisp, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Arrange tortillas on serving plates; top each tortilla with 2 cooked sausage patties. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in same skillet. Fry 3 eggs sunny-side-up or over-easy as desired. Sprinkle with salt, if desired. Place one egg over each serving of sausages. Repeat with remaining 1 tablespoon butter and 3 eggs. Add salsa and catsup to skillet; heat through, stirring constantly. Spoon mixture over each serving; top with cheese and, if desired, cilantro.
