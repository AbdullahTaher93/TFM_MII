Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add chicken breasts, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Pour chicken broth into the pot; bring to a boil. Stir in potatoes, cabbage, and carrot. Simmer soup until potatoes are tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Bring soup back to a boil. Drizzle in eggs, stirring until cooked, about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper.
