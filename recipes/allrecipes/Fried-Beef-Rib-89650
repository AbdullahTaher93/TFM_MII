Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together the salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, garlic salt, and onion salt. Place the flour in a separate bowl or plate. Whisk eggs in a large bowl. Rub the spice mixture onto all of the ribs. Dip each rib in egg, then in flour, then egg, then flour again. Place the ribs in a fryer basket so they are not crowded, try 4 or 5 at a time depending on the size of your fryer. Cook for about 8 minutes. Remove to paper towels to drain. Continue with remaining ribs.
