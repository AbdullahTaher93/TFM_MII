Melt the butter and heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Arrange the potato slices across the bottom of the skillet in a single layer. Cook without stirring for 5 minutes, or until the potatoes have begun to brown on the bottom. Sprinkle potato slices with rosemary, thyme, oregano, parsley, and paprika. Turn the potatoes, and continue cooking 5 minutes, or until tender. Turn off the heat, and sprinkle the garlic and cayenne over the potatoes. Lightly toss for about 1 minute, until the garlic has softened.
