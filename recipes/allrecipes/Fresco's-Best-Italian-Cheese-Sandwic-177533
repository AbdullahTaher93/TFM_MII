Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cut each toast in half. Divide the cheese slices among 8 toast halves. Top with the remaining toast halves. Place the flour, eggs and bread crumbs into separate shallow bowls. Beat the eggs with a fork. Coat the sandwiches with the flour. Dip the sandwiches into the eggs. Coat the sandwiches with the bread crumbs. Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the sandwiches in batches and cook until they're well browned on both sides. Place the sandwiches onto a baking sheet. Bake for 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted. Heat the sauce in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat until it's hot and bubbling. Serve the sandwiches with the sauce for dipping.
