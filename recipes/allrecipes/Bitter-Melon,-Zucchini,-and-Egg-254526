Mix bitter melon and 1 tablespoon salt together in a bowl. Let stand until water is drawn out of bitter melon, about 20 minutes. Rinse melon; squeeze out excess moisture with your hands. Heat butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat; cook and stir bitter melon, zucchini, bell pepper, sweet onion, and garlic in the skillet until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain excess liquid; return vegetables to skillet. Combine eggs, sour cream, Parmesan cheese, melted butter, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and ground black pepper together in a bowl; stir until combined. Pour egg mixture over vegetable mixture; cook and stir over medium heat until eggs are set but still very moist, 5 to 8 minutes. Top with Cheddar cheese; cover and turn off heat. Allow to rest until eggs have set and cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes.
