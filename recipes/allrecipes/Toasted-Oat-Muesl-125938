Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Spread the oats out on a jelly-roll pan. Spread the almonds in a small baking pan. Place the oats and almonds in the oven and bake, stirring often, until the oats are lightly browned and the almonds are toasted. The oats will take 30 to 35 minutes; the almonds will toast in 20 to 25 minutes. Place the oats and almonds in a large bowl and cool completely. Add the fruit bits, wheat germ, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds. Toss to combine. Store in an airtight container. To serve, place 1/2 cup of the cereal mixture in a bowl. Top with soy milk, fat-free milk, or yogurt.
