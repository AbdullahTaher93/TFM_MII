Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add pork chops and saute until browned. Remove from skillet and drain on paper toweling. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl mix together soup, milk, sour cream and salt and pepper to taste. Stir in potatoes, 1/2 cup cheese and 1/2 cup onions. Mix together and spread mixture in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange pork chops over potato mixture. Cover dish and bake in the preheated oven for about 40 minutes, or until internal temperature of pork has reached 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove cover; top with remaining cheese and onions and bake uncovered for 5 more minutes.
