Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spread 1/2 of the yellow cake mix into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cut peaches from the larger can into large chunks and layer on top of the cake mix. Sprinkle butter over peach layer. Cover butter layer with remaining cake mix. Pour the reserved juice from both cans over cake mix mixture. Set the peaches from smaller can aside for another use. Bake in the preheated oven until cobbler is lightly browned, 35 to 40 minutes.
