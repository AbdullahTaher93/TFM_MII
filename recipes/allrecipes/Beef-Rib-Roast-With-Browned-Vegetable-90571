Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine garlic and lemon pepper; press onto beef roast. Place roast, fat side up, in shallow roasting pan. Insert ovenproof meat thermometer so tip is centered in thickest part of beef, not resting in fat or touching bone. Do not add water or cover. Roast in 350 degrees F oven 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 hours for medium rare; 2-3/4 to 3 hours for medium doneness. Remove roast when meat thermometer registers 135 degrees F for medium rare; 150 degrees F for medium. Transfer to board; tent with foil. Let stand 15 to 20 minutes. (Temperature will continue to rise about 10 degrees F to reach 145 degrees F for medium rare; 160 degrees F for medium.) Remove all but 2 tablespoons drippings from pan. Add vegetables; cook over medium-high heat 5 minutes or until lightly browned, stirring occasionally. Carve roast. Serve with vegetables.
