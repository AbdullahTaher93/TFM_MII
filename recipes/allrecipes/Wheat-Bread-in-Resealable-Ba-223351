Grease a bread loaf pan. Mix 1 cup all-purpose flour, yeast, milk powder, sugar, and salt together in a large resealable plastic bag. Add hot water and oil; seal bag and squeeze to mix. Add whole-wheat flour; seal and mix. Add 1 cup all-purpose flour; seal and mix. Add small amounts of additional all-purpose flour until dough easily pulls away from sides of bag. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface; knead until soft and well combined, 4 minutes. Allow to rest for 10 minutes. Roll dough into a large rectangle; roll rectangle into a log. Place log into prepared loaf pan. Cover and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
