Cut stem ends off endive. Separate the leaves; cut off any brown edges. Place leaves on a platter. In a food processor with the metal blade or in a mixing bowl with a fork, blend cheese and mayonnaise until creamy; it will be slightly lumpy. Using a knife or a small spoon, scoop approximately 1 teaspoon of the cheese mixture onto the widest end of each leaf. Sprinkle tops with nuts. Cover the filled leaves and refrigerate until chilled. Serve chilled or at room temperature.
