In a large bowl combine the pasta, turkey cubes, scallions, celery, parsley and tarragon and mix together. In a small bowl blend together the oil, vinegar, lemon juice and mayonnaise. Add this mixture to the turkey mixture and mix well, coating all surfaces. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours, or until chilled through.
