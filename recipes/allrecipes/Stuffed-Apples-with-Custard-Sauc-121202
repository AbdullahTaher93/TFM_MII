In a blender or food processor, combine the walnuts, raisins and sugar; cover and process until ground. Stir in butter; set aside. Core apples and remove enough pulp to leave a 1-in. shell. Fill each apple with about 1/4 cup nut mixture. Place in a greased shallow 3-qt. baking dish. Pour water around apples. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until tender. Meanwhile, for custard sauce, combine the sugar, flour and salt in a saucepan. Gradually stir in milk and cream until smooth. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat. Stir a small amount of hot milk mixture into egg yolks; return all to the pan, stirring constantly. Bring to a gentle boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in vanilla. Cool. Serve over warm apples. Refrigerate any leftovers.
