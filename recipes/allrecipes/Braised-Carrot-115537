Put oil and carrots in a heavy 10-inch skillet. Cook over high heat, stirring and shaking the pan often and scraping the browned bits from time to time with a wooden spoon, until the carrots have browned nicely, about 10 minutes. Add garlic, tomatoes, mint, lemon slices, sugar, salt, anise and cumin; mix well. Cook until bubbling vigorously, then reduce heat to low. Cover and cook for 20 minutes. Stir, turning the carrots. Cover and cook until the carrots are very soft, 20 minutes more. Add lemon juice and season with pepper. Serve hot or at room temperature.
