Roast the eggplant and red bell pepper over an open flame (such as your BBQ grill or if you have a gas stove, directly over the burner) until the skin blackens. (Otherwise roast in the oven). Peel immediately. Finely chop the eggplant and peppers and run through a food processor (or through a meat grinder like they do in Romania). Cut the tomatoes in half and squeeze out and discard the seeds and excess liquids. Coarsely chop the tomatoes. In a pot, add the oil and the onions and saute over medium heat for a few minutes. Then add the tomato and the bay leaf and simmer for about 4 minutes. Add the eggplant and peppers and mix well. Add a pinch of salt and pepper. Simmer for about 10 minutes. It should be very thick. Discard the bay leaf. Meanwhile, blanch your cabbage leaves. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt. Put the cabbage leaves in the pot and carefully submerse them with a spoon or tongs. As soon as they become flexible (not limp) remove from water and let drain in a colander. Spoon out 1/4 of the Zacusca onto each cabbage leaf and serve immediately.
