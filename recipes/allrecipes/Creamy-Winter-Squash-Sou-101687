Heat oil over low heat in a large deep pan while preparing vegetables. A few minutes from cooking, increase heat to medium-high and add squash and onions to the hot pan; cook, stirring very little at first then more frequently at the end, until vegetables are golden brown, about 7 to 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add butter, sugar, and garlic; continue to cook until all vegetables are a rich spotty caramel color, about 10 minutes longer. Add cinnamon, ginger, cloves and cayenne; continue to cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds to a minute. Add broth; bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce to low and simmer, partially covered, until squash is tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer squash to a blender; puree until very smooth, 30 seconds to a minute. Work in batches if needed. Return puree to soup pot; add enough half-and-half so that puree is a soup consistency. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
