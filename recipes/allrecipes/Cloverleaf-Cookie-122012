In a mixing bowl, cream butter, shortening and sugars. Beat in egg and vanilla. Combine flour, baking soda and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Divide dough into thirds. Add chocolate chips to one portion, peanut butter to another and melted chocolate to the third portion. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until firm. Roll 1/2 teaspoonfuls of dough into balls. For each cookie, place three balls (one of each dough) with edges touching on ungreased baking sheets to form a cloverleaf. Place cookies 2 in. apart. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 1 minute before removing to wire racks.
