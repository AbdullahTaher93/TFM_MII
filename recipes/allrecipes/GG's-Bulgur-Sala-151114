Place the bulgur wheat into a bowl, and pour the hot water over it. Let it soak for 20 to 30 minutes, until tender. Drain off any excess water. In a serving bowl, combine the apples, dates, green onion, lettuce, cilantro and parsley with the bulgur. Whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, yogurt, honey, salt and pepper in a small bowl; pour over the salad and stir to coat. Refrigerate until serving. Just before serving, stir in the Muenster cheese and slivered almonds.
