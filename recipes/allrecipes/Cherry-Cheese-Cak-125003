Prepare cake mix according to package directions. Pour into two greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minute or until a wooden pick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool. In a mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar until fluffy; fold in the whipped cream. Spread over each cake. Top with pie filling. Chill 4 hours or overnight.
