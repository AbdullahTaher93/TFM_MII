Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir water, black beans, cumin, and beef bouillon cube into the onion and garlic mixture; bring to a boil, add rice, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the moisture is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Gently stir Creole seasoning and cilantro into the beans and rice.
