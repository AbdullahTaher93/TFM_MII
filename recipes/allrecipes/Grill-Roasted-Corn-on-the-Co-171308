Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above the cooking grate only 2 to 3 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). While grill heats, carefully peel back husks from corn (don't remove entirely) and pull off the silks. Using a basting brush, brush each ear with melted butter. Push husks back over kernels and place corn on cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook ears, turning often with tongs, until hot and speckled brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Put corn on a platter. Pull back or remove husks completely, rub corn with lime wedges, if you like, and sprinkle with salt to taste.
