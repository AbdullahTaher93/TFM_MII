Preheat grill to medium heat. Mix barbecue sauce, pineapple with its liquid, the cinnamon and dry mustard until well blended. Remove 1/2 cup of the barbecue sauce mixture; set aside for later use. Grill chops 5 min. on each side. Continue grilling 5 min. or until cooked through (160 degrees F), turning occasionally and brushing with the remaining barbecue sauce mixture. Serve with the reserved 1/2 cup barbecue sauce mixture.
