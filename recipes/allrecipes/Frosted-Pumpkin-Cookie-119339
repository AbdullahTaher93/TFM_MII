In a mixing bowl, cream shortening and brown sugar. Add pumpkin; mix well. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt; gradually add to pumpkin mixture. Stir in pecans and dates. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls 2 in. apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 13-15 minutes or until firm. Meanwhile, for frosting, combine the butter, brown sugar and milk in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly; boil for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in maple flavoring and vanilla. Cool slightly; beat in enough confectioners' sugar to achieve spreading consistency. Remove cookies to wire racks; frost while warm.
