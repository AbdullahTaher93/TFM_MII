Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Heat the butter and oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season the pork chops with salt and pepper then lightly coat with flour. Add chops to the pan and fry on each side until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking sheet and place in the warm oven. Leave in the oven to finish cooking, about 10 minutes. While the chops are cooking, stir together the honey and chicken broth in a small bowl. As soon as you remove them from the pan, pour the honey sauce into the skillet and add pecans. Cook and stir until sauce becomes thick enough to coat a metal spoon, about 2 minutes. Drizzle sauce over pork chops and serve immediately.
