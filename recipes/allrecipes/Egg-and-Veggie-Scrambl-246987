Steam or boil vegetables until very tender. Drain if necessary and mash or puree together until you have your desired consistency. Let cool, then place in a sealed container in the fridge until ready to use. Whisk egg. Whisk in 1/4 cup (60 mL) of the pureed or mashed mixed vegetables until well combined. Heat a pan over medium heat. Add egg and vegetable mixture and cook, stirring often, until eggs are scrambled and completely cooked through. Remove from heat, let cool and chop into tiny pieces your baby can manage.
