Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Place squash in a bowl; drizzle with olive oil. Stir to coat. Place bread crumbs in a separate bowl; dredge squash in bread crumbs until well coated. Cook squash on preheated grill until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Whisk mayonnaise, yogurt, taco sauce, chile paste, and paprika together in a bowl. Top each cooked squash slice with a dollop of mayonnaise mixture.
