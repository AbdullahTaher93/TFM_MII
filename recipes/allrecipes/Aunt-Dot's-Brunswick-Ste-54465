Bring water to boil in a saucepan; add potatoes, and boil until tender ( about 15 minutes). Pour the potatoes and the water used to boil them into a large pot. Stir in onion, peas, corn, tomatoes, ground turkey, and bacon. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Stir in the salt, pepper, garlic salt, and sugar. If stew appears too watery, stir together flour and some of the stew liquid in a small cup, and then stir mixture into the stew. Continue cooking for 1 hour.
