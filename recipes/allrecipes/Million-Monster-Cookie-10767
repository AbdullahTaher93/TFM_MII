In a very large mixing bowl, cream together the shortening, the butter or margarine, the sugars, the eggs, and the vanilla. Add to the mixing bowl the flour, the leavenings, the oats, the nuts, the coconut, the chocolate chips, and the M & M candies. Drop dough by spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets. To make extra large cookies, drop by ice cream scoopfuls. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 to 12 minutes, longer for large cookies. Remove, and cool on wire racks.
