Cook the cabbage and carrots in boiling salted water until crisp-tender. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, saute the onion in 3 tablespoons of butter until tender. Stir in flour, salt and pepper; cook until bubbly. Gradually add milk; cook and stir until thickened. Drain cabbage and carrots; place half in a greased 2-1/2-qt. baking dish. Top with half of the sauce; sprinkle with half of the cheese. Repeat layers. In a small skillet, melt remaining butter. Add crumbs, marjoram and thyme; cook and stir until lightly browned. Sprinkle over casserole. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until the cabbage is tender and the top is browned.
