Blend soy sauce, oil, garlic juice, sugar and water, stirring until sugar dissolves; set aside. Cut 3 bagels crosswise in half into semi-circles; lay on cut edge and cut into 7 or 8 thin slices. Brush both sides of slices lightly and evenly with soy sauce mixture, stirring mixture frequently. Place slices, in single layer, on large baking sheet. Bake in 250 degrees F oven 45 minutes. Remove chips to wire racks; cool completely. Repeat procedure with remaining bagels and soy sauce mixture. Store chips in well-sealed plastic bags.
