Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil. Place cherry tomatoes on the prepared baking sheet. Distribute sage and thyme amongst tomatoes, reserving about 1 tablespoon of each for garnishing. Drizzle generously with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast for 30 minutes or until tomatoes blister. Remove tomatoes and place into a bowl, tossing all juices collected in the foil. Garnish with additional fresh thyme, sage and oregano. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve.
