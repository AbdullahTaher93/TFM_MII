In a shallow baking dish, mix the white wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, Italian seasoning, rosemary, tarragon, capers, and sun-dried tomatoes. Place the salmon fillets into the dish, and turn to coat with the marinade. Season with pepper, and sprinkle with olives. Cover, and refrigerate 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake uncovered for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fish is easily flaked with a fork.
