Cook rice as package directs. Heat grill. In medium bowl combine shrimp, lime juice and butter; set aside (butter will harden). In medium saucepan combine sauce mix, coconut milk and curry powder; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low, add tomatoes and simmer 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Spray grill basket with nonstick cooking spray. When ready to grill, place shrimp in grill basket on gas grill over medium heat or on charcoal grill 4 to 6 inches from medium coals. Cook 4 to 6 minutes or until shrimp turn pink, turning once, discarding any remaining lime butter marinade. To serve, spoon sauce over rice. Top with cooked shrimp, sprinkle with cilantro.
