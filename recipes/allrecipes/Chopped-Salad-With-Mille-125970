In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, cook the millet, stirring frequently, for 3 to 4 minutes, or until lightly browned and the grains begin to crackle. Add the water and 1/8 teaspoon of the salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 25 minutes, or until the millet is tender, some grains have burst, and the water has evaporated. Remove from the heat and let stand for 10 minutes. Fluff the millet with a fork and place in a medium bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes, or until cooled. Meanwhile, in a large serving bowl, whisk together the vinegar, olive oil, flaxseed oil, black pepper, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir in the scallions and let stand for at least 10 minutes to allow the flavors to blend. Place a steamer basket in a saucepan with 1/2 inch of water. Place the asparagus in the steamer. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 4 minutes, or until tender-crisp. Rinse briefly under cold running water and drain. Add the millet, cabbage, radishes, carrots, roasted pepper, parsley, and asparagus to the dressing. Toss to coat well. Let stand for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.
