Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cover baking sheet with parchment paper. Blend almond four, egg, coconut oil, and flax seeds together in a blender. Transfer mixture to prepared baking sheet and roll or press out to desired thickness and shape. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
