Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, heat the EVOO, 3 turns of the pan, over medium-high heat. (If the skillet does not have an ovenproof handle, wrap the handle in a double layer of foil.) Add the zucchini and bell pepper, season with salt and pepper and cook for 5 minutes. Add the leeks and garlic and cook until the leeks are wilted, 3 to 4 minutes. Beat the eggs with the cream and hot sauce and season with salt and pepper. Add the eggs to the skillet and cook for 2 to 3 minutes without stirring to let the bottom cook, then transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until set, 10 to 15 minutes. During the last minute or two of cooking, top the frittata with the cheese. Cut the frittata into 6 wedges and top with the spinach.
