Place miso in a small double boiler. Whisk in egg yolk, sugar, sake, mirin and matcha, if using, until smooth. Cook over simmering water, whisking, until the mixture begins to thicken, about 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in water and continue whisking until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 4 minutes. Scrape into a bowl and set aside. Preheat broiler. Line a baking sheet with foil and coat with cooking spray. Arrange salmon, skin-side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Dip your fingers into cold water and lightly moisten the top of the fish. Broil the salmon 4 to 6 inches from the heat source until just cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish. Remove the salmon from the broiler. Put 1 tablespoon of the miso sauce over each portion, spreading evenly. Return the salmon to the broiler and continue cooking, shifting the baking sheet as necessary, until the salmon is cooked through and the topping is lightly browned, about 1 minute. Serve with lemon wedges.
