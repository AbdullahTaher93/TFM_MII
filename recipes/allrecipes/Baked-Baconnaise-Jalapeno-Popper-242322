Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix cream cheese and bacon-flavored mayonnaise together in a bowl. Fill each jalapeno pepper half with cream cheese mixture. Wrap each filled pepper with a bacon slice, securing with a toothpick if needed. Arrange peppers in a baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crisp and peppers are tender, about 1 hour. Transfer peppers to a serving plate and allow to cool, 3 to 5 minutes.
