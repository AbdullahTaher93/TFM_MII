In a 3-quart microwavable bowl, stir the onion, carrot, and garlic with the olive oil until coated. Nuke for 4 to 6 minutes or until soft. Stir in the chickpeas, zucchini, broth, tortellini, and Italian seasoning. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and microwave for 15 to 18 minutes, or until the tortellini is cooked. Stir in the salt and pepper.
