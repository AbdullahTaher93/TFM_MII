Cook and drain fettuccine as directed on package. While fettuccine is cooking, place whipping cream, Creole seasoning and bell peppers in blender or food processor. Cover and blend on high speed until smooth. Pour pepper mixture into 12-inch skillet. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture thickens. Stir in sausage; heat through but do not boil. Serve sausage mixture over fettuccine. Sprinkle with onions.
