Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Cut each chicken breast from one side through the middle horizontally to within one-half inch of the other side. Open the two sides and spread them out like an open book. Mix cream cheese, feta cheese, tomato, olives, onion, and spinach together in a large bowl. Spoon cheese mixture onto 1 side of each opened chicken breast. Fold each chicken breast closed and place on a piece of aluminum foil. Cook the chicken breasts on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
