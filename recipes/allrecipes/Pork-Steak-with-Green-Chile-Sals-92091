For salsa, core and chop tomato. In a small bowl, stir together tomato, onion, green chiles, and cilantro. Set aside. Trim and discard fat from pork; put pieces of meat between sheets of plastic wrap and pound with a flat mallet until about 1/8-inch thick. If you do this step ahead, wrap meat airtight and chill up until next day. In a small bowl, stir together chili powder, cumin, and vinegar. Remove wrap from pork; rub chili mixture evenly on all sides of meat. Heat a teaspoon of the oil in a nonstick 10- to 12-inch frying pan over high heat; add pork without crowding and cook until edges turn white. Turn and cook until no longer pink in center (about 2 1/2 minutes total; cut to test). Transfer to platter as cooked and keep warm. Add meat to pan as space is available; add more oil as needed. Serve pork with salsa, sour cream, and salt to taste.
