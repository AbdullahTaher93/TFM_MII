In a shallow bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. In another shallow bowl, combine the flour, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese and seasonings. Cut each potato lengthwise into eight wedges. Dip potatoes into egg whites, then coat with crumb mixture. Place in a single layer on a baking sheet coated with nonstick cooking spray. Spray wedges evenly with nonstick cooking spray. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until golden brown.
