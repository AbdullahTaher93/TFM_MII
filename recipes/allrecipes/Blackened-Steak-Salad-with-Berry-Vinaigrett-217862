Brush steak with olive oil and sprinkle with blackening seasoning. Grill or broil to desired doneness. Let stand 5 minutes before cutting into thin slices. Combine romaine, tomatoes, red onion, olives and roasted red pepper in large bowl; toss well. Divide salad mixture on 2 large plates. Top each with sliced cooked steak. Drizzle with Berry Vinaigrette, to taste, and sprinkle with feta cheese. Refrigerate any remaining dressing.
