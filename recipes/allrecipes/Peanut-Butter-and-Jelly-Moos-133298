Using an electric mixer, whip together the cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, peanut butter and 1/4 cup half-and-half. Have a buddy or a GH (Grown-Up Helper) slowly pour in the remaining 1/4 cup half-and-half while you continue beating until the mixture is smooth. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream just until it thickens enough to make soft peaks and bumps--too much beating turns it into butter! Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the whipped cream into the peanut butter mixture. Scrape the jelly into a small bowl and stir it up to make it more spoonable. In parfait or juice glasses, layer 1 big spoonful jelly and 2 big spoonfuls peanut butter mousse, adding some strawberries wherever you like. Keep going until you reach the tops of your glasses. Refrigerate the parfaits for a couple of hours or until they get cold and firm.
