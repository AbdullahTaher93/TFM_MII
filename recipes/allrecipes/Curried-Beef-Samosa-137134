Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Set aside 1/8 teaspoon curry powder. In 1 1/2-quart nonstick saucepan, mix remaining curry powder, taco sauce with ground beef and frozen peas. Cook over medium heat 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until hot. Remove pie crusts from pouches; place flat on work surface. With 3 1/4- to 3 1/2-inch round cutter, cut 8 rounds from each crust, making 32 pie crust rounds. Spoon 1 rounded tablespoon beef mixture onto center of each of 16 pie crust rounds. Top each with remaining pie crust round; firmly press edges with fork to seal. Place on ungreased large cookie sheet. In small bowl, beat egg yolk and reserved 1/8 teaspoon curry powder with fork until blended; brush over tops of samosas. Bake 13 to 17 minutes or until golden brown. Meanwhile, mix yogurt and chutney. Immediately remove samosas from cookie sheets. Serve warm with yogurt-chutney sauce.
