Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Rinse well the chicken and arrange in a baking dish or roasting pan, generously season with salt and pepper. In a sauce pan, add the diced apricots, the 11/2 cups water and the 3 Tbsp of Splenda. Bring to a boil, and then reduce heat to a simmer. Stir frequently until reduced to about 1/2 to 2/3 cup. Pour into a blender or food processor and process until fairly smooth. (Leave in the bowl for now). In the same sauce pan (don't wash it out yet), add a drop of oil and saute the garlic just until the point you start to see some color. Immediately add 2 Tbsp of mustard and 2 Tbsp of water and turn off the heat. Stir well. Add this mixture to the apricots and pulse several times. Remove about 6 Tbsps of the apricot mixture to a small bowl to use for basting the chicken. Start off by drizzling about 1/2 of this (3 Tbsp) over the chicken and coat evenly using a basting brush. Place chicken in 350 degrees F oven and roast for 20 minutes. Then baste with the remaining 3 Tbsp and continue cooking until an internal temperature of 180 degrees F (about 40 minutes longer for a whole chicken and only 15 minutes for skinless breast meat). Meanwhile, pour the remaining contents of the food processor bowl back into the sauce pan. Use 3/4 cup of water to rinse out the processor bowl and add this to the sauce pan. Also add the guar gum, 1/4 tsp salt and a dash of pepper. Stir well while bringing to the boil. Set aside until the chicken is ready. Reheat once ready to serve with the chicken. I generally serve the sauce on the side, but you could also drizzle it over the chicken just before serving.
