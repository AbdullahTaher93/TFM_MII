Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl. Mash potatoes using a potato masher or fork. Stir ground beef and white sauce together in a bowl; spread into the prepared casserole dish. Layer corn over beef mixture. Measure about 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese and set aside. Sprinkle the remaining Cheddar cheese over corn layer; top with mashed potatoes. Sprinkle reserved 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese over potatoes. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and cheese is melted, about 30 minutes.
