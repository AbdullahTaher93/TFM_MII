Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (even if the polenta package instructs otherwise -- the polenta will be easier to pick up). Lightly coat a medium baking sheet with the olive oil spray. Slice ends off polenta, then cut into 12 rounds (each about 1/3-inch thick). Place them side by side on a baking sheet. Bake 7 minutes on each side, then transfer to serving platter. Top each with 1 teaspoon sour cream, then 1/4 teaspoon caviar, and serve immediately.
