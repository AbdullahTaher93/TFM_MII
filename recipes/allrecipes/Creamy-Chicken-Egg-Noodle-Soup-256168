Bring chicken stock, garlic bulb, peppercorns, and bay leaf to a boil in a large pot. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until flavors combine, about 35 minutes. Strain out garlic bulb, peppercorns, and bay leaf from the stock. Stir onion, carrots, celery, thyme, salt, Italian seasoning, celery leaves, and black pepper into the stock. Simmer over medium-low heat until carrots are tender, about 18 minutes. Bring to a gentle boil; stir in egg noodles and corn. Cook until noodles are tender yet still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Discard thyme bundle. Stir chicken and cream into the pot; simmer until heated through, about 3 minutes.
