Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners. Combine flour, white sugar, brown sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk olive oil, milk, egg, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl until smooth; stir into flour mixture until batter is just moistened. Fold zucchini, blueberries, and pecans into batter. Fill prepared muffin cups 2/3 full with batter. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
