Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cook the beans in a saucepan of boiling water until just tender, 3 minutes; drain and refresh under cold running water. Halve the beans and put into a large salad bowl. Add the lettuce, endive, celery, and chicken; set aside in the refrigerator. Put the egg in a saucepan, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer 10 minutes. Meanwhile, tip the anchovies into a bowl with the oil from the can (about 1 tablespoon). Add the garlic and mash with a fork to a paste. Spread thinly over one side of each slice of French bread. Arrange on a baking sheet and bake until the croutons are crisp and golden, about 10 minutes. Cool slightly, then break into pieces. While the croutons are baking, make the Caesar Dressing. Whisk together the mustard, olive oil, vinegar, yogurt, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and pepper to taste. Cool the hard-boiled egg under cold running water, then peel and chop. Stir into the dressing. Drizzle half of the dressing over the chilled salad and toss to coat everything evenly. Add the croutons and toss again. Drizzle the remaining dressing over and sprinkle the Parmesan shavings on top.
