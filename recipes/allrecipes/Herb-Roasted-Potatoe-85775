Preheat oven to 475 degrees F. Combine Enova brand oil, garlic, salt, dill weed, thyme, oregano, parsley and pepper sauce in large, resealable, plastic food storage-bag or large mixing bowl. Add potato cubes and toss until evenly coated. Place potato cubes in one layer on a 9x13 inch roasting pan. Roast potatoes, turning occasionally, until tender and golden brown, about 30 minutes.
