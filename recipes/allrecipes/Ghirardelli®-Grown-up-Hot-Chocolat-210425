In a small saucepan, combine the chocolate chips and half-and-half over low heat and bring to a simmer, whisking constantly. Simmer for 1 minute or until the mixture thickens slightly. Remove from the heat; whisk in the liqueur and vanilla. Pour into four 1/2-cup demitasse or coffee cups. Top each serving with whipped cream and dust with cocoa. Serve immediately.
