Cook the pasta in boiling water until al dente, 10 to 12 minutes, or according to the package directions, adding the peas 2 to 3 minutes before the end of the cooking time. Drain and rinse well with cold water, then drain again. While the pasta and peas are cooking, put a third of the watercress in a food processor or blender and process until finely chopped. Add the peeled garlic clove, parsley, tarragon, and half of the scallions, and process to a fine puree. Add the yogurt and mayonnaise, and process briefly to combine. Stir in the remaining scallions, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the dressing to the cooked pasta and peas, and mix well together. Divide between 4 plates. Toss the remaining watercress with the red onion, capers, cucumber, oil, and vinegar, then spoon over the pasta salad. Arrange the pieces of smoked salmon on top and serve.
