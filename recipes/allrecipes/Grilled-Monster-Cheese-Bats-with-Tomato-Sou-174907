Prepare soup as directed on can. Meanwhile, spread butter evenly on one side of each bread slice. Place 2 bread slices, buttered sides down, in 12-inch skillet or on griddle. Top each with 2 slices cheese. Top with remaining bread, buttered sides up. Cook over medium heat about 5 minutes, turning once, until bread is golden brown and cheese is melted. Remove to cutting board. Use 4-inch bat-shaped cookie cutter or sharp knife to cut shape from sandwiches. Cut trimmings into croutons. Spoon soup into serving bowls and top with grilled cheese croutons. Serve sandwich bats on the side.
