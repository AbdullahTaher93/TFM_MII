Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the cream cheese and butter, and mix with the milk until smooth and bubbly. In a medium casserole dish, mix the frozen corn, red bell pepper, and jalapeno peppers. Pour in the cream cheese mixture, and toss to coat. Bake 35 to 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly and lightly brown.
