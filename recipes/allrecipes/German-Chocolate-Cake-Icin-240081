Bring brown sugar, milk, and butter to a boil in a large saucepan, stirring occasionally. Boil until icing thickens and reaches 240 degrees F to 245 degrees F (115 degrees C to 118 degrees C) on a candy thermometer, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in coconut and pecans. If icing is too thick, thin with milk to desired consistency.
