Preheat oven to BROIL. Lightly grease a 1 to 1 1/2 quart baking dish. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt 3 tablespoons of margarine and saute the green onions. Toss in shrimp and saute until pink, about 5 minutes. Remove shrimp with slotted spoon and set aside. Add cream cheese and milk to skillet, stirring constantly until cheese melts. Stir in Swiss cheese, wine, cooked shrimp, and red pepper. Cook until all cheese is melted and shrimp are heated through. Pour mixture into prepared baking dish. Combine bread crumbs and 2 tablespoons of melted margarine, sprinkle over shrimp mixture. Broil for 1 to 2 minutes or until golden brown.
