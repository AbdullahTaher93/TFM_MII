In a small pot, bring the cream to a boil just around the edges. Add the chocolate and whisk until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Stir in the cranberries. Transfer the chocolate mixture to a pie pan or 9 inch pan. Refrigerate until firm, 1-2 hours. Using a teaspoon scoop the truffles. Return to the refrigerator and let firm up again, about 30 minutes. Place the walnuts on a plate or pie pan. Roll the truffles in the walnuts and then roll them lightly between your palms until they are a nice round shape. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
