Whisk coconut milk, peanut butter, rice vinegar, lime juice, sriracha sauce, fish sauce, soy sauce, mint, garlic, curry powder, brown sugar, ginger, and Chinese five-spice powder together in a large bowl to make marinade. Place chicken in a separate bowl. Pour in enough marinade to thoroughly coat the chicken. Marinate chicken in the refrigerator for 15 to 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a rimmed baking sheet. Thread chicken onto bamboo skewers, alternating with green onions. Lay skewers a few inches apart on the baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven, flipping skewers halfway through baking, until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve remaining marinade alongside.
