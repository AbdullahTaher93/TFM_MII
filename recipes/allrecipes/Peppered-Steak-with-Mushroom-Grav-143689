Trim any fat from the meat. Combine peppercorns or pepper, oregano, 1/4 teaspoon thyme, and salt. Sprinkle both sides of meat with the pepper mixture, pressing into meat. In a large skillet, cook the meat in hot butter over medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes for medium doneness (160 degrees F), turning once. Remove from skillet. Cover and keep warm. For gravy, add water and bouillon granules to skillet. Bring to boiling. Stir in mushrooms. Cook, uncovered, about 2 minutes or until tender. In a separate bowl, whisk together the LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, flour, and 1/4 teaspoon thyme. Add the milk mixture to the skillet. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir 1 minute more. To serve, spoon the gravy onto serving plates. Place meat over the gravy. If desired, garnish with chives.
