Brown ground beef in a large skillet; drain fat. Stir in seasoning mix, tomatoes and beans. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes. Spread 1/2 cup chili onto center of each tortilla; top each with 2 tablespoons sour cream, 1/4 cup cheese, and 1/4 cup lettuce. Sprinkle with sliced green onion, if desired. Fold bottom of each tortilla over chili; fold sides over, overlapping fillings.
