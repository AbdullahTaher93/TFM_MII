Heat oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-high heat. Stir in onions, celery and carrots; saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Add ham, beans, broth, caraway seeds and Worcestershire sauce; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered to blend flavors, about 15 minutes. Serve.
