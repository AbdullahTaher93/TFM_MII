Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 9 inch square baking pan. To make crust: In medium mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Add in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press dough into baking pan and bake for 15 minutes. To make the filling: In large mixing bowl, beat sugar, eggs and bourbon. Slowly add in flour and salt, mixing well. Fold in coconut and pecans. Spread filling over hot crust. Bake 12 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned. Let cool on wire racks before cutting into bars.
