Set oven rack about 6 to 8 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler; if broiler setting has Low setting, set broiler to that. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place salmon, skin side down, on the prepared baking sheet; rub salmon with olive oil. Season with seafood seasoning and black pepper. Arrange ginger slices atop salmon and sprinkle with garlic. Place lime slices over ginger-garlic layer. Broil salmon until hot and beginning to turn opaque, about 10 minutes; watch carefully. If broiler has a High setting, turn broiler to that setting and continue broiling until salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 10 more minutes.
