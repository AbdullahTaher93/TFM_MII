Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Season chops, if desired, with salt and pepper. Arrange 2 slices prosciutto on flat surface. Top with 3 sage leaves, then wrap around 1 chop; repeat with remaining chops. Heat Bertolli(R) Extra Light(TM) Tasting Olive Oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat and cook chops, turning once, 5 minutes or until prosciutto browns. Arrange chops in 9-inch baking dish and bake 10 minutes or until chops are desired doneness. Meanwhile, combine remaining ingredients in large serving bowl. Just before serving, drizzle with additional Bertolli(R) Extra Light(TM) Tasting Olive Oil.
