Thaw dough as directed on package; let rise at room temperature, covered with plastic wrap, until about double its thawed size, about 3 hours. Heat oven to 350 F. Grease 12-cup fluted tube pan. Set aside1/2 cup cinnamon chips. Working with 1 loaf at a time, use serrated knife to cut each loaf into 12 equal slices. Slightly flatten 1 slice; place 1 heaping teaspoon chips in center. Gather dough around chips and pinch to seal, forming a ball; set aside. Prepare remaining slices. Dip each ball in butter; coat with sugar. Place balls in prepared pan, staggering to fit, sprinkling reserved chips between layers as balls are placed in pan and on top. Bake 45 to 50 minutes or until golden brown. Cool 10 minutes. Remove from pan to serving plate. Serve warm or at room temperature.
