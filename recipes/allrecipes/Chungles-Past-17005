In a large skillet heat the olive oil over medium high heat. Add the garlic and onion and saute until translucent. Add the tomato, olives, pepperoni, mushrooms, capers and salt and pepper to taste and simmer until heated through. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Add warm sauce to pasta and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese; mix well and serve immediately.
