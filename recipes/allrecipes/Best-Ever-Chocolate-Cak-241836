Allow butter and eggs to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, lightly grease bottoms of two 9x1-1/2-inch round cake pans. Line bottoms of pans with waxed paper; grease and lightly flour pans. Set pans aside. In a medium bowl stir together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt; set aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl beat butter with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Gradually add sugar, 1/4 cup at a time, beating on medium speed until well combined. Scrape sides of bowl; beat for 2 minutes more. Add eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Alternately add flour mixture and milk to butter mixture, beating on low speed after each addition just until combined. Beat on medium to high speed for 20 seconds more. Spread in the prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted near centers comes out clean. Cool cake layers in pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Remove cake layers from pans. Peel off waxed paper. Cool thoroughly on wire racks. Frost with desired frosting. Chocolate-Sour Cream Frosting: In a large saucepan melt chocolate and butter over low heat until melted, stirring frequently. Cool for 5 minutes. Stir in sour cream. Gradually add powdered sugar, beating with a wooden spoon until smooth. (This frosts tops and sides of two 8- or 9-inch cake layers. Halve the recipe to frost a 13x9x2-inch cake.) Cover and store frosted cake in the refrigerator. Makes about 4 cups.
