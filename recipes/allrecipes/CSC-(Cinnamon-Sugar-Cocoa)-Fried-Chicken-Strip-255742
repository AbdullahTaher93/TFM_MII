Whisk egg, egg white, heavy cream, and garlic salt together in a small bowl. Combine flour, cocoa powder, and cinnamon sugar in a separate small bowl. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place half of the chicken into the egg mixture; let sit for 2 minutes. Remove chicken from egg mixture and place in the flour mixture, turning to coat all sides. Place the coated chicken pieces onto a paper towel. Repeat dipping the the remaining chicken in the egg mixture and the flour mixture. Gently place the first batch of coated chicken in the hot oil; fry until chicken is cooked through and floats to the top, about 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer cooked chicken to a plate lined with fresh paper towels. Repeat frying with the second batch of chicken. Let chicken rest for 5 minutes before eating.
