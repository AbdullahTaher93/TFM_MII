Trim tough stems from Brussels sprouts. With a knife, mark base of each Brussels sprout with a shallow "x." Remove about 25 large outer green leaves; set aside. In pot of boiling salted water, cook Brussels sprouts until just tender but still bright green, 6 to 8 minutes. Strain, and transfer to ice water to stop cooking. Blanch reserved leaves in pot of boiling water, until bright green, 1 to 2 minutes. Strain; transfer to bowl of ice water. Drain; reserve. Transfer sprouts to food processor. Heat cream and butter in saucepan over low heat until butter has melted. Add salt, pepper, and nutmeg; add to sprouts. Process until combined. Transfer to serving bowl. Arrange reserved leaves around edge of bowl.
