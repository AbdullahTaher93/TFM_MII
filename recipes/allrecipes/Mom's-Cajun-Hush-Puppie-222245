Mix flour, cornmeal, sugar, Parmesan cheese, baking powder, salt, black pepper, eggs, bell peppers, onions, cream-style corn, whole kernel corn, and pimento peppers in a large bowl. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Drop 6 to 8 tablespoon-sized balls of batter into the hot oil; fry until each hush puppy is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove hush puppies with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with any remaining batter.
