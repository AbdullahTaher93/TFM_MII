In a small saucepan, melt butter; add the mustard, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce and lemon pepper. Place each ear of corn on a 13-in. x 12-in. piece of heavy-duty foil. Drizzle with butter mixture. Fold in edges of foil and seal, leaving space for expansion of steam. Grill over medium coals for 15-20 minutes or until corn is tender. Carefully unwrap foil.
