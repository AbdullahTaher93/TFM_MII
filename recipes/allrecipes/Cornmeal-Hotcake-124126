In a mixing bowl, combine cornmeal, flour, baking soda, sugar and salt. In another bowl, beat buttermilk, oil and egg yolk; stir into dry ingredients. Beat egg white until stiff peaks form; fold into batter. Let stand 10 minutes. Pour batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto a lightly greased hot griddle; turn when bubbles form on top of pancakes. Cook until second side is golden brown.
