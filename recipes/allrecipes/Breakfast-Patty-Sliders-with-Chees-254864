Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a nonstick muffin pan with cooking spray. Remove biscuit dough from can. Separate 8 uncooked biscuits. Divide each biscuit into two even layers, horizontally. Place the bottom dough layers in the muffin pan; top each with cheese and a sausage patty. Place the top dough layers on top of each sausage patty. Bake for 18-20 minutes or until golden brown and the biscuit is fully baked.
