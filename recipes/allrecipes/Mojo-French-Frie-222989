Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Whisk flour, paprika, salt, black pepper, chili powder, and cayenne pepper in a bowl. Whisk egg with milk together in a separate bowl. Dip potato wedges in the egg mixture, then dredge in the seasoned flour. Arrange coated potato wedges on prepared baking sheet. Drizzle wedges with vegetable oil. Bake in the preheated oven until the coating is browned and the potatoes are tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve immediately.
