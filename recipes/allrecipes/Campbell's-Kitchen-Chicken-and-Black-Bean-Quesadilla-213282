Heat the oven to 425 degrees F. Heat the soup, salsa, beans and chicken in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Place the tortillas onto 2 baking sheets. Spread about 1/3 cup soup mixture onto half of each tortilla to within 1/2 inch of the edge. Brush the edges of the tortillas with water. Fold the tortillas over the filling and press the edges to seal. Bake for 5 minutes or until the filling is hot. Cut the quesadillas in half, making 20 pieces. Serve with the Fiesta Rice.
