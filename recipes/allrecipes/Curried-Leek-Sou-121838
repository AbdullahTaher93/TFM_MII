In a 3-qt. saucepan, saute leeks and garlic in butter over medium heat until tender. Add the broth, water, carrots, celery, bouillon, curry powder and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Cool slightly. Place 1 cup soup in a blender or food processor; cover and process until smooth. Return to pan. Add milk; heat through (do not boil).
