Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine eggs, bread crumbs, onion, garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add ground beef and the 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese; mix until combined. Form into 48 meatballs. Place meatballs in a 15x10x1-inch baking pan. Bake for 20 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers 160 degrees F. Drain meatballs on sheets of clean paper towels. Combine marinara sauce and the cooked meatballs in a 4- to 6-quart pan. Heat over medium heat until heated through, stirring occasionally. Spoon hot meatballs and sauce into buns. Top meatballs with any remaining sauce. Sprinkle the 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese over meatballs. Let stand for 2 minutes before serving. [Cleaning tip: Once the stove top is cool, wipe up any spills with Clorox(R) Disinfecting Wipes*.]
