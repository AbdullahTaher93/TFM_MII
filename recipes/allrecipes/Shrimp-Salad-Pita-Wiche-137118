Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spread almonds on ungreased cookie sheet; bake at 375 degrees F for 2 to 5 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from cookie sheet; cool. Separate dough into 5 biscuits. Press each into 4 1/2-inch round; place on same ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F for 8 to 11 minutes or until light golden brown. Remove from cookie sheet; place on wire rack. Cool 15 minutes. Meanwhile, reserve 2 tablespoons toasted almonds and 2 tablespoons onions for garnish. In large bowl, mix remaining toasted almonds, remaining onions and all remaining sandwich ingredients. With knife, cut along side of each cooled biscuit about halfway around; open gently to form pocket. Spoon rounded 3/4 cup shrimp mixture into each biscuit pocket. Sprinkle reserved almonds and onions over top. Serve each sandwich on lettuce leaf with mixed fruit on the side.
