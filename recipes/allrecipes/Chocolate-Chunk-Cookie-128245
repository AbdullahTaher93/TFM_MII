Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat two baking sheets with nonstick spray. In a large bowl, combine unbleached or all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, oats, baking soda, and salt. In another large bowl, combine sugar, brown sugar, butter or margarine, egg whites, milk, and vanilla extract. Add flour mixture and stir just until moistened. Stir in chocolate pieces. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls, 2 inches apart, on the prepared baking sheets. Bake 10 to 12 minutes, or until lightly browned around the edges. Remove cookies to racks to cool.
