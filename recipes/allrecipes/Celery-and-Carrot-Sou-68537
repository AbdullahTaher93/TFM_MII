Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute onions until tender, approximately 5 minutes. Slowly stir in carrots, celery, and tarragon, and continue cooking another 5 minutes, or until carrots are tender. Stir in vegetable broth and wine, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, and continue cooking 15 minutes longer. Serve hot.
