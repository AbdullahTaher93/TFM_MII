Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Wrap each chicken breast in one piece of bacon. Place the chicken breasts in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Mix the soup and milk and pour mixture over the chicken breasts. Cover dish with foil. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Remove foil for the last 15 minutes of baking, to brown the bacon.
