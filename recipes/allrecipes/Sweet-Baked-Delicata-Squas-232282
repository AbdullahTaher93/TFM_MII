Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously butter a baking dish. Spread squash slices into prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Stir brown sugar, honey, cinnamon, ginger, and salt together in a bowl; drizzle over the squash. Continue baking squash in oven until completely tender, 15 to 20 minutes more.
