Bring the orange juice to a boil in a small saucepan and reduce it to 1/3 cup, about 10 minutes. Transfer the orange juice to a small bowl. Whisk in the garlic, vinegar, oil, curry, and salt. Set aside. Using a serrated knife, cut the peel off the top and bottom of each orange. Set each on end and remove the outer skin and pith. Cut crosswise into 1/4 inch-thick rings. Place the onion and arugula in a medium salad bowl and top with the oranges. Toss with the vinaigrette, and serve.
