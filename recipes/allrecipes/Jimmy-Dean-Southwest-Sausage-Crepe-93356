Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In large mixing bowl, combine cooked sausage, shredded cheese, cream cheese, onions and chilies; mix well. Spread about 3 tablespoons of filling along the right side of each shell; roll shell over filling to form a log. (To make triangle-shaped crepes, spread filling over one quadrant of each crepe; fold in half, then fold in half again). Place filled crepes on a lightly greased cookie sheet and bake 12-15 minutes, until heated through. Topping: melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat; stir in sour cream and heat until warm. Drizzle 1 tablespoon over each baked crepe and top with your favorite salsa or chopped tomatoes and cilantro.
