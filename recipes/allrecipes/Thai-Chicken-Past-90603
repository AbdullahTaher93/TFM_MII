Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the chicken and cook for 30 seconds. Add the pasta and cook 2 minutes, stirring once. Drain. Place in a large bowl. Add onions and water chestnuts and toss. To make dressing, whisk Spicy Ginger Sauce, orange juice, peanut butter and soy in a small bowl until smooth. Pour over pasta and toss. If not using immediately, reserve some of the dressing to stir in before serving. The pasta absorbs the dressing as it sits. Sprinkle with peanuts.
