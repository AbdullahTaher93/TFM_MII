Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and chop. Place potatoes and onions in a 9x13 inch casserole dish. In a medium saucepan combine soup, milk, sour cream and processed cheese; heat until cheese is melted. Pour over potatoes. Dot with butter and covered with shredded cheese. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour.
