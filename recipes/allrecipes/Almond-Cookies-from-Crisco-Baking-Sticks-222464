Beat shortening and sugar in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in egg and almond extract until well blended. Combine flour, baking powder and salt in medium bowl. Gradually add to shortening mixture, beating until well blended. Shape dough into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap; chill 2 hours. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Roll tablespoonfuls of dough into 1-inch balls. Place on ungreased baking sheets, about 2 inches apart; flatten slightly with fingertips. Gently press an almond into center of each. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until cookies are just set but not brown. Cool 5 minutes. Remove to wire rack to cool completely.
