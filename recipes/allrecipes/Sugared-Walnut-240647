Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Beat egg white and water together in a bowl using an electric mixer until frothy. Add walnuts to egg white mixture and stir until coated. Mix sugar, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl; add to walnuts and stir until coated. Spread coated walnuts onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 15 minutes, until walnuts are fragrant and crisp, about 1 hour.
