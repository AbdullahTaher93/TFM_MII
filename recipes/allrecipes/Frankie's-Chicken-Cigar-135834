Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. In the bottom of a large bowl, combine the cloves, cumin, chili powder, poultry seasoning, paprika and grill seasoning. Add the chicken, shallot, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce and parsley, and stir to combine. On a nonstick baking sheet, brush a sheet of phyllo with half of the melted butter and top with a second phyllo sheet. Form one-quarter of the chicken mixture into a log the length of the pastry. Roll the log tightly in the phyllo. Repeat with remaining chicken mixture and phyllo. Cut each log into 3 "cigars," for a total of 12, and brush with the rest of the butter. Bake the cigars until evenly golden and firm, 15 to 20 minutes.
