Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray cookie sheets with cooking spray. In large bowl, break up cookie dough and almond paste; knead mixture until well combined. Stir in crushed granola bars, coconut and almond extract. Shape mixture into 1 1/4-inch balls; roll in sugar. On cookie sheets, place balls 2 inches apart. Bake 12 to 14 minutes or until edges are light golden brown. Cool 1 minute; remove from cookie sheets to cooling racks.
