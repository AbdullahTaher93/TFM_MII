In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in egg and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with milk. Pour into a greased 8-in. square baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Meanwhile, combine topping ingredients. Spread over warm cake. Broil 3-5 in. from the heat for 3-5 minutes or until golden brown.
