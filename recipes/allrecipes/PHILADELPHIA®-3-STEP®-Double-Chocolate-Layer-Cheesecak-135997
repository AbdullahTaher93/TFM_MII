Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Beat cream cheese, sugar and vanilla in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating on low speed after each addition just until blended. Remove 1 cup of the batter to small bowl; stir in melted chocolate. Pour into crust; top with remaining plain batter. Refrigerate 3 hours or overnight. Top with whipped topping and strawberries just before serving. Store leftover cheesecake in refrigerator. Bake 40 minutes or until center is almost set. Cool.
