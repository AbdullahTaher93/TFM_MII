In a large bowl, combine chicken, tomatoes, spinach, pesto, and vinegar. Toss to mix; season to taste with salt. Set aside. Divide bread dough into 4 equal pieces. On a lightly floured board, roll each piece out to a 7- to 8-inch round. Place dough rounds on 2 oiled, cornmeal-dusted 12- by 15-inch baking sheets. Bake in a 500 degrees F oven until dough looks dry and is covered with large brown spots (6 to 8 minutes); switch positions of baking sheets halfway through baking time. Sprinkle crusts equally with cheese and continue to bake until cheese is melted (about 2 more minutes). Place one crust on each of 4 individual plates; top equally with chicken mixture.
