Toast walnuts in a dry skillet over medium heat, shaking occasionally, until fragrant and a shade darker, 2 to 4 minutes. Chop coarsely. Place radishes in a serving bowl. Whisk oil, lemon juice, salt, and honey in a small bowl until combined; drizzle over radish slices and toss to coat. Stack mint leaves, roll tightly, and slice crosswise into thin ribbons. Fold mint and walnuts into salad.
