Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place zucchini directly on oven rack near the bottom. Cook until slightly softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Place bacon slices on paper towels. Heat in microwave on High until cooked but not crisp, about 3 minutes. Place a layer of bacon on each zucchini slice; top with a slice of fontina cheese. Tightly roll each layered zucchini strip and secure with a toothpick or skewer. Place on baking sheet. Bake zucchini rolls in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.
