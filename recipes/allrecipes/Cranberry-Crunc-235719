Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix apples, cranberries, 1 cup pecans, 1 cup sugar, and 1/2 cup butter together in a bowl; divide between two 8x8-inch baking dishes. Stir 1 cup pecans, oats, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup butter together in a bowl; sprinkle over each cranberry mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and topping is lightly browned, 30 to 40 minutes.
