Combine cranberries, cherries, pears, vinegar, sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon in a large heavy saucepan and bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring often to prevent sticking. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the fruit is tender and the relish has thickened, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool.
