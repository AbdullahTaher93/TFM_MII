Combine Caesar dressing and Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Place wings in a large resealable plastic bag; pour in dressing-cheese marinade. Seal bag; toss to coat and refrigerate at least 4 hours. Preheat grill for medium heat (300 to 350 degrees F, 150 to 175 degrees C), and lightly oil the grate. Remove wings from bag; discard marinade. Heavily sprinkle all sides of wings with lemon pepper. Place wings on grill. Cook, covered, turning several times, until cooked through and internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F (75 degrees C); 20 to 30 minutes. Transfer wings to a platter.
