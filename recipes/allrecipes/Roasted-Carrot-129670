Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Cut carrots into 1-1/4-inch-thick slices. (If carrots are thick, cut lengthwise in half before slicing for more even roasting.) Place in foil-lined shallow baking pan. Toss with 2 Tbsp. of the dressing; cover with foil. Bake 20 min. Remove foil; stir. Bake an additional 20 to 25 min. or until carrots are crisp-tender, stirring occasionally. Toss with the remaining 1/4 cup dressing just before serving.
