Mix together the milk, thyme, marjoram, salt, seasoned salt, and Worcestershire sauce in a bowl. Stir in the flour gradually until the mixture reaches a thick, batter-like consistency. Refrigerate 1 to 2 hours. Preheat the oil in a large pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Completely coat each piece of beef in the batter and gently place into the hot oil. Lie them into the oil individually to keep them from sticking together. Cook in small batches of 4 to 8 pieces until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Allow the oil to return to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) between batches.
