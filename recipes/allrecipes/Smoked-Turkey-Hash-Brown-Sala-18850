Cover potatoes with water in a large saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil and cook for 2 to 4 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. Drain thoroughly and let cool. In a large bowl, combine cooled potatoes with turkey, celery, green onion, bell pepper, mayonnaise, yogurt, mustard and ground black pepper. Mix thoroughly, cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.
