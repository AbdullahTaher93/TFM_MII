Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Place pear halves, cut side down, on cutting board. Starting about 1/2-inch from stem end, make 7 lengthwise cuts in each half, cutting to the bottom but leaving pears slices attached at the stem end. Arrange pear halves, cut side down, in an 11 x 7-inch baking dish. In small saucepan, combine sugar, water, apple pie spice and vanilla. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved. Pour sugar mixture over pears. Bake covered, 40 to 45 minutes or until pears are tender, basting occasionally with sauce. Spread two tablespoons creme fraiche onto one side of each of 6 dessert plates; spoon one tablespoon sauce from pears on the other side. With slotted spoon, place pear half in center of each plate; garnish with almonds, if desired. Serve immediately.
