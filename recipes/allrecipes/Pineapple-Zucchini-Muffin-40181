Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour 4 muffin pans, or use paper liners. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Make a well in the center, and pour in the oil, eggs, zucchini, pineapple and vanilla. Mix until smooth. Fill muffin cups 2/3 to 3/4 full. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
