Melt the butter in a pot over low heat. Stir the oysters and onion into the melted butter, increase heat to medium-low, and cook and stir until the edges of the oysters begin to curl, 7 to 10 minutes. Slowly stream the cream into the oyster mixture as you stir. Bring the mixture to a simmer, but do not boil; cook at a simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper to serve.
