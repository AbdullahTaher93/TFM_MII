In medium bowl, stir together corn syrup and peanut butter. Add cereal and stir until well coated. Press mixture firmly and evenly into buttered 3.5 L (13 x 9-inch) pan. Place in freezer until firm, about 15 minutes. Cut cereal mixture in half crosswise. Spread one half with softened ice cream or frozen yogurt and top with second half to make one very large sandwich. Freeze until firm, about 2 hours. Cut large sandwich into 5 cm (2-inch) portions. Wrap individually in foil or freezer wrap and store in freezer until needed.
