Season eggs with salt and pepper in a bowl; whisk until combined. Heat an 8-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add butter to skillet; heat until hot but not smoking. Add eggs. Cook, gently tilting skillet occasionally and pulling cooked egg away from sides with a fork to let raw egg flow underneath, until omelet is no longer runny. Sprinkle herbs on top. Run a rubber spatula along one side of omelet; gently fold over one-third. Repeat on opposite side so that the two sides overlap in the middle.
