Cut each tenderloin into 12 slices; sprinkle with salt. In a large nonstick skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, brown pork in batches in butter over medium heat for 3-4 minutes on each side. Return all pork to the skillet. Combine the remaining ingredients; pour over pork. Cook and stir over low heat for 2-3 minutes or until sauce is thickened.
