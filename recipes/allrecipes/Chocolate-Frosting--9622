In a large bowl, cream the butter. Add in cocoa, salt and boiling water, stirring until smooth. Add powdered sugar and beat until frosting reaches a spreadable consistency. If frosting seems too thick, add water. If it seems too thin, add powdered sugar. Spread on cooled cookies, such as Frosted Chocolate Walnut Goodies.
