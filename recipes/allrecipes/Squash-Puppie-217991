In a bowl, mix the egg, cornmeal mix, squash, onion, onion powder, salt, and black pepper until thoroughly combined (mixture may seem a little dry). Heat the peanut oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, and drop the squash mixture by large spoonfuls into the hot oil to form patties. Cook until brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
