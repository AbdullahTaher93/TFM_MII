Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix bread crumbs, egg, evaporated milk, salad dressing, onion, mustard, salt, and black pepper in a large mixing bowl; add corned beef, sauerkraut, and ground chuck and mix well. Spread about half the meat mixture into the pie shell and top with about half the Swiss cheese; repeat layers. Put pie crust on a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until the crust is browned and the cheese is bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes.
