Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat; add garlic and shallots. Cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes or until shallots are translucent. Stir in rice and chicken broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer covered for 20-22 minutes (stirring occasionally) or until rice is tender but still firm to the bite. Remove from heat; stir in cheese and butter. Combine apricots, water, SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend for Baking, and lemon juice in a small saucepan; bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in the butter and cook uncovered for 5 minutes or until apricots are softened and the juices begin to brown. Divide risotto among 8 shallow serving bowls; top evenly with apricots and walnuts. Garnish with basil and cheese.
