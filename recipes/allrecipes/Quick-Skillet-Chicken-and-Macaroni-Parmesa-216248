Heat the sauce, Parmesan cheese, chicken and macaroni in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10 minutes or until the mixture is hot and bubbling, stirring occasionally. Sprinkle with the mozzarella cheese. Let stand for 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted.
