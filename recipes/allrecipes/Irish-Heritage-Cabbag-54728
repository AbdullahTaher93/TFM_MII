Preheat your oven's broiler. Place cabbage into a large pot. Add water and bring to a boil. Simmer over low heat until tender, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, cook bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat until crisp. Drain and set aside. Drain cabbage, and drizzle with melted butter. Sprinkle with bacon and nutmeg. Transfer to a baking dish. Place under your oven's broiler until the top layer is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Serve with salt, pepper and vinegar as desired.
