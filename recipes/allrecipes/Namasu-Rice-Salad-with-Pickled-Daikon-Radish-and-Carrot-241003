Whisk rice vinegar, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a bowl; add carrots and radish and stir until well-coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend, at least 1 hour. Drain. Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Spread rice out on a baking sheet and cool to room temperature. Whisk vegetable oil, lime juice, ginger, sesame oil, garlic, chile paste, and remaining salt together in a large bowl. Add rice, drained carrot mixture, cilantro, peanuts, and green onions to the bowl; stir until salad is well-coated. Serve warm or cold.
