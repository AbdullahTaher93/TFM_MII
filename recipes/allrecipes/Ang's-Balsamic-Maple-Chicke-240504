Whisk maple syrup, balsamic vinegar, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, white pepper, nutmeg, and chipotle pepper together in a small bowl until rub is smooth. Coat chicken on all sides with rub. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken in hot oil until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 5 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
