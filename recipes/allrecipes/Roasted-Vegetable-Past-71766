Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. In large bowl, combine sweet potato, carrots, parsnip, onion, oil, rosemary, salt and pepper. Toss well; transfer to large baking pan. Bake 15 minutes; stir. Continue to bake 12 to 15 minutes or until vegetables are browned and tender. Meanwhile, in medium saucepan, bring 2 cups water and margarine to a boil. Slowly stir in pasta; reduce heat to medium.

Stir in roasted vegetables. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
