Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch springform baking pan. Blend gluten-free flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and xanthan gum together in a small bowl. Beat egg yolks and sugar together in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until yolks are fluffy and lemon colored, about 3 minutes. Stir flour mixture and blueberries into the egg yolks; mix batter until combined. Whisk egg whites in a bowl until stiff but not dry. Fold egg whites into the batter; blend until egg whites are absorbed. Pour the batter into the springform pan. Bake in preheated oven until cake springs back when touched in the middle with a fork, 45 to 50 minutes.
