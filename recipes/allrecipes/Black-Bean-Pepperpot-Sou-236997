Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir beef stock, water, black beans, sweet potato, carrot, salsa, onion, bell pepper, jalapeno pepper, taco seasoning, salt, browning sauce, adobo seasoning, and bay leaves together with the beef in the pot; bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.
