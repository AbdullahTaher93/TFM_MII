In a bowl combine the pork, curing salt, black pepper, fennel seeds, garlic, sugar and cayenne pepper. Mix to make sure seasonings are well distributed throughout the pork. Freeze for 30 minutes. To prepare the forcemeat, pass the mixture through a meat grinder using the large hole plate. Transfer to an electric mixer, using the paddle on the lowest speed, and mix for 1 minute. Increase the speed to medium and slowly add the stock and mix for 2 minutes. Switch to high speed and mix for 30 seconds. To form the sausages, place about a cup of forcemeat in a 12 by 16-inch piece of plastic wrap. Shape into a 1 1/2 by 8-inch sausage and wrap with the plastic to a tight roll. Tie both ends by forming a knot. Wrap again in aluminum foil. Repeat the process until all forcemeat is used. In a large saute pan bring court bouillon to a simmer. Poach the prepared sausages for 10 minutes or until firm to the touch. Allow to cool and unwrap sausages. In a cast iron pan, over high heat, saute the sausages in olive oil until nicely browned. Slice and serve with honey mustard and minced onion.
