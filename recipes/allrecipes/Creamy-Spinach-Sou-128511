Bring the water to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add the peas. Cook, covered, for 1 minute. Stir in the broth, spinach, nutmeg, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes. Working in batches, puree the mixture in a blender or food processor. Return to the pan. Add the milk and sour cream and cook for 3 minutes, or until heated through.
