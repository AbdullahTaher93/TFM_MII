Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix together the flour and baking powder; set aside. In a large bowl, beat the butter until creamy. Blend in the egg yolks, one at a time. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk. The dough will be stiff like a cookie dough. Divide the dough into 10 pieces and shape into balls. Roll each ball into a 9-inch circle. Place on cookie sheets and prick with a fork in several places. Bake cookies in batches in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until edges are just starting to brown. Let cool. In a saucepan, boil the unopened cans of sweetened condensed milk for 3 hours. Monitor the water closely to make sure there is always water covering the cans. Remove cans from heat and let cool for 10 to 15 minutes. In a small measuring cup, combine the brandy and water. Place one cookie layer on serving plate. Brush with brandy mixture, then spread with the now-thickened condensed milk. Sprinkle with nuts. Continue stacking until all layers are used.
