Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Slice each roll almost all the way through, but keeping the top attached. Arrange rolls on prepared baking sheet. Stir honey mustard dressing into melted butter until well blended. Brush butter mixture inside each roll using a pastry brush, making sure to get the top and bottom. Place a layer of Swiss cheese and ham into each roll. Close each roll and brush the top with butter mixture. Sprinkle the top of each roll with sesame seeds. Bake rolls in the preheated oven until cheese has melted, 5 to 6 minutes.
