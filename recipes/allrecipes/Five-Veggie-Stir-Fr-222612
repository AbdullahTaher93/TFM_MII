Bring rice and beef broth to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Combine cornstarch and ginger in a small bowl. Stir in orange juice, soy sauce, beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic until blended. Heat 3 teaspoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower until just tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon oil, mushrooms, snow peas, and tofu; continue cooking until mushrooms soften, about 3 minutes. Push vegetable mixture to one side of skillet and cook and stir egg in remaining space until set; combine egg with vegetables. Stir in orange juice mixture and boil until thickened, about 2 minutes. Serve over rice and top with slivered almonds.
