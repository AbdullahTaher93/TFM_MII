In a bowl, combine salmon, egg white, mustard, bread crumbs, flour, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, and all but 1 teaspoon scallions. Season with salt and pepper. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Shape salmon mixture into two patties. Coat skillet lightly with cooking spray. Cook patties, turning once, 3 minutes per side or until golden brown and cooked through. Stir mayonnaise, remaining lemon juice, and scallions together.
