Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Stir 1/2 cup soup, the chicken and 1/2 cup cheese in a medium bowl. Spoon about 1/4 cup chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Roll up the tortillas around the filling and place seam-side down into an 11x8x2-inch baking dish. Pour the remaining soup over the tortillas. Cover the baking dish. Bake for 25 minutes or until the enchiladas are hot and bubbling. Top with the remaining cheese. Sprinkle with the cilantro, if desired.
