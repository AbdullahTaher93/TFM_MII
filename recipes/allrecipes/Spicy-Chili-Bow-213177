Preparation for Bread Bowl & Paddles: Carve out center core of bread within 1-inch of bottom and sides keeping bread intact. Cut reserved bread horizontally into 1/2-inch layers. Brush both sides of layers with olive oil. Cut layers into about 18 'paddles' that measure about 3x1 1/2x1/2-inches. Place paddles on foil-lined baking sheet; sprinkle with cheese. Brush inside of bowl lightly with olive oil. Place bowl on separate baking sheet. Bake bowl and paddles in a preheated 350 degrees F oven for 11-13 minutes, until golden brown and cheese is bubbling. Preparation for Spicy Chili: Heat oil over medium heat in 3 qt. saucepan. Add sausage and brown. Add next 4 ingredients, cook until hot. Pour into prepared bread bowl. Garnish with onions and cheese. Place paddles around bowl. Serve immediately.
