Melt butter in oil in a wide frying pan over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, cut steak into 4 equal portions and sprinkle generously with pepper. Add to hot pan and cook, turning once, until browned on both sides and done to your liking; cut to test (6 to 8 minutes for rare to medium-rare). Add shallots to pan around steak after you turn pieces. Transfer steak to a warm platter and keep warm. To pan, add mustard and wine, stirring well to blend in pan drippings. Cook, stirring, until most of the liquid is gone (1 to 2 minutes). Spoon shallot mixture over steaks, then season to taste with salt. Garnish with parsley.
