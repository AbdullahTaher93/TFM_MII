Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, baking powder and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs and melted butter. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until combined; set aside. Heat a large, heavy skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Add the sausage patties and cook, turning once, until lightly browned and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet, cover and keep warm in the oven. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the skillet over medium-high heat. Add the apples, sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon brown sugar and cook until golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to the baking sheet, cover loosely and keep warm in the oven. Working in batches, drop a scant 1/4 cup batter for each pancake into the skillet and cook over medium-high heat, without disturbing, until small bubbles appear on the surface, about 2 minutes. Turn and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 minute. Serve the pancakes, sausage patties and sauteed apples with the maple syrup.
