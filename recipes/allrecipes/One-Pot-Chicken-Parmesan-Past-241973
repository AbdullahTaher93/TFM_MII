Coat chicken cubes in 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning. Heat olive oil in a medium skillet over medium/high heat. Cook chicken in skillet, turning occasionally, until cooked through (no longer pink inside) about 5 minutes. Pour water and Ragu(R) sauce into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add pasta and simmer until pasta is tender, about 15 minutes. Stir frequently to prevent pasta from sticking to bottom. Add the remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and stir in chicken. Serve immediately. Enjoy!
