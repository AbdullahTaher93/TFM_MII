Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Heat butter in a large wide saucepan over medium heat. Add pancetta; cook 7 minutes stirring frequently until crisp. Drain all but 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of fat from the pan. Add wine to the pan, if using; stir until wine is nearly evaporated. Turn heat to low. Add pasta to boiling water; cook according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk cream with eggs, Parmesan, cornstarch, salt and pepper. Drain pasta; add to the pan with the pancetta. Increase heat to medium. Add cream mixture; stir 2 to 3 minutes until sauce thickens and pasta is coated in sauce. Stir in parsley. Serve immediately with Parmesan.
