In a medium saucepan, combine the milk, vanilla, and butter. Heat over medium heat until the mixture just simmers. Remove from the heat and stir in the bittersweet and milk chocolates and chocolate liqueur until completely melted and smooth. Serve over a heat source that will keep the fondue warm, but not hot.
