Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare and bake cake mix as package directs for two 9-inch round layers. Remove from pans; cool thoroughly. In heavy saucepan, over medium heat, melt chocolate chips with sweetened condensed milk. Cook and stir until slightly thickened, about 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon milk. Cool 10 minutes. Combine cherry filling and almond extract. Place 1 cake layer on serving plate, top side up. With sharp knife, remove crust from top of cake layer to within 1/2 inch of edge; top with half the chocolate mixture, then the cherries. Top with second cake layer and remaining chocolate mixture. Garnish as desired. Store leftovers covered in refrigerator.
