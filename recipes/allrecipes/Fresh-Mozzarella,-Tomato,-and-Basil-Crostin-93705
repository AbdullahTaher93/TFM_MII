Preheat the broiler. Cut off the end crusts of the bread and reserve for bread crumbs. Cut the loaf into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Cut the larger slices in half to make pieces that are approximately 2 inches square. Place on a large baking sheet. Broil 6 inches from the heat source for about 2 minutes, just to dry. Remove from the broiler. Turn pieces over. Spray lightly with olive oil from a mister or coat lightly with a pastry brush dipped in oil. Return to the broiler and cook for about 1 minute, or until the oil is sizzling. Remove. Rub each crostini with a cut side of garlic. Remove the mozzarella from the whey. Pat dry. Cut into thin slices. Cut the tomatoes into thin slices. Pick off and reserve several pretty basil sprigs for garnish. Pinch 36 leaves from the stems. On each crostini, place a slice of mozzarella, a basil leaf, and a tomato slice. Season with salt and ground black pepper. Drizzle a drop of oil on each tomato. Garnish the platter with the reserved basil sprigs. Serve right away.
