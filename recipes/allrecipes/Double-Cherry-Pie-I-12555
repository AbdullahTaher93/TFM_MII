Combine frozen cherries, dried cherries, white sugar, tapioca, and almond extract in a large mixing bowl; mix well. ( It is not necessary to thaw cherries before using. ) Let cherry mixture stand 15 minutes. Line a 9 inch pie pan with pastry. Fill with cherry mixture. Sprinkle with nutmeg. Dot with butter or margarine. Adjust top crust, cutting slits for steam to escape. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) about 1 hour, or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly. If necessary, cover edge of crust with aluminum foil to prevent overbrowning.
