Lightly mix together avocados, green onion, cilantro, tomatoes, corn, and black-eyed peas in a salad bowl until well combined. Whisk together red wine vinegar, olive oil, cumin, and minced garlic in a bowl, and pour over the salad. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and lightly toss the salad again. Chill for 1 hour before serving, to blend the flavors.
