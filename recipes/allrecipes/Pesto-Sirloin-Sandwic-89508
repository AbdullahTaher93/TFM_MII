Rub the steaks with half the basil pesto, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Mix the rest of the pesto with the softened butter and lemon juice. Spread the pesto butter on the inside of the rolls. Grill the steaks the way you like them, toasting the rolls on the grill. Serve with just the bun, or add lettuce, tomato and sweet red onion.
