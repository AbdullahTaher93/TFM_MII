Cook pasta according to the directions on the package. Drain and set aside. Meanwhile, lightly spray a 2-quart casserole with no-stick spray and set aside. Press the cottage cheese through a strainer or sieve into a large bowl. Add yogurt and stir until well combined. Set yogurt mixture aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly spray a medium saucepan with no-stick spray. Add onions and cook, stirring, over medium heat about 3 minutes or until tender. In a small cup, stir together 2 tablespoons of the skim milk and the cornstarch until smooth. Stir the remaining skim milk, evaporated milk, and cornstarch mixture into the onions. Cook, stirring, over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Then stir in the dry mustard, Worcestershire sauce, red pepper, and hot-pepper sauce. Cook and stir for 1 minute more. Stir in the cheddar cheese and cook until melted. Slowly stir the cheese mixture into the yogurt mixture. Fold in the pasta. Transfer to the prepared casserole. Sprinkle the bread crumbs on top. Bake about 15 minutes or until bubbly.
