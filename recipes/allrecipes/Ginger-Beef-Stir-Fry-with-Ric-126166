Cut beef in half lengthwise and then cut crosswise into thin slices; set aside. In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, cornstarch and ginger. Stir until cornstarch dissolves; set aside. Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Working in 3 batches, add one tablespoon of canola oil, coating bottom evenly. Add one-third of beef slices and cook 1 minute, until browned, stirring constantly. Remove from skillet and set aside. Repeat with remaining 2 batches. Return skillet to medium-high heat; add remaining 1 tablespoon canola oil. When hot, add carrots, onion, bell pepper, mushrooms and garlic, and stir-fry 3 minutes or until tender-crisp. Add soy mixture, beef, snap peas and pepper flakes, if desired, to vegetables in skillet. Cook 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, or until sauce thickens. Serve over hot rice.
