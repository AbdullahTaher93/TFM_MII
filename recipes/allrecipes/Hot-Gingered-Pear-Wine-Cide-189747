In a 1 1/2- to 2-quart pan over medium-high heat, mix pear nectar, sugar, ginger, lemon juice, and wine. Cook, uncovered, until hot, about 7 minutes. (Or heat in a 1 1/2- to 2-quart microwave-safe container in a microwave oven at full (100%) power until hot, about 7 minutes.) Pour cider into mugs or heat-proof glasses, and garnish each with a lemon slice.
