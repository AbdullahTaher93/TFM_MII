Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Unroll crescent roll dough into 2 large rectangles. Firmly press perforations to seal. Spread each rectangle with pesto. Leave 1/4 inch at each edge. Sprinkle with RED GOLD(R) or REDPACK(R) DICED TOMATOES with BASIL, GARLIC & OREGANO. Start at longest side, roll up and pinch edges to seal. Cut each roll into 8 slices. Place cut side down on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for 12 to 17 minutes or until nicely browned. Remove from cookie sheet and serve warm.
