In a large nonstick skillet, brown pork chops on both sides in oil. Remove and keep warm. In the same pan, combine the brown sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, molasses and orange peel until blended. Return meat to pan; cover and simmer for 15 minutes or until tender. Remove chops and keep warm. Combine cornstarch and water until smooth; stir into pan juices. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Add orange segments; cook for 1 minute. Serve over pork and rice.
