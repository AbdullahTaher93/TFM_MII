In a large saucepan, reduce 4 cups heavy cream at a gentle simmer until it is half its original volume. Meanwhile, in a smaller pot, combine clam juice, wine, garlic, peppercorns, salt, 2 tablespoons dill, and vinegar. Reduce at a rolling boil to half its original volume. Strain, and dispose of garlic and peppercorns. Add wine reduction to reduced cream. Reserve. With an electric mixer, whip 1 cup cream to medium peaks. Add sour cream, and whip until blended. In boiling, lightly salted water, cook pasta until al dente. Drain, and cool by running cold water through it to halt cooking. In a 10 to 12 inch saute pan, heat cream/wine sauce to boil, then whisk in parmesan until well blended. Sauce will continue to reduce quickly. Add cooked pasta to sauce, and toss to coat evenly. Divide between 4 dishes, topping each with 2 ounces smoked salmon, a dollop whipped sour cream mixture, and a sprig of dill.
