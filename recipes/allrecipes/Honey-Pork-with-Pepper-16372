In a large skillet over medium heat, saute the pork chunks in the oil for about 15 minutes, or until browned on all sides. Add the gravy mix, water, honey, soy sauce, vinegar, ginger and garlic powder. Mix well, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 15 minutes, or until sauce has thickened and pork is near done. Add the onion, green bell pepper and red bell pepper and simmer for 15 more minutes or until all vegetables are tender.
