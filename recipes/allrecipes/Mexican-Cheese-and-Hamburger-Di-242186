Cook and stir hamburger and onion together in a skillet over medium heat until the hamburger is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle taco seasoning over the hamburger mixture. Pour water over the hamburger mixture; bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Put cheese cubes into the crock of your slow cooker; add the hamburger mixture, green chiles, tomato sauce, and jalapeno peppers. Cook on Low, stirring occasionally, until the cheese is melted and smooth, about 45 minutes.
