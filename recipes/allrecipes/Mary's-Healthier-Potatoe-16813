Place potatoes in a large pot. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Cook until tender, then drain. When potatoes are cool enough to handle, shred them. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8 inch baking dish. In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine potatoes, sour cream, cottage cheese, onion, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper. Transfer the mixture to the greased baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 minutes.
