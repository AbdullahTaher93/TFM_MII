Heat the olive oil in a large enameled cast-iron casserole. Working in 3 batches, add the pork, season with salt and pepper and cook over moderately high heat until browned all over, about 9 minutes. Transfer the pork to a bowl. Add the onion and two-thirds of the minced garlic to the casserole and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the orange juice and simmer until reduced by half. Add the water and bay leaf and bring to a simmer. Return the pork to the casserole along with any accumulated juices and bring to a simmer. In a mortar, grind the toasted cumin seeds to a powder and stir into the stew. Simmer over low heat until the pork is tender, about 30 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pork to a bowl. Add the chickpeas to the stew and cook over moderate heat for 10 minutes. Return the pork to the stew. Stir in the zest, the remaining minced garlic and the parsley and simmer for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper. Discard the bay leaf and serve.
