Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange flounder in a medium baking dish. Dot with butter, season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with lemon juice. Top with tomato, basil, and garlic powder. Cover, and bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fish is easily flaked with a fork.
