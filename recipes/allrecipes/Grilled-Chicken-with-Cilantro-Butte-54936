Mash garlic, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper with flat side of large knife into a paste; add lime peel. Rinse chicken with cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Loosen skin by slipping your hand between meat and skin. Rub one-quarter of garlic mixture between skin and each breast half, spreading evenly; tuck in 2 cilantro sprigs. Sprinkle chicken with remaining 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper. Wash hands. In small bowl, combine butter, chopped cilantro, oil, and lime juice. Brush some lightly on chicken. Preheat grill. Place chicken, skin-side down, on grill; brush with cilantro butter. Cover and grill 15 minutes. Turn chicken, brush with half of remaining cilantro butter, cover and grill 10 minutes. Brush chicken with remaining cilantro butter, cover and grill 5 minutes or until juices run clear when thickest part of chicken is pierced or temperature on instant-read thermometer reaches 170 degrees F. (Refrigerate leftovers.)
