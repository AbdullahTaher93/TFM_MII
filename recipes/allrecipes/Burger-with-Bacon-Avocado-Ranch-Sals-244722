In a small bowl, add the bacon, tomato, and Hidden Valley(R)Original Ranch(R)Avocado Dressing, and mix well to create a salsa. Shape the beef into 4 burgers. Grill the burgers and onion slices for about 5 to 7 minutes on each side or until an internal temperature of 160 degrees F has been reached. Toast the rolls. Place a burger in each roll. Top each burger with 2 tablespoons of the salsa and grilled onions to taste, and serve.
