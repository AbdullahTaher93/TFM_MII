Adjust oven rack to bottom position. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a large roasting pan with olive oil. Toss potatoes, rutabaga, carrots, red onion, and white onion in a large mixing bowl. Add 1/4 cup olive oil and toss to evenly coat vegetables. Mix in lemon juice and garlic. Add Italian seasoning, lemon pepper, and sea salt; toss to thoroughly distribute ingredients. Transfer vegetable mixture to the prepared roasting pan. Roast in preheated oven until rutabaga is easily pierced with a fork and bright yellow or orange, about 45 minutes.
