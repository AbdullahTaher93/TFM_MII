To prepare shortcakes: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Whisk cake flour, white whole-wheat (or whole-wheat pastry) flour, sugar and baking powder in a large bowl. Cut in butter using two knives or a pastry cutter until the pieces are about the size of peas. Cut in cream cheese until it's the size of peas. Drizzle oil over the mixture; stir with a fork until just combined (the mixture will be crumbly). Make a well in the center and add egg and buttermilk. Gradually stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients with a fork until the mixture is evenly moist. Knead the mixture in the bowl two or three times until it holds together. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Dust with flour and roll into an 8-by-10-inch rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Cut the edges square using a butter knife. Cut the dough into 12 equal shortcakes. Transfer to a baking sheet. Bake the shortcakes until puffed and lightly golden, about 20 minutes. Let cool slightly. To prepare filling: Meanwhile, toss strawberries with sugar in a medium bowl. Whisk whipping cream in a medium bowl until it's thick and holds its shape, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in sour cream until combined. To serve, split shortcakes horizontally. Spoon berries and juice onto the bottoms, top with the cream mixture and replace the shortcake tops.
