OR roll dough on a floured counter to 12-inch circle; place in greased pizza pan or baking sheet. Pull or cut each stick of string cheese into 2 pieces lengthwise. Lay each piece around the outer edge of the pizza dough. Bringing edge of dough over cheese, pressing to encase the cheese in the dough. Spread with pizza sauce.
