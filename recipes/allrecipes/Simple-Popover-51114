Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Generously grease 6-cup popover pan or six 6-ounce custard cups. Beat eggs slightly in medium bowl. Beat in remaining ingredients just until smooth (do not overbeat). Fill cups about 1/2 full. Bake 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Bake about 20 minutes longer or until deep golden brown. Immediately remove from cups. Serve hot.
