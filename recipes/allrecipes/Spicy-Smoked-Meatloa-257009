Preheat smoker to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions. Grease a loaf pan with cooking spray. Combine ground beef, diced tomatoes, eggs, onion, panko bread crumbs, seasoned salt, 2 teaspoons pepper, hot banana peppers, pink salt, onion salt, garlic salt, paprika, and liquid smoke flavoring in a large bowl. Mix well with your hands. Pack it into the prepared loaf pan, doming the top. Smoke meatloaf for 2 hours, adding wood chips to the drip tray according to manufacturer's instructions. Whisk ketchup, chile sauce, sugar, 1 tablespoon pepper, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt, red chile pepper, and red pepper flakes together to make sauce. Drain excess grease from meatloaf; spread sauce on top. Return to smoker for 30 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
