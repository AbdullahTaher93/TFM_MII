On a floured surface, roll dough into an 18-in. x 6-in. rectangle; brush with butter. In a bowl, combine the brown sugar, walnuts and cinnamon; sprinkle over dough. Roll up, jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch seams to seal. Cut into 16 slices. Place, cut side down, in two greased 8-in. round baking pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 50 minutes. Pour 1/4 cup cream over each pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Immediately invert onto serving plates.
