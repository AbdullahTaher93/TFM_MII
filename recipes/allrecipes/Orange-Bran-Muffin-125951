Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a 12-cup muffin pan with cooking spray. In a medium bowl, combine the cereal, water, and oil. Stir until the cereal is softened. Grate 1 tablespoon of the peel from the orange into another medium bowl; cut the orange in half and squeeze 1/4 cup juice into the bowl. Stir in the buttermilk, molasses, honey, and egg until well-blended. Stir into the cereal mixture. In a large bowl, combine the flour, 1/3 cup of the oats, baking soda, and salt. Add the cereal mixture and stir just until blended. Stir in the raisins and walnuts, if using. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 teaspoons oats. Bake for 15 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Place the pan on a rack. Meanwhile, combine the sugar and orange juice in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat and stir until the sugar dissolves. Using a wooden pick, poke holes in the muffin tops. Brush with the orange syrup. Cool on the rack for 5 minutes. Remove to the rack to cool completely.
