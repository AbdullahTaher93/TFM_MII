Wash spinach well and remove any hard stems. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add spinach (it will cook down very rapidly). Remove spinach from the stovetop, let cool slightly then drain reserving the water. Using an electric food processor, puree the spinach. Make roux with the butter, flour and reserved water. Add the roux to the spinach, stir and serve.
