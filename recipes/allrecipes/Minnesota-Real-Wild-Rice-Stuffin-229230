Bring 8 cups chicken broth and wild rice to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat and simmer until rice is partially tender, about 30 minutes. Mix partially-cooked wild rice with chicken broth, cranberry-walnut bread, 1 cup chicken broth, celery, water chestnuts, pecans, pine nuts, onion, apple, apricots, and garlic together in a slow cooker. Cook on Low until wild rice has softened and split, at least 40 more minutes.
