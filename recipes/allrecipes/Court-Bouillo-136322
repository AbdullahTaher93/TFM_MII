Fill a large stockpot or fish poacher with water (about three-quarters full). Bundle thyme, parsley, peppercorns, and fennel seeds in a small piece of cheesecloth to make a bouquet garni, and place in stockpot. Add remaining ingredients. Cover pot, and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Remove lid; gently simmer 30 minutes. Remove from heat; discard bouquet garni. Use immediately, or let cool completely, about 1 hour, before storing.
