Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread pecans on a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake pecans in the preheated oven until lightly toasted, 5 to 7 minutes. Let cool. Place pecans in a food processor and pulse into 1/4-inch pieces. Transfer to a bowl. Stir flour, brown sugar, orange zest, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Pour flour mixture into the food processor; add butter and pulse until mixture starts to hold together. Add pecans and pulse until topping is evenly mixed. Toss strawberries, white sugar, and corn starch in a bowl until well combined. Pour strawberry mixture into a 2-quart baking dish, sprinkle evenly with topping. Bake until golden and bubbling, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool 20 minutes before serving.
