In a bowl, mix the chicken, cracker crumbs, onion, mayonnaise, tartar sauce, parsley, salt, pepper, and hot sauce. Form the mixture into 6 cakes. Place the bread crumbs in a bowl. Dip the cakes into the bread crumbs to evenly coat. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the cakes until evenly browned, about 5 minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels before serving.
