Whisk together Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke, salt, seasoned salt, garlic powder, and onion powder in a bowl until the salts have dissolved. To use, pour the marinade over up to 2 pounds of meat in a resealable plastic bag. Seal the bag, and refrigerate overnight. The following morning, discard the marinade, and cook the meat as desired.
