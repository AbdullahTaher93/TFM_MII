Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Spread the pecans evenly onto a baking sheet. Toast the pecans in the preheated oven until they are lightly browned, about 5 minutes, then remove and set aside to cool. Meanwhile, place the quartered potatoes into a large mixing bowl. Toss with the olive oil until thoroughly coated. Season with the sea salt, marjoram, thyme, rosemary, and garlic powder. Place into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and just about tender when pierced with a fork, about 30 minutes. While the potatoes are cooking, place half of the toasted pecans into a blender along with the butter, Worcestershire sauce, and cornstarch. Puree until a smooth paste has formed. Crush the remaining toasted pecans, then mix with the puree. Spread this mixture over the roasted potatoes, and return them to the oven to bake until the nut mixture has browned nicely, about 5 minutes. Serve with dollops of sour cream.
