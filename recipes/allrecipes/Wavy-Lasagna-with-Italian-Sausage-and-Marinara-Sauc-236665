Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray a 13 X 9 baking dish with cooking spray. Cook pasta according to package directions. In a large skillet saute onions in oil until translucent, about five minutes. Add sausage, salt, pepper; brown well until cooked through. (Optional) Deglaze sausage pan with wine and reduce. Add 2 jars marinara sauce to the sausage mixture, bring to a boil. Pour 1 cup marinara sauce on the bottom of prepared baking dish. Layer 3 sheets of lasagna noodles, top with 1 cup of sausage mixture, 1/2 cup ricotta and 2 tablespoons of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. Repeat for 3 more layers. On the top layer pour the remaining marinara sauce and cover with foil. Bake in pre-heated oven for 20 minutes. Top Lasagna with mozzarella and the remaining Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. Re-cover with foil and continue baking for another 10 minutes. Before cutting the lasagna let it rest for 5 minutes.
