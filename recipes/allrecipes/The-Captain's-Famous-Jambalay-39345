In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Mix in flour, and whisk constantly 2 to 3 minutes, until a thick paste-like roux has formed. Stir file powder, garlic, green onions, onions and green bell pepper into the roux. Cook and stir until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir tomatoes into the mixture. Season mixture with black pepper, cayenne pepper, allspice, cloves, salt and bay leaf. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is well blended, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour in mushroom broth, and mix in rice. Increase amount of broth to cover all ingredients, if necessary. Bring to a boil, and mix in snapper. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 1 hour, or until rice is tender.
