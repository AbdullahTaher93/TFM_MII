To Prepare Apricot Sauce: In a blender, combine the apricots, yogurt, honey (to taste), and almond extract. In a cup, sprinkle the gelatin over the orange juice concentrate. Let stand to soften. Warm by microwaving for a few seconds or by standing the cup in warm water. Add to the blender with the ice cube. Process on high speed until the sauce has a smooth, fluffy consistency. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate at least 30 minutes. To Prepare Fruit: In a large bowl, combine the strawberries, kiwifruits, orange sections, and grated peel. Refrigerate until needed. Just before serving, slice and stir in the banana. Divide the fruit among 6 dishes; top with the sauce. Sprinkle with the almonds and julienned peel.
