Preheat barbecue grill. Combine garlic, lemon pepper, and oregano. Combine mushrooms, onion, oil and 2 teaspoons rub in medium bowl; toss. Alternately thread mushrooms and onion onto six 12-inch metal skewers. Finish with a lemon wedge. Press remaining rub onto beef steaks. Place steaks and kabobs on grid over medium, ash-covered coals. Grill steaks, uncovered, 15 to 18 minutes for medium rare to medium doneness, turning occasionally. Grill kabobs 6 to 8 minutes or until mushrooms are tender, turning occasionally. Remove vegetables from skewers; toss with cheese. Carve steaks. Season beef and vegetables with salt.
