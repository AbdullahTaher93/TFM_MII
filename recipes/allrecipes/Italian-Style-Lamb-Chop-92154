Trim and discard fat from chops. Place chops in a large (gallon-size) plastic resealable food bag. Add wine, onion, Worcestershire, lemon juice, sugar, oregano, and thyme. Seal bag and rotate to mix ingredients. Let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes. (If you have time to marinate ahead, chill up to 6 hours, turning bag 3 or 4 times.) Lift chops from marinade and drain briefly. Pour marinade into a 10- to 12-inch frying pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Meanwhile, place chops on a lightly oiled rack in a broiler pan. Broil 6 inches from heat, turning once and basting several times with boiled marinade, until browned on both sides and done to your liking (cut to test), 8 to 10 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer chops to a platter or individual plates. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
