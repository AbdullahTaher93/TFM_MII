In a skillet over medium heat, cook sausage and onion until the meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in pizza sauce, salsa and cayenne if desired; cook and stir for 5 minutes. Place buns, cut side up, on baking sheets. Broil 4 in. from the heat until lightly toasted. Spread about 3 tablespoons sausage mixture over each bun half. Sprinkle with cheese. Broil for 2-3 minutes or until cheese is melted and lightly browned.
