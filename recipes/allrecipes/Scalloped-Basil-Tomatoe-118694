Peel tomatoes and cut into 1/2-in. cubes; drain. In a large nonstick skillet, cook bread in oil over medium heat for 5-7 minutes or until lightly browned. Add the tomatoes, sugar and garlic; cook and stir for 5 minutes. Stir in the salt, pepper and basil. Pour into a 1-1/2-qt. baking dish. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until bubbly.
