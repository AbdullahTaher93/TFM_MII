Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line two 12-cup muffin tins with paper baking cups. In a medium bowl, whisk the cornmeal with the flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, pepper and cumin. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the butter at high speed until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time. At low speed, beat in half of the milk, followed by half of the dry ingredients. With a rubber spatula, fold in the cheese and the remaining milk and dry ingredients. Spoon the batter into the baking cups; fill them to within 1/4 inch of the rims. Bake the muffins for 30 minutes, or until golden. Transfer to a rack to cool.
