In a bowl, combine cracker crumbs and peanuts. Stir in butter and peanut butter; mix well. Set aside 1/2 cup for topping. Press the remaining crumb mixture into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. dish. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and peanut butter until smooth. Beat in sugar and vanilla. Fold in whipped topping; spoon over crust. Drizzle with chocolate syrup; sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture. Cover and freeze for up to 3 months. Remove from the freezer 15 minutes before serving.
