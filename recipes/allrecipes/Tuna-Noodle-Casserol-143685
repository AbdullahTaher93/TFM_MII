Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cook noodles according to package directions, adding the green beans the last 3 minutes of cooking. Drain and set aside. Meanwhile, toss the bread crumbs with the 1 tablespoon melted butter; set aside. In a large skillet melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add mushrooms, sweet pepper, onion, celery, and garlic. Cook and stir until vegetables are tender. Stir in flour, salt, mustard, and black pepper. Add LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk all at once; cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Stir in tuna, cooked noodles, and green beans. Spoon tuna mixture into a 1 1/2-quart au gratin dish or oval baking dish. Sprinkle bread crumb mixture atop casserole. Bake, uncovered, in a 350 degree F oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until heated through and bread crumbs are golden. Makes 4 servings.
