Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Whisk together melted coconut oil, garam masala, cumin and salt in a large bowl. Add cauliflower and toss until well coated. Arrange on a baking sheet and bake until tender, about 35 minutes. Meanwhile, melt 1 Tbsp coconut oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and onion and saute for 5 minutes, until transparent. Add quinoa and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring often. Add Silk, curry powder and salt, bringing mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, cover and cook for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in peas. Spoon into bowls and top with roasted cauliflower and toasted coconut, if desired.
