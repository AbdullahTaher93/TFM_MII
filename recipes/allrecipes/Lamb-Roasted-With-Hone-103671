Adjust oven to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Mix honey, mustard, rosemary, pepper, lemon zest and garlic in a small bowl. Spread 3/4 of this mixture over lamb, season with salt and place on a shallow roasting pan. Use the remaining honey mixture to baste the roast during cooking. Roast the lamb in preheated oven for about 1 hour and 30 minutes for medium-rare to 1 hour 45 minutes for medium, or until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest section of the roast registers 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium-rare to 155 degrees F (68 degrees C) for medium-well. Remove lamb from oven, transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes prior to cutting and while making the gravy. Set roasting pan over 2 burners at low heat and pour in 1 cup of water. While it is heating up, scrape the pan until all of the browned bits are loose. Strain pan juices into a small saucepan; return to heat, add vinegar and bring to a boil. Whisk in cornstarch; continue to simmer until gravy thickens. Carve lamb into slices and serve with warmed juices alongside.
