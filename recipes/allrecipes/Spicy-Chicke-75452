Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. Arrange chicken in the baking dish. In a bowl, mix French salad dressing, salsa, and thyme. Pour evenly over chicken. Cover with aluminum foil, and bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove foil, and continue baking 15 minutes, until chicken juices run clear.
