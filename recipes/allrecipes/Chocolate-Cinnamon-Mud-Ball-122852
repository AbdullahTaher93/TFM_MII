Butter the sides of a heavy saucepan; add the first five ingredients. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until sugar is dissolved. Cook, without stirring, until a candy thermometer reads 238 degrees F (soft-ball stage). Remove the heat. Cool, without stirring, until mixture reaches 110 degrees F. Transfer to a mixing bowl; add cinnamon, vanilla and salt. Beat until light-colored and stiff enough to knead, about 2 minutes. Lightly grease hands; knead mixture in bowl for 2 minutes or until smooth. Roll into 1-in. balls; cover and freeze for 20 minutes. Melt chips and shortening; dip the balls, shaking off excess. Roll in nuts if desired. Place on waxed paper-lined baking sheets to harden.
