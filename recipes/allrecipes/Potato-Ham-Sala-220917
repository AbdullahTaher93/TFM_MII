Place potatoes and carrots in a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain. Hold the potatoes under cold running water to cool. Slide the skins from the potatoes and discard. Cut skinned potatoes and carrots into bite-size pieces. Mix potatoes, carrots, onion, sweet peas, ham, dill pickle cubes, and ranch dressing in a large bowl. Season with salt and black pepper.
