Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with aluminum foil; spray with cooking spray. Mix oil, seafood seasoning, onion powder, hot sauce, and garlic powder together in a bowl. Cut potatoes into spirals using a spiralizer fitted with a large shredder blade; snip long spirals into smaller lengths. Place potatoes into a large bowl; drizzle with oil mixture. Toss until potatoes are evenly coated. Spread coated potatoes in a single layer onto the baking sheets, leaving 1/4-inch of space between potato spirals. Bake in the preheated oven until bottom of potatoes are browned, 8 to 9 minutes. Flip potatoes with a spatula. Bake until potatoes are browned and crisp on top, about 6 minutes. Sprinkle malt vinegar and sea salt over potatoes.
