Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil. Sprinkle the coconut onto the baking sheet and spread in a thin layer. Bake for 5 to 7 minutes, or until just beginning to turn golden brown. Transfer to a shallow bowl. Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F. Coat a 9 x 13 baking pan with cooking spray. Place the chicken between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and gently pound to 1/4 to 1/2 inch thickness. Season with the salt and pepper. Dip each piece of chicken in the egg white to moisten well. Press into the coconut and turn to coat both sides. Place the chicken in the prepared baking pan and lightly coat with cooking spray. Bake for 15 minutes, or until cooked through.
