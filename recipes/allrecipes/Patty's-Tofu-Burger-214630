Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl until smooth. Mix in the tofu, celery, onion, chili powder, cumin, curry paste, garlic, and oats with your hands until the tofu has broken into fine pieces, and the mixture is evenly blended. Form into 8 patties. Heat the vegetable oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook the patties until crispy and golden brown on each side, about 5 minutes per side.
