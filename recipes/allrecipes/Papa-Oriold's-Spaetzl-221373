Mix flour, water, eggs, salt, and baking powder in a bowl until blended. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Place part of the dough into a spaetzle press or potato ricer. Press dough into boiling water; cook and stir until pasta floats, about 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and rinse with water; repeat with remaining dough.
