Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Stir in onion, and cook until tender and golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add mushrooms; continue to cook, seasoning lightly with salt and pepper, until most of the moisture has evaporated, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl; stir in soy sauce and allow to cool for a minute or so. Mix in turkey and cheese and form into patties. Place burgers on hot grill; cover and cook until char-grill marks form on one side of the burgers, about 6 minutes. Turn and continue to grill until a meat thermometer inserted into the burger registers 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), 5 to 6 minutes longer.
