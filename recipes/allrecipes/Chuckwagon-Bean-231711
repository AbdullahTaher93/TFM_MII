Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir bacon and onion in pot until the onion is tender, 7 to 10 minutes; add ketchup, dry mustard, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, salt, and black pepper. Reduce heat to low and cook bean mixture at a simmer until hot, about 10 minutes; pour into a large casserole dish. Bake in preheated oven until bubbling on top, 10 to 15 minutes.
