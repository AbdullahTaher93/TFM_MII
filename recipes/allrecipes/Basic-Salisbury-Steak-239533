Mix ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, and onion soup mix together in a bowl; shape into 6 oblong patties. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Stir golden mushroom soup and water together in a bowl; pour over the patties in the skillet. Turn patties to coat in the liquid. Bring liquid to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the skillet, and cook until steaks are very firm, hot, and grey in the center, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
