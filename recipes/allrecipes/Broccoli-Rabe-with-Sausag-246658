Fill a large pot with chicken broth and 1 cup water; add broccoli rabe. Bring to a boil and cook until nearly tender, about 5 minutes. Drain. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage; cook, stirring to break into small pieces, until crumbly and browned, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add broccoli rabe, remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Cook until broccoli rabe is tender, about 3 minutes more.
