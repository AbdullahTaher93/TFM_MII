Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the green chile peppers and onion, and cook until tender. Place baked beans in the saucepan. Stirring often, cook 10 minutes, or until beans are a smooth, mashed mixture. Mix in taco seasoning mix and salsa. Transfer to a medium serving bowl. Top with Cheddar cheese. Microwave on high 1 to 2 minutes, if necessary, to melt the cheese. Serve warm.
