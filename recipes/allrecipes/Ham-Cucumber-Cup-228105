Use a melon baller to scoop out the center of each cucumber slice, leaving the bottom of the slice intact to make a small cup. Place ham, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, and curry powder in a food processor and pulse a few times to mince and combine the filling. Spoon about 2 teaspoons filling into each cucumber cup.
