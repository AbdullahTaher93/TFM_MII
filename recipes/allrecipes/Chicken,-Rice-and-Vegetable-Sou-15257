In a large saucepan over high heat, combine 4 cups water and the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Add the chicken, carrots, onion, celery and bouillon and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the vegetables are soft. Add more water as necessary. Add the rice and allow to simmer for another 15 minutes, or until the rice is tender. Add salt and pepper to taste.
