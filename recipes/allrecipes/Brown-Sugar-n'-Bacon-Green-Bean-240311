Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels, reserving 1 tablespoon bacon drippings. Crumble bacon. Bring water to a boil in a skillet. Add brown sugar, vegetable seasoning, and bacon drippings to water; cook and stir until brown sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Add green beans and bacon to brown sugar mixture; season with salt. Reduce heat and simmer until green beans reach desired tenderness, about 10 minutes.
