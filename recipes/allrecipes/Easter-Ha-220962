Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Score ham by making 1/2-inch deep diagonal cuts, creating a diamond pattern; transfer ham to a roasting pan. Mix brown sugar with enough yellow mustard to make a smooth, pourable sauce. Pour reserved pineapple juice over ham, followed by the honey. Pour brown sugar mixture over honey and arrange pineapple rings decoratively atop ham. Secure pineapple rings with toothpicks. Bake in the preheated oven until diamond pattern on ham splits open, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Baste ham every 15 minutes with pan drippings.
