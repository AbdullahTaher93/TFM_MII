Pierce steaks all over with a fork, and place them into a resealable freezer bag. In a medium bowl, stir together 1 tablespoon of olive oil, cocktail sauce, honey, soy sauce, garlic, and seasoning salt. Pour over the steaks in the bag, seal, and refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to 6 hours, turning frequently. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. When grill is heated, lightly oil the grate. Remove steaks from marinade, reserving marinade. Grill for about 7 minutes on each side, or to your desired degree of doneness. While steaks are grilling, heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, and cook until tender. Pour in reserved marinade, and bring to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes, or until thickened. Serve with steaks.
