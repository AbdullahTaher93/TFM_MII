Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add habanero peppers, and garlic, and fry for a few minutes to release the flavors. Add shrimp, and cook stirring constantly until pink, about 5 minutes. Season with chili powder, salt and pepper, stirring to evenly coat the shrimp. Stir in the cream, and cook over low heat until heated through, but do not allow to boil. Serve hot with bread slices.
