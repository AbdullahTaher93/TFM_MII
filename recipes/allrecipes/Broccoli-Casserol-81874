In a microwave and oven proof casserole dish add the broccoli and 1/2 of the juice from the can of mushrooms (about 1 Tbsp of liquid). Cover and zap in the microwave for 3 minutes for frozen and 4 minutes for fresh broccoli. Meanwhile; in a mixing bow, blend together the mayo, sour cream, paprika, oregano, thyme, salt and pepper. Mix well. When the broccoli is done, stir in the mayo mixture and the mushrooms. Evenly spread out the broccoli. Sprinkle the top with Parmesan cheese and put under a 500 degrees F broiler for about 3-5 minutes or until it begins to bubble.
