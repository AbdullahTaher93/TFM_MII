Chop cranberries in an electric blender or food processor until they are almost mush; stir in sugar and refrigerate overnight. A couple of hours before serving, stir the apples and walnuts into cranberry mixture and fold in the non-dairy whipped topping. This dessert will keep well in a covered container for several days.
