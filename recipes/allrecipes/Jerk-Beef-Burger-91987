Add oil to a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan and place over high heat. Add onions and mushrooms and stir to mix. Cover pan and cook until mushrooms begin to get juicy, 2 to 3 minutes; stir often. Remove lid; continue to cook, stirring mixture often, until vegetables begin to brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Add beef to frying pan; break apart with a spoon and stir often until browned, about 10 minutes. Add jerk seasoning and flour to broth; stir until well mixed. Add broth mixture to pan and stir frequently until most of the liquid evaporates, 4 to 5 minutes. Add salt to taste and remove from heat. Lay hamburger buns, toasted sides up, on plates and spread lightly with mayonnaise. Lay lettuce leaves, cupped sides up, on buns and mound equal portions of the beef-jerk mixture into lettuce on buns, using all. Garnish with tomatoes and eat with knife and fork.
