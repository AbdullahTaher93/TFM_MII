Place the great Northern and kidney beans in a bowl. Add cold water to cover by 2 inches. Cover and let stand overnight. Drain the beans and place in an ovenproof Dutch oven. Add the broth, water, garlic, oil, sage, and pepper. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Cover and bake for 1 hour and 45 minutes, or until the beans are very creamy and tender. (Add a little more water during baking, if needed.)
