In a bowl, combine the first four ingredients. Pour 1/3 cup marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add the chicken. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade. Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill. Drain and discard marinade from chicken. On eight metal or soaked wooden skewers, alternately thread chicken, vegetables and pineapple. Grill kabobs, covered, over low heat for 9-11 minutes or until chicken juices run clear, turning and basting frequently with reserved marinade.
