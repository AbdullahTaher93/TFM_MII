Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Grease 15x10x1-inch pan with shortening or spray with cooking spray. Unroll dough; place in greased pan. Starting at center, press out dough to edge of pan. Prick dough 15 to 20 times evenly with fork. Bake at 400 degrees F for 8 to 10 minutes or until crust is very light brown. Meanwhile, remove sausage from casings; place in 10-inch skillet. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently and breaking up sausage, until no longer pink. Remove sausage from skillet; drain well on paper towels. In blender, puree tomato sauce and chipotle chile until smooth. Remove partially baked crust from oven. Spread tomato sauce mixture evenly over crust. Sprinkle cooked sausage, cilantro, olives and cheese over sauce. Return to oven; bake an additional 12 to 15 minutes or until cheese is melted and crust is crisp and lightly browned. Cut into squares. Serve warm.
