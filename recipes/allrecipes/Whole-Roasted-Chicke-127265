Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix oil and salad dressing mix; brush under skin and on outside surface of chicken. Place chicken on rack in roasting pan. Bake 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hours or until chicken is cooked through (180 degrees F when tested in the thickest part), brushing occasionally with the salad dressing mixture.
