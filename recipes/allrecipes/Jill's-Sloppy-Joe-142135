Cook the ground beef, onion, and celery in a large skillet over medium-high until the meat is fully cooked; drain off the excess liquid. Mix in the garlic, salt, pepper, grill seasoning, cumin, paprika, chili powder, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, and water. Reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes. Serve on toast or hamburger buns.
