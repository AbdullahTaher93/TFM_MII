Place chocolate in medium saucepan. Add cream; cook on low heat until chocolate is completely melted and mixture is well blended, stirring constantly. Stir in vanilla; cover. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or until firm. Meanwhile, reserve 30 of the cashew halves. Finely chop remaining cashews; set aside. Shape chocolate mixture into 30 (1-inch) balls with melon baller or teaspoon, using about 2 tsp. of the chocolate mixture for each ball. Insert one of the reserved cashew halves in center of each ball; reshape ball lightly to completely enclose cashew. (Balls need not be perfectly round.) Roll lightly in the chopped cashews. Place truffles in single layer in wax paper-lined 15x10x1-inch pan. Refrigerate 1 hour or until firm. Store in tightly covered container in refrigerator. Remove from refrigerator about 30 min. before serving to soften slightly.
