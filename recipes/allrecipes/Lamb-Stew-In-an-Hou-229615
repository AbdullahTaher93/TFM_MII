Heat olive oil in a pressure cooker over medium heat. Cook and stir lamb in hot oil until browned completely, about 10 minutes. Add 2 cups water, pureed corn, chicken soup base, bay leaf, marjoram, parsley, chives, allspice, salt, and black pepper to the lamb. Lock the lid onto the pressure cooker, increase pressure to full, and reduce heat to medium-low to keep pressure consistent; cook 25 minutes. Release pressure from cooker. Add 2 cups water, potatoes, carrots, and onion to the lamb mixture. Lock lid on the cooker, increase pressure to full, and reduce heat to medium-low to keep pressure consistent. Cook another 8 minutes.
