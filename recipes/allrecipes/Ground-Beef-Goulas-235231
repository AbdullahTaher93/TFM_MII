Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir beef, onion, and red bell pepper in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 7 to 10 minutes; drain and discard grease. Transfer beef mixture to a slow cooker; add beef broth, potatoes, carrots, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, paprika, hot sauce, and salt. Stir the mixture, making sure the potatoes remain submerged in liquid. Cook on Low for 4 hours.
