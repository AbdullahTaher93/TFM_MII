To make sushi rice, combine rice vinegar, sugar and salt in a bowl. Microwave for 30 seconds or till sugar is dissolved completely. Pour the mixture evenly over the cooked short grained rice and gently mix to combine. Make a few slits on the underside of shrimp and turn it belly-up so that shrimp will straighten after cooking. Cook shrimp in lightly salted boiling water for 2-3 minutes or until the shrimp are pink and opaque. Drain and rinse under cold water. Wrap the bamboo mat with plastic wrap. Spread the sushi rice evenly on each nori sheet. Turn it over and lay shrimp, imitation crab, avocado, cucumber, and carrot in the center of the nori sheets. From the bottom end, start rolling nori sheet over the filling tightly and firmly with bamboo mat until the bottom end reaches the nori sheet. Lift the bamboo mat and roll over. Place the bamboo mat over the roll and tightly squeeze the roll. Wrap the roll with plastic wrap and cut the roll into 8 pieces with knife. Clean knife with wet towel after each cut. Decorate Susheep's eyes, mouth, horn, and legs with black sesame seeds, nori sheet, and cucumber. Lay tobiko on top and enjoy.
