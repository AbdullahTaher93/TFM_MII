Preheat oven to 325 degree F. Lightly grease and flour large baking sheet. Mix flour and baking powder until well blended; set aside. Beat butter and sugar in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla; mix well. Gradually add flour mixture, beating until well blended after each addition. Stir in 1-1/2 cups of the chopped chocolate, cherries and pecans. Roll out dough to 1/4-in. thickness on floured surface. Cut with 3-in. heart-shaped cookie cutter, re-rolling dough scraps as needed. Place hearts, 2 in. apart, on prepared baking sheet. Bake 10 to 12 min. or until lightly browned. Turn hearts over on baking sheet. Bake an additional 10 to 12 min. or until slightly dry and golden brown. Remove to wire racks; cool completely. Melt remaining chopped chocolate as directed on package. Drizzle over hearts. Let stand until chocolate is firm.
