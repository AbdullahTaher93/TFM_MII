Preheat the broiler and broiler-pan rack. In a large skillet, warm the oil over medium-high heat. Add the bell pepper, onion, pepperoncini, garlic, basil, sugar, 1/4 teaspoon (1 ml) of the black pepper, 1/8 teaspoon (0.5 ml) of the salt, and the red pepper flakes, and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to medium and saute for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Add the tomatoes, broth, and tomato paste; increase the heat to medium-high and saute for 2 to 3 minutes longer, or until the tomatoes start to release their juices. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally and mashing the tomatoes with a spoon, for 10 minutes, or until the tomatoes are reduced to a sauce. Meanwhile, season the chicken on both sides with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon (1 ml) black pepper and 1/8 teaspoon (0.5 ml) salt. Broil the chicken 4 to 5 inches (10 to 12 cm) from the heat for 5 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through. Add the chicken to the tomato sauce, spoon the sauce over the chicken, and bring to a simmer. Sprinkle with the parsley and remove from the heat. To serve, place a piece of chicken on each of 4 plates and top with the sauce.
