Place the red beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let soak 8 hours to overnight. Drain and rinse beans. Put beans in a slow cooker; add quinoa, barley, celery, tomato, garlic, red chile pepper, green bell pepper, green onion, curry paste, ginger, chicken bouillon, Italian seasoning, black pepper, chives, onion powder, and garlic powder to the beans. Cook on High, stirring occasionally, until the beans and barley are tender, about 4 hours. Stir coconut milk and lime juice into the soup; cook 15 minutes more.
