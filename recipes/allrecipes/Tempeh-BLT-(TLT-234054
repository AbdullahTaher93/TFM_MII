Heat oil in a skillet over high heat; cook tempeh bacon in the hot oil until lightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Spread mayonnaise on 1 side of each bread slice. Layer 1 leaf lettuce, 1 tomato, and tempeh bacon on the mayonnaise side of 1 bread slice. Top tempeh with remaining tomato slice and lettuce leaf. Place the remaining slice of bread, mayonnaise-side down, on top.
