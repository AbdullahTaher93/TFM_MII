Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Microwave caramels and milk in microwavable bowl on HIGH 1-1/2 to 2 minutes or until caramels are completely melted, stirring after each minute. Pour into well-greased 8-inch round cake pan; sprinkle with 1/2 cup of the pecans. Unroll crescent roll dough; separate into 2 rectangles. Press perforations in each rectangle together to seal. Mix remaining 1/4 cup pecans, sugar, cinnamon and raisins; sprinkle over dough rectangles. Roll up each rectangle, jelly-roll fashion, beginning at one of the short ends. Cut each roll crosswise into 4 slices. Place, cut sides down, in prepared pan. (Sprinkle with any remaining sugar mixture.) Bake 17 to 20 minutes or until lightly browned. Immediately invert pan onto serving plate; remove pan. Spread any remaining caramel over buns. Cool slightly.
