Place pie filling in a blender; cover and process until the apples are in 1/4-in. chunks. Pour into a mixing bowl; add dry cake mix and eggs. Beat on medium speed for 5 minutes. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Sprinkle with nuts and chocolate chips. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool completely on a wire rack before cutting.
