Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle both sides of each chicken breast with 2 tablespoons of the fajita seasoning. When skillet is hot, add chicken; cook until well-browned and cooked through, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove chicken from pan, cut into bite-size pieces, and set aside. Pour beans, corn, and salsa into the hot skillet, and season with remaining fajita mixture; simmer until hot, about 2 to 3 minutes. In a large bowl, toss salad greens, green onions, and cilantro with remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil and lime juice. Add chicken and bean mixture; toss again, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve warm.
