Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a 2 quart casserole, combine mashed potatoes, Cheddar cheese, American cheese, Parmesan cheese, bacon bits (reserving 1 tablespoon of the bacon bits for later use), onion, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Stir until the cheeses begin to melt. Combine melted butter, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, reserved bacon bits, onion powder and bread crumbs. Crumble mixture over the potato-cheese mixture. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until the topping has browned.
