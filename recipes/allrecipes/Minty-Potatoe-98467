Place the potatoes in a large pot and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain, cool, peel and cube. Set aside. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, raisins and chile peppers and season with asafoetida powder, ginger garlic paste, cumin seeds and fennel seeds. Cook and stir until onions are tender and golden brown. Add the potatoes to the skillet along with whole mint leaves. Cook and stir until potatoes are glazed with the spices. Stir in lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Garnish with cilantro leaves.
