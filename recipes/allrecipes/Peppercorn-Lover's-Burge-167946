Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Spray both sides of onion slices with cooking spray; set aside. Mix meat and 1/4 cup of the steak sauce; shape into four 1/2-inch-thick patties. Grill patties 5 minutes; turn. Add onions to grill. Cook burgers an additional 5 minutes or until cooked through (160 degrees F), brushing occasionally with the remaining 1/4 cup steak sauce and turning onions after 3 min. Place burgers on bottom halves of rolls; cover with onions and tops of rolls. Serve with assorted cut-up fresh vegetables and fruit to round out the meal
