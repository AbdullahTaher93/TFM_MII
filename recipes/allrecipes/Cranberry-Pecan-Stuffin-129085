Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl, pour 2 cups boiling water over the cranberries and let soak for 30 minutes; do not drain. Add the butter to a large skillet and melt over medium-high heat. Add the onion, garlic and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat. In a large bowl, combine the stuffing mixes with the parsley, pecans, onion mixture and the cranberries with their soaking liquid. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with the broth and pour the liquid over the stuffing, mixing until thoroughly combined. Spoon the stuffing into 2 buttered 3-quart casserole dishes and bake, covered, for 40 minutes.
