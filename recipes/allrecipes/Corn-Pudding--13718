Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2 quart casserole dish. In a medium bowl, mix together the whole kernel corn, cream style corn, margarine, sour cream, and corn bread mix. Pour into the prepared casserole dish. Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
