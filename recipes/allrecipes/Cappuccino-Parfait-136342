In a food processor, puree ricotta, sugar, and espresso powder until very smooth, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, 1 to 2 minutes. Dividing evenly, spoon mixture into four glasses or serving dishes. Refrigerate, covered, until ready to serve, at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day. Just before serving, crumble cookies over parfaits.
