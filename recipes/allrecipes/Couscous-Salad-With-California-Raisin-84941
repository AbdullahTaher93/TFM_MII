Bring stock to a boil in a large pot and add the oil, turmeric, cinnamon, cumin, ginger and couscous. Stir the mixture and lower heat to simmer. Allow to cook until liquid has been absorbed (about 2 minutes) stirring occasionally. Remove the pan from the heat and add the raisins. Fold gently to combine. Cover pot and let stand for 15 minutes. Meanwhile whisk together the lemon juice, salt and pepper. Drizzle the mixture over the couscous and toss well. Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving. Serve at room temperature; garnish with toasted nuts.
