Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Rinse pasta with cold water until cool; drain. Combine cooled pasta, tomatoes, cucumber, green bell pepper, red onion, and black olives in a large bowl. Pour Italian-style salad dressing over the pasta mixture; toss to coat. Sprinkle bacon bits and cranberries over the salad to serve.
