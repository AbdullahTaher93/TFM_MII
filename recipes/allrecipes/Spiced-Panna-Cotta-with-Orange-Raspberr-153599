Combine gelatin and water in a small bowl-set aside for 15 minutes to soften gelatin. Mix cream, sour cream, sugar, cloves and cinnamon sticks in medium saucepan. Gently stir over medium heat until mixture comes to a simmer. Remove from heat and strain to remove cloves and cinnamon sticks. Whisk gelatin mixture into strained cream. Add vanilla. Lightly coat six 3/4-cup ramekins with non-stick spray. Divide panna cotta between ramekins. Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight to set. Thaw raspberries; crush using a fork. Stir in remaining sauce ingredients. Heat for 1 minute on HIGH in microwave. Cool. To serve, run a knife around each dessert and invert on plate. Spoon sauce over.
