Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken, and saute until browned, about 5 to 7 minutes. When chicken is browned, stir in sour cream, mushrooms, ketchup and mustard; season with garlic powder, salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low. Simmer for about 20 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
