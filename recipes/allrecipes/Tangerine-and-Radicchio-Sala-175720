In a small bowl, mix together olive oil, lime juice, lime peel, lemon peel, chili powder, and cumin seeds. Let stand 10 minutes. Just before serving, peel tangerines and separate into segments. Place segments in a large serving bowl; discard seeds. Tear lettuce and radicchio into pieces and add to bowl. Pour dressing over lettuce and tangerines; mix gently until evenly coated. Add salt and pepper to taste.
