In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups flour, sugar, yeast and salt. Add water and oil; beat just until moistened. Stir in the olives and tomatoes. Stir in enough of the remaining flour to form a soft dough (dough will be sticky). Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into thirds. Shape each portion into a loaf. Place in three greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
