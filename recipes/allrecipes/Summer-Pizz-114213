Heat the oven to 450 degrees F. Put the tomatoes in a strainer set over a medium bowl. Toss with the salt and let drain for 15 minutes. In a medium bowl, combine the drained tomatoes with the onion, mozzarella, basil, and pepper. Top each pizza shell with half of the tomato mixture. Sprinkle the pizzas with the Parmesan and drizzle with the oil. Bake directly on the oven rack until the cheese just melts, about 8 minutes.
