Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Combine crabmeat, artichoke hearts, red bell pepper, cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, green onions, flour, garlic powder, and black pepper together in a bowl. Spoon crabmeat mixture evenly into tart shells. Place filled shells on a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until tart is golden and filling is bubbling, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
