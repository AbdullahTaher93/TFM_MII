Trim excess fat from chops. Heat skillet over medium heat, and rub a piece of fat over the bottom of the pan. Cook chops, turning occasionally, until browned on both sides (4 to 6 minutes). Season chops with garlic salt, rosemary, and basil. Arrange slices of orange and lemon over meat, and pour coffee liqueur and 1/4 cup water over all. Cover, and simmer for 30 minutes, or until meat is tender. Blend cornstarch with remaining 1/4 cup water, and stir into pan liquid; cook until thick. Sprinkle with green onions, and serve.
