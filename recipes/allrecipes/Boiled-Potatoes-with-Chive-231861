Place butter in a serving bowl. Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water by 1 inch; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and cool until potatoes can be handled; cut potatoes in half. Place potatoes into serving bowl with butter, season with salt and black pepper, and toss with chives until potatoes are coated.
