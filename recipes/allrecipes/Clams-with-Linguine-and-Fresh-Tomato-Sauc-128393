In a nonstick skillet over medium heat, cook onions and garlic in hot oil, about 2 minutes. Add tomatoes, basil, Italian seasoning, and pepper. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in broth and bring to a boil. Add clams. Reduce heat. Cover and gently simmer until clams open, 5 to 10 minutes. Using tongs, transfer clams to a bowl, discarding any unopened clams. Toss tomato mixture with hot linguine. Sprinkle with parsley and top with clams.
