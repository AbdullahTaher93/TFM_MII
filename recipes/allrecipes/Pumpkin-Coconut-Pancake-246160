Blend bananas, egg whites, almond butter, coconut oil, and almond extract together in a food processor until smooth. Add pumpkin puree, coconut flour, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, ginger, and sea salt. Pulse until batter is just combined. Heat a skillet over medium-low heat; spray with cooking spray. Drop 2 large spoonfuls of batter onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
