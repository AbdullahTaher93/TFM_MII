Combine water, chicken, carrots, celery, onions, leeks, sea salt, garlic, garlic powder, rosemary, dried parsley, and dried thyme in a large stock pot; partially cover pot with a lid. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until chicken is fully cooked and falling off the bone, about 2 hours. Remove chicken from pot. Stir in fresh parsley until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove broth from heat and allow to cool slightly. Strain broth into freezable 2 to 4 cup containers. Use immediately or freeze.
