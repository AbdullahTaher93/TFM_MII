Place half of the sauerkraut in a large roasting pan. Place pork roast over sauerkraut; top with remaining sauerkraut. Spoon tomatoes over top. Arrange the celery, carrots and onion around roast. Sprinkle brown sugar over tomatoes and sauerkraut. Add the parsley, bay leaves, oregano and pepper. Cover and bake at 325 degrees F for 3 to 3-1/2 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), basting occasionally with pan juices. Discard bay leaves. Let stand for 15 minutes before slicing.
