Pull the husk away from the ear without removing it and remove the silk. Twist the husk at the base, being sure not to remove it; it can be used as a handle. Using a long piece of corn husk or string, tie the pulled-back husk to make a handle. Brush the corn lightly with olive oil and season with Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM). Set aside. In a bowl, mix together the softened butter, cilantro, green onions and Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM). Transfer to a serving bowl, cover and set aside. Preheat grill to medium. Grill ears of corn for 12 to 15 minutes, turning frequently until the corn is lightly charred and the kernels are tender and plump. Brush with Hot Salt Butter and serve. Serve with Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM) for seasoning and extra Hot Salt Butter.
