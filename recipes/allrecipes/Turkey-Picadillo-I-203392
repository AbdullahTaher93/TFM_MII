Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground turkey. Cook and stir until the turkey is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Remove the turkey and drain and discard any excess grease. Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, bell pepper, garlic, and bay leaves; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the cooked turkey, wine, tomato sauce, olives, raisins, black beans, olive brine, capers, cayenne, and cumin. Simmer about 15 minutes.
