Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, medium-high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above the cooking grate only 3 to 4 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spread almonds in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour onto a counter and let cool. In a medium bowl, mix butter with 1 tablespoon sugar until smooth, then add almonds, remaining 1/4 cup sugar, and salt, and stir to combine. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon of the beaten egg and stir to moisten mixture. Discard remaining egg. Arrange 6 of the apricot halves with cut sides up on a sheet of foil placed on a baking sheet. Arrange remaining apricots on a second sheet of foil on a baking sheet. Spoon a generous tbsp. of almond mixture into each half. Transfer apricots (still on foil) to grill. Cover and cook until apricots are slightly softened and almond mixture is puffed and brown, 6 to 8 minutes. With a wide spatula, transfer apricots to a platter. Serve warm, with ice cream, if you like.
