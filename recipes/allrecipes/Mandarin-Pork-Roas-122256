Combine rosemary, garlic and pepper; rub over roast. Place roast, fat side up, on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours. Arrange oranges over roast. Combine glaze ingredients; brush over roast. Bake 30 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees (63 degrees C), brushing often with glaze. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing.
