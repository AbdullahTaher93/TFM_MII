In a large saucepan, saute the onions and celery in the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and the savory. Stir for 30 seconds. Add the potato, broth, and clam juice, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Stir in the corn and oysters. Simmer briefly (until the edges of the oysters start to curl). Slowly add the milk and parsley and heat through.
