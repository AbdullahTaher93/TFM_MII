Bring water and lentils to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until lentils are tender, about 40 minutes. Drain. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease two 5x9-inch loaf pans. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, spinach, carrot, and garlic in the hot oil until onion is tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix lentils, onion mixture, bread, vegetable broth, eggs, 1/4 cup ketchup, soup mix, parsley, basil, and black pepper in a bowl. Divide mixture into the prepared loaf pans. Drizzle 2 tablespoons ketchup over each loaf. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, about 50 minutes. Let loaves sit for 10 minutes before serving.
