Place lamb in a large bowl. Add 1/2 cup olive oil, red wine, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, oregano, mint and garlic. Stir until lamb is well coated. Cover, and refrigerate 3 hours, or overnight. Preheat grill, and lightly oil grate. In a small bowl, combine yogurt, cucumber, minced garlic and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Season with dill weed, salt and pepper; set aside. Thread meat onto skewers. Grill 10 minutes, turning once. Lightly sprinkle pita bread with olive oil, and place on grill until warm, about 1 minute. Serve meat on pita bread along with sliced red onion, sliced tomato and yogurt sauce.
