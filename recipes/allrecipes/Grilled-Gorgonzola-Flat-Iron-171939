Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Combine the cinnamon, black pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, cayenne pepper, and brown sugar in a small bowl. Sprinkle over the flat iron steaks on all sides, and press into the meat; set aside. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in the red wine, and boil until the wine has nearly evaporated, about 5 minutes more. Remove the onions from the skillet and set aside. Cook the flat iron steaks on the preheated grill for 4 minutes per side, then remove and place into the skillet. Top the steaks with the onion mixture, and sprinkle with Gorgonzola cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese has melted and the steaks have cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 5 minutes for medium. Sprinkle with chopped basil to serve.
