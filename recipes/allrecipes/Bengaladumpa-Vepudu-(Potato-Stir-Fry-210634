Heat the oil in a large skillet. Fry the dried red chile peppers, cumin seeds, urad dal, and mustard seeds in the hot oil until the seeds begin to splutter. Add the curry leaves and continue cooking another 30 seconds. Stir the potatoes into the mixture. Season with salt. Cook and stir until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle the red pepper and cumin powder over the potatoes; cook another 2 to 3 minutes.
