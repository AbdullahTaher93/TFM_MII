Line a baking sheet with a plain paper bag or parchment paper. Mix peanuts, sugar, and water together using a wooden spoon in a large pot over medium-low heat; cook, stirring constantly, until liquid is evaporated and peanuts are coated, 20 to 30 minutes. Carefully pour coated peanuts onto the prepared baking sheet to cool completely.
