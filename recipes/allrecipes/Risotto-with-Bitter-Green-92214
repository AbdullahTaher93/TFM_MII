In a 3- to 4-quart pan, bring 2 quarts water to a boil over high heat. Plunge broccoli rabe into water and cook until bright green, about 2 minutes. Drain and immerse in cold water. When cool, drain and coarsely chop. In the same pan over medium-high heat, combine oil and onion. Stir often for 3 minutes. Add garlic and stir often until onion is limp, about 2 minutes. Add rice and continue to cook, stirring until grains are opaque (about 2 minutes). Add wine and stir until wine evaporates, about 2 minutes. Add 1 1/2 cups hot broth and cook over medium heat until the liquid is absorbed. Continue to add broth, 1/2 cup at a time, until all broth is used and rice is tender to bite, about 20 minutes. Stir in chopped broccoli rabe and cheese. Spoon risotto into wide bowls to serve.
