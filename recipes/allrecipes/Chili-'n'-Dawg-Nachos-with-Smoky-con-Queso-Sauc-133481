Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of EVOO, 1 turn of the pan, and the hot dogs and brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the dogs to a plate. Add the remaining tablespoon of EVOO, 1 turn of the pan, and let it get hot. Add the beef and brown it, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes. Move the meat to the sides of the pan and add the onion, bell pepper and garlic to the center. Cook the veggies for a few minutes to soften, then combine with the meat and stir in the beans. Cook it all together for another 3 to 4 minutes. In a small bowl, combine the tomato sauce, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, cumin and grill seasoning. Pour the sauce evenly over the meat and work it in. Add the hot dogs to the pan, then the beer. Let the meat sauce boil for 1 minute, then reduce the heat to low and simmer while you make the cheese sauce. In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the butter. Add the flour and whisk for 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk the milk into the bubbly flour and butter and raise the heat a bit. Bring the milk to a boil, whisking, then turn the heat to low and let it thicken, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the chiles. Add the cheese, a few handfuls at a time, stirring in a figure-eight motion. Once the cheese has melted into the sauce, add the drained tomatoes and heat through for 1 minute. Season to taste with salt. Reduce the heat to low until ready to serve. To assemble, scatter the chips on a cookie sheet and crisp in the oven (or place in large bowls and microwave each bowl for 20 seconds on high). Scatter the chips across a large platter or divide among individual bowls and top with the meat topping and cheese sauce. Serve as is or garnish with your choice of toppings, such as cilantro, olives, onions, scallions and sour cream.
