Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Cut bread into 1-inch cubes. Spread the bread cubes out in a single even layer on a baking sheet and toast for 10 minutes. Chop cucumbers and tomato into 3/4-inch cubes. Remove the skin from the chicken and pull the meat into bite-size pieces. Set aside. Combine chicken, toasted bread, cucumber, tomatoes, Parmesan cheese, basil, olive oil and vinegar in a large bowl and toss well. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Toss again and serve immediately.
