First make the marinade. Combine the ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, and sherry, wine, or vermouth in a bowl. Add the fish and turn to coat in the marinade; set aside. Bring 1 cup of the stock to the boil in a saucepan that will accommodate a steamer basket(s). Put the couscous in a bowl and pour the boiling stock over. Cover and leave to stand until the couscous is swollen and absorbs the liquid, about 15 minutes. Pour the remaining stock into the saucepan. Add the lemon zest and bring to a boil. Add the carrots and reduce the heat so the stock simmers. Place the fish, skin side down, in a single layer in a steamer basket. Add the scallions, and asparagus tips, or put them in a second stacking steamer basket. Place the steamer basket(s) over the gently boiling stock and cover. Steam until the fish is opaque throughout and the flesh begins to flake, and the vegetables are tender, 10 to 12 minutes. When the couscous is ready, add the chopped parsley and fluff the grains with a fork to mix the couscous and parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Lift the steamer basket(s) off the pan. Drain the carrots, reserving the cooking liquid. Arrange the fish, carrots, and steamed vegetables on warm plates with the couscous. Discard the lemon zest from the cooking liquid. Moisten the fish, vegetables, and couscous with a little of the liquid, and serve with any remaining liquid as a sauce.
