Whisk flour and baking powder into a bowl and mix in corn kernels. Whisk egg yolks with cream in a small bowl and stir into the corn mixture; season with salt and black pepper. Beat egg whites with an electric mixer until fluffy and stiff peaks form in a separate bowl. Gently fold egg whites into the batter, retaining as much volume as possible. Pour vegetable oil into a deep heavy skillet to a depth of 3 inches. Heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Drop fritters into the hot oil, 2 to 3 tablespoons at a time, and cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain fritters on paper towels and serve drizzled with cane syrup.
