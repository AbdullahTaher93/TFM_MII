In a mixing bowl, cream butter, shortening and sugars until light and fluffy. Add eggs and beat well. Combine dry ingredients; stir into creamed mixture along with nuts. Shape into three 9-in. x 1-1/2-in. rolls; wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 2-3 days for spices to blend. Unwrap and cut into 1/4-in. slices. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-14 minute or until set. Remove to wire racks.
