Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the penne pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until tender. Drain well and return to the pot. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and onion; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant. Add the escarole and continue to cook and stir until wilted, about 5 minutes. Stir in the beans and tomatoes, then season with fresh thyme. Simmer for about 5 minutes, mashing some of the beans to thicken the juices. Pour the sauce into the pot with the pasta and stir to coat. Stir in half cup of Parmesan cheese and season to taste with salt and pepper. Reserve the remaining cheese for passing at the table.
