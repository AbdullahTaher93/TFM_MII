Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Saute carrots in hot oil until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add onion; saute until onion is fragrant, about 2 minutes. Season carrot mixture with turmeric, cumin, pepper, and ground ginger; stir and let the seasonings toast until fragrant, about 1 minutes. Stir cabbage and garlic into the carrot mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage wilts, about 10 minutes. Stir potatoes into the cabbage mixture. Pour water into the pot and stir. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer, stirring every 10 minutes, until the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.
