Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, garlic, and rosemary and saute stirring frequently, until the onions are soft and are starting to turn golden, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, make the bean and garlic mash. Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over very low heat. Add the garlic cloves and saute until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the beans and vegetable stock, cover the pan, and simmer to heat through, 4 to 5 minutes. Mash until smooth, season to taste, and stir in the parsley; keep warm. Push the onions to the side of the skillet. Add the chops and fry 3 to 4 minutes on each side, depending on how well done you like your meat. Lift the chops from the pan and place on warm serving plates. Add the balsamic vinegar, wine, olives, and sugar to the skillet and let bubble over high heat until the liquid evaporates. Stir in the stock and bubble 1 minute longer. Pour the sauce over the lamb. Garnish with fresh sprigs of rosemary and serve with the bean mash.
