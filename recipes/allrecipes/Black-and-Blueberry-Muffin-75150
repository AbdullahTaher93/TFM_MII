Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter muffin pan. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flours, wheat germ, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon. In another bowl, whisk together half and half cream and eggs. Stir wet ingredients into dry, mixing just to combine. Fold in berries. Scoop batter into muffin pan cups. If there are any empty cups, fill those halfway with water. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until done.
