Coarsely chop, or shred by hand, enough cooked roast beef to make 1-1/2 cups. If meat is cold, cut into chunks and warm slightly in microwave to make hand-shredding easier. Heat olive oil in a 4-quart pot and gently cook garlic, basil, oregano and rosemary about 3 minutes. Stir in the 1-1/2 cups beef and tomato paste. Add tomato sauce, red cooking wine, brown sugar and cinnamon or nutmeg, stirring until smooth. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 30-40 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in half & half. Serve over pasta, sprinkled with cheese if desired.
