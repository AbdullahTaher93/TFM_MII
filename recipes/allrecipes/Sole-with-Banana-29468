Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium saucepan over medium heat, blend the butter, flour, and milk. Cook, stirring constantly, until a thick sauce has formed. Arrange sole in a single layer in a medium baking dish, and cover with the wine and lime juice. Season with salt and pepper. Pour 1/2 the sauce over the fish. Arrange bananas over the fish, and cover with remaining sauce. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until the cheese is lightly browned and the fish is easily flaked with a fork. Drain any of the remaining wine and lime juice mixture before serving.
