Place the pretzels on greased baking sheets; place a chocolate kiss in the center of each pretzel. Bake at 275 degrees for 2-3 minutes or until chocolate is softened. Remove from the oven. Place an M&M on each, pressing down slightly so chocolate fills the pretzel. Refrigerate for 5-10 minutes or until chocolate is firm. Store at room temperature.
