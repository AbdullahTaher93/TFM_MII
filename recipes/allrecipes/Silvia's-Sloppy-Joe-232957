Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef and onion in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Mix chili sauce, ketchup, water, pickle relish, brown sugar, and mustard into the ground beef mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors are blended, about 15 minutes.
