In a large bowl, mix water, yeast, and honey. Stir in biscuit mix. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead 10 minutes, or until dough is slightly sticky, working in 1/4 cup flour or more as necessary. Coat a baking sheet with nonstick spray. Shape dough into 16 small rolls. Arrange rolls on the prepared baking sheet. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place 45 to 60 minutes, or until doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake 13 minutes, or until golden.
