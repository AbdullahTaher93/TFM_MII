Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil. Spread the potatoes on the sheet and coat with nonstick spray. Bake for 25 minutes, or until lightly browned. Set aside. Warm 1 1/2 teaspoons (7.5 mL) of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the leeks and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until softened. Transfer to a large bowl. Cut the salmon into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces and add to the bowl. Stir in the artichokes, potatoes, and pepper. In the same skillet used for the leeks, warm the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil over medium-high heat. Add the salmon mixture and shape into a shallow mound with the back of a spatula. Cover and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until lightly browned and crisp on the bottom. Using the spatula, cut the hash into 4 sections. Flip the hash in sections and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on the other side. Serve sprinkled with the tomatoes and dill (if using).
