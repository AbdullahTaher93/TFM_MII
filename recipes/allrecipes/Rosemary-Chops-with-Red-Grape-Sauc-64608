Heat the butter in a frying pan over medium high heat. Season the chops with rosemary and beef granules, then add to the pan. Cook for 3 minutes, then turn and reduce heat to medium. Continue to cook for about 5 minutes. Place chops on a platter and cover with foil to keep warm, while making the sauce. Place the grapes, sherry and sugar in the frying pan used to cook chops and cook on medium high heat, stirring frequently until the grapes are hot and the juices are bubbling, about 3 minutes. Pour sauce over chops.
