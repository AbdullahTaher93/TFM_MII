Place cucumbers and pepper in medium bowl. Using coffee grinder or food processor, chop peanuts until reduced to a coarse powder (not too fine, but no big chunks). Add to cucumbers along with lemon juice (to taste), salt, and sugar (to taste) and mix well. Sprinkle cayenne in small pile on top of salad. Do not stir it in yet. Heat oil in small skillet over high heat. When it begins to smoke, add mustard seeds and cover with a lid or a splatter screen. As soon as the seeds stop sputtering, remove from heat and carefully pour oil over cayenne. Stir in dressing.
