Cut a pocket through the crust of each slice of bread. In a mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and pineapple; stir in pecans. Stuff into pockets. In a shallow bowl, beat the eggs, cream, vanilla and ginger; dip both sides of bread. Cook on a greased hot griddle until golden brown on both sides. Combine syrup ingredients in a saucepan; heat until warmed, stirring constantly. Serve with the French toast.
