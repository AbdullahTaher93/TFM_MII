Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a 4- to 6-quart pan, bring about 3 quarts water to a boil over high heat; stir in pasta and cook, uncovered, until just tender to bite (10 to 12 minutes). Or cook pasta according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a 1 1/2- to 2-quart pan, bring milk and cream to a simmer over medium heat. Add the cheddar, asiago, and jack cheeses, the ham, and the cayenne; stir until cheese is melted and smoothly blended into sauce. Season to taste with salt, and pepper. Drain pasta well and transfer to a 9-inch-square baking dish (2- to 2 1/2-quart size). Pour cheese sauce over pasta and stir gently to mix well. Spread out evenly, then sprinkle with bread crumbs. Bake until top is golden brown and sauce is bubbly (15 to 20 minutes).
