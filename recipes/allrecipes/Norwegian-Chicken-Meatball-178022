In a large bowl, combine chicken, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the cornstarch, egg, 1/4 cup of the broth, salt, lemon peel, and 1 tablespoons fresh dill (or 1 teaspoon dried); mix well with a fork. In a wide frying pan, bring remaining 2 cups broth to a simmer. As broth heats, drop level tablespoon portions of chicken mixture into the liquid, keeping them slightly apart. Cover and simmer until meat is white in center (3 to 4 minutes; cut to test). With a slotted spoon, transfer meatballs to a bowl. In a small bowl, mix remaining 1 tablespoon cornstarch and 2 tablespoon water until smooth. Whisk cornstarch mixture into broth. Increase heat to high, add cheese, and whisk until cheese melts. Return meatballs to sauce, mix gently, and heat for about 1 minute. Spoon meatballs and sauce over noodles in a bowl. Sprinkle with remaining dill.
