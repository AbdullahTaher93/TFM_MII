Whisk together the vinegar, mayonnaise, Dijonnaise and olive oil in a large bowl until combined. Put the romaine, bacon, chicken and blue cheese in a large bowl and toss to combine. Heat the wraps in a dry saute pan over low heat, or place on a plate, cover with a damp paper towel and microwave for 25 seconds to make more pliable. Place the wraps on a flat surface and spread some of the dressing over the surface. Divide the mixture among the wraps, fold like a burrito, slice in half and drizzle top with more dressing, if desired.
