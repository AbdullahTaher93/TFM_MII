In a skillet, saute celery, onion and cranberries in 1/2 cup of butter until tender. Stir in garlic, stuffing and enough broth to moisten; set aside. Place chicken with breast side up on a rack in a roasting pan. Combine salt, pepper, poultry seasoning and sage; sprinkle over inside and outside of chicken. Loosely stuff with cranberry mixture. Melt remaining butter; brush over chicken. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 2-1/2 to 3 hours or until juices run clear and a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees F for the chicken and 165 degrees F for the stuffing, basting occasionally.
