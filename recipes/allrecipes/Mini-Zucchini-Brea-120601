In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs, sugar, oil, molasses and vanilla. Add zucchini; mix well. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and baking powder; stir into zucchini mixture just until moistened. Stir in nuts. Transfer to two greased and floured 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 38-42 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to a wire rack.
