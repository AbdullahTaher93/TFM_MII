In large skillet over medium heat, saute rice-vermicelli mix with margarine until vermicelli is golden brown. Slowly stir in 2 cups water and Special Seasonings; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low. Cover; simmer 15 to 20 minutes or until rice is tender. Let stand 3 minutes. Meanwhile, toss steak with garlic and red pepper flakes; set aside. In another large skillet or wok over medium-high heat, heat oil until hot. Add snow peas and bell pepper; stir-fry 2 minutes. Add meat mixture; stir-fry 2 minutes. Add soy sauce and peanut butter; stir-fry 1 minute or until meat is barely pink inside and vegetables are crisp-tender. Serve meat mixture over rice; sprinkle with cilantro, if desired.
