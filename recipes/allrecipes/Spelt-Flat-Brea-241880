Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Whisk flour, salt, onion powder, and sugar together in a bowl; add water and whisk until smooth. Cover bowl with a towel and set bowl aside. Pour olive oil into a 12-inch cast iron skillet and place in oven until oil is hot, about 5 minutes. Pour batter into oiled skillet. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Flip flat bread and cook until browned, about 10 minutes more.
