Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute ginger, green onions, celery, bean sprouts, mushrooms, green pepper, ham and salt until vegetables are tender. In a large bowl combine beaten eggs and vegetable mixture. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Pour in egg mixture to form a small omelet. Cook until golden brown on each side. Repeat with remaining egg mixture.
