Lightly oil and preheat barbecue grill. In a 9- by 13-inch pan or heavy gallon-size plastic food bag, mix together vinegar, soy sauce, ginger, honey, oil, garlic, and pepper. Add steak (close bag if using) and turn to coat. Let stand at room temperature, turning occasionally, for 20 minutes. Drain steak; discard marinade. Grill 4 to 6 inches above a solid bed of hot coals (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds) or on a gas grill on high; close lid on gas grill. Cook meat, turning to brown evenly, until pink in the thickest part for medium-rare (cut to test), 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer steak to a cutting board and garnish with lime wedges. Thinly slice meat across the grain to serve. Offer lime wedges to squeeze over individual portions to taste.
