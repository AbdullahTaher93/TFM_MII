Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray a shallow roasting pan with no-stick cooking spray. Heat oil in large skillet over medium high heat. Season tenderloins liberally with salt and pepper. Brown each tenderloin on all sides in skillet. Transfer meat to prepared roasting pan. Roast tenderloins for 15 minutes, or until instant-read thermometer reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Whisk chicken broth, peanut butter and hoisin sauce together in a small saucepan, over medium heat, until smooth. Stir in ginger and garlic. Remove from heat. Transfer roasted meat from oven to cutting board. Tent with foil. Allow meat to rest for 10 minutes. Slice into medallions and serve drizzled with warm Asian Peanut Sauce and garnish with sliced chives or scallions.
