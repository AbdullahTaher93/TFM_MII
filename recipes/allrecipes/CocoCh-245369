Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Mix chili powder, paprika, allspice, taco seasoning mix, marjoram, ginger, thyme, basil, red pepper flakes, and Asian seasoned salt together in a bowl. Rub spice mixture over chicken breasts. Pour pear juice into a casserole dish; add chicken. Pour coconut cream over chicken and season with pepper, salt, and cinnamon sugar. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Flip chicken and continue baking until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
