Soak beans in twice their volume of water 8 hours or overnight. In a large pot, place drained beans, chorizo, soup bones and 1 quart water (or more as needed to cover). Cook over medium heat until beans are just beginning to be tender, 1 hour. Stir in cabbage, kale, potatoes and enough hot water to cover. Cook until potatoes are tender, 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
