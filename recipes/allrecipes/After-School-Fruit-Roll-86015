Combine fruit, honey and cinnamon in a bowl. Spread each tortilla with 1 tablespoon peanut butter, leaving a 1-inch border. Spoon fruit filling down the center of each tortilla. Sprinkle with nuts, if desired. Fold in 2 sides of tortilla to meet in center, then roll up, bottom to top. Place seam-side down. Halve each tortilla on a sharp diagonal.
