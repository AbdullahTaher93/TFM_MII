Combine beef, salt and Worcestershire sauce. Divide in half; pat each half into an 8-in. circle on waxed paper. Combine the remaining ingredients; spoon over one patty to within 1 in of the edge. Top with second patty; press edges to seal. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 12-13 minutes on each side or until the juices run clear. Cut into wedges.
