Set a deep skillet over medium heat and coat with cooking spray. Add sausages and cook until browned. Remove from the pan and set aside. Add the onion to the skillet; cook and stir until tender. Pour in the tomato soup and bring to a simmer. Return the sausages to the skillet and simmer in the soup for about 30 minutes. Serve over mashed potatoes.
