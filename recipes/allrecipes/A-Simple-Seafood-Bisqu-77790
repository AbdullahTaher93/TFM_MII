Heat evaporated milk, half-and-half, white wine, roasted red pepper, butter, bay leaf, salt, and hot pepper sauce in a saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring often, until very hot but not simmering, about 5 minutes. Stir in the oysters, clams with juice, and mushrooms. Cover and cook until canned oysters are just heated through, about 3 minutes. Do not boil. Remove bay leaf, sprinkle with green onions, and serve.
