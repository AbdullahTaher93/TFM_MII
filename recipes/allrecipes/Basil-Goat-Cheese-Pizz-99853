Allow dough to rise in a covered bowl until doubled in bulk. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Roll the dough on a floured surface into a 15-inch circle. Roll the edges towards the center to form a crust, leaving a 12-inch circle. Brush the entire crust generously with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt, pepper, 1 sprig of chopped basil, and rosemary. Bake in preheated oven until the crust begins to turn golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Spread the crust with tomato sauce. Sprinkle with 2 sprigs of chopped basil and goat cheese. Bake in preheated oven until the crust is brown, and the pizza has heated through, about 8 more minutes.
