Stir the beer, brown sugar, kosher salt, paprika, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and teriyaki marinade together in a bowl. Rub the chicken legs thoroughly with the vegetable oil. Poke several holes in the flesh of the chicken legs with a fork; arrange in a single layer in a glass dish. Pour the marinade over the chicken legs; marinate in refrigerator for 1 hour. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the chicken from the marinade and shake off any excess liquid. Discard remaining marinade. Grill the chicken legs on the preheated grill until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, turning one-quarter turn every 5 minutes, 20 to 25 minutes total. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the leg, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).
