Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Unfold puff pastry; cut each sheet into nine squares. In a bowl, mix the ricotta, 3/4 cup mashed BUSH'S(R) Cannellini Beans, chutney, raisins, 2 tablespoons of Romano cheese, parsley and 1 tablespoon of curry powder. Brush edges of pastry squares with milk; place 2 rounded teaspoons of cheese mixture in center of each square. Fold edges of pastry over filling, forming a rectangle; seal edges with a fork. Cut slits in pastry and brush the tops with milk. Sprinkle with remaining Romano cheese. Arrange pastries 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Remove to a wire rack. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in garlic, season with remaining curry powder, and cook until tender. In a food processor, process 1 can BUSH'S(R) Cannellini Beans and wine until smooth. Add to skillet and mix in cream. Add more cream if necessary to achieve desired consistency. Heat through; season to taste with salt and pepper. Drizzle sauce over top of warm pastry puffs to serve.
