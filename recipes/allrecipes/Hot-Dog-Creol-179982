Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the onions and peppers in the oil until tender crisp, about 3 minutes. Stir in hot dogs, and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, and season with oregano, salt, and pepper; cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or until hot dogs are heated through.
