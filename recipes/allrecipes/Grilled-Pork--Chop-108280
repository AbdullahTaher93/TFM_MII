Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for direct heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is directly under the food). For charcoal grill: Before you put the grill over the hot coals, brush it with a light coat of oil. For gas grill: When hot, brush grill with a light coat of oil. In a small bowl, with your fingers, mix Italian seasoning blend, salt, and pepper to blend well. Rinse pork chops and pat dry. Sprinkle seasoning mixture evenly over both sides of chops and rub into meat. Lay pork on lightly oiled grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand just above grill level only 2 to 3 seconds). Keep charcoal grill uncovered; close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning once with a wide spatula, until pork is no longer pink in center (cut to test), 10 to 12 minutes total. Transfer chops to plates and serve each with a lemon wedge to squeeze juice over the top.
