Combine fennel seeds, cumin seeds, caraway seeds, cracked wheat, butter or margarine, molasses or barley malt, and orange zest in 1 1/3 cup of boiling water. Soak for 1 hour. (This pre-soaks the cracked wheat and pre-releases the other flavors.) Add seed mixture along with baking soda, whole wheat or rye flour, high-gluten bread flour, dry yeast, gluten, and buttermilk powder into the pan of a bread machine in the order suggested by the manufacturer. Select the cycle for White Bread and the Light Crust setting. Start.
