Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking pan with vegetable oil. Place mackerel fillets in the baking pan; season with salt and pepper. Mix butter, lemon juice, and paprika together in a bowl. Pour over mackerel fillets. Bake in the preheated oven until mackerel flakes easily with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes.
