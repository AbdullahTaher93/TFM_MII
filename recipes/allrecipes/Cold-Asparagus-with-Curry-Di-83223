Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add asparagus, and cook for about 7 minutes, until bright green. Remove to a bowl of ice water to cool. Drain and set aside. In a medium bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, sour cream and curry powder. Transfer to a nice serving dish, and serve with chilled asparagus.
