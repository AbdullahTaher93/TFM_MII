Cut feta into 8 slices. In a small bowl, mix together egg and oregano. Dip feta slices in egg, shake off excess, and coat with flour. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry cheese until golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels. Arrange on a plate with tomato slices, and sprinkle with pepper. Serve with lemon wedges.
