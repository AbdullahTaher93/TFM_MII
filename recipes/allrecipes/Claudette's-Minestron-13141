In a large pot combine the potatoes, carrots, celery, onion, garlic, beans, tomato paste and water. Cook over medium heat until all the vegetables are tender. Transfer soup to a food processor or blender and puree until smooth. Return to pot and stir in the pasta. Cook until pasta is done. Serve with Romano or Parmesan cheese, if desired.
