Simmer the plantain pieces in salted water over medium-high heat until tender. Once tender, drain, and allow to cool, then finely chop. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the beef, garlic, and onion, season with salt and pepper. Cook until the beef is crumbly and the onion is soft. Stir in the chopped plantain, cilantro, and tomato. Season with Worcestershire sauce and hot pepper sauce; cook for about 10 minutes until everything is hot.
