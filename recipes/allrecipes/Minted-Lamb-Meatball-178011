In a 1-cup glass measure, combine broth, lemon juice, and cornstarch; set aside. In a medium-size bowl, beat eggs lightly. Add mint, garlic, flour, salt, pepper, and lamb; blend well. With dampened hands, shape lamb mixture into 24 meatballs, each about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Arrange meatballs in a circle on a microwave-safe plate. Cover and microwave on full (100%) power for 6 minutes. Drain off and discard juices. Give each meatball a quarter-turn, cover, and microwave on full power for 1 more minute or until meatballs are no longer pink in center; cut one to test. Let stand, covered, for 3 minutes. Meanwhile, stir broth mixture; then microwave, uncovered, on full power for 2 minutes or until bubbly and slightly thickened, stirring after 1 minute. Stir in onion and parsley, cover, and let stand for 1 minute. Spoon rice onto a platter. Arrange meatballs on top, then spoon sauce over all. Garnish with lemon peel, if desired.
