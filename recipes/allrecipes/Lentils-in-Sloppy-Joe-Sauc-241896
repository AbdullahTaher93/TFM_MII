Heal oil in a deep skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, green bell pepper, and garlic until until tender, about 10 minutes. Add water, ketchup, brown mustard, soy sauce, barbeque sauce, maple syrup, sriracha hot sauce, thyme, and cayenne pepper to onion mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir lentils into sauce and simmer until lentils are warmed, about 5 minutes.
