Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place bacon on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until just before crisp, about 15 minutes. Drain grease. Sprinkle brown sugar evenly on both sides of the bacon. Return to the oven until bacon is crisp and sugar has glazed, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven; place bacon on aluminum foil to cool. Combine pineapple, lemon juice, garlic, and ginger powder in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir until pineapple softens 5 to 7 minutes. Add honey, habaneros, and apple cider vinegar; cook and stir until honey is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Combine bacon and habanero mixture together in a blender. Cover and pulse until mixture is thin.
