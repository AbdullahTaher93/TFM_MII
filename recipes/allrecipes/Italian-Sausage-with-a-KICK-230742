Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir sausage in the hot oil until browned, about 10 minutes. Stir onion, mushrooms, garlic, and oregano into sausage, season with salt and black pepper, and cook until onions are slightly browned, about 15 minutes. Pour wine into skillet, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until liquid has nearly evaporated, about 10 minutes. Pour cream into skillet and add Parmesan cheese and butter. Cook at a simmer, stirring often, until sauce is slightly thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Adjust salt and black pepper to taste.
