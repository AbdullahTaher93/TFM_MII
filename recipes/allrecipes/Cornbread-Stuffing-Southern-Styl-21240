Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a medium bowl combine muffin mix, corn, eggs, yogurt and milk; stir just until moistened. Pour into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan over medium heat, melt butter and saute onion, celery, green pepper and garlic. When onions are tender stir in thyme, basil, oregano, salt, pepper, cayenne and broth. Bring to a boil and then remove from heat. Crumble the cornbread and stir into broth mixture; mix well. Add more broth or more bread, as necessary, to achieve desired consistency.
