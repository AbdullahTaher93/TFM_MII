On a cookie sheet place 15 chocolate wafers flat side up. Working quickly, top each wafer with a small scoop of ice cream. Top each sandwich with another wafer, flat side down. Gently push the top wafers down until the ice cream comes to the edge of the wafer cookies. Freeze for one hour, or until firm. Roll each ice cream sandwich in mini chocolates chips so that all the exposed ice cream is covered. Cover and freeze until ready to serve.
