Season ground beef as desired. Divide into 12 small patties. Flatten ground beef patties to fit larger than size of roll (patty will shrink when cooked.) Dice onion into small pieces and saute in heavy skillet with butter over medium heat until translucent. Place patties over onions and press patties down firmly with spatula; this allows the onions to cook into patties. Fry over medium heat until done. Pull apart rolls in each package. Slice roll in half; place a patty in between each roll and serve.
