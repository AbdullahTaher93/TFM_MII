Sterilize 5 half-pint jars. Set aside. Pour the champagne into a large pot, and stir in sugar and vinegar. Bring to a full rolling boil, and stir in the pectin. Boil hard for one minute while stirring vigorously. Remove from heat, and ladle into sterile jars to within 1/2 inch of the top. Wipe rims with a clean dry cloth, and seal with lids. Allow to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate. The jelly may take a few days to set.
