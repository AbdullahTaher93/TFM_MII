Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Stir the soup, corn and chicken in a 9-inch pie plate. Stir the muffin mix, milk and egg in a small bowl just until blended. Spread the batter over the chicken mixture. Bake for 30 minutes or until the topping is golden brown. Sprinkle with the cheese. Let stand until the cheese is melted.
