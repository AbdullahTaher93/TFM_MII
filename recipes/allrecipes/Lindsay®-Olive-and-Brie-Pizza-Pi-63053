Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place crust on a lightly floured cookie or baking sheet. Fold in edges of crust 1/2-inch, pressing down to form a rim. Spread mustard over inside of crust; top with half of brie cheese, tomatoes, olives, green onion, remaining brie cheese, oregano and Parmesan cheese. Bake until crust is crisp and golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature.
