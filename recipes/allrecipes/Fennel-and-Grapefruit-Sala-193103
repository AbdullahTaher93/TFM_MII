Trim and halve the fennel bulbs. Cut them paper thin with a sharp knife or mandolin. Peel and section the grapefruit so that only the fleshy fruit remains. Stem, wash and dry the arugula leaves. In a large bowl place the arugula and dressing. Toss until coated and then add the fennel, grapefruit and olives. Pepper and salt and toss again
