Place garlic, blueberries, peach preserves, sesame oil, mustard, vinegar, sugar, and soy sauce in a blender; cover and blend until smooth. Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat; cook and stir chicken and mushrooms until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 7 minutes. Stir in ginger, garlic salt, and black pepper; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Toss green onions and mixed vegetables with chicken; pour blueberry sauce over vegetable mixture. Continue cooking on medium-high heat until sauce comes to a boil, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook until vegetables are tender, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and allow sauce to cool for 3 minutes. Serve over brown rice and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
