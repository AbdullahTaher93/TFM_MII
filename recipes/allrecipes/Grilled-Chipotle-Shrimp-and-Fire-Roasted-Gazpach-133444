Preheat a grill or a grill pan to medium-high. In a food processor bowl, combine the lime juice, chipotles, adobo sauce and grill seasoning. Turn the processor on and add 1/4 cup of the EVOO in a thin stream and process until smooth. Pour the smoky marinade onto a plate and return the processor bowl to its base without rinsing it out. Add the shrimp to the marinade, toss and let it hang out for 10 to 15 minutes. Drizzle the bread with EVOO, then grill until lightly toasted, 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Rub the garlic all over the bread. Chop the bread and add it to the food processor with the tomatoes, onion, cucumber, piquillo peppers, celery, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce and cilantro and a little salt. Pulse the food processor to blend the soup until it reaches the consistency you like. (Heads up: If you have a small food processor, you may need to blend the gazpacho in 2 batches. Grill the shrimp until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Serve 4 shrimp alongside each bowl of gazpacho with a lime wedge to squeeze into the soup.
