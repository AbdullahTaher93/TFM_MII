In a 5-qt. soup kettle, combine the first 10 ingredients. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer for 3 hours. Remove chicken; allow to cool. Strain broth, discarding vegetables and seasonings. Add enough water to make 8 cups; return to kettle. Debone chicken and cut into chunks; add to kettle with beans and noodles. Bring to a boil; cook for 20 minutes. For dumplings, mix potatoes, egg, cream, sugar and salt if desired in a medium bowl. Gradually add flour to make a stiff batter (it should form a peak when spoon is lifted). Drop by teaspoons into boiling soup. Cover and simmer for 3 minutes.
