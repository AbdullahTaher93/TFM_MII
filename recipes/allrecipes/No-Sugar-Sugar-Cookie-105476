Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil a cookie sheet and set aside. Blend together butters, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and vanilla in a medium mixing bowl with an electric mixer, or by hand. Blend until butter is softened. Add egg substitute, water and vinegar. Mix briefly. Add flours, salt and baking powder. Mix on low speed, until dough is formed. Do not overmix. Remove dough from bowl and place on a floured work surface. Divide dough in half.
