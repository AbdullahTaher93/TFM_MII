Spray 3 1/2- to 4-quart slow cooker with cooking spray. Place turkey in slow cooker and pour barbecue sauce over turkey, turning to coat. Cover and cook on Low 9 to 10 hours, or High 4 1/2 to 5 hours, or until turkey is tender and thoroughly cooked. About 10 minutes before serving, remove turkey. Place on plate, remove and discard bones; shred using two forks or cut into bite-sized pieces. Return turkey to slow cooker; mix with pan juices. Fill rolls with shredded turkey, using a slotted spoon. Spoon pan juices into small bowls to enjoy for dipping, if you like.
