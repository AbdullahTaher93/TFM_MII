Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the celery, carrots, onion, and garlic. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the vegetable stock, quinoa, basil, and turmeric. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 25 to 30 minutes until the quinoa is tender and has absorbed the liquid. Once done, stir in the lime juice, and season to taste with salt to serve.
