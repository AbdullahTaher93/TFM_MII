Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil. Add linguine, and cook until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, and set pasta aside. Fry bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp. With a slotted spoon, remove bacon to paper towels. Stir garlic into bacon fat, and cook until garlic is slightly browned, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add spinach, and toss until spinach begins to wilt, about 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat, stir in pasta, and toss. Sprinkle with Brie and drizzle with olive oil to taste, then toss until cheese is melted.
