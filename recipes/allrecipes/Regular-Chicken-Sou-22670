In a large saucepan, boil the chicken until tender and no longer pink. Drain and dice. Return diced chicken to the large saucepan. Mix together the water, carrots, celery, onion, chicken bouillon and egg noodles. Boil the mixture approximately 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat and simmer at least 2 hours before serving.
