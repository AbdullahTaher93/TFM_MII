Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Beat butter and confectioners' sugar in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add vanilla extract, almond extract, and salt; mix briefly to incorporate. Gradually stir 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour into the creamed butter, add almonds, and mix until dough is just combined. Shape dough into tiny crescents; place on an ungreased baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Bake cookies in preheated oven until edges are golden, about 15 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Roll cookies in sifted confectioners' sugar when cooled.
