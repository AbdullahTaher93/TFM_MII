Rinse the fish and dry the surface and the cavity of each thoroughly with paper towels. In a 12-inch or larger nonstick frying pan, heat 3/8 of an inch of cooking oil over moderately high heat until very hot. A deep-fat thermometer should register 375 degrees F. Carefully add the fish, letting the tails stick out of the pan if necessary. Let the fish cook, without moving them, until crisp and browned, about 9 minutes. Using a large spatula, carefully turn each fish. Continue cooking until crisp and browned and just done, about 7 minutes longer. Drain on paper towels. Meanwhile, in a small glass or stainless-steel bowl, combine the broth, soy sauce, lime juice, orange juice, sesame oil, grated ginger, and scallions. Serve the fish on a platter. Run a knife between the flesh and the bones and lift off the fillet with the skin attached. Turn the fish over and repeat. Pass the sauce.
