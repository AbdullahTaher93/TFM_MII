Spray inside of bean mold lightly with cooking spray. (Or, dip paper towel in oil and use to lightly wipe inside of mold.) Place mold, fill side up, on tray. Stir boiling water into gelatin in bowl at least 3 minutes until completely dissolved. Pour into liquid measuring cup. Slowly pour gelatin into mold, filling each bean completely. (Any remaining gelatin mixture can be poured into a small custard cup and refrigerated.) Refrigerate 30 minutes or until firm. Tilt mold on slight angle over plate. Using moist fingertips, gently scoop beans out of mold. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
