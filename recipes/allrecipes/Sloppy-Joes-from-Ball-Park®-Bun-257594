Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. In a large skillet, saute beef on medium heat until brown and cooked through. Add in onions, garlic, carrots and red bell peppers and cook for 8 to 10 minutes until vegetables are tender. While vegetables are cooking, combine tomato sauce, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, brown sugar and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Add the tomato sauce mixture to saute pan and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. To make the ranch coleslaw, combine ranch dressing and vinegar in a medium bowl. Fold in slaw mix and set aside. Toast buns in oven until golden brown. Place pickles, if desired, on bottom bun. Add sloppy joe mix and top with ranch coleslaw, if desired.
