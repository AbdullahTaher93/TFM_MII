Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the pasta at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Rinse the pasta with cold water until cooled; drain. Stir cucumbers, green bell peppers, banana peppers, jalapeno peppers, Colby cheese, and Italian-style salad dressing in a bowl; add cooled pasta and mix until pasta is coated completely with dressing.
