Put chicken pieces in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Stir sake and 2 tablespoons mayonnaise together in a separate bowl until smooth; add chicken and mix to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 15 minutes. Whisk remaining 3 tablespoons mayonnaise, ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and lemon juice together in a bowl. Stir cornstarch and flour together in a separate shallow bowl. Beat egg in a third bowl. Pour enough oil into a large skillet to be about 1/4 inch deep; heat over medium-high heat. Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade. Coat chicken in the cornstarch mixture; dip chicken pieces into the beaten egg and gently drop into the hot oil. Fry chicken, turning regularly, until golden brown and no longer pink in the center, 7 to 10 minutes; transfer to a large bowl. Drizzle mayonnaise sauce over fried chicken and quickly mix to coat.
