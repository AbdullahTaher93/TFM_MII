Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Brown meat; drain. Add Seasoning Mix and water. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to low. Simmer, uncovered, 10 min., stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, fold each Tortilla over crumpled piece of foil, pressing to hold taco shell shape. Spray each side of tortilla with cooking spray. Place on 2 baking sheets. Bake 7 to 8 min. or until golden brown. Let cool on baking sheets 5 min. or until crisp. Spoon meat mixture into tortillas; top with cheese, Taco Sauce, lettuce, tomato and sour cream.
