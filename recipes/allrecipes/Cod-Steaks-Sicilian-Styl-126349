Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, fennel, garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring frequently, for 4 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender-crisp. Add the vinegar and cook for 30 seconds. Stir in the tomatoes and orange juice and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the sauce is slightly thickened. Place the cod steaks in a 9 inch x 9 inch baking dish. Spoon the sauce over the fish. Bake for 12 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily.
