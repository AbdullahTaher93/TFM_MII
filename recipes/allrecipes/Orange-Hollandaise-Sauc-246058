Place egg yolks and 1/4 cup orange juice in a heatproof bowl or in a double boiler set over simmering water, whisking constantly until warm and just starting to thicken, 1 to 2 minutes. Add butter, 1 slice at a time, whisking each addition until fully incorporated. Continue to whisk until sauce is thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and season with salt and black pepper. Thin sauce with remaining 2 tablespoons orange juice to reach desired consistency.
