Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Mix together the ketchup, ginger ale, dry onion soup mix, brown sugar, and red wine in a bowl, and stir until the brown sugar dissolves. Place the brisket into a disposable aluminum pan, and pour sauce over the brisket. Seal the pan with a cover of aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until the meat is very tender, about 4 hours.
