Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 36 muffin cups, or use paper liners. In a large bowl, combine flour, bran, wheat germ, brown sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Make a well in the center. In a small bowl, mix together eggs, molasses, vegetable oil, milk, and grated carrots. Pour into well, and mix just until moistened. Stir in walnuts and raisins. Fill muffin cups 3/4 full. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until tops spring back when lightly tapped.
