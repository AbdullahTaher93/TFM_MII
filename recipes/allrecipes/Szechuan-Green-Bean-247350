Cook and stir peppercorns in a dry skillet over medium heat until aromatic, 2 to 3 minutes. Grind peppercorns using a mortar and pestle. Heat peanut oil in a small skillet over medium heat; add garlic and cook until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Mix ground peppercorns and ginger into garlic. Mix red wine vinegar, soy sauce, green onion, hoisin sauce, and sesame oil into garlic mixture; cook and stir until sauce is heated through, 2 to 4 minutes. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add green beans, cover, and steam until tender, about 5 minutes. Toss green beans and sauce together in a bowl; top with sesame seeds.
