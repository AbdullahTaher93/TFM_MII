Preheat broiler. Cut peppers into quarters lengthwise; discard stems and seeds. Flatten pepper pieces slightly by hand. Place skin-side up on foil-lined baking sheet. Broil about 4 inches from heat source 10 to 12 minutes or until skin is blackened. Wrap peppers in foil from pan; let stand 10 minutes. Peel peppers; arrange in shallow dish. Drizzle any remaining pepper juice from foil over peppers. Combine rice vinegar, oil, garlic, salt and pepper; mix well. Pour evenly over peppers. Cover and chill at least 2 hours or up to 3 days before serving. To serve, let peppers stand at room temperature 30 minutes. Top with feta cheese and basil.
