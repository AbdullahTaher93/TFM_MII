Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place pita breads on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and slightly crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Spread pesto onto each pita bread and top with mozzarella cheese and tomato slices. Bake in the oven until cheese is melted and tomatoes are tender, about 10 minutes more.
