Place the onion, raisins, currants, garlic, chile powder, sesame seeds, cumin, cinnamon, cocoa powder, hot sauce, tomatoes, tomato sauce, and chicken broth into a slow cooker; stir to mix. Add the chicken breasts, and stir to cover with sauce. Cover and cook on Low 6 hours, then increase heat to High, and continue cooking until the chicken is tender, about 3 hours more. Or cook on Low for 11 to 12 hours. Once the chicken is tender, remove, shred, and stir it back into the mole. Serve sprinkled with slivered almonds.
