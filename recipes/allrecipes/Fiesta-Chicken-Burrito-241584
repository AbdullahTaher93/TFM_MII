Cut chicken into small 1-inch (2.5cm) cubes. In skillet, melt butter over medium high heat and cook chicken for about 8 minutes or until no longer pink inside. Salt and pepper to taste. Pour into large bowl and stir in 1/2 cup (375mL) of the cheese, sour cream, green pepper, salsa, olives, jalapeno, and cilantro. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Divide mixture among tortillas: Fold and roll to enclose filling completely; place seam side down in small baking dish. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake in centre of oven for about 20 minutes or until cheese is melted and tortillas are crispy.
