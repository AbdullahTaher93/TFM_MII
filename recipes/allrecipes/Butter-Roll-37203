STIR together yeast and 1/4 cup water in a measuring cup; let stand 5 minutes. PULSE 1 cup flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor until blended. Add yeast mixture, 1 egg, and milk; pulse until blended. (Pulsing prevents mixture from overheating, which would kill yeast.) Add butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, pulsing until combined. Gradually add enough of remaining flour until dough is no longer sticky. (Dough should be smooth.) PLACE dough in a well-greased bowl, turning to grease top. COVER and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in bulk. Punch dough down and divide into fourths; shape each portion into 6 (1-inch) balls. Place on a lightly greased 13-x-9-inch pan. COVER and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 1 hour. STIR together remaining egg and 1 tablespoon water; brush over rolls, and sprinkle with sesame seeds. BAKE at 375 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Freeze up to 3 months, if desired.
