Whisk tahini, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and salt together in a bowl until smooth and thick. Add warm water a splash at a time, whisking after each addition, until desired consistency is reached. Season with salt. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until flavors blend, at least 3 hours.
