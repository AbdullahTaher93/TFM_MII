In a saucepan, combine the liquid from the beets, vinegar, sugar, cloves, cinnamon and salt. Stir to dissolve the sugar and bring to a boil. Simmer over medium heat for 5 minutes. Add the beets and simmer for 5 more minutes. Use tongs to transfer the beets to a jar. Pour the liquid over them to cover. Cover and cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until serving.
