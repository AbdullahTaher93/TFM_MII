Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Coat a jelly-roll pan with cooking spray. In a medium bowl, combine the oats, wheat flakes, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, apple juice concentrate, brown sugar, oil, and cinnamon. Spread the oat mixture in the prepared pan. Bake, stirring occasionally, for 45 to 60 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool completely. Place the cereal, figs, apples, apricots, and almonds in an airtight container. To serve, place 2/3 cup of the cereal mixture in a bowl. Top with soy milk, fat-free milk, or yogurt.
