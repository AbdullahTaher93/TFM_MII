Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, mix together the whey, Splenda, baking powder and cinnamon. Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender or two knives or your fingers, blend the butter into the dry mixture keeping it light and fluffy. (I prefer using my fingers, smashing the pieces of butter until well incorporated with no noticeable pieces of butter remaining.) Lightly beat the egg with the maple and vanilla extract. Pour into the mixing bowl. Stir until well blended. You can buy chopped pecans but they are more course than I like for this recipe, so run them through the food processor for a minute. Add the chopped pecans and the flax to the mixture. Drop about 1 Tbsp of the batter onto a parchment lined cookie sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until cookies have a golden color and just start to turn brown along the edges. Transfer to a cookie rack and then repeat with the remaining batter.
