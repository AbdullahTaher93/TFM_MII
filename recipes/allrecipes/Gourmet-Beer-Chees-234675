Heat cream cheese and processed cheese food together in a sauce pan over low heat until melted, 5 to 10 minutes. Slowly stir beer into cheese mixture until thoroughly mixed. Add Gouda cheese, mozzarella cheese, and provolone cheese to beer-cheese mixture, stirring continually until smooth, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, horseradish, garlic, mustard, salt, and pepper into cheese mixture until well mixed and heated through, about 10 more minutes.
