Pour almonds into a baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F until almonds are golden, about 10 to 12 minutes. Pour from pan and set aside to cool slightly. In a blender or food processor, combine almonds, roasted peppers, garlic, 2 tbsp. olive oil, vinegar, paprika, cumin, cayenne, and 1/4 tsp. salt. Whirl until smoothly pureed. Transfer to a serving bowl. Or, if making ahead, cover and chill up to 3 days. Rinse shrimp and pat dry. Thread onto four metal skewers. Brush lightly with remaining olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Place shrimp on a barbecue grill over a solid bed of medium-hot coals (you can hold your hand at grill level 3 to 4 seconds) or medium heat on a gas grill (close grill lid). Cook shrimp, turning once, until opaque in the center (cut to test), 3 to 6 minutes total. Remove from skewers to a platter and serve with sauce for dipping.
