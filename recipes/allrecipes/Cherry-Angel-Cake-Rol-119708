Line two 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pans with ungreased parchment paper. Prepare cake batter according to package directions. Spread evenly in prepared pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-16 minutes or until golden brown. Meanwhile, sprinkle 3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar over two kitchen towels. Immediately invert cakes onto prepared towels. Gently peel off parchment paper. Roll up cakes in towels jelly-roll style, starting with a short side. Cool completely on a wire rack. Unroll cakes. Spread each with 1 cup whipped topping to within 1 in. of edges. Combine pie filling and extract; spread over whipped topping on each cake. Roll up again. Place seam side down on a serving platter. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours. Dust with remaining confectioners' sugar. Slice; garnish with remaining whipped topping.
