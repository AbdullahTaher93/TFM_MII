In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine flour, cinnamon, baking soda, cloves and nutmeg; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Stir in the dates, raisins and walnuts. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hour or until easy to handle. On a floured surface, roll out to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with a 2-1/2-in. round cookie cutter dipped in flour. Place 1 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-12 minutes. Remove to wire racks. Meanwhile, combine glaze ingredients; brush over warm cookies.
