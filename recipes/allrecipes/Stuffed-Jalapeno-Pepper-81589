Cut off the stems and cut each pepper in half lengthwise. Cut or scoop out all the seeds and membrane (this is where all the heat is and where you get to decide how spicy to make these appetizers). I prefer to discard all the seeds and to finely mince about 1/3 of the membrane to add to the cream cheese. In a small microwave safe bowl, add the cream cheese and pepper membrane (if using). Zap for about 30 seconds or until soft enough to stir. Add the chili power and garlic powder. Stir well. Spoon or pipe the cream cheese mixture into each pepper half. Serve at once or cover and refrigerate until needed (up to a day in advance).
