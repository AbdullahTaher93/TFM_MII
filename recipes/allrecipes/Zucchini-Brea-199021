Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat an 8 x 4-inch non-stick loaf pan with non-stick cooking spray. Use paper towels to blot excess water from zucchini. Set aside. In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt. In another large bowl, whisk SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, milk, egg, trans-free spread, and vanilla. Stir in zucchini. Add dry ingredients and mix just until moistened. (Batter will be lumpy.) Scrape into prepared pan. Bake 35 to 45 minutes, or until a tester inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pan 10 minutes. Remove to a wire rack; cool completely.
