Heat the remaining oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the eggplant and zucchini and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the water and sauce and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the oregano. Return the chicken to the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Place the rice onto a serving platter. Slice the chicken and place it on the rice.
