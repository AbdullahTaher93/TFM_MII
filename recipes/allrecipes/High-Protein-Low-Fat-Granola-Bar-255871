Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a mini muffin tin with cooking spray. Combine chickpeas and egg whites in a food processor; blend until well mixed. Pour chickpea mixture into a bowl. Add apple, oats, puffed wheat, applesauce, chocolate chips, honey, almond butter, cranberries, almonds, and cinnamon; stir until batter is evenly mixed. Drop tablespoonfuls of batter into the prepared muffin tin; press down to flatten. Bake in the preheated oven until sides are golden, about 12 minutes.
