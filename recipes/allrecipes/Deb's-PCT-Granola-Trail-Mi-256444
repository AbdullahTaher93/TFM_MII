Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Combine chocolate chips, oats, almonds, pecans, pumpkin seeds, and coconut in a large bowl. Whisk honey, canola oil, cinnamon, and vanilla extract together in a measuring cup; pour over oat mixture and stir until well coated. Divide oat mixture between 2 large baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Stir granola and switch position of the sheets. Continue baking until granola is lightly browned, 15 to 30 minutes more. Cool completely, about 15 minutes. Store in a resealable container.
