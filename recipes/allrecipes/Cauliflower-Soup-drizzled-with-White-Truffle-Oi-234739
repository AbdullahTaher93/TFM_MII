Melt butter in a large cast-iron pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot butter until tender, about 7 minutes. Add cauliflower and garlic; cook, stirring, until garlic is fragrant and cauliflower starts to soften, 5 minutes. Pour chicken broth, salt, and pepper into cauliflower mixture; cover pot and simmer until cauliflower is tender, about 25 minutes. Pour cauliflower mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Return pureed soup to pot and bring to a simmer. Ladle soup into bowls and drizzle with truffle oil.
