Line an 8-in. square pan with foil and grease the foil; set aside. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine chocolate chips and milk. Cover and microwave on high for 1 to 1-1/2 minutes or until chips are melted; stir until smooth. Stir in the almonds, cherries and extract. Spread into prepared pan. Cover and chill for 2 hours or until set. Using foil, lift fudge out of pan. Discard foil; cut fudge into 1-in. squares. Store in the refrigerator.
