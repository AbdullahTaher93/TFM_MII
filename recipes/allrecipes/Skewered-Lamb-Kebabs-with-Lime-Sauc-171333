If using wooden skewers, put them in a shallow pan with water to cover and soak at least 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix bulgur and 1 quart boiling water and let stand until bulgur is tender to the bite, about 15 minutes. Drain and squeeze excess moisture from bulgur. Mix bulgur with lamb, coriander, garlic, salt, and pepper. Divide into 48 equal portions (each about 3 tablespoons) and shape each into a ball. Drain wooden skewers. On each skewer, thread 3 balls, squeezing each into a 2-inch oval that runs lengthwise on skewer. Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above the cooking grate only 2 to 3 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). Place kebabs on well-oiled cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook, turning once with 2 spatulas, until meat is well browned, 6 to 8 minutes total. Lift to a platter. In a small bowl, combine lime juice, cilantro, and basil. Pull hot meat off skewers and put into pocket breads, spooning in a little lime sauce.
