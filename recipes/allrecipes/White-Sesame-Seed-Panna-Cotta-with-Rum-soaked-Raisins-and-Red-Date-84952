Warm milk, sesame seeds and cream together in saucepan. Add gelatin; heat and stir until dissolved. Chill over ice until cool. Divide and pour into 4 individual ramekins that have been sprayed and lightly sugared. Keep in refrigerator at least 3 hours until set. Heat rum and cinnamon stick to boiling; remove cinnamon and flame to burn off alcohol. Add raisins and 1 cup sugar; stir until sugar is dissolved and liquid is syrupy. Cool. Cook dates in remaining 2 cups sugar and water until soft and liquid is syrupy. Unmold panna cotta onto 4 individual dessert plates; divide and spoon raisins and dates along with some of the rum syrup around and over each. Combine any remaining liquid from raisins and dates. Drizzle over panna cotta, then drizzle with condensed milk and serve.
