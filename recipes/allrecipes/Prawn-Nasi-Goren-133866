Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Swirl the beaten egg into the pan so that it coats the surface. Flip the egg after 30 seconds, and cook for an additional 20 seconds on the other side. Remove the egg from the pan and, when cool enough to handle, roll up on a cutting board. Slice the rolled egg to make thin strips and set aside. In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, sesame oil, and chili sauce; set aside. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet or wok over medium-high heat. When hot, add the zucchini, carrot, and green onions. Stir-fry for three minutes. Add the garlic, rice, prawns, and sauce mixture and mix well. Remove from heat and serve immediately, topped with the egg strips and chopped chives.
