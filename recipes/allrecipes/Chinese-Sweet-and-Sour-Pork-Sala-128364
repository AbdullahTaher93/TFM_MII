Heat ketchup, apple juice, fruit spread, vinegar, and ginger in a small saucepan, stirring constantly, until spread has melted and sauce is slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Coat a large nonstick skillet with nonstick spray and warm over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Add pork; stir-fry until lightly browned and almost cooked through, 6 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add peas and cook, stirring frequently, just until peas are crisp-tender, 5 minutes. In a serving bowl, combine pork mixture, pineapple chunks, water chestnuts, and the sauce. Add carrots and toss to mix well. Serve warm or chilled.
