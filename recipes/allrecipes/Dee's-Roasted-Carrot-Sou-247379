Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Stir carrots, potatoes, onion, and garlic together in a large roasting pan; drizzle with oil and sprinkle with herbes de Provence, salt, and pepper. Roast in the preheated oven until vegetables are tender and beginning to brown, stirring once, about 50 minutes. Remove roasted vegetables from oven; scrape vegetables and any brown bits into a large pot. Pour vegetable broth into vegetable mixture; bring to a boil. Blend soup until smooth with a stick blender; stir in cream to thin soup to desired consistency.
