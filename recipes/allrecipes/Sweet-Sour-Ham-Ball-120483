In a bowl, combine the eggs, onion and bread crumbs. Crumble meat over mixture and mix well. Shape into 1-1/2-in. balls. Place in two greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dishes. In a blender, combine the pineapple, brown sugar, mustard and vinegar; cover and process until smooth. Pour over ham balls. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F (72 degrees C); basting occasionally with sauce.
