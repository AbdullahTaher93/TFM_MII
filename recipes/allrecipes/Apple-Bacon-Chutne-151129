Combine vinegar and SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend in a large saucepan and cook over high heat for 8 to 10 minutes, whisking for the first 30 seconds to dissolve. Mixture should be quite thick. Cook the diced bacon in a small skillet over medium-high heat for 3 to 5 minutes, until the fat renders. Drain the bacon. Add the bacon to the SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend and vinegar mixture with all the remaining ingredients, except the salt. Cook for about 10 minutes more, until liquid has reduced and is quite thick. Remove from the heat, let cool completely, and season with salt.
