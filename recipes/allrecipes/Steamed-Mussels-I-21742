In a medium stock pot, heat butter over medium heat. Add shallots and saute until translucent. Pour in wine and mussels. Raise heat to medium/high and steam mussels until shells open, about 5 minutes. Pour mussels and cooking liquid into a serving bowl, sprinkle with parsley and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
