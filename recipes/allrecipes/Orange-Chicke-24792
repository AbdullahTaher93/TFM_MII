Saute chicken in a large skillet until lightly browned, about 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from skillet and set aside. In a medium bowl combine the flour, broth, juice, marmalade and pepper. Mix together. Heat mixture in a medium saucepan over medium low heat, stirring constantly, until bubbly. Add chicken and cook over low heat for 4 minutes.
