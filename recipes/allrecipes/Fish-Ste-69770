Place undrained mackerel, tomato soup (if using), potatoes, onion, and red pepper flakes in a medium stock pot. Add just enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce to a simmer, and cook 30 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. Break the egg over the stew, if desired, and serve.
