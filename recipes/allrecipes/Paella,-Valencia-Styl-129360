Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat the oil in a paella pan or large frying pan about 18 inches in diameter over medium heat. Saute the garlic for 2 to 3 minutes. Discard the garlic. Brown the chicken in the same pan for 5 minutes. Add the rice and stir until well coated with oil. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Add the snails, artichokes, green beans, peas, mussels, and eel. Season with salt and pepper. Add the bay leaf and saffron. Continue cooking over medium-high heat until the liquid has almost all been absorbed. Discard any clams or mussels that do not open. The rice grains should still be slightly crunchy and there should still be some liquid in the pan. Bake in the oven, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Cover the pan with foil or parchment paper and let stand for 10 minutes. Remove the bay leaf before serving.
