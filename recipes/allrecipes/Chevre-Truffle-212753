In a bowl, using a fork, mix the chevre, green onions, pepper and half of the chopped herbs (2 tablespoons) until the mixture is smooth. Using two spoons, portion cheese mixture into 10 mL (2 tablespoon) balls, rolling them in the palm of your hands. Roll 8 balls in the chopped nuts and place on a service platter. Using a small sifter, sprinkle paprika on 8 other cheese balls. Serve the remaining cheese truffles as they are or roll them in the remaining chopped herbs. Serve as an appetizer on tooth picks.
