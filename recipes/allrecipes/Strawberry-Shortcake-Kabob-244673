Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or spray with cooking spray. Mix flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl; cut in cold butter using a pastry blender or your hands until crumbly. Stir buttermilk and applesauce together in a separate bowl; pour into the flour mixture until dough comes together and is sticky. Using 2 spoons, drop dough into about 1/2 tablespoon-size mounds onto the prepared baking sheet, making 36 total mounds. Bake in the preheated oven until the bottoms are slightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Cool biscuits. Thread 3 biscuits onto each skewer, alternating with 3 strawberries halves, until all the ingredients are used. Top each skewer with whipped topping.
