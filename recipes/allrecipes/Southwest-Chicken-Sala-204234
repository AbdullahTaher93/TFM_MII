Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Cut bread into 3 strips; cut each strip into thirds, making 9 cubes. Combine 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons chili seasoning and garlic. Place bread cubes in zip-top bag and toss with olive oil mixture. Spread bread cubes in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake for 5 minutes; turn and bake for 5 to 7 additional minutes or until well toasted; set aside. Brush chicken breasts with remaining tablespoon of olive oil and sprinkle with 2 teaspoons chili seasoning. Heat a grill skillet or regular skillet over medium high heat until very hot. Cook chicken 4 minutes; turn and cook an additional 4 to 5 minutes or until done and meat is no longer pink inside. Allow to rest 10 minutes. Cut chicken into strips. Place greens in a large salad bowl. Add tomatoes, black beans, corn, pepper and green onions. Top with chicken breast strips. Combine remaining chili seasoning with ranch dressing; stir to blend. Pour over salad and toss. Sprinkle with cheese. Top with chili croutons.
