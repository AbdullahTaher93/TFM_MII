In a 2- or 3-quart mixing bowl, use a fork or spoon to evenly mix bread crumbs, egg, pizza sauce, mustard, onion powder, and garlic powder. Using your hands, gently fold the meat and green onions, if using, into bread crumb mixture. Divide meat into 4 equal portions. Wet hands and roll each portion into a ball. Make a hole that goes halfway through the center of each ball. Put 1 tablespoon cheese into each hole, then fold the meat around it to close the hole. Form into a patty. Place in an airtight container in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes or up to 24 hours to help set the patties to hold together better when cooking. Preheat barbecue grill. Spray each chilled patty lightly on both sides with cooking spray. Place patties on barbecue grill over hot coals or a gas grill on medium; close lid on gas grill. Grill undisturbed for 6 minutes. Turn burgers and grill for an additional 6 minutes (cut to test), or until done. (If your grill has a lid, cover it after you turn the burgers to help keep moisture in the meat.) To serve, place a lettuce leaf on each of four plates, then top it with a burger and a slice of tomato. Place a warmed bun on each plate, garnish plate with a pickle, and offer catsup, mustard, and mayonnaise on the side.
