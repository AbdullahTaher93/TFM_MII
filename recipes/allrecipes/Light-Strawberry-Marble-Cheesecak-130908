Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan with heavy-duty foil. Assemble the pan, pulling the foil up and around the sides. With another piece of foil, wrap the outside of the pan to prevent water from leaking in. Coat the bottom and sides of the pan with cooking spray. Arrange the ladyfingers in a single layer covering the bottom of the pan and set in a large roasting pan. Bring a pot of water to a boil for a water bath. Place the strawberries in a food processor or blender and puree until smooth. Using a fine strainer, strain the berries into a bowl to remove the seeds, leaving about 21/2 cups of berry puree. Set aside. In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth. Gradually add the sugar and beat on medium speed for about 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and beat in the sour cream, flour, and vanilla. Add the eggs one at a time or the egg substitute, beating until just incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl to make sure all the lumps of cream cheese are gone. Slowly pour the berry puree into the batter. Stir with a knife to create a marbleized effect. Pour the batter into the springform pan. Pour enough of the boiling water into the roasting pan to come about halfway up the sides of the springform pan. Bake for 2 hours. Turn off the heat and leave the oven door slightly ajar for 1 hour longer. Remove the pan from the water bath and cool on a wire rack. Remove the outer foil, cover, and refrigerate overnight before unmolding.
