Break off artichoke leaves down to pale, tender inner ones. Slice off about the top third of the remaining leaves. Peel artichoke bottoms and stems (lengths vary greatly) to remove fibrous exteriors. Trim discolored ends of stems. Cook artichokes until bottoms pierce easily, 25 to 30 minutes. Drain. Cut artichokes in half lengthwise. Pull out sharp-tipped inner leaves. With a spoon, scrape out and discard fuzzy centers in bottoms. Rub stems lightly with 1 teaspoon of the oil. Mix remaining oil with crumbs. Lay artichokes, cup sides up, on a baking sheet, and fill cavities equally with cheese. Sprinkle cheese with crumbs. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven until cheese is hot and crumbs are lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a serving dish.
