Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high. Mix the ground chicken with the curry paste, grill seasoning, cinnamon, cumin and coriander and form into 4 large, 1/2-inch-thick patties. Coat the patties with a little EVOO and grill for 4 to 5 minutes on each side (3 minutes on each side for lamb). In a food processor, blend the yogurt with the garlic, lemon juice, cilantro and mint until smooth. Season the lettuce and tomatoes with a little salt. Char the pitas on the grill, about 1 minute on each side, and cut about 1 inch off the tops. Open each pita and fill with a patty, a quarter of the chopped lettuce and sliced tomatoes and a generous spoonful of the yogurt sauce.
