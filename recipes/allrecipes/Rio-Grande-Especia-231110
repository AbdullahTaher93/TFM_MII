Cook and stir ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the beef is crumbly and completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir water, tomato sauce, tomato paste, green chilies, instant rice, sugar, chili powder, garlic, oregano, cumin, and salt together with the cooked ground beef. Reduce heat to low, place a cover on the skillet, and cook mixture at a simmer until the flavors have blended and the beef is very tender, about 40 minutes.
