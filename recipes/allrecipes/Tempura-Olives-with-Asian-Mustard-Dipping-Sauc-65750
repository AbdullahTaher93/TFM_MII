In a separate bowl whisk together mustard, water, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar and cilantro. Set aside. Heat 2 inches oil in deep, heavy saucepan or wok to 350 degrees F. Working in batches, dip olives in batter, allowing excess to drain slightly. Slide gently into hot oil. Fry until golden, about 1 minute. Drain on wire rack or paper towels. Serve hot with mustard sauce.
