Spray the inside of a 4 1/2- to 5-quart slow cooker with the cooking spray. Place the bread cubes into the cooker. Beat the milk, water, vanilla and eggs with a fork in a medium bowl. Pour over the bread mixture. Stir and press the bread cubes into the milk mixture to coat. Cover and cook on LOW for 2 1/2 to 3 hours or until set. Serve warm with the ice cream, if desired.
