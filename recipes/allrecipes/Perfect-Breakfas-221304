Melt 2 teaspoons butter in a skillet over medium heat; add the eggs. Allow the egg whites to cook until mostly firm before breaking the yolks; continue cooking until eggs are completely cooked and no longer runny, 2 to 3 minutes. Spread one side of toasted sourdough bread slice with Dijon mustard. Arrange avocado slice onto the mustard. Top avocado with cooked eggs. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over eggs.
