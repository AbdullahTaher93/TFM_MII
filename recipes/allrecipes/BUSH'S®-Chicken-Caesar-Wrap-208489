Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the chicken in an 8 x 8-inch baking dish, drizzle with the olive oil, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper and bake until cooked through and no longer pink, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven, let cool, and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (this will yield about 2 1/2 cups). Place the cooked chicken, beans, carrots, cucumber, lettuce, cheese, salad dressing, and dill as desired in a large bowl. Stir to combine. Arrange the mixture evenly down the center of each tortilla. Roll up tightly burrito style, slice in half, and serve.
