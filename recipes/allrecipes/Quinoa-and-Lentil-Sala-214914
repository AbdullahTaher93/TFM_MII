Bring the quinoa and 6 cups water to a boil in a large pot. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender and the water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Run under cold water to cool; drain. Pour into a large bowl. Meanwhile, bring the lentils and 2 cups water to a boil in a separate saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the lentils are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Run under cold water to cool; drain any excess moisture. Whisk the rice vinegar, olive oil, lemon juice, and agave nectar together in a bowl until well incorporated. Season with sea salt and black pepper. Pour the dressing over the quinoa and stir to coat evenly. Add the lentils, carrot, cucumber, green onions, and yellow bell pepper; stir until evenly mixed. Serve immediately.
