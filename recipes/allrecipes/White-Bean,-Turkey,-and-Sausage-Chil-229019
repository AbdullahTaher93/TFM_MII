Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Wrap the sausages in foil, place them on a baking sheet, and bake for 30 minutes. Heat olive oil in a large cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir turkey in hot oil until evenly browned, about 5 minutes. Season turkey with 1 tablespoon cumin, 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Add onions and garlic to the turkey; continue to cook and stir until onion is softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour in the white kidney beans and chicken broth. Season with 1 tablespoon cumin and 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder. Simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Mix in the chopped jalapeno and the whole jalapeno peppers, if desired. Remove the sausages from the oven and cut them into bite-sized pieces. Stir the sausage into the chili. Cook the chili until the whole jalapeno peppers are tender and chili is thick, about 15 minutes more.
