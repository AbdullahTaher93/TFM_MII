In a large stockpot, combine the chicken, chili beans, tomatoes, jalapenos, onion and green bell pepper. Season with chili powder and cumin. Pour in the chicken broth, and enough water to cover the ingredients. Stir well, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, and let simmer for one hour. Season with salt to taste.
