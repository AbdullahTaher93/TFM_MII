Whisk olive oil, white balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, and honey in a small bowl to make dressing. Cut Granny Smith and Red Delicious apples into noodles using a spiralizer fitted with the large shredding blade. Place apple noodles in a large bowl and toss with lime juice to keep them from turning brown. Pour in dressing; mix gently until salad is combined. Place pine nuts in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Toast pine nuts, shaking often, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle pine nuts over salad.
