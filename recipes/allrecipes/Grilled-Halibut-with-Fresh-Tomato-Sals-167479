Place halibut steaks in a shallow dish and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon lime juice and oil. Turn to coat well. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Preheat the grill. Core the tomato and halve crosswise. Gently squeeze out and discard the seeds. Dice the flesh and place in a small bowl. Stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon lime juice, cilantro (or parsley), onion, jalapeno, garlic, salt and pepper. Oil the grill rack (see Tip). Grill the halibut until it is opaque in the center, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Serve with the tomato salsa.
