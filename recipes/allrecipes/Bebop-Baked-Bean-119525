In a skillet, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp; remove to paper towels. Drain, reserving 1 tablespoon drippings. Saute green pepper in drippings until tender. Drain one can of beans. In a bowl, combine both cans of beans, barbecue sauce, brown sugar, mustard and green pepper. Transfer to a greased 1-qt. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until bubbly and heated through. Sprinkle with bacon.
