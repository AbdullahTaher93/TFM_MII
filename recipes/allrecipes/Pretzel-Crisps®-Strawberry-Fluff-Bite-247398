Arrange 24 Pretzel Crisps(R) on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Combine cream cheese spread and strawberry marshmallow fluff in a small bowl; mix well. Top each Pretzel Crisp(R) with a small spoonful of strawberry fluff mixture and spread slightly. Add a strawberry slice to the top of each. Place the chocolate in a small, microwave safe bowl. Microwave on high, in 20 second increments, stirring in between, until the chocolate is melted. Place the melted chocolate into a pastry bag or small zip-top bag. Take a tiny snip off of the tip of the pastry bag (or the corner of the zip-top bag) with a scissors. Drizzle the chocolate over the Pretzel Crisps(R). Refrigerate until ready to serve.
