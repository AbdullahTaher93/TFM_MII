Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat; cook sausage slices until they begin to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onion, reduce heat to medium, and cook until onion becomes translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add chicken broth, crushed tomatoes, and jalapeno pepper; stir to combine. Bring mixture to a simmer; gently stir squash and potatoes into mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Simmer stew, uncovered, until potatoes and squash are tender, 30 to 35 minutes. Stir in Italian parsley. Adjust levels of salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper if needed. Serve in bowls; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
