The Ultimate Burger: In a bowl, whisk the All-Bran* cereal "flour" and egg with the mustard to make a paste. Add the grated shallot, garlic, olives, herbs and spices. When your flavouring components are combined, work the ground meat into the mixture until well incorporated. Form into patties (I like an 8-oz. patty, about an inch thick), place them onto a tray lined with parchment paper and allow to sit for a couple of hours in the refrigerator. Ideally, prepare them the day before. To cook, season with salt and pan fry or grill for about 4 minutes on each side. The internal temperature should reach 160 F or 71 C. Farmers Market Crudites Salad: Wash the vegetables under cold running water. Using a vegetable peeler, peel long strips of the vegetables and store them in ice water. When ready to serve, remove the shaved vegetables from the water and pat dry on paper towel. Toss the vegetables with some olive oil, your favourite fresh herbs and season with sea salt and pepper.
