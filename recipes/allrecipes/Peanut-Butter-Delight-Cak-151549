Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat 10-inch (12-cup) bundt pan lightly with no-stick cooking spray. In the bowl of an electric mixer beat shortening, peanut butter, sugar and brown sugar on low speed until creamy. Add vanilla and eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. In medium bowl combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add to peanut butter mixture alternately with buttermilk, beating after each addition until well blended. Spoon 2 cups batter into medium bowl. Stir in 3/4 cup chocolate syrup. Spoon plain batter into pan. Spoon chocolate batter over plain batter. Do not mix.
