In a bowl, combine first four ingredients. Combine flour and baking powder; add to egg mixture and blend well. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Combine pie fillings, lemon juice and vanilla; spoon over batter. For topping, combine all ingredients; sprinkle over filling. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until bubbly and cake tests done. If necessary, cover edges with foil to prevent over-browning.
