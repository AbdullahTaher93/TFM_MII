In a medium bowl combine eggs, salt, and black pepper; set aside. In a medium broiler-proof skillet cook ham, sweet pepper, and onion in hot oil over medium heat until vegetables are tender and ham is light brown, stirring occasionally. Stir in parsley. Pour egg mixture over ham mixture in skillet. Cook over medium heat. As egg mixture sets, run a spatula around the edge of the skillet, lifting egg mixture so uncooked portion flows underneath. Continue cooking and lifting edges until egg mixture is almost set (surface will be moist). Place skillet under broiler 4 to 5 inches from heat. Broil for 1 to 2 minutes or until top is just set. If desired, arrange tomato slices on top of frittata. Sprinkle with cheese. Broil 1 minute more. If desired, sprinkle with fresh basil. Cut into wedges.
