Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners. Gently stir flour, baking powder, baking soda, cocoa powder, salt, chocolate chips, dried cranberries, and orange zest in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Beat butter, white sugar, brown sugar, sour cream, milk, and eggs with an electric mixer on medium speed in a separate large mixing bowl until blended. Gently stir flour mixture into the liquid ingredients just until batter is moistened and smooth. Dissolve coffee granules in water in a small bowl and stir coffee mixture into the batter. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups, filling them about 3/4 full. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the middle of a muffin, 20 to 25 minutes.
