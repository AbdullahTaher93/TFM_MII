Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Whisk olive oil, ground chipotle pepper, and chili powder together in a bowl; brush over the entire surface of the cut-side of each avocado. Grill avocados, cut-side down, on the preheated grill until grill-lines begin to form on the avocado flesh, about 5 minutes.
