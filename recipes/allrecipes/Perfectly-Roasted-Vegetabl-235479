Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Set an oven rack to the second-lowest level in the oven. Fill a bowl with lightly salted water. Place Brussels sprouts in salted water and let sit for about 15 minutes; drain. Stir potatoes, carrots, cauliflower, beets, shallot, olive oil, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Pour vegetables in a single layer onto a baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven until caramelized and cooked through, about 45 minutes.
