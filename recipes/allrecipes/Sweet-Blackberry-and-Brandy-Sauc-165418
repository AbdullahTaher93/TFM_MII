Place the blackberries, sugar, and brandy into a saucepan, and place over medium heat. Slowly bring to a simmer, and cook until the blackberries have softened, about 10 minutes. Dissolve the cornstarch in the water, and stir into the simmering berries. Continue cooking and stirring until the sauce has thickened and reached your desired consistency, about 10 minutes.
