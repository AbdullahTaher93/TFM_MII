Mix onion, mushroom, milk, bread crumbs, eggs, and salt together in a large bowl. Break ground beef into small pieces and add to onion mixture; stir. Shape the beef mixture into a round loaf and place into a 5-quart slow cooker. Cook on Low until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 6 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Whisk ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce together in a small bowl; spoon over the meatloaf. Continue cooking glazed meatloaf until the glaze is warmed, about 15 minutes. Remove meatloaf to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before slicing.
