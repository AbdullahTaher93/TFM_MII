Place milk in a large saucepan over medium heat. Bring just to the boiling point, stirring constantly. Gradually whisk in the flour with a fork, and continue cooking and stirring until slightly thickened. Stir in the peas, and let the mixture heat back up to a simmer while stirring constantly. Mix in the salmon, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Continue cooking and stirring until thick and heated through. Serve over saltine crackers or toast.
