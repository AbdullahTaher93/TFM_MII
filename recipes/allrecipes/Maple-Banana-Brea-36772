Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 5x9 inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, mix the melted butter and maple syrup. Beat in the egg and bananas, leaving a few small chunks. Stir in the maple extract and milk. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, and baking powder, and stir into the banana mixture just until moistened. Transfer to the prepared loaf pan. Mix the nuts and sugar, and sprinkle evenly over the batter. Bake 50 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean.
