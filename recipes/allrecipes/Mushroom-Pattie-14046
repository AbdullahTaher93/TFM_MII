Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine bread crumbs, cottage cheese, Cheddar cheese, nuts, eggs and onion soup mix in a medium size mixing bowl. Mix well. Form the mixture into patties and place one at a time in a skillet with oil. Fry until both sides of the patties are browned. In a small bowl mix mushroom soup and milk together. Place fried patties in a 9x13 inch casserole dish. Pour the milk and mushroom soup mixture over the patties. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes.
