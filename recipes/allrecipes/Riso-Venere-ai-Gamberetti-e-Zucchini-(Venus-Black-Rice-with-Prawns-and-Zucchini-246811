Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; add rice and cook until tender, about 18 minutes. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir shallot until translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir zucchini into shallot mixture. Mix prawns and white wine into zucchini mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until wine evaporates and prawns are fully cooked, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain rice and stir in chives. Toss rice with the prawn mixture and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Drizzle 1 teaspoon olive oil over mixture.
