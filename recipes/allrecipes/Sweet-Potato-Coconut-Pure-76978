In a small saucepan, simmer the coconut milk until reduced by one-quarter. In a large pot of salted water, boil the sweet potatoes until very tender. Drain well and transfer to a food processor or mixer. Add the coconut milk and nutmeg and mix together just until smooth. Season to taste with more nutmeg, salt and pepper. Serve hot.
