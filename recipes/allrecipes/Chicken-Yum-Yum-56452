Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Pat chicken breasts dry with a paper towel, and lightly season with salt. Add chicken to the pan, and reduce heat to medium. Cook for 3 minutes per side, turning once. Reduce heat to medium low. To the pan, add duck sauce, apricots, raisins, and apples. Turn chicken to coat, and continue cooking until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear. More duck sauce may be added, as desired.
