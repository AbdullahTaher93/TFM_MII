Place the ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir until the beef and onion are browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Break the meat apart as it cooks. Drain excess fat. Place the browned beef mixture into a soup pot, and stir in hominy, corn, potatoes, green chilies, salsa, diced tomatoes, and water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook until the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
