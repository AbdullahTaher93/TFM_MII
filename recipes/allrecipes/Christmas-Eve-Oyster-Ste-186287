Melt the butter in a large pot over medium-high heat; cook the onion in the melted butter until tender, about 5 minutes. Pour the oysters with their juices into the pot and bring to a boil; cook 3 minutes. Add the milk, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic powder; stir. Allow the soup to cook until heated completely through, 5 to 10 minutes.
