Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in the melted butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and ginger; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Mix butternut squash into onion mixture and pour in enough chicken broth to cover the squash. Bring broth to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until squash is tender and mashes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes. Pour squash mixture into a blender no more than half full. Remove center piece from lid and cover hole with a clean towel and hold lid down using the towel; Puree soup in batches on high until smooth. Pour pureed soup into a new pot; stir in half-and-half and season with salt and pepper. Simmer soup until warmed through, about a minute more.
