Place corn in a food processor or blender; cover and process until coarsely chopped. Set aside. In a bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, baking soda and salt. In a small bowl, combine the egg, egg whites, milk and oil. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Add the cheese, chilies and corn. Pour into a 9-in. square baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Serve warm.
