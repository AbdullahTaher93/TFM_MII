Grill or fry sausage until almost cooked through. Drain and set aside. When cooled, cut into bite-size pieces. In a large skillet combine the celery, onion, bell pepper, garlic, tomatoes, broth, rice, bay leaf and seasoning. Mix well and bring to a boil over medium high heat. Reduce heat to medium low and add sausage. Cover and simmer until rice is tender, about 40 to 45 minutes.
