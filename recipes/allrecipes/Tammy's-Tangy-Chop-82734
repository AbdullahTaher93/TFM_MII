In a shallow dish, stir together the garlic, cinnamon and soy sauce. Place the pork chops in the mixture, and marinate for 10 to 15 minutes. Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Fry pork chops in the hot oil until the juices run clear and they are crispy on the outside. This will only take about 2 minutes.
