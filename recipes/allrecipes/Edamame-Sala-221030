Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook edamame in the boiling water until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain and chill in the refrigerator. Combine Napa cabbage, bok choy, vinegar, sesame oil, and salt in a small bowl. Let sit in at room temperature until cabbage is slightly wilted, about 20 minutes. Stir edamame and carrots into cabbage mixture. Refrigerate until fully chilled, 1 hour. Top edamame salad with sesame seeds and daikon radish before serving.
