Prepare stuffing mix according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine soup and milk; set aside. Spoon about 1/4 cup stuffing onto each turkey slice. Roll up and place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Pour soup mixture over roll-ups. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes. Sprinkle with onions. Bake 5 minutes longer or until heated through.
