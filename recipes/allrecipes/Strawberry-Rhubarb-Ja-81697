Cut the strawberries into quarters or eights depending on their size. Slice the rhubarb into 1/4 inch slices. Be sure not to use much close to the leaf end of the stack. This part is extremely bitter. (The leaves are poisonous, you know.) You should have about 3 cups each of the chopped fruit. In a large heavy pot over medium heat, add the 1/4 cup of water and the rhubarb. Cover and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the cinnamon, cloves and allspice and stir. If you have pumpkin pie spice mix, you can substitute 2 tsp of that. Add the strawberries and cook until all the fruit has broken up into a mush, stir frequently. Now start adding the Splenda. Start off with about half of it. Stir well and taste. Be careful not to burn your mouth, the fruit will be very hot - so spoon out just a little and let it cool for a minute. Keep adding more and more Splenda until the desired sweetness. Add more spices now too if you'd like. Dissolve the gelatin in the 1/3 cup of boiling water. Then add this to the fruit and mix thoroughly. Pour into 3-4 jelly canning jars (or recycled jelly jars). Refrigerate for 3 or more hours before using. If you don't think you'll use up the jam within a month then keep one jar in the refrigerator and put the others in the freezer for future use.
