Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray. Stir chicken, cream cheese, and garlic powder together. Unroll crescent rolls and cut each triangle in half into 2 triangles, for a total of 16 triangles. Lay triangles out on a flat work surface. Place 1 teaspoon of the chicken mixture in the center of each dough triangle and fold corners over the mixture into the center. Place folded dough pieces onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and puffed, 12 to 14 minutes; cool before serving.
