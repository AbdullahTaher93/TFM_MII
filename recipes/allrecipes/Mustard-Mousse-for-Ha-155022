Place a mixing bowl over a pot of boiling water. Pour the mustard mixture into the bowl. Cook and stir until the thick like a custard. Remove from heat and allow to cool completely. Beat the whipping cream in a separate bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Fold the whipped cream into the mustard mixture. Lightly grease a 1 quart ring mold; pour mixture into the mold. Chill in refrigerator overnight. Serve with ham.
