Add the rice to a large saucepan of cold water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes, or cook according to the package directions; drain well. While the rice is cooking, cut the fish fillets in half lengthwise. Arrange the strips, skinned side uppermost, on a plate and spread the oyster sauce over. Sprinkle with the sugar, half of the garlic, half of the ginger, and half of the scallions; roll up the strips. Place the glasswort in a steamer and arrange the fish rolls on top. Sprinkle with the remaining chopped garlic and ginger, and add the carrot shavings. Cover and steam over high heat until the fish flakes easily and the glasswort is just tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Arrange the glasswort and flounder rolls on plates with the carrot shavings. Drizzle with the sesame oil and sprinkle with the remaining scallions and the chopped cilantro. Garnish the rice with cilantro sprigs.
