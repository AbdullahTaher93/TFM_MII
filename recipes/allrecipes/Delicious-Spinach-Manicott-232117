Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook manicotti in boiling water until nearly cooked through yet firm, about 6 minutes; drain. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix ricotta cheese, spinach, egg whites, Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, and garlic powder together in a bowl; stuff into ricotta shells. Spread enough of the pasta sauce into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish to cover completely. Arrange stuffed manicotti shells into the pan. Pour remaining pasta sauce over the stuffed shells. Cover dish tightly with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven until the filling is set and hot in the center, about 45 minutes. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Remove aluminum foil from baking dish. Sprinkle mozzarella over the manicotti. Cook under broiler until cheese is melted and slightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.
