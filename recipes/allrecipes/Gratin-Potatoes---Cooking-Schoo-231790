Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 3-quart baking dish with 1 tablespoon butter. Combine potatoes, half and half, garlic, salt, pepper, and nutmeg in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring continuously, until the mixture comes to a boil. Transfer potato mixture to the prepared baking dish. Remove garlic cloves and discard. Shake the pan to evenly distribute. Sprinkle with grated cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is golden brown and melted, and the potatoes are tender, about 40 minutes. A paring knife inserted into the center should easily pierce a potato. Allow to sit for 15 minutes before serving.
