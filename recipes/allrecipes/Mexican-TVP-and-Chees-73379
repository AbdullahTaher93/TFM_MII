In a small bowl, stir together the texturized vegetable protein and boiling water. Set aside. Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and spray with cooking spray. Add onion, and cook just until it begins to brown. Add the garlic, and cook for a minute. Stir in tomatoes and cumin. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for 5 minutes, or until thickened. Stir the TVP into the tomato sauce along with the chipotle peppers. Remove from heat, and stir in the shredded cheese. Serve as is, or use as a stuffing for peppers.
