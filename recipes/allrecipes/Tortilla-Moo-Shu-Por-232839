Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Season pork with salt and pepper and arrange on a large baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until pork is slightly pink in the center, 20 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Shred pork. Mix hoisin sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil, and cornstarch in a bowl. Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir shredded pork, ginger, green onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until vegetables are fragrant. Add hoisin sauce mixture; stir. Cover and simmer under pork is very tender and sauce is thickened, about 20 minutes. Place tortillas on a microwave-safe plate and cover with a damp paper towel. Heat in microwave until warm, about 30 seconds. Scoop about 1/2 cup pork mixture in the center of each tortilla. Top with coleslaw mix and shredded carrots; fold tortillas in half.
