In a heavy saucepan, combine sugar, water and corn syrup; cook and stir until sugar is dissolved and mixture comes to a boil. Cook over medium heat, without stirring, until a candy thermometer reads 250 degrees F (hard-ball stage). Remove from the heat. In a mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Slowly pour hot sugar mixture over egg whites, beating constantly. Add vanilla and salt. Beat until candy loses its gloss and holds its shape, about 14 minutes. Stir in fruit and nuts. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto waxed paper.
