Prepare charcoal or gas grill. Cut ham steak in 1 by 3-inch strips and place on water soaked wooden skewers. Sprinkle on Moroccan spice and olive oil. Place skewers on grill over medium heat until golden brown. Combine remaining ingredients and mix well. Set aside. Scoop peach slaw on a plate and lay kabobs on top.
