Place eggs in a pot of salted water. Bring the water to a boil, and let eggs cook in boiling water until they are hard boiled, approximately 12 minutes. Drain eggs, and let cool. Remove the egg yolks and mash them together with whites in a small mixing bowl. Mix in paprika, mayonnaise, and dry mustard. Mound on a platter in the shape of an oval egg. Sprinkle with rows of chopped olives, pickles, crisp bacon, green onion, and parsley. Surround with Townhouse(R) or other Keebler(R) Crackers.
