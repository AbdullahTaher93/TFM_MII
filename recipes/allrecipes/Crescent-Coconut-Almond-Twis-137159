Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease cookie sheet. Reserve 1 tablespoon almonds for garnish. Place remaining almonds in food storage plastic bag; crush with rolling pin. In medium bowl, combine brown sugar and butter; mix well. Stir in coconut, flour, 1 teaspoon almond extract, egg white and crushed almonds; mix well. Unroll dough into 2 long rectangles. Firmly press perforations to seal. Press each to form 12x4-inch rectangle. Spread half of almond mixture in 2-inch-wide strip lengthwise down center of each rectangle to within 1/4 inch of each end. Fold sides over filling; pinch edges to seal. With rolls side by side and starting at one end, carefully overlap rolls 2 times to form 1 twist; press ends to seal. Place twist on greased cookie sheet. In small bowl, combine egg yolk and water; beat well. Brush over twist. Bake at 350 degrees F for 19 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool 10 minutes. Remove from cookie sheet; place on wire rack. In small bowl, combine powdered sugar, milk and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract; blend until smooth. Drizzle over twist. Garnish with reserved almonds.
