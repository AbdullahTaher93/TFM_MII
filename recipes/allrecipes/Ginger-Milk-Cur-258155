Place minced ginger in a small sieve or tea strainer over a bowl; press well to extract the ginger juice. Discard solids. Combine milk and sugar in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave for 1 minute. Stir and heat in microwave until it simmers, about 1 minute more. Stir ginger juice into the warmed milk. Let stand until set, about 5 minutes.
