Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Toss sweet potato wedges with 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large bowl; season with sea salt and paprika and toss again. Spread sweet potatoes in a single layer onto a baking sheet. Bake sweet potatoes in the preheated oven until soft, about 20 minutes. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir green onions with curry powder in the hot oil until softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir ketchup into the mixture and transfer to a bowl. Serve sweet potatoes with curry ketchup for dipping.
