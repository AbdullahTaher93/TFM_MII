Toss together the lettuce, spinach, celery, mushrooms, eggs, peas, bell pepper, green onions, and water chestnuts in a 9x13 inch dish. Mix the mayonnaise, sour cream, and sugar in a bowl, and spread evenly over the salad to the edges of the dish. Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese, and top with bacon. Cover and refrigerate 24 hours before serving.
