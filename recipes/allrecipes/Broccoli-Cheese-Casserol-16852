Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart casserole dish. Place broccoli in saucepan with 2 tablespoons water. Bring water to a boil; reduce heat to medium. Cover; cook 5 minutes. Uncover; cook 2 to 3 more minutes, separating broccoli occasionally. Drain well. In a small pot, cook cheese and soup together until smooth. Combine cheese and soup, broccoli, water chestnuts, and rice in the casserole dish. Cover with almonds. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes, or until the casserole is bubbly.
