Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Combine the oil, maple syrup, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a bowl; stir to combine. Place both types of oats in a large bowl; stir to combine. Add the oil/syrup/spice mixture and stir until oats are evenly coated. Spread oat mixture on a rimmed baking sheet or large jelly roll pan. Place oats in the oven and bake for 10 minutes. Immediately turn off the oven and leave the granola inside to finish baking (do not open the oven door). Allow oats to "slow bake" as the oven cools, at least 2 1/2 hours or overnight. When cool, break up large clumps of oats. Serve the granola with coconut milk beverage or sprinkle on coconut milk yogurt. Store leftover granola in an airtight container at room temperature.
