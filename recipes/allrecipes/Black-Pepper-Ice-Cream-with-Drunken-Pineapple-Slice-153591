For Ice Cream: Combine 3/4 cup milk, vanilla, lime peel, juice and sweetened condensed milk in a bowl; set aside. Heat 1-1/4 cups milk and pepper in a heavy saucepan over medium heat for 5 to 8 minutes, stirring constantly to avoid scorching. Do not let mixture boil. Remove from heat; cover and let stand for 10 minutes. Strain milk mixture through cheesecloth or fine sieve; discard solids. Whisk egg yolks in a medium bowl. Gradually add hot milk mixture, stirring constantly with whisk. Return milk mixture to saucepan and add sugar. Cook over medium heat stirring constantly until mixture coats back of metal spoon, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and gradually add in milk and lime mixture. Cover and chill completely. Freeze ice cream according to manufacturer's directions. For pineapple slices: Preheat broiler. Heat brown sugar and rum in a small sauce pan over medium heat until sugar is dissolved completely. Spray broiler pan with non-stick cooking spray or brush with vegetable oil. Place pineapple slices on broiler pan; baste with rum sauce. Broil two minutes on each side until lightly brown. To serve: place pineapple slice on dessert plate; top with a scoop of ice cream.
