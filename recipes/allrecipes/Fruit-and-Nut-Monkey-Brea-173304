Add dough ingredients to bread machine pan in the order suggested by manufacturer. Select dough/manual cycle. If not using a bread machine, combine dough ingredients in the following manner: stir together all dry ingredients (including undissolved yeast), then add remaining ingredients for dough using a mixer. Mix until a soft dough is formed. Turn dough out on lightly floured surface and knead for 8 to 10 minutes until dough is smooth and elastic. Cover with a towel and let dough rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, combine glaze ingredients in medium bowl. Stir to blend. Pour 1/3 of glaze on bottom of greased 12-cup tube pan.* When bread machine cycle is complete, transfer dough to a lightly floured surface. Divide into 36 equal pieces; roll each piece into a smooth ball. Arrange balls in 3 layers in prepared pan; pour remaining glaze in between layers. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40 to 45 minutes or until done. Cool in pan on wire rack 5 minutes; invert onto serving tray. Serve warm.
