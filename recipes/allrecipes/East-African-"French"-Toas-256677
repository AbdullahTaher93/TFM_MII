Whisk eggs and milk together in a large bowl. Season with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Stir in tomatoes, onion, green chile peppers, and cilantro. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip 4 breads slice briefly in the egg mixture and place in the skillet. Ladle some of the egg mixture over each slice using a spoon. Cook until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip and press down with a spatula; cook until second side is browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with remaining slices.
