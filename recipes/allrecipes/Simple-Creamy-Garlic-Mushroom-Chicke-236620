Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in hot oil until slightly softened and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add chicken pieces; season with salt, white pepper, and black pepper. Cook and stir chicken until no longer pink in the middle, 7 to 10 minutes; transfer to an 8-inch square baking dish. Stir condensed soup, mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, corn, sour cream, and milk together in a bowl; pour over chicken in the baking dish. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the top. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and cheese is melted, about 20 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
