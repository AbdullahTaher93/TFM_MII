Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Using an electric mixer, combine the flour, butter and sugar. Press the dough evenly into a 9-inch square baking pan. Bake until golden around the edges, 18 to 20 minutes. Let the shortbread cool slightly in the pan, then cut into16 squares and transfer to a rack to cool completely.
