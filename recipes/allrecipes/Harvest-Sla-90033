In a medium ungreased skillet, over medium heat, toast the pecans by stirring frequently until golden brown. Set aside to cool. In a large bowl, combine coleslaw mix, carrots, grapes, pecans, and feta cheese. In a small bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, and Ranch dressing. Pour in sugar, and mix until dissolved. Toss coleslaw mixture with dressing until evenly coated. Serve immediately, or cover and chill in refrigerator.
