Whisk together the cornstarch and water in a small bowl. Mix in the soy sauce and olive oil, and set aside. Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Saute the carrot, pepper, and zucchini in oil for about 5 minutes. Stir in the corn, garlic, green onions, and bean sprouts. Pour in the soy sauce mixture. Cook and stir for about 5 minutes, or until vegetables are tender but crisp. Serve immediately.
