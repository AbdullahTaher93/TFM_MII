Position rack in top third of oven; preheat broiler. Coat a broiler pan with cooking spray. Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan. Stir in barley, reduce to a simmer and cook until tender, 10 to 12 minutes or according to package directions. Remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes. Meanwhile, combine red peppers, reserved pineapple juice, tomato paste, 2 teaspoons oregano and cumin in a food processor or blender and puree until smooth. Transfer the sauce to a small saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened slightly, 5 to 6 minutes. Combine the cooked barley, chopped pineapple, the remaining 2 teaspoons oregano, lamb, jalapeno, garlic powder, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Shape the mixture into 6 patties and transfer to the broiler pan. Broil until cooked through, 3 to 6 minutes per side. Serve the burgers on buns, topped with the sauce.
