In a 10- to 12-inch pan over medium-high heat, heat olive oil. When oil is hot, add onion and raisins; stirring, cook until just soft, about 3 minutes. Add potato cubes and cover. Cook 3 minutes, then add about 1/4 cup broth to release potato from pan bottom. Using a spatula, scrape potato and brown bits from pan. Cover and cook 3 more minutes, then add 1/4 cup broth and scrape pan bottom. Repeat this step one more time. Add broccoli and remaining broth. Cover pan and cook 3 more minutes or until broccoli is just tender to bite. Remove pan from heat. Stir parsley into broccoli-potato mixture. In a second 10- to 12-inch pan over high heat, add one tortilla at a time to heat, turning to brown lightly. When both sides of the tortilla are golden, sprinkle 1/4 cup shredded cheese on tortilla. Transfer tortilla to dinner plate and top with 1/4 of the broccoli-potato mixture. Fold tortilla edges over filling and roll up tightly to enclose; keep warm while cooking remaining tortillas. Serve, offering salt and pepper to add as desired.
