Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash. Prepare stuffing as directed. Place the stuffing in a 2 quart baking dish. Layer with turkey and cover with 1 cup gravy. Top with mashed potatoes and the remaining gravy. Bake covered in the preheated oven 45 minutes, or until bubbly and lightly browned.
