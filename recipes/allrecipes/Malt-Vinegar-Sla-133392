In a large bowl, combine the cabbage, radicchio, carrot and onion. In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, malt vinegar, granulated sugar and lemon juice and season to taste with salt, pepper and hot sauce. Toss the slaw with the dressing, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, then toss with the sunflower seeds.
