Remove all silk from corn and cut raw corn from the cob over a large bowl. Scrape the juice from the cobs into the bowl as well. Discard cobs. Stir in the eggs, flour and salt to form a batter the consistency of thin pancake batter. Heat oil in an electric skillet to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). If using a large skillet on the stove, preheat oil to medium high heat. There should be enough oil in the pan to cover the fritter. Use a large serving spoon to make 4 pancake sized fritters at the same time. Fry for about 5 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve warm.
