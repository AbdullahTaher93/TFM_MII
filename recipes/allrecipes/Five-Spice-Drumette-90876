Rinse chicken and pat dry. In a large bowl, stir together soy sauce, sherry, honey, oil, five-spice, and garlic; add chicken and stir to coat evenly. Lift chicken pieces from glaze (reserve any remaining glaze) and arrange in a single layer in 2 shallow 10- by 15-inch baking pans. Bake, uncovered, in a 500 degree oven until chicken is dark brown and meat near bone is no longer pink; cut to test (22 to 25 minutes). Halfway through baking time, switch positions of pans and brush chicken with reserved glaze. If necessary, add 1 tablespoon water to each pan near end of baking time to prevent scorching.
