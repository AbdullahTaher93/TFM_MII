In a Dutch oven or large saucepan, cook cranberries in butter until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients. Cover and cook over medium-low heat until cabbage is wilted, about 5-7 minutes. Transfer to a greased 2-qt. baking dish. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour or until tender. Serve with a slotted spoon.
