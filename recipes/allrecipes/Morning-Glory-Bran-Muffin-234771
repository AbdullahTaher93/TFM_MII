Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly spray 12 (2 1/2-inch/6.5cm) non-stick muffin pan cups with cooking spray. In medium bowl, combine cereal and milk. Let stand for about 2 minutes or until cereal softens. In large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and salt. Set aside. Add egg, oil and carrot to cereal mixture; beat well. Add liquid mixture to dry ingredients, stirring only until just combined. Fold in mixture of raisins, almonds, sunflower seeds and 1/4 cup (50 mL) coconut. Portion batter evenly into prepared muffin cups. Sprinkle each with portion of remaining coconut. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes or until tops spring back when lightly touched.
