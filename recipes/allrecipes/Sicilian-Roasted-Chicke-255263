Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan with cooking spray. Arrange chicken pieces in the baking pan. Sprinkle salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and oregano over both sides. Roast in the preheated oven until chicken is browned and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
