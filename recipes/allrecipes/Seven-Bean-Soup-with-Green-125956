Pick over and rinse all the beans. Place in a large saucepot and cover with 3 inches of water. Cover and let stand overnight. Drain. Rinse and dry the pot. Heat the oil in the pot over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, onions, and celery and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes, or until soft. Add the Italian seasoning and pepper and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the beans, split peas, and water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 1/2 hours, or until the beans are tender. (The black beans will take the longest to cook, so use them as a guide.) Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, greens, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes longer, or until the greens are tender. Stir in the basil.
