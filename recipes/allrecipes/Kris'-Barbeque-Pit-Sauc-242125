Stir vinegar, brown sugar, white sugar, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, salt, black pepper, red pepper, and hot pepper sauce together in a saucepan; bring to a boil, place a cover on the saucepan, reduce heat to medium-low. Cook sauce at a simmer, stirring occasionally, until sugars dissolve completely and sauce is thick, about 15 minutes. Stir ketchup into the sauce until smooth.
