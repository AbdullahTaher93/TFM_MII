Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer ground beef mixture, using a slotted spoon, to a 2-quart casserole dish; retain drippings in the skillet. Spread cream of mushroom soup over ground beef mixture. Cook and stir mushrooms in the beef drippings over medium heat until tender and browned, 5 to 10 minutes; spread over soup layer in casserole dish. Arrange snap peas over mushroom layer; cover with American cheese slices. Layer potatoes over cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and potatoes are browned and crisp, about 1 hour.
