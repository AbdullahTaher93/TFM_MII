In a large bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, oil, water, mustard, oregano, and black pepper. Add the steak, bell pepper, and mushrooms, tossing to coat. Alternately thread the steak, bell pepper, and mushrooms on each of 4 metal skewers. Set aside. Prepare the rice according to package directions. Keep warm. Meanwhile, place the kabobs on a grill over medium coals. Grill uncovered, turning occasionally for 8 to 11 minutes or until a meat thermometer measures 145 degrees F (for medium-rare). Mix the toasted pine nuts into the rice. Serve the kabobs over the rice mixture, allowing 1/2 cup rice per serving.
