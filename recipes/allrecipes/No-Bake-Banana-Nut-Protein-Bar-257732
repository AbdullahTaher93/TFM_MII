Line an 8x8-inch pan with parchment paper or plastic wrap. Combine dates, banana, and vanilla extract in a large food processor until smooth, about 1 minute. Add 3/4 cup oats, walnuts, almonds, flax seed, cinnamon, and salt; blend. Scrape sides down and add remaining 1/4 cup oats and protein powder; process until mixture is well combined and thick, about 1 minute. Stir in chocolate chips. Spoon mixture into prepared pan; press into pan using wet hands until even. Freeze until solid, at least 2 to 3 hours. Slice into 10 bars.
