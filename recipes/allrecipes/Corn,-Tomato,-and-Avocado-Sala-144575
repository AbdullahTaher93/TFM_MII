Prepare an ice bath; set aside. Cover, and bring a large pot of cold water to a boil over high heat. Add corn, and let simmer, uncovered, until just tender, about 2 minutes. Drain the corn, and transfer to the ice-water bath. When cool, remove from the ice bath. Using a large knife, remove kernels; set aside. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper; set aside. In a large bowl, combine corn, tomatoes, and basil. Drizzle with half of the dressing, and toss to coat. Gently fold in the diced avocado. Place arugula in a medium bowl. Drizzle with remaining dressing, and toss to coat. Transfer to a large platter. Arrange vegetable mixture over arugula. Shave ricotta salata over salad. Serve immediately.
