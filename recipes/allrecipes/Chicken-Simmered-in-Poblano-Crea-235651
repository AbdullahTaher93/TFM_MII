Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the carrot and cook for 2 minutes or until tender-crisp, stirring occasionally. Add the onion and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the chicken and cook for 8 minutes or until well browned on both sides. Remove the chicken and vegetables from the skillet. Stir the soup and water in the skillet and heat to a boil. Return the chicken to the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Season with the salt and black pepper. To serve, spoon the soup mixture over the chicken. Top with the vegetables, chile and red pepper, if desired. Serve with the rice.
