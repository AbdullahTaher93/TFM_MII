In a medium-sized bowl, toss together cabbage, mango and cilantro. Roast tenderloin in oven at 425 degrees F for 25 to 30 minutes until internal temperature reaches 150 degrees F. Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes then slice. In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, lime juice, sriracha and salt. Pour over cabbage mixture and toss to coat. To assemble the sandwiches, halve the rolls then top with a few rounds of pork and a heap of the spicy mango slaw.
