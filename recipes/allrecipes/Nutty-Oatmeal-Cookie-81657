Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, mix together the whey, almond meal, Splenda, flax, baking powder and cinnamon. Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the mixing bowl along with the coconut oil. Using a pastry blender or two knives or your fingers, blend the butter into the dry mixture keeping it light and fluffy. (I prefer using my fingers, smashing the pieces of butter until well incorporated with no noticeable pieces of butter remaining.) Lightly beat the egg with the vanilla extract. Pour into the mixing bowl. Stir until well blended. It's hard to find unsalted macadamia nuts, so I am assuming that yours are lightly salted, which would be too much for this recipe. However, if yours are unsalted then you'll need to add about 1/2 tsp or salt to the recipe. Wet 1 or 2 paper towels and squeeze out all the excess water. Then in batch rub the macadamia nuts in the paper towel to remove some of the salt. Coarsely chop using a good knife. A food processor will chop too finely for this recipe. Drop about 1 rounded tablespoon of the batter onto a parchment lined cookie sheet. Flatten the batter a bit, unless you prefer cake like cookies then leave them mounded. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until cookies have a golden color and just start to turn brown along the edges. Transfer to a cookie rack and then repeat with the remaining batter.
