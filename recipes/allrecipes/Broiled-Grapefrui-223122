Preheat broiler. Slice each grapefruit in half. Remove center core; slice between each segment. Place grapefruit, cut side up, in shallow baking dish. Press 1 1/2 teaspoons butter into center of each grapefruit half (where core was removed). Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon sugar, then 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon sugar. Place on top shelf under broiler; broil 4-5 minutes or until sugar is bubbling and edges of grapefruit begin to brown. Serve warm.
