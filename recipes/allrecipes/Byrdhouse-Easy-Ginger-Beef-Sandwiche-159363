Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the sirloin strips, and cook a few minutes until the strips begin to brown, but are still a little pink. Stir in the onion and garlic; cook for 2 minutes. Add the celery and ginger, continue cooking until the onion has softened, about 3 minutes. Season with soy sauce and chili oil. Divide among hoagie rolls and serve.
