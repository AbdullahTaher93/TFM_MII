Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain. Rinse macaroni with cold water until cooled completely; drain and transfer to a large bowl. Mix black beans, tuna, mayonnaise, green onions, bacon bits, lemon juice, and black pepper with the macaroni. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled.
