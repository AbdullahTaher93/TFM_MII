Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Heat butter (or cooking oil) in skillet over medium-high heat. Brown meat on both sides (about 3 minutes per side). Remove meat to a deep casserole dish (preferably one with a lid). The meat should just fit inside without a lot of extra room. And the dish should be at least 1/2 inch deeper than the meat is thick. With the heat turned off, deglaze the skillet by adding the water and scraping up all the brown bits off the bottom of the skillet using a wooden spoon or a spatula. Add the vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, bay leaf, onion powder, ginger, sweetener, salt and pepper. Stir and then pour over the pot roast. Cover securely with a lid or aluminum foil. Cook at 300 degrees F for 3 hours. If convenient, half way through the cooking time, turn the meat over (especially if the liquids do not cover the meat). Remove liquids from casserole dish. Discard the bay leaf. Boil the liquids until reduced by about half. Let the roast rest for about 10 minutes. Cut meat away from the bone and place on serving platter. Pour some of the juices over the meat. Garnish with sour cream and parsley. (Serve extra juices on the side).
