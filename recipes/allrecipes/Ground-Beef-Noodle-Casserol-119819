In a small bowl, combine gravy mix and water until smooth; set aside. In a large skillet, cook the beef, onion and garlic over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Add spaghetti sauce, cream, seasonings and gravy; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer 15 minutes. Add the noodles and 1/3 cup of Parmesan cheese; mix well. Transfer to a greased 3-qt. baking dish; sprinkle with remaining Parmesan. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes or until heated through.
