Place quinoa in a saucepan. Pour 2 cups water over quinoa; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover. Simmer until quinoa is tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain; cool. Combine lemon juice and olive oil in a small bowl; stir until dressing is combined. Pour half of the quinoa into a large salad bowl. Add 1 handful of baby spinach; stir together. Add 1 handful of walnuts, feta cheese, and strawberries; stir until mixed. Repeat layering and stirring quinoa, spinach, feta cheese, and strawberries until all ingredients are mixed together. Top with dressing.
