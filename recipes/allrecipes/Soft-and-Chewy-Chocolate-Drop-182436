Cookies: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Microwave unsweetened chocolate and butter in large microwaveable bowl on HIGH 2 min. or until butter is melted. Stir until chocolate is completely melted. Add sugar; mix well. Blend in eggs and vanilla. Add flour; mix well. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour or until dough is easy to handle.

Cool completely. Glaze: Place frozen whipped topping and semi-sweet chocolate in microwaveable bowl.

Let stand until glaze is set.
