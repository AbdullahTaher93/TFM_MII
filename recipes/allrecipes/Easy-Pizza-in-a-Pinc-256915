To make the sauce, combine tomato sauce, garlic, 3 teaspoons herbs, paprika, salt and pepper in a sauce pan over medium-high heat. When sauce bubbles, reduce to a low simmer and stir. Cover and allow to simmer over very low heat for 15 minutes. Crumble Italian sausage in a pan and cook over medium heat until no longer pink, about 15 minutes. Drain over paper towels. Set aside. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Mix olive oil, garlic and 1 teaspoon herb blend in a small bowl. Open hot dog buns and arrange on sheet pans covered in foil. Separate buns in halves along the folds if you want to make 16 appetizers; leave whole if you want to make 8 pizzas. Brush the buns with the olive oil mixture. Toast buns in the oven for about 5 minutes, just until edges begin to brown. Remove pan from oven and spread each of the buns with the warm tomato sauce. Top with browned Italian sausage, pepperoni slices, mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Return pan to the oven and bake at 400 degrees F for 5 to 10 minutes or until cheeses are bubbling. Serve garnished with fresh oregano leaves and crushed red pepper, if desired.
