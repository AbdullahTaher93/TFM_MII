Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread the olive oil over the pizza crust, then sprinkle with the smoked salmon, artichokes, and sun-dried tomatoes. Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese evenly over the pizza. Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese has melted and is bubbly, 10 to 15 minutes.
