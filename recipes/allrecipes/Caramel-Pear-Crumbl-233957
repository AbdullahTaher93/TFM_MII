Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray an 8 x 8-inch pan with non-stick cooking spray. Microwave caramels and milk in a microwave-safe bowl on HIGH 2 minutes, or until melted, stirring after 1 minute. Mix the flour, oats, brown sugar, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Stir in the melted butter until crumbly. Press half of oat mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking pan. Reserve the rest. Bake the crust for 9 minutes. Sprinkle crust with walnuts and chopped pears. Pour the caramel mixture over pears and then crumble the remaining crust mixture over the caramel layer. Return to the oven and bake for an additional 20 minutes, or until the top is lightly toasted. Spoon into dessert cups while it is still warm or chill and cut into bars.
