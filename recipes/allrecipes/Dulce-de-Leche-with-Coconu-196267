Spray a 3X5 inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Set aside. Cook LACTAID(R) Reduced-fat Milk and sugar in a 4 quart pot for over medium-low heat for 35-45 minutes. Milk mixture will thicken and turn caramel in color. Remove pot from heat and stir in coconut. Spoon dulce de leche into prepared pan. Chill 50-60 minutes or until firm enough to cut into soft squares.
