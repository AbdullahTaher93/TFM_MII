In a 12-inch deep skillet heat the olive oil over medium heat, then add the mushrooms, squash, zucchini, onion, garlic and salt. Cook and stir for 5 to 6 minutes or until just tender, then stir in the Meat Sauce and reduce heat to a low simmer. Meanwhile, bring 4 to 6 quarts of water to a rolling boil, adding salt to taste along with the Rigatoni, and stir gently. Cook pasta according to package directions. Remove from heat and drain well. Stir the pasta into the Meat Sauce mixture in the skillet. Serve topped with Parmesan.
