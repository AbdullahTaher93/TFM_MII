For rice. Combine olive oil and onion in a 3- to 4-quart pan over medium-high heat; stir often until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add cumin and cardamom; stir just until spices are fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in rice to coat, then add broth. Bring to a boil. Lower heat, cover, and cook 35 minutes. Stir in apricots and cranberries, then cover and continue cooking until liquid is fully absorbed, 10 to 15 minutes more. Stir in pistachios, season to taste with salt and pepper if desired, and keep warm. For chicken. While rice cooks, preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Sprinkle chicken on both sides with salt to taste. Arrange chicken, skin side up, on a rimmed, foil-lined baking sheet. Bake in center of oven until meat is no longer pink in thickest part (cut to test) or until a meat thermometer inserted in thickest part of breast registers 165 degrees F, 25 to 30 minutes. When chicken is almost done, combine jam and mustard together in a small saucepan. Stir over low heat until melted, about 3 minutes. Season with pepper and remove from heat. When chicken has finished baking, brush pieces equally with jam-mustard glaze. Broil chicken, about 6 inches from heat, until glaze bubbles and skin turns deep golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent burning. To serve, spoon rice onto a platter or individual plates. Top with chicken.
