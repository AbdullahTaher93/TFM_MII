Place roast in large self-sealing bag. In small bowl, whisk together remaining ingredients, pour over pork. Seal bag and toss gently. Refrigerate 8-24 hours, turning bag occasionally. Prepare a medium to medium-low, banked fire in covered kettle-style grill (for gas grill, heat only one side). Remove pork from marinade, reserving marinade. Grill pork over indirect heat, basting occasionally with reserved marinade, until internal temperature (measured with a meat thermometer) is 150-155 degrees F., about one hour. Remove pork from grill (discard any remaining marinade) and let roast rest 10 minutes before slicing to serve. Roasted Pepper Vinaigrette: Slice drained peppers 1/4-inch thick; toss with shallots in medium bowl. In small bowl, whisk together vinegar, sherry, oil, salt and pepper; drizzle over peppers, toss, add parsley and toss gently. Set aside.
