In a microwave safe bowl, add the broccoli and zap for 2 minutes to defrost. Add the almonds and zap another 2 minutes to cook (times may vary depending on microwave). Meanwhile, in a small bowl mix together the mayo, sour cream and mustard. When the broccoli is done, pour off the liquids (the chef gets to drink this!) and toss broccoli with the dressing. Serve immediately.
