In a bowl, combine the egg, oats, salt and pepper. Crumble turkey over mixture and mix well. Pat into a 12-in. x 9-in. rectangle on a piece of heavy-duty foil; set aside. In a saucepan, saute onion and celery in butter until tender. Remove from the heat. Stir in water, sage and thyme. Add stuffing; mix well. Spoon over turkey to within 1 in. of edges. Roll up, jelly-roll style, starting with a short side and peeling away foil while rolling. Place loaf, seam side down, in a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Place bacon strips over top. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 60-70 minutes or until meat is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 165 degrees F.
