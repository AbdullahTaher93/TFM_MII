In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, whisk egg, milk and oil; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Drain cherries, reserving 2 tablespoons of juice for glaze (discard remaining juice or save for another use). Chop cherries; fold chips, pecans and cherries into the batter. Drop by tablespoonfuls into greased or paper-lined heart-shaped or miniature muffin cups. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-13 minutes or until muffins test done. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pans to wire racks. Combine confectioners' sugar and reserved cherry juice to make a thin glaze; drizzle over muffins. Serve with cream cheese if desired.
