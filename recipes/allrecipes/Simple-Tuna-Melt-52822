Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, combine tuna, minced onion, and black pepper. Divide mixture onto 4 halves of English Muffins. Arrange 3 slices jalapenos on each muffin half. Top each with a slice of Cheddar cheese. Place on baking sheet. Bake in oven for 10 minutes, or until cheese begins to bubble.
