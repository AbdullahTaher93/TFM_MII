In a mixing bowl, combine dry cake mix, egg, butter and pecans. Press into a greased 13-in. x 9-in.x 2-in. baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool completely (as crust cools, it will fall in the center to form a shell). In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar for 2 minutes. Fold in 1 cup whipped topping. Spread over crust. Refrigerate for 10 minutes. In a mixing bowl, beat milk and pudding mix on low speed for 2 minutes. Beat in nutmeg and extract. Spread over cream cheese layer. Top with remaining whipped topping. Sprinkle with pecans. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
