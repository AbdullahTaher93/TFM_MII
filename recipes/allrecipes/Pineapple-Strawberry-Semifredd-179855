Line a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving a 4- to 5-inch overhang on all sides. In a blender or food processor, combine strawberries, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1 tablespoon rum. Whirl until smoothly pureed. In a small bowl, stir together pineapple and remaining 2 tablespoon rum. In a large bowl, with an electric mixer on high speed, beat whipping cream until it begins to thicken. With the beaters running, gradually add remaining sugar and continue beating until soft peaks form. Transfer about 1/3 of the whipped cream to another bowl. Add the pineapple mixture to this bowl and fold gently to blend. Add strawberry puree to remaining whipped cream and fold gently until no white streaks remain. Spoon pineapple mixture into prepared loaf pan; smooth top. Spoon strawberry mixture gently and evenly over the pineapple; smooth top. Cover with plastic wrap (from overhang). Freeze until firm, about 8 hours or up to 5 days. Before serving, remove semifreddo from freezer, unfold plastic wrap from top, and unmold semifreddo onto a plate. (If semifreddo sticks, run pan briefly under warm water to release.) Peel off plastic wrap. Cut semifreddo into slices, dipping knife in warm water between slices. Place slices on dessert plates, garnish with strawberries, and serve immediately.
