To make cookie tortillas: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Coat 2 baking sheets with cooking spray. Line them with parchment paper or foil and coat again. Whisk flour, cinnamon and salt in a small bowl. Whisk egg white, 1/4 cup sugar, butter, oil and vanilla in a mixing bowl until smooth. Add the dry ingredients and whisk until blended. Drop the batter by scant tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets; allow for 3 cookies per baking sheet. With a metal spatula or the back of a spoon, spread each mound of batter into a circle 4 to 4 1/2 inches in diameter. Bake the cookies one sheet at a time, until lightly browned, about 7 to 9 minutes. Immediately lift the parchment or foil from the baking sheet and place it on the counter. Carefully slip a flat metal spatula under each cookie to loosen it. Return the cookies to the baking sheet and place in the oven for about 1 minute to soften. Drape the cookies over a clean wooden dowel or broom handle, about 1 inch in diameter. Let cool. To make salsa & assemble tacos: Combine 2 tablespoons sugar, lime juice, tequila and orange liqueur, if using, in a medium bowl; stir to dissolve the sugar. Add pineapple, mango and strawberries and toss gently. Just before serving, spoon the fruit salsa into the tortilla cookies and garnish with toasted coconut, if using, and a cilantro or mint sprig.
