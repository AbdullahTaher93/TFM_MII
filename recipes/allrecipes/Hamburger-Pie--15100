Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Crumble ground chuck into a large skillet and saute over medium heat for 2 minutes. Add onion, and saute until meat is no longer pink and onion is beginning to brown. Drain grease. In a large bowl, mix together cream cheese, vegetables, cream of celery soup, and ketchup. Add hamburger and stir until ingredients are thoroughly combined. Spread mixture evenly into a large casserole dish. Place biscuit dough on top, allowing room for biscuits to spread without touching. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, until biscuits are browned and fluffy.
