Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the onions in the heated oil until clear, but not brown. Add tomatoes, chicken broth, and basil; bring to a boil. Stir in rice and return to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer until the liquid is completely absorbed into the rice, about 20 minutes.
