In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over high heat, bring clam juice, wine, and fish to a simmer. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until fish is opaque in center (cut to test), about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spatula, transfer fish to a platter; keep warm. Boil pan juices, uncovered, over high heat until reduced to 1 cup, 4 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together cornstarch, horseradish, and 1 tablespoon water. Whisk cornstarch mixture and mustard into fish broth; stir until boiling. Pour into a bowl. Serve fish, offering sauce to add to taste.
