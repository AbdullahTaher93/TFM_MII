In a saucepan, bring sugar and water to a boil. Add cranberries and cook until they pop, about 4-6 minutes. Add orange juice, peel, butter, cinnamon and salt. Cook 5 minutes more or until mixture thickens. Remove from the heat; stir in walnuts and set aside. In a bowl, combine the flour and salt; cut in butter until crumbly. Add sugar and oats; mix well. Spoon half into an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan; pat firmly into pan. Spread filling evenly over crust. Top with remaining crumb mixture; pat lightly. Bake at 400 degrees F for 30-35 minutes. Cool.
