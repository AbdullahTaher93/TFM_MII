Preheat oven to 400 degrees F Combine cumin, oregano, 1/2 tsp. salt, and pepper in cup. Rinse chicken; pat dry with paper towels. Rub spices onto chicken. Wash hands. Heat large nonstick skillet with tight-fitting lid. Add chicken, skin-side down, and cook over high heat 3 minutes per side or until browned. Remove chicken from skillet and set aside. Remove all but 1 tsp. drippings from skillet; add bell pepper and onion. Cook over medium-high heat until vegetables are golden, 4 minutes. Add diced tomatoes, beans, and remaining 1/4 tsp. salt; bring to a boil. Return chicken to skillet; transfer skillet to oven, cover and bake 20 minutes or until juices run clear when thickest part of chicken is pierced or temperature on instant-read thermometer reaches 180 degrees F. Serve with rice. (Refrigerate leftovers.)
