Combine water, honey, cloves, cinnamon stick and cardamom in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer until slightly reduced and syrupy, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes. Pour the syrup through a fine sieve into a bowl. Discard the spices. Add mango, kiwi, pear, lime segments, dried cherries and orange zest. Stir gently to combine. Just before serving, add mint, if desired. Serve the fruit warm, at room temperature or chilled.
