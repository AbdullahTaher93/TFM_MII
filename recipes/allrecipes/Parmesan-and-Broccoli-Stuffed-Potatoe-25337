Wash potatoes and pierce with a fork. Microwave on high for 15 minutes, or until done. Place broccoli in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water, and cover. Cook until tender but still firm, about 2 to 6 minutes. Drain. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice the tops off of the potatoes, and scoop the flesh into a large bowl with the broccoli. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir in cheese sauce and mash mixture until desired consistency is reached, adding more sauce if desired. Spoon mixture back into the skins, and place on a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
