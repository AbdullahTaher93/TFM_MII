Stir rice, eggs, tapioca, green onion, and salt together in a bowl. Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Spoon about 1/3 cup of the rice mixture into hot oil; fry until well-browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat until all batter is used.
