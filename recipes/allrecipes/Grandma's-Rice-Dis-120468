In a large skillet, cook the beef, onion and green pepper over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the rice, tomatoes, corn, olives, bacon, chili powder, garlic powder and salt. Bring to a boil; remove from the heat. Add 1 cup of cheese; stir until melted. Transfer to a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Toss bread crumbs with butter; sprinkle over top. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until cheese is melted.
