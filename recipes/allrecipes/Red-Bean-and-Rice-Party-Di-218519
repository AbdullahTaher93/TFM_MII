Prepare Rice Mix as directed on package, using 3 cups water instead of 3 1/4 cups. Reserve 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese to garnish dip, if desired. Stir remaining ingredients into rice mixture. Place mixture into food processor or blender; cover. Process or blend until smooth. Keep dip warm in a chaffing dish or slow cooker, if desired.
