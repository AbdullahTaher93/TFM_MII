Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Mix meat and MIRACLE WHIP. Shape into four patties; set aside. Heat 1 Tbsp. of the Italian dressing in large nonstick skillet. Add onions; cook on medium-high heat 10 min. or until onions are golden brown and tender, stirring occasionally. Remove from skillet. Add patties; cook on medium heat 5 min. on each side or until cooked through (160 degrees F). Spray baking sheet with cooking spray. Brush bread with the remaining 2 Tbsp. Italian dressing. Place 4 of the bread slices, dressing-sides down, on prepared baking sheet; top evenly with the 2% Milk Singles, onions and meat patties. Cover with the remaining bread slices, dressing-sides up. Bake 20 min., turning sandwiches after 10 min.
