Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups, or line with paper muffin liners. Mix self-rising flour and vanilla ice cream together until smooth. Spoon batter in muffin cups, filling them 3/4 full. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
