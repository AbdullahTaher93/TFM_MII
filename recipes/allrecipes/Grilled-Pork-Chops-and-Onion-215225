In a zip-top bag* or a large container with a lid, combine the pork, onions and 1 cup Mojo. Seal bag and transfer to refrigerator; chill at least 3 hours, or overnight. Prepare a grill to medium-high heat, or heat a large, lightly-greased grill pan over medium-high heat. Remove pork and onions from the marinade; discard any leftover liquid. Season pork with Adobo. Cook pork until golden brown and internal temperature registers 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) on a quick-read thermometer, basting with remaining mojo, flipping once, 15 to 20 minutes. Cook onions until soft and golden brown, about 10 minutes. Divide pork and onions evenly among serving dishes.
