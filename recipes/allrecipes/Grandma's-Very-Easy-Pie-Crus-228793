Sift flour and salt into a bowl. Pour vegetable oil into a 1-cup measure and fill the measure with milk up to the 7-ounce mark. Whisk oil and milk together and pour immediately into the bowl with flour. Mix the crust together with a fork just until it holds together. Do not knead. Divide crust in half, form into balls, and roll each half out between sheets of waxed paper. Peel waxed paper from crusts to fit into pie plate.
