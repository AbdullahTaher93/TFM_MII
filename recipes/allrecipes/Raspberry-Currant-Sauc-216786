Combine the raspberries and jelly in a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Mix the cold water and cornstarch; stir into the raspberry mixture. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly; boil and stir one minute. Cool. Press through a sieve to remove seeds. (Don't skip this step!) Chill before serving.
