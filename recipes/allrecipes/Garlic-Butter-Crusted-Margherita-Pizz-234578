Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Grease large dark or nonstick cookie sheet with shortening or cooking spray; set aside. In 10-inch nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until hot. Add tomatoes, 1/2 teaspoon roasted garlic and the salt. Reduce heat to medium; cook 10 to 15 minutes or until tomatoes are thickened, stirring frequently. Set aside; cool slightly. Unroll dough on cookie sheet. Press out dough to 15x10-inch rectangle. In small bowl, mix butter and 1 tablespoon roasted garlic. Spread over dough. Bake 7 minutes; remove from oven. Evenly distribute tomato mixture over partially baked crust. Top with mozzarella cheese. Bake 7 to 9 minutes or until cheese is melted and crust is golden brown. Sprinkle basil strips over pizza before serving.
