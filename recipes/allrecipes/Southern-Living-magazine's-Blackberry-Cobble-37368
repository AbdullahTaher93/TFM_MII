COMBINE first 5 ingredients in a large bowl; gently stir in blackberries. Spoon into an 8-inch square baking dish. Sprinkle with orange juice. Set aside. COMBINE 1 cup flour and salt in a bowl; cut in shortening with a pastry blender until mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, evenly over mixture; stir with a fork just until dry ingredients are moistened. PRESS pastry gently into a 4-inch circle on heavy-duty plastic wrap, and cover with additional plastic wrap. Roll pastry, still covered, into a 9-inch square; chill 10 minutes or until plastic wrap can be easily removed. REMOVE top sheet of plastic wrap, and cut pastry into 9 (1-inch) strips. Arrange pastry strips over blackberry mixture in a crisscross pattern. COAT with cooking spray; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar. Bake at 425 degrees for 35 minutes or until pastry is golden.
