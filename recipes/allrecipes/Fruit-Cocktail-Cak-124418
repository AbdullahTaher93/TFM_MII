In a large mixing bowl, combine all cake ingredients; mix well. Pour into a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. pan and sprinkle with topping ingredients. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes. Meanwhile, combine all sauce ingredients in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. When cake is done and still warm, pour sauce over cake. Cool to room temperature.
