Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. In a skillet over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter, and saute the green beans, onions, and leeks until tender. Season with garlic and herb seasoning blend. Mix in the remaining butter until melted. In a large bowl, toss together the green bean mixture, eggs, and dry stuffing mix. Gradually blend in the water. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish. Bake 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly brown.
