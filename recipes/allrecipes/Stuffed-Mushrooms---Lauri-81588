I like to use crimini mushrooms, but the white button mushrooms are good too. Remove the caps and place on a foil lined sheet pan (for easy clean-up). The caps should be like domes not bowls so the liquid will not pool up inside. Place under the broiler for about 3 minutes. Remove and let cool. To make the stuffing: soften the cream cheese by zapping in the microwave for a few seconds. Mince the olives and add to the cream cheese along with the garlic power and stir well. Spoon or pipe the cream cheese into each cap. I like to serve them right away at room temp, but you can cover them and refrigerate them for a few hours ahead of serving time.
