Mix the ground red chile peppers, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, garam masala, salt, ginger, garlic, tomatoes, and yogurt in a large bowl. Stir the chicken pieces into the yogurt mixture, and let marinate in the refrigerator for 30 to 60 minutes. Melt the butter in a large skillet on medium heat and cook the bell pepper slices and onion until the onion begins to turn translucent, about 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the chicken and marinade to the skillet. Cook, stirring constantly, 5 to 10 minutes until the chicken firms and is no longer pink in the center. Turn up heat to medium-high and mix in the cream and coriander. Cook until mixture just begins to boil, stirring continuously. Serve immediately.
