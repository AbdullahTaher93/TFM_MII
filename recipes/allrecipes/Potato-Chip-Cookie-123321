In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Stir in potato chips and pecans. Add vanilla; mix well. Stir in flour just until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and forms a ball. Shape into 1-in. balls; place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Flatten with a glass dipped in flour. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until lightly browned.
