In mixing bowl add dry mix (reserve 1/2 cup dry mix), 2 eggs, 1/4 cup oil. Add well drained carrots and raisins, add nuts. Mix well by hand. Spread 2 cups of carrot cake on bottom of a greased 9 to 9 1/2-inch springform pan. Reserve remaining carrot cake. Cheesecake: In large bowl beat cream cheese, eggs and sweetened condensed milk until smooth. Add remaining ingredients (brown sugar, pumpkin, and remaining 1/2 cup of dry mix). Spread 1/2 of the cheesecake batter on top of the carrot cake. Spoon on remaining carrot cake and top with remaining cheese cake batter. Do not marble with knife. Bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes or until cake is set and cooked through. Cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. When cake is cooled, top with Duncan Hines Cream Cheese Frosting.
