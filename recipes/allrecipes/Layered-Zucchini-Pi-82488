Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 10 inch springform pan with parchment paper. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the Italian sausage; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain well and reserve. Heat the olive oil the skillet over medium heat. Stir in zucchini and garlic; cook until zucchini is lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Stir basil into the skillet; cover and simmer until zucchini is soft, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cool slightly; place in a square of cheesecloth or a colander and squeeze dry. Use one can of crescent dough to form a crust in the springform pan, pressing dough up sides. Layer 1/2 cup mozzarella , the cooked zucchini, the cooked sausage, and the remaining 1/2 cup of mozzarella in the crust. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese; dot with the pesto. Beat the eggs, cream, and paprika in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper. Pour egg mixture over layered ingredients in crust. Place remaining crescent dough, in one piece, on top of pan to form a top crust. Trim; poke hole in the middle to vent. Place pan on a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes. Cover with aluminum foil; bake an additional 15 minutes. Turn off oven; allow pie to rest in warm oven for 20 minutes. Serve warm, or refrigerate for at least 3 hours to serve chilled.
