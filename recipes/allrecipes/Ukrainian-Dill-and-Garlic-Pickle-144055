Soak cucumbers in cold water overnight. Sterilize a 1 gallon glass or ceramic container. Combine the water and salt in a large pot and bring to a boil. Prepare the cucumbers by trimming the ends and making a slit in the sides with a small sharp knife. In the bottom of the sterile container, place several stalks of dill, half of the garlic cloves, about 10 peppercorns and a slice or two of red chile pepper. Arrange half of the cucumbers over the seasonings and then repeat the layers. When the brine comes to a boil, pour over the cucumbers to cover. Place a small plate on top of the pickles to keep them submerged. Store in a cool place. Pickles will be ready in 4 to 10 days, depending on how warm it is. Once they have fermented to your liking, refrigerate until using.
