Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place cupcake liners in muffin pans. Prepare cake batter as directed on package. Pour batter into cupcake liners, filling them no more than two-thirds full. Bake 18 to 24 minutes or until toothpick inserted into cupcakes comes out clean. Let cool completely. Pour 1 packet of Duncan Hines(R) Frosting Creations(TM) Bubble Gum Flavour Mix into 1 can of Duncan Hines(R) Frosting Creations(TM) Frosting Starter. Stir until evenly blended. Repeat with second can and packet. Transfer the Bubble Gum frosting you just created to a piping bag with a round decorating tip. Pipe a circle of frosting around the outside edge only of each cupcake. Put nonpareils in a shallow bowl. Holding a cupcake by the bottom, tilt cupcake and dip the frosted edges into the nonpareils. Rotate cupcake and repeat until frosting is covered in nonpareils. To finish cupcakes, pipe a swirl of frosting in middle of your cupcake, taking care not to disturb decorated edges of cupcake.
