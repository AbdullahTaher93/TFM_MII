Arrange sweet potatoes and chicken pieces in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a small bowl, mix together pomegranate juice, sherry vinegar, olive oil, brown sugar, ginger, garlic, and salt and pepper. Pour over chicken and sweet potatoes. Cover, and marinate for 1 to 2 hours, turning once. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake, uncovered, in preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until chicken and sweet potatoes are cooked through. Baste with cooking juices several times while cooking. Sprinkle with green onion and pomegranate seeds before serving.
