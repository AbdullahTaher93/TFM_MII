Mix processed cheese food, Cheddar cheese, bacon, Worcestershire sauce, and dry mustard together in a bowl. Heat skillet over medium heat. Butter both sides of each slice of bread and toast in skillet until browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side; arrange onto a baking sheet. Repeat toasting with remaining butter and bread slices. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Spoon cheese-and-bacon mixture atop the toasts. Arrange toasts on a baking sheet. Heat toasts under the broiler until the topping is hot and bubbling, about 2 minutes.
