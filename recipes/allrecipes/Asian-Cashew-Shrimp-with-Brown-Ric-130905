In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Stir in the rice and season to taste with the salt. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. In a large bowl, stir together the soy sauce, wine, sesame oil, ginger, and garlic. Add the shrimp and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Remove the shrimp from the marinade and set aside. Stir the cornstarch into the marinade until blended well. In a wok or large nonstick skillet, heat the oil on high heat. Add the onion, water chestnuts, and mushrooms. Cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Add the shrimp, snow peas, and cashews, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Pour in the marinade. Stir for 1 minute, or until the sauce is thickened and the shrimp is cooked through. Serve immediately, spooned over the rice.
