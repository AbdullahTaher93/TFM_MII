Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x5x3-inch loaf pans. Whisk flour, white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and powdered jalapeno pepper together in a bowl. Add vegetable oil, applesauce, and eggs to flour mixture; beat until until batter is smooth. Fold zucchini and fresh jalapenos into batter. Pour batter into prepared loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean, about 1 hour. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
