Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a broiler pan. Stir the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, seasoned salt, and garlic powder together in a shallow dish such as a pie plate. Pour the olive oil into a separate shallow dish. Dip the t-bone steaks in the olive oil on both sides; allow excess to drip off. Press the steaks into the bread crumb mixture, and place onto the prepared broiler pan. Bake on the middle rack in the preheated oven until the steaks have cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 15 minutes for medium. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium.
