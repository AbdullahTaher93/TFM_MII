In a shallow dish, combine the honey, orange zest, orange juice, olive oil, five-spice powder, garlic and salt. Toss the chicken thighs in the marinade, taking care not to pull away the skin. Cover and refrigerate for one hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Heat a 10-inch cast iron skillet on medium-high heat. Add the oil and swirl to coat. Add the chicken, skin side down; cook until a rich mahogany color, about 3 minutes. Using tongs carefully flip each thigh; transfer the skillet to the oven and cook until the juices run clear and the meat is fully cooked, about 18 minutes. Transfer the thighs to a cutting board and allow to rest for 5 minutes. Serve with fried rice, wasabi-whipped potatoes or Szechuan green beans.
