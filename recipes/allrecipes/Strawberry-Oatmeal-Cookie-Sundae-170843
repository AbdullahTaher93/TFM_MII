Instructions for sundaes: Gently fold together whipped cream and lemon curd. Place one cookie on each serving plate. Place some strawberries on each cookie. Top berries with a scoop of ice cream, then a generous spoon of the lemon cream. Gently crumble remaining cookies over ice cream. Sift powdered sugar over the top. Instructions for cookies: Heat oven to 300 degrees F. Place oats on a cookie sheet and toast in oven 10-15 minutes or until lightly browned. Increase oven temperature to 350 degrees F. In an electric mixer, beat butter with vanilla, baking soda and salt until creamy. Add sugars and mix until light and fluffy. Add nuts and mix briefly. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, fold in oats and flour, making sure ingredients are well combined. Roll dough into 1 1/2-inch balls and gently flatten into 1/2-inch-thick disks. Place on a cookie sheet, leaving enough space in between to allow them to spread during cooking. Bake cookies for 15 -20 minutes or until lightly browned but still slightly soft in the center.
