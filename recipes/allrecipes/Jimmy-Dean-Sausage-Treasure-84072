Begin by heating the butter in a small saute pan on medium heat. Once the butter is heated saute the sausage, onion, garlic and potato for 2 minutes. While cooking add salt and pepper to season. In a bowl whisk 5 of the 6 eggs. Now add the 5 whipped eggs to the pan and cook while stirring continuously. Should take approximately 5 minutes. Add parsley to the scrambled mixture and place in a container. Chill in the refrigerator for 10 minutes. Whisk the remaining egg in a small bowl. Use a brush to apply the egg wash to the surface of the wonton wrapper. Now place one teaspoon of the scrambled mixture into the center of the egg washed wonton wrapper. Fold the wrapper from one point to the other creating a triangle shaped treasure. Fry in vegetable oil until the surface is golden brown.
