Soak wheat berries in cold water to cover by 2 inches in a bowl, overnight, covered and chilled. Stir together 1-1/2 teaspoons thyme and 2 teaspoons lemon peel with salt and pepper to taste. Pat chicken dry and spread herb mixture evenly under skin on breast. Season skin with salt and pepper to taste. Drain wheat berries well and cook in pot of 2 quarts boiling water uncovered until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain well and toss with remaining 1 teaspoon thyme and 2 teaspoons lemon peel. Heat 1 teaspoon of oil in a large nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Cook chicken, skin sides down, turning once, until golden brown and cooked through, 16 to 18 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cutting board. Cover roast with foil and stand for 5 minutes. Wipe skillet clean and add chicken broth. Bring broth to a simmer and add wheat berry mixture. Simmer mixture until broth is reduced to a couple of tablespoons, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a serving bowl, gently toss in goat cheese, lemon juice, and remaining teaspoon oil, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Slice chicken diagonally crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Add arugula and sunflower seeds to wheat berries, tossing to combine. Mound salad on serving plates and top with sliced chicken.
