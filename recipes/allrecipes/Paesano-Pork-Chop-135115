In a 2-quart microwavable dish, mix the tomato paste, vinaigrette, and garlic. Add the chops, spreading the sauce all over them. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and microwave for 8 to 10 minutes, stopping once or twice to flip the chops and swap the ones in the center of the dish with those on the edges, to ensure even cooking. When done, the chops will be just slightly pink in the middle (registering about 145 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer), and the meat juices will run almost clear. Cover and set aside for 2 minutes - the still-hot chops will finish cooking as they sit there. Serve with some of the sauce over the top and toss on the parsley or basil.
