In a small mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar, egg and milk; set aside. In a large mixing bowl, beat sugar, pumpkin, oil, water and eggs. Combine dry ingredients; gradually add to pumpkin mixture and mix well. Stir in nuts, raisins and dates. Pour half of the batter into three greased and floured 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Spoon filling over batter. Cover filling completely with remaining batter. Bake at 350 degrees F for 65-70 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pan and cool completely on a wire rack. Wrap in foil; refrigerate until ready to serve.
