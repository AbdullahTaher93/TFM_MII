In a medium size bowl, combine the flour, walnuts, baking powder, and spices. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream the vegetable shortening with the sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients. Cover and chill for 8 hours or overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). On a floured surface, roll out the dough to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Cut into rounds using a 2-inch round cookie cutter and place 1-1/2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes, until golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Melt chocolate over low heat and drizzle over cooled cookies.
