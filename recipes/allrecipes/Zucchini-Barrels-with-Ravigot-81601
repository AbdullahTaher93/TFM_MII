First you'll want to make the ravigote. Be sure to rinse and drain the capers otherwise they are too salty. Mix together the capers with the chopped onions, parsley, chives, tarragon salt and pepper. Toss. Drizzle with the vinegar and oil. Toss. Let sit for about 30 minutes before serving. Meanwhile; slice off the stem and blossom ends of the zucchini. Slice the zukes into 1 inch long segments. You should get 4 to 5 segments per zuke. Ideally you will have 18 total. Try to make them as uniform as possible. Cut one and then use it as a guide to cut the rest. Optional step. I like to lightly blanch the zucchini if I will be serving them right away. But if you are making them ahead of time then they can get too soggy. To blanch: bring a pot of water to a boil while you make an ice bath, which is just a huge bowl with ice water with plenty of ice cubes. In two batches, blanch the zukes in the boiling water for 30 seconds, scoop out and put into the ice bath for 30 seconds. Place in a colander to drain. With a spoon or melon baller, scoop out (and discard) some of the zucchini flesh to form a cup to hold the ravigote. Drain the ravigote and spoon out 2 tsp per zucchini cup. Arrange on a platter, cover and chill for 1 hour. Sprigs of fresh herbs help garnish the platter.
