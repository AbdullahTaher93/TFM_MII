Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the mixture. Dissolve yeast in the warm water in a small bowl. Pour into the middle of the flour mixture. Mix together lightly and rapidly until dough is moist and soft. Allow dough to rise slightly, 15 to 20 minutes. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Pinch off a 2-inch piece of dough with well-floured fingers. Stretch it into a round 5 to 6 inches in diameter, working in more flour if needed. Deep-fry dough until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining dough.
