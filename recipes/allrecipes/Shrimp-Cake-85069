In a medium bowl, combine the shrimp, crackers, onion and jalapeno. Stir in the mayonnaise and mustard, and season with Tabasco and celery salt. Mix in Parmesan cheese. Form into 8 patties. Heat about 1/2 inch of oil in a deep heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is nice and hot, fry the patties for about 5 minutes per side, or until golden brown.
