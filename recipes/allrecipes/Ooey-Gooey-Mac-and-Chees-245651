Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add garlic; cook until fragrant. Stir in flour, mustard powder, garlic powder, Worcestershire powder, salt, and black pepper. Whisk in half-and-half. Simmer, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Add processed cheese, Parmesan cheese, and Cheddar cheese; stir until melted. Pour cheese sauce over cooked pasta; stir well to combine.
