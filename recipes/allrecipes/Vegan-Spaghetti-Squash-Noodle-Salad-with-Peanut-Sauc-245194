Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place squash, cut-side down, on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until squash is tender, about 30 minutes. Cool until easily handled. Combine peanut butter, tamari, agave syrup, sea salt, ginger, and garlic in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until sauce is smooth, about 1 minute. Stir lime juice and sriracha into sauce. Shred squash into a large bowl using a fork or your fingers. Add cabbage, broccoli, cucumber, carrot, scallions, and mint; drizzle peanut sauce over mixture and toss to coat. Top salad with peanuts.
