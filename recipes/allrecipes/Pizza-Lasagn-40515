ARRANGE pepperoni evenly over hot lasagna. Separate dough into breadsticks. Evenly place breadsticks lengthwise and crosswise over pepperoni, weaving to form a lattice top. Trim any excess dough that might be hanging from edge of pan. Sprinkle top of lattice with cheese. Place lasagna on a baking sheet. BAKE in preheated 325 degrees F. oven for 25 to 35 minutes, or until breadsticks are golden brown and fully cooked. Note: To make mini breadsticks, place left over dough on baking sheet with lasagna. Brush with melted butter, or olive oil. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown.
