Place potatoes in a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. With a sharp knife, cut an X in the top of each potato. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes or until warm. Meanwhile, combine the sour cream, ham, Parmesan, mayonnaise, chilies, salt and pepper; mix well. Fluff potato pulp with a fork. Top with ham mixture; sprinkle with cheese. Bake, uncovered, 10-15 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.
