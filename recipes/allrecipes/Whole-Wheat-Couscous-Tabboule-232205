Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; stir in couscous and salt. Remove from heat, cover saucepan, and let stand until water is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Transfer couscous to a bowl and fluff with a fork. Mix tomatoes, cucumber, onion, parsley, mint, lemon juice, olive oil, and black pepper into couscous. Serve immediately or refrigerate for 1 hour for flavors to blend.
