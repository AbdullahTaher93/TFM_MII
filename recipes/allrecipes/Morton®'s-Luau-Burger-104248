Mix ground beef with onion, 1/2 teaspoon Morton(R) Coarse Kosher Salt, pepper and three tablespoons sweet-and-sour sauce. Shape mixture into 4 patties; set aside. In small bowl, combine remaining sweet-and-sour sauce with hot mustard; set aside. Pour water into a 9-1/2x10-3/4x1-inch baking pan. Sprinkle Morton(R) Coarse Kosher Salt over water to form a solid layer of salt. Place patties on moistened salt. Bake at 350 degrees F until desired doneness (about 25 minutes for well done, internal temperature of 160 degrees F). Do not turn patties. Transfer burgers to plate and keep warm. Discard salt bed.
