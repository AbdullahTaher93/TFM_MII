Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter 15 muffin cups, or line with paper liner cups. Mix together flours, soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Stir pears lightly into dry ingredients. In a large bowl, combine yogurt, oil, honey, and egg. Mix in flour mixture until just combined. Spoon into muffin cups. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until done.
