In a skillet over medium heat, cook turkey and onion until meat is no longer pink; drain. Transfer to a 9-in. pie plate coated with nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle with cheese. In a bowl, combine egg substitute, milk and baking mix; mix well. Pour over cheese. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown and a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
