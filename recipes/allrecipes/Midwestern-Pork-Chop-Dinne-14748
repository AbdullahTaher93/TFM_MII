Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Season pork chops with salt and pepper. Working in batches, sear the pork chops until they're browned on each side. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl combine the potatoes, carrots, kohlrabi, salt, marjoram and pepper. Mix lightly and place mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour milk over potato mixture and top with browned pork chops. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours, or until pork chops and vegetables are very tender and internal temperature of pork has reached 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
