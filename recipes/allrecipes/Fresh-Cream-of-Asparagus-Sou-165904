Cut off about 2 inches from tough end of the asparagus spears. Cut the tips from the tender ends and set aside. Cut the spears into small pieces. Melt the butter in a large heavy pot. Saute the onion, stirring for 3 to 4 minutes or until softened. Stir in the flour and cook over medium heat, stirring for two minutes. Do not brown. Whisk in the broth. Add the cut up asparagus spears and cook, partially covered, for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the asparagus tips in a small amount of lightly salted water in the microwave for 2 minutes. Drain and set aside. Puree the cooked soup in a blender and return to the pot. (Or use a hand-held emersion blender in the pot.) Reheat to boiling and whisk in the cream. Do not boil after the cream is added. Season with salt, hot pepper sauce and nutmeg. Put the cooked tips into the soup. Sprinkle each bowl with chopped parsley.
