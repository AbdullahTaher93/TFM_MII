Dressing: In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat the shallots in the vinegars to approximately 100 degrees F and then remove from the heat and cool very quickly in an ice bath. In a blender, combine the vinegar and shallot mixture with the egg yolk pulsing quickly until the ingredients are fully blended. With the blender running at low speed, slowly drizzle in the canola oil until the dressing is completely emulsified. Store in the refrigerator until ready to serve. Salad: Drain all of the beans and rinse in cold water. In a large mixing bowl, combine the beans, cucumber, radishes, grape tomatoes, onions, chives and strawberries. Place one large and one small leaf of butter lettuce on each salad plate, concave side up. Place one-eighth of the salad mixture on each large leaf. With a spoon or squeeze bottle, place dressing in the small lettuce leaf and serve.
