Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain pasta; return to pot. Place tuna in a skillet over low heat; season with onion powder and salt. Cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir tuna into cooked pasta. Add Alfredo sauce; stir until combined. Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese.
