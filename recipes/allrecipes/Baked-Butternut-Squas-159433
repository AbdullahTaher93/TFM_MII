Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place squash, cut sides down, in a 9x13 baking dish. Pour water into dish around squash halves. Bake in the preheated oven until tender and easily pierced with a fork, about 1 1/2 hours. Carefully remove the skin with a fork; it should be very easy to remove. Top squash halves with butter and season with salt and pepper to taste.
