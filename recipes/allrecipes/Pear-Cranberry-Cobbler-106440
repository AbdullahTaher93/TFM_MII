Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Combine SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, cinnamon, orange juice, and orange zest in a large bowl, stirring until SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener dissolves. Add pears and cranberries; toss to coat. Divide pear mixture evenly among 6 (8-ounce) ramekins or custard cups. Place ramekins on a baking sheet; bake 15 minutes. Make Topping: COMBINE flour, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl; cut butter in with a pastry blender or two knives until mixture is crumbly with some pea-sized pieces. Stir in buttermilk. Remove ramekins from oven; reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Drop batter evenly over pears; brush with egg white. Immediately return cobblers to oven. Bake 30 additional minutes, or until topping is browned. Cool 10 minutes before serving.
