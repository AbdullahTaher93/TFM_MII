Slip skin off plums using a paring knife. Cut plums in half; remove pits. Place plums in food processor. Process in batches until finely chopped. Measure exactly 5 cups of fruit. Combine plums, lemon juice, and pectin in a large saucepan, stirring until pectin dissolves. Let stand 10 minutes. Bring mixture to a full rolling boil (a boil that doesn't stop bubbling when stirred) over medium-high heat. Boil 1 minute, stirring constantly.

After jars cool, check seals by pressing center of lid with finger. (If lid springs back, lid is not sealed and refrigeration is necessary.) Store in a cool, dark place for up to 1 year. Once opened, store refrigerated and use within 2 weeks.
