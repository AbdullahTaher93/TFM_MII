Gently squeeze potatoes to remove excess water. Melt 5 tablespoons butter; add to potatoes along with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Press in bottom and up sides of a greased 9-in. pie plate to form a crust. Bake at 425 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until edges are browned. Cool to room temperature. In a saucepan over medium heat, saute the onion and red pepper in remaining butter until tender, about 6-8 minutes. Spoon into crust; sprinkle with cheese. Combine the eggs, milk and remaining salt; pour over onion mixture. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
