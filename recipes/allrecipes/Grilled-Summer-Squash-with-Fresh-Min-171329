Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above cooking grate only 2 to 3 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). Cut each squash in half lengthwise, then into 1-inch pieces. In a bowl, mix squash with olive oil, garlic, and 1/8 teaspoon each salt and pepper. If cooking over charcoal, use a grill skillet or basket; if cooking over gas, use a grill sheet or basket. Pour vegetables into grill skillet, sheet, or basket. Place on cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook, gently shaking skillet once or twice to turn vegetables, until tender when pierced, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove vegetables from grill and return to bowl. Add mint, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste; mix well. Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.
