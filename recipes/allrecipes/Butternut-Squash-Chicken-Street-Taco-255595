Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Combine chicken thighs, butternut squash, onion, chicken stock, paprika, garlic, salt, marjoram, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, and pepper in an enameled cast iron Dutch oven. Pour tomatoes on top. Bake, covered, in the preheated oven until chicken is tender, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Uncover and continue baking until most of the butternut squash has melted into the sauce, about 30 minutes more. Shred chicken with 2 forks.
