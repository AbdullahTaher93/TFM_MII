Chill a large glass or metal bowl and the beaters from an electric mixer for 30 minutes. Beat heavy cream in the chilled bowl with the electric mixer until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Beat cream cheese in a separate bowl until creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add butter; mix until well blended, 1 or 2 minutes. Stir in strawberry puree and vanilla extract. Add confectioners' sugar and mix until well blended. Fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture; lift and fold gently until whipped cream is evenly incorporated.
