In a large saucepan, brown ground beef; drain. Add tomato paste, water, spaghetti sauce mix, sugar, parsley, salt, garlic powder and pepper. Simmer, partially covered, for 20 minutes. Stir occasionally. In a bowl, combine eggs with cottage cheese, half of the Cheddar cheese and half of the mozzarella. Set aside. Spoon one-third of the meat sauce into a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Place half of the uncooked noodles over sauce. Top with one-third of meat sauce and press down. Spoon cottage cheese mixture over all. Cover with remaining noodles and meat sauce. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Bake, covered, at 350 degrees F for 1 hour. Uncover; sprinkle with remaining Cheddar and mozzarella cheeses. Bake an additional 15 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before cutting.
