Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until well browned, stirring often. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the pepper and onion and cook until they're tender. Stir the soup, cumin, chili powder and garlic powder in the skillet. Cook until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Spoon about 1/3 cup chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Fold the tortillas around the filling. Tip: To warm the tortillas you may either wrap them in damp paper towels and microwave on HIGH for about 1 minute or wrap in foil and bake.
