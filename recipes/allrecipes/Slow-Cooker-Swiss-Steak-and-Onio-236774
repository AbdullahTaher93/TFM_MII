Mix flour, salt, mustard, and pepper together in a wide, shallow bowl. Dredge cube steaks in the flour mixture to coat completely. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry steaks until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side; transfer to a slow cooker, reserving drippings in the skillet. Saute onion and garlic in the reserved drippings in the skillet until softened, 2 to 3 minutes more; add to the slow cooker. Discard the oil. Stir beef broth and tomato paste together in a bowl until the paste dissolves into the broth; add tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, thyme, and oregano. Pour the broth mixture over the steaks in the slow cooker. Cook on Low until the meat is tender to the point of falling apart, 6 to 8 hours.
