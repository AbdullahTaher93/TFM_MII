Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. In a large bowl, mix together the ground pork, ground turkey, eggs, bread crumbs, mushrooms, garlic, Italian seasoning, basil, and Worcestershire sauce using your hands. Pat evenly into a 9 inch pie plate. Place the pie plate onto a cookie sheet, and place on the grill grate. Close the lid, and cook for 30 to 45 minutes, until no longer pink. The meat will cook faster on the grill than in the oven.
