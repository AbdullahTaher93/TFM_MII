In a large bowl, stir brownie mix, egg, oil and water until well blended. Fold in 1 cup vanilla chips. Pour into a greased 9-in. heart-shaped or round springform pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted 2-in. from the side of pan comes out clean. Let stand for 10 minutes; alternate milk chocolate and striped kisses around edge of pan with points toward center. Melt shortening and remaining chips; stir until smooth. Drizzle over brownie. Cool completely. Remove sides of springform pan.
