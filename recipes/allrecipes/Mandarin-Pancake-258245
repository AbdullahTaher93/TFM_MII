Combine flour and boiling water in a large bowl until dough comes together. Turn dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 5 to 8 minutes. Shape dough into a 1 1/2-inch thick log and divide into 16 equal portions. Roll each piece of dough into a 6-inch circle on a lightly floured work surface. Brush 8 dough circles with sesame oil. Place an unoiled dough circle on top of an oiled dough circle, gently pressing them together. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place 1 dough circle stack in the skillet and cook until slightly puffed, about 1 minute per side. Remove from the skillet and cool slightly. Peel pancakes apart. Repeat cooking with remaining dough circles.
