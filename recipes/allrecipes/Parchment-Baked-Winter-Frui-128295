Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Tear off four large sheets of parchment paper. Divide the apples, pears, apricots, and currants evenly among the pieces of parchment. Drizzle each pile of fruit with wine or apple juice and maple syrup, then sprinkle with cinnamon. Fold over the edges of the packets to seal tightly. Place on two baking sheets. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the fruit is tender.
