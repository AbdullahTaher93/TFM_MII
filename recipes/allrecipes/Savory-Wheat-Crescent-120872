In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir in 2 teaspoons honey; let stand for 5 minutes. Add milk, 2 tablespoons butter, salt and remaining honey; mix well. Add egg and whole wheat flour; beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Stir in enough all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Knead on a floured surface for 30 seconds. Roll into a 12-in. circle. Melt remaining butter; brush over dough. Combine Parmesan cheese and garlic salt; sprinkle over dough. Cut into 16 wedges. Roll up wedges from the wide end and place with pointed end down on greased baking sheets. Curve ends to form a crescent shape. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 20 minutes. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
