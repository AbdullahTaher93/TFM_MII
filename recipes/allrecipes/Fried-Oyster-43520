Heat water in a big pot, add minced ginger and bring to boil. Add oysters, bring to boil again and then boil for another 30 seconds. Take the oysters out, drain and dry with kitchen towels or napkins. Marinate the oysters with ginger juice, cooking wine, 1 tsp. salt and white pepper powder. Let stand for 30 minutes. Beat the egg white in a bowl until slight puffy. Mix in breadcrumbs and 4 tbsp. flour. Set 1/2 cup flour on a plate. Heat the oil in a wok or deep fry pan (375 F degree). Dip the oysters one by one in the egg white mix, then roll in the flour until evenly covered, then put into the pan to fry. Fry until brown. Oysters are ready to serve. Sprinkle with pepper salt to your taste.
