Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Grease the cups of a 12-cup muffin pan. Sift together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in oats. Add egg, milk, and syrup. Stir only until dry ingredients are moistened. Fill greased muffin tins 3/4 full. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes. Remove from oven, and let stand a few minutes before removing muffins from the pan.
