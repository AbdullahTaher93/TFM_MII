Drain and rinse beans. In a saucepan, over medium-high heat, cook the sausages, until they are cooked through and nicely browned, remove from the pan, set aside and keep hot in a 140 degrees F oven. Pour off the cooking fat from the sausages. Add the olive oil, chopped bacon, shallots, garlic, thyme, and oregano to the pan and cook, until the bacon pieces are cooked but not browned (about 4 to 5 minutes). Add the wine, tomato sauce and cooked beans to the pan. Simmer, for about 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. At the same time, in a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat, and saute the polenta slices, until they are a nice golden brown and heated through. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
