Place the beef brisket and contents of the spice packet into a pot and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, cover, and cook over low heat for about 2 hours. Add the cabbage and potatoes, and simmer over low heat for 2 more hours. Stir in the whiskey when it is almost done. Check the water level occasionally and replace as needed.
