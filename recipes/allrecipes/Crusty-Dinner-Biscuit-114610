In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Combine milk and oil; pour over dry ingredients and stir just until moistened. Turn onto a floured surface; knead 5-6 times. Roll out to 1/2-in. thickness; cut with a floured 2-in. biscuit cutter. Place on a greased baking sheet. Brush tops with cream if desired. Bake at 425 degrees F for 13-15 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm with butter and/or honey.
