Melt butter in a medium size skillet over low heat. Add garlic and flour. Cook over low heat until flour absorbs butter and begins to whiten (about 1 minute). Remove from heat and slowly add LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk while stirring constantly with a wire whisk to prevent lumps from forming. Mix well and return to heat. Add cloves, thyme, bay leaf and season with salt and pepper. Stir well. Simmer 3-4 minutes or until the sauce starts to thicken. Add chicken breasts and cover pot. Simmer over low heat 6-8 minutes. Turn breasts over and cook an additional 6 minutes or until breasts are cooked through.
