Place orange rolls in bottom of pan, spacing evenly; press rolls together to cover bottom of pan. Set icing aside. Brush 2 tablespoons preserves over rolls. Sprinkle 1/4 cup almonds over rolls. In large bowl, beat cream cheese, icing, vanilla and salt with electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Beat in eggs, one at a time, scraping bowl occasionally, until smooth and creamy. Gently spoon filling over almonds on rolls, spreading to edge of pan and smoothing top. Cut up large fruit pieces in 1/4 cup preserves if necessary. Drop preserves in small spoonfuls randomly over filling. Swirl preserves into filling, using knife. Sprinkle 1/4 cup almonds around edge of tart. Place pan on cookie sheet.
