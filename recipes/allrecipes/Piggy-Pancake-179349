Heat griddle or skillet over medium-high heat or to 375 degrees F. In medium bowl, stir Bisquick mix, milk and eggs until blended. Lightly oil griddle. For each pig face, pour slightly less than 1/4 cup batter onto hot oiled griddle. Pour scant tablespoonful batter onto griddle for snout and another scant tablespoonful for ears. Cook pancakes until edges are dry. Turn; cook until golden. To serve, place large pancakes on individual serving plates. Place 1 small pancake in center of each face for snout; poke 2 holes for nostrils with end of handle of wooden spoon. Cut second small pancake in half for ears; place at top of face. Use blueberries for eyes.
