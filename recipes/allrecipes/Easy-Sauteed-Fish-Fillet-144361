Combine flour, salt and pepper in a shallow dish; thoroughly dredge fillets (discard any leftover flour). Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the fish, working in batches if necessary, and cook until lightly browned and just opaque in the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Serve immediately.
