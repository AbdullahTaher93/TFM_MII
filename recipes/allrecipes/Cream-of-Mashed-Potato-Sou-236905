Heat milk in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir mashed potatoes into the warm milk until the mixture is smooth, adding more milk as needed to make it smooth; add ham and stir. Cook the mixture until the ham cubes are hot in the middle, 5 to 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper and top with Cheddar cheese.
