Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Combine white wine, leek, butter, green onions, shallot, and garlic in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until leek and shallot soften, 2 to 4 minutes. Stir scallops, mussels, salt, and pepper into the pot. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until scallops are opaque and mussels open, 2 to 4 minutes. Squeeze in juice from 2 lemon slices. Remove from heat; stir in heavy cream. Divide linguine between serving bowls. Scoop scallop and mussels on top. Serve with remaining lemon slices and toasted baguette.
