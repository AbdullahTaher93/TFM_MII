Cook sausage in a skillet over medium heat until browned. Stir in black beans and diced tomatoes and continue cooking until mixture is hot, about 5 minutes. Stir in cream cheese, and taco seasoning, and water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer for about 5 minutes. Spoon mixture into large tortillas, top with your favorite toppings, and roll up tortillas to form burritos.
