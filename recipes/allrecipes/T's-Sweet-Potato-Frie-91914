Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place the cut sweet potatoes into a microwave-safe dish with the water. Cook on in the microwave for 5 minutes on full power. Drain off liquid, and toss with Italian seasoning, lemon pepper, salt, pepper, and olive oil. Arrange fries on a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake for 30 minutes, turning once, or until fries are crispy on the outside.
