Place avocados, butter, jalapeno peppers, lime zest, lime juice, cumin, paprika, salt, and black pepper in a food processor; pulse until blended and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Place a large piece of plastic wrap on your work surface. Scoop avocado mixture out into center of plastic wrap. Fold bottom edge of plastic wrap over mixture and roll into a log, twisting ends to seal. Chill until firm to the touch, about 2 hours in the refrigerator or 1 hour in the freezer. Slice into coins to serve.
