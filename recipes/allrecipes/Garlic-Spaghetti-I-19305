Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and reserve. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, saute garlic in olive oil until golden. Add tomato sauce, oregano and salt; stir until combined and cover. Lower heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Pour sauce over pasta and toss to coat; serve.
