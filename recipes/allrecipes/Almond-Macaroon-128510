Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a small bowl, combine the almonds, flour, and salt. In a large bowl, with an electric mixer on high speed, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Add the almond extract. Gradually beat in the sugar, 1/4 cup (60 ml) at a time, until stiff peaks form. Fold the almond mixture into the egg whites. Drop the batter by heaping teaspoons 2 inches (5 cm) apart onto the prepared sheet. Bake for 14 minutes, or until light brown. Cool on a rack for 3 minutes. Slide the parchment paper off the pan onto the rack to cool completely. Peel off the paper.
