Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Generously grease and flour a 10" tube pan or Bundt pan. Sift together flour, baking soda and salt, and set aside. With electric mixer, cream together olive oil and sugar (mixture will seem granular). Add eggs, one at a time, until each is blended. Alternate adding flour mixture and sour cream to the egg mixture, beginning and ending with flour mixture. Add vanilla extract. Pour cake batter into prepared pan. Place in preheated oven and reduce temperature at once to 325 degrees F. Bake 1 hour and 15 min., until lightly golden and a wooden pick comes out clean.
