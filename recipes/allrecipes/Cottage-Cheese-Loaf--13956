Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x9 inch cooking dish with cooking spray. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in medium skillet. Saute the onion until soft and translucent. In a large bowl combine cottage cheese, cornflake crumbs, egg, oil and sauteed onion. Gradually stir in the milk to moisten. You might only need 1/2 cup of the milk, the mixture should be moist but not soupy. Spread the cottage cheese mixture into the prepared pan and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 40 minutes or until bubbly and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
