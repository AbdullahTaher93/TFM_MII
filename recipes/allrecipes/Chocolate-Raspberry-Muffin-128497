Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin pan. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, stir together the buttermilk, oil, vanilla, and egg until well-blended. Stir in the flour mixture until just combined. Do not overmix. Gently fold in the raspberries. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups, filling them about two-thirds full. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Cool on a rack for 5 minutes. Remove to the rack to cool completely.
