Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a large bowl, stir together the honey, butter and salt. Add the sweet potatoes, and stir to coat. Transfer to the prepared baking dish. Pour any liquid from the bowl over the potatoes. Cover, and bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, basting frequently.
