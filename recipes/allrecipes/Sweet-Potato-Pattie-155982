Mix together the sweet potatoes, onion, coconut, flour, semolina, and syrup in a large bowl. Mix in the eggs. Form the mixture into 4 patties. Mix together the yogurt, half and half, pineapple juice, and cayenne pepper in a separate bowl. Set aside until serving. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the patties in the hot oil until crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to plate lined with paper towels. Serve patties hot with yogurt mixture on the side.
