Bring the rice and water to a boil in a pot. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the walnuts on a baking dish, and bake 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until lightly toasted. Remove from heat. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the onion until tender. Mix in garlic, and cook 1 minute. Stir in the broth, and season with sage, tarragon, salt, and pepper. Continue cooking 10 minutes, stirring often. Heat the oil in a separate skillet. Dredge the tofu in the toasted walnuts, and cook in the skillet about 4 minutes on each side, until lightly browned. Mix any remaining walnuts and the onion and broth mixture into the skillet. Cook until heated through. Serve over rice, and top with blue cheese.
