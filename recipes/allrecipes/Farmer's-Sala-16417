Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, measure out 1 cup and set aside. In a large bowl, combine the lettuce and broccoli. Prepare the dressing by whisking together the salad dressing, sugar and vinegar. Pour dressing over lettuce mixture and toss evenly to coat. Sprinkle with bacon and refrigerate until chilled. Serve cold.
