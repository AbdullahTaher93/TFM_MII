Spread flour slices of bread with mayonnaise. Layer each with ham, cheese and onion. Spread horseradish sauce on remaining bread; place bread with horseradish side down over onion. Spread butter on the outside of each sandwich. In a skillet over medium heat, toast sandwiches until bread is lightly browned on both sides and cheese is melted.
