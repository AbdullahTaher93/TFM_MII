In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in milk. Add butter, sugar, eggs, salt and 4 cups flour; beat until smooth. Stir in wheat germ and enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl; turn once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface, divide into four portions. Roll each into a 12-in. circle; cut each circle into 12 wedges. Roll up wedges from the wide end and place pointed end down 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Curve ends to form a crescent shape. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12 minutes or until light golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks.
