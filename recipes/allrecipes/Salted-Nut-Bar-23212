Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 13x9-inch baking pan with no stick cooking spray; set aside. Combine all crust ingredients in large bowl. Beat at low speed, scraping bowl often, until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press crumb mixture into prepared pan. Bake for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, place all topping ingredients except mixed nuts in 2-quart saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until chips are melted and mixture is smooth (5 to 7 minutes). Stir in nuts until well coated. Spread nut mixture over hot, partially baked crust. Continue baking for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown. Cool completely. Cut into bars.
