In a skillet, saute the red pepper and onion in oil until tender. In a bowl, beat eggs and milk. Stir in chicken if desired, 1/2 cup spinach, mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses, salt and pepper (save remaining spinach for another use). Add to the skillet. Cover and cook over medium heat for 7-10 minutes or until completely set. Cut into wedges.
