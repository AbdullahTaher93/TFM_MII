Place meat in deep non-metallic container or bowl. Trim excess fat, if desired. Add remaining ingredients to bowl except salt, pepper and oil. Pierce meat several times with fork and turn to coat; spoon marinade over meat. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours or up to 24 hours, turning meat at least once. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Reserving marinade, remove meat and sprinkle with salt and pepper. On stovetop, heat about 3 tablespoons olive oil in a small roasting pan. Add meat and brown on all sides. Pour marinade over meat. Cover and roast in oven for 15 minutes. Lower heat to 350 degrees F, and continue to roast 1-1/2 hours or until meat is tender when pierced with a fork. Remove meat to serving platter. Carefully spoon marinade into blender container. Cover and run on low until smooth. Serve with sliced roast beef.
