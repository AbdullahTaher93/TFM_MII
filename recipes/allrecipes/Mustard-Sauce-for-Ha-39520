In a small bowl, mix together the flour, sugar and mustard powder until evenly blended. Whisk together the milk and egg yolks in a saucepan, and slowly whisk in the mustard mixture. Stir in the vinegar. Whisking constantly, bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, reduce heat to low, and simmer until thickened.
