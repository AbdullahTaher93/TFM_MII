Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, 8 to 10 minutes or according to package directions. Drain and rinse under cold water until cooled. Set aside. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a wok or large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and saute until no longer pink inside, 2 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon oil to the pan. Add peppers, shallots and garlic, and saute until the peppers are tender-crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Add to the reserved chicken. Add broth, vinegar and rosemary to the pan and bring to a boil. Add artichokes and the reserved pasta and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Return the reserved chicken mixture to the pan and toss with the pasta. Taste and adjust seasoning and sprinkle with pine nuts. Serve warm.
