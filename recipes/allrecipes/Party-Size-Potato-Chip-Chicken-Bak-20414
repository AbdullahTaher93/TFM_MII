Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and lightly grease two 9x13 inch baking dishes. In a large bowl combine the chicken, celery, green onion and almonds; mix well. In a separate large bowl mix together mayonnaise and lemon juice and season with salt and pepper to taste. Combine the two mixtures and blend all together. Spread potato chips in the bottom of the prepared baking dishes, then spread 1/2 of chicken mixture in each dish. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 to 45 minutes, or until bubbly. Top with remaining potato chip crumbs and cheese and bake for another 5 to 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
