In a bowl, combine beef and stuffing mix. Shape into 1-in. balls. In a large skillet over medium heat, brown meatballs in oil in small batches; drain. Return all meatballs to the pan; add spaghetti sauce. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 6-8 minutes or until meat is no longer pink.
