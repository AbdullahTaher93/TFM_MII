Cook pasta according to package directions. Rinse with cool water and drain well. In a small bowl whisk the oil together with the seasoning mix until emulsified. In a large bowl, combine the pasta with the remaining ingredients. Pour the dressing over the pasta and toss until well coated. Chill covered for at least 1 hour before serving.
