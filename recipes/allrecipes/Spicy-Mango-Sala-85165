Place the mango cubes into a serving bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the lime juice and olive oil. Season with red pepper flakes, cilantro, shallots, salt and pepper. Whisk briefly, then pour over the mangos. Stir to coat, then cover and refrigerate for about 30 minutes to blend the flavors before serving.
