Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Oil a round 8- or 9-inch-wide pan with removable rim. In a food processor or a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer, process or mix cream cheese, ricotta, and goat cheese until well blended, scraping sides as needed. Process or mix in eggs until thoroughly incorporated. Mix in sour cream. Pour into pan. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes or until top is puffed and golden. The middle portion should jiggle slightly. Remove to rack and cool completely. As close to serving as possible, remove rim of pan. Place cheesecake on serving plate. Spread pesto over top. Serve with crackers.
