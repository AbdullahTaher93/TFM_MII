Pour milk and water into a saucepan; add salt. Stir in rolled oats and steel-cut oats. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to low. Simmer until you get the consistency you like, about 20 minutes. The rolled oats will get creamy, while the steel-cut oats will have a luscious pop to them. Add more water at any time if it gets too thick. Serve. Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container. Reheat the next day with a little added water or milk..
