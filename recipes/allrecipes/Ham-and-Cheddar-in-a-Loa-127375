Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place dough on lightly floured surface; flatten slightly with hands, then roll into 12x8-inch rectangle with a rolling pin. (If dough is difficult to roll, cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for 30 min. before rolling out.) Top dough evenly with ham, overlapping slices slightly and leaving a 1/2-inch border around all sides. Mix Cheddar cheese and dressing; spread evenly over ham. Moisten edges of dough with water. Starting at one of the long sides of dough, fold 1/3 of the dough over filling and then repeat with other long side of dough. Firmly pinch ends of dough together to seal. Place, seam side down, on lightly greased baking sheet. Cut three diagonal slits in top of dough with kitchen shears. Brush evenly with beaten egg; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake 35 to 40 min. or until golden brown. Cool 10 min. before cutting into six slices to serve.
