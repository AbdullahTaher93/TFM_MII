Combine garlic and oil in a small saucepan. Simmer until cloves are a light gold color, about 15 minutes. Pour oil through a fine sieve, squeeze all juice from cloves, and then discard the solids. Add ghee, and stir until melted. Set garlic oil aside to cool. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Lightly oil a baking sheet. Place bread cubes in a large bowl. Drizzel cooled garlic oil over bread, gently tossing to coat. Only add enough oil to coat the bread cubes. Arrange bread cubes in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake, turning bread cubes periodically, until lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Turn out into basket lined with paper towels, and drain.
