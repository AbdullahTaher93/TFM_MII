Combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, baking soda and salt, and set aside. In a separate bowl, cream the butter with the sugar. Add the eggs, one at a time, and stir in the pumpkin puree. The mixture will be loose and wet. Using a low speed mixer, add the flour, one third at a time, blending well after each addition. Stir in the apple cider until smooth. Spoon half of the batter into a greased and floured bundt pan. Make a layer with 2 cups of the MILKY WAY(R) Bars. Cover it with the remaining batter. Bake in a preheated, 350 degree F oven for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely. Gently loosen the sides of the cake from the pan, and invert it onto a cake plate. Unmold the cake from the pan, letting it carefully slip out. To make the drizzle, heat 1/2 cup of remaining MILKY WAY(R) Bars with condensed milk in microwave for about 20-30 seconds. Drizzle the sauce over the top of the cooled cake. Decorate the top with reserved chopped candy.
