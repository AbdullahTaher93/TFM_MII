Remove corn husks and silks; slice kernels off cobs (3 ears yields 2-3 cups) into medium bowl. Scrape cobs with back of knife to release remaining juices. Preheat large saute pan on medium-high 2-3 minutes. Season scallops with salt and pepper. Place oil in pan, then add scallops; cook 1-2 minutes on each side or until golden, opaque, and firm. Remove pan from heat; transfer scallops to plate and cover to keep warm. Cut bacon into small pieces (using kitchen shears) while adding to same pan (wash hands); cook 3-4 minutes or until crisp. Drain bacon fat, reserving one tablespoon in pan. Stir in trinity mix; cook 2-3 minutes or until soft. Combine blackening seasoning, half-and-half, and corn; add to pan. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook 3-4 more minutes, stirring frequently to prevent sticking. Transfer corn mixture to serving dish; top with scallops and chives. Serve.
