Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Place 1 biscuit into each of 10 ungreased standard-sized muffin cups. Press dough firmly into bottoms and up sides of cups. Spoon 1 generous tablespoon of beans into each biscuit cup. Bake 11 to 13 minutes or until edges of biscuits are golden. Sprinkle each bean cup cheese. Return to oven and heat 1 minute or until cheese has melted. Let cool slightly. Loosen edges of biscuits before removing from pan.
