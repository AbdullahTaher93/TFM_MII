Cook pasta in a pot of boiling salted water until al dente. Drain. In large bowl, stir together oil, vinegar, garlic, basil, and salt and pepper. Toss with warm macaroni to coat well. Toss with Parmesan. Cover, and refrigerate 2 to 3 hours. Add broccoli, pepperoni, and tomatoes; toss well. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese, and serve.
