Stir the chili-garlic sauce, garlic, lime juice, and white wine together in a small saucepan over medium-high heat; allow the mixture to simmer until reduced to about 1/3 its original volume, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. Pour the heavy cream into a saucepan and cook over medium heat until reduced to about 1/3 its original volume, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat the medium low. Whisk the cooled garlic mixture into the cream. Add the butter to the mixture about 2 tablespoons at a time, whisking vigorously to incorporate. Season with salt and pepper to serve.
