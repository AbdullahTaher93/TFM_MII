Pulse lentils in a food processor until coarsely ground; transfer to a large mixing bowl. Mix onion, egg, bell pepper, and bread crumbs with the lentils; add mozzarella cheese, garlic, salt, and pepper to the lentils and mix. Divide the mixture into four equally sized portions, roll into balls, and flatten into patties. Spread cornmeal into a wide, shallow bowl. Dredge patties in cornmeal to coat. Heat olive oil in a wide skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties in skillet until browned, about 5 minutes per side.
