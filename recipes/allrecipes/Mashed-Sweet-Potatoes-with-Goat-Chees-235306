Place sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and transfer sweet potatoes to a large bowl. Mash sweet potatoes with half-and-half and butter with a potato masher until butter is melted; add goat cheese, maple syrup, sage, and paprika. Stir potatoes until evenly seasoned.
