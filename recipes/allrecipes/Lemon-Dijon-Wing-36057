In a large bowl, stir together the olive oil, lemon juice, mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper. Add chicken wings, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Preheat grill for high heat. Drain marinade from chicken into a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, and simmer for 5 minutes. Set aside for basting. Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill wings for 10 to 15 minutes, or until juices run clear. Turn frequently and baste with the marinade during the last 5 minutes.
