In a large bowl, combine the flour, cheese, caraway, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In another bowl, beat the eggs, yogurt, butter and mustard. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Pour into a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.
