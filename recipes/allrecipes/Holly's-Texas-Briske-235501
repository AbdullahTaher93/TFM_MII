Preheat grill for medium-low heat or 270 degrees F (132 degrees C), and lightly oil the grate. Whisk chili powder, brown sugar, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, ground black pepper, and dry mustard together in a small bowl to create the dry rub. Pierce fatty side of the brisket with a knife about 50 times. Sprinkle 1/2 the dry rub generously over the lean side of the brisket. Turn meat over and sprinkle remaining 1/2 the dry rub over the fatty side, rubbing into the pierced fat. Cook brisket, uncovered and fatty-side up, on the preheated grill for 4 hours. Transfer brisket to a roasting pan and cover pan tightly with aluminum foil. Preheat oven to 270 degrees F (132 degrees C). Cook in the preheated oven until meat is tender and pulls easily away from the side of the brisket, about 8 more hours. Let meat rest 30 minutes before slicing.
