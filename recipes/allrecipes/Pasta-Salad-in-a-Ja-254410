Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook tortellini in the boiling water until they float to the top, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain water. Place in the refrigerator to cool, about 15 minutes. Layer pesto, cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, tortellini, and mache into the canning jar; season with salt and pepper.
