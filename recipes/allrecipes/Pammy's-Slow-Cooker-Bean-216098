Wash and pick over the beans, then place them in a large bowl. Fill the bowl with cold water, and soak the beans for 6 to 8 hours. Drain and rinse the beans, then place into a slow cooker. Pour in 8 cups of water. Stir in onion, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and bay leaves. Place the turkey leg into the cooker, cover, and cook on Low setting for 6 hours. Stir in olive oil, and add more water if the beans are beginning to dry out; cook until the beans are very tender, an additional 2 hours.
