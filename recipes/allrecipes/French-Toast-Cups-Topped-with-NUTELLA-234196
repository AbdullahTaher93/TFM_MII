Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Spray a 6-muffin, non-stick muffin tin with cooking spray. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, vanilla and cinnamon. Dip each slice of whole grain bread in the egg mixture one at a time, lightly coating both sides. Gently press each slice of bread into the muffin cups. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until muffin cups are cooked and golden. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine yogurt, sugar and orange zest. Divide the NUTELLA(R) equally between the 6 cups, spreading on the inside. Spoon in some orange yogurt and top with fresh berries.
