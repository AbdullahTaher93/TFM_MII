Place eggs in a large saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and remove from heat. Cover the saucepan with a lid and let sit until eggs are cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water until eggs are cold. Peel and chop eggs. Stir chopped eggs, mayonnaise, green onion, celery, gherkins, brown mustard, and dry mustard together in a bowl. Season with salt and black pepper. Sprinkle paprika over the top.
