Combine cheese and sour cream in bowl of electric mixer and beat on high speed until smooth. Add sugar and vanilla extract and beat until well combined. Reserve 4 teaspoons of the mixture and set aside. (You should have 1 cup for the parfaits.) Fill each of 4 small parfait glasses or champagne flutes with layers, starting with 2 tablespoons of the cheese mixture, then some cookie crumbs, and then a layer of blueberries. Repeat the pattern once more using the remaining cheese mixture, crumbs, and blueberries. Finish by dabbing 1 teaspoon of the reserved cheese mixture on top of each parfait. Use any extra berries and crumbs to garnish, if desired. Chill at least 30 minutes before serving.
