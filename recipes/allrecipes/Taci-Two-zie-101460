In 12-inch skillet, prepare ground beef, Lawry's(R) Taco Spices & Seasonings and water according to package directions; set aside and keep warm. On each tortilla, evenly spread refried beans, covering the entire tortilla. Arrange taco shell on center of each tortilla and fold edges up around shell, lightly pressing to 'stick' tortilla to shell. Evenly fill each taco with beef mixture. Top with your choice of taco toppings and serve.
