Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Add to a food processor the parsley, lemon juice, garlic, cumin and the olive oil. Process until well blended. Add 2 Tbsp of the tahini and blend again. Place each trout on a separate sheet of heavy duty foil (or double sheets of regular foil). Place 1 heaping Tbsp of the parsley mixture inside each trout and spread it evenly. Place two half slices of the lemon inside each trout and place two half slices on top. Wrap securely and bake for 20 -25 minutes at 375 degrees F. Meanwhile, in a small sauce pan over low heat, warm up the remaining mixture from the food processor and add the remaining tahini and the water. Do not boil just warm it. Stir occasionally. Remove trout from oven and carefully cut open the foil using a fork or knife. After all the steam has escaped, carefully transfer trout to individual plates. Serve with the sauce on the side.
