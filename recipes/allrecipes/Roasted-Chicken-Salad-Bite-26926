Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush chicken with olive oil, salt and pepper. Wrap in foil and bake in the preheated oven 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until internal temperature has reached 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove chicken from heat. Cool, debone and chop. In a large bowl, mix chicken, mayonnaise and dill. Gently fold in grapes, mandarin oranges and sunflower seeds. Spread the mixture on miniature croissants. Cover and chill in the refrigerator until serving.
