Beat 1/2 of the confectioner's sugar, shortening, cold water, cocoa powder, Irish cream liqueur, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 8 minutes. Beat in the remaining confectioner's sugar. If necessary, add cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to reach desired consistency.
