In a medium skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion, garlic and jalapeno peppers; saute until onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Add the beans and smash with the back of a ladle or large spoon until softened and heated through, another 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in pre-shredded Mozzarella or Oaxaca, sour cream, cumin and cayenne pepper, stirring until cheese is melted. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle Cotija cheese on top. Serve warm or at room temperature with chips and vegetables.
