Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat butter or margarine with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Add one cup of the flour, the sugar, eggs, baking powder, vanilla, cinnamon, soda, and cloves. Beat until thoroughly combined. Stir in the remaining flour. Beat in bananas and nuts. Drop by rounded teaspoons 2 inches apart onto a greased cookie sheet. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Cool cookies on a rack.
