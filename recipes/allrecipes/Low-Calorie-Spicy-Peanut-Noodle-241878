Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook noodles in the boiling water until heated through, about 1 minute. Drain and rinse noodles under cold water. Mix powdered peanut butter, soy sauce, sriracha sauce, and stevia together in a bowl. Add noodles, cucumber, and green onion and toss to coat. Refrigerate until flavors blend, about 20 minutes.
