Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray muffin tins with cooking spray. Cook sweet potato in the microwave until tender, about 6 minutes. Peel and dice sweet potato; transfer to a large bowl. Mix biscuit mix, brown sugar, milk, zucchini, eggs, margarine, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and nutmeg into sweet potato. Spoon 1/3 cup batter into each muffin cup. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.
