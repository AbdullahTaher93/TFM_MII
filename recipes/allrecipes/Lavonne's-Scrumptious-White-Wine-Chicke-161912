Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Season the chicken breasts with garlic powder, poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper. Place the breasts in a 9x13 baking dish. Whisk together the wine, Worcestershire sauce, and vegetable oil in a small bowl; pour the wine mixture over the chicken breasts. Cover the entire dish with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven about 45 minutes; uncover the dish and spoon the liquid from the pan over the breasts. Recover with foil and bake until the juices run clear, another 20 to 30 minutes.
