Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Heat oil in large skillet. Add onion; cook over low heat, stirring regularly, until golden and slightly caramelized, about 20 minutes. Place onion in a shallow 9-by-9-inch ovenproof dish. Add corn and bell pepper. Beat eggs; stir into half-and-half. Pour egg mixture over casserole, add salt and pepper, and stir. Sprinkle cheese on top. Bake at 400 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes until firm. Brown top under a broiler. Let cool for 10 minutes. Cut in squares and serve.
