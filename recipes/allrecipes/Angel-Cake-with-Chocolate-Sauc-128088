Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). To Make the Cake: In a small bowl, whisk together the cake flour and 1/2 cup (125 ml) of the sugar; set aside. In a large bowl, with an electric mixer at medium speed, beat the egg whites, orange-flower water, vanilla, cream of tartar, and salt until soft peaks form. With the mixer at medium-high speed, slowly add the remaining 1 cup (250 mL) sugar, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) at a time, continuing to beat until the whites are stiff but not dry. Gently fold the reserved flour-sugar mixture into the egg whites, then fold in the orange zest. Pour the batter into a 10-inch (4-L) tube pan and run a knife through the batter to remove any air bubbles. Bake for 30 minutes, or until the top springs back when lightly touched and a cake tester or toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven and invert on a wire rack. Let cool in this position until the pan is no longer hot. To remove the cake, run a sharp, thin-bladed knife around the sides and inner tube of the pan. Lift the cake out of the pan, then remove the bottom of the pan. Place the cake on a serving plate. To Make the Sauce: In small saucepan, combine the sugar, orange juice, and water, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low and whisk in the cocoa powder until smooth. If desired, top the whole cake with orange slices before cutting. Serve with the Chocolate Sauce.
