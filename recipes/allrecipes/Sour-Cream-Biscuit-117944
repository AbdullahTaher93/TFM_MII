Place the biscuit mix in a large bowl. Combine the sour cream and lemon-lime soda; stir into biscuit mix just until combined. Turn onto a floured surface; knead 4-5 times. Roll to 1/2-in. thickness; cut with a 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter. Place on greased baking sheets. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. In a small mixing bowl, beat the butter, honey and orange peel until fluffy. Serve with biscuits.
