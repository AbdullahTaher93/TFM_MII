In a large, heavy, preferably nonstick skillet, bring wine, clam juice, and ginger to a simmer. Add fish; cover, and poach until fish is cooked through, turning once, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, heat oil in another heavy, large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add carrots, bell pepper, and mushrooms and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Add soy sauce and sesame oil and stir to coat. Divide rice among 4 plates. Top with vegetables and fish.
