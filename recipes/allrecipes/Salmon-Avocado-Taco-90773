Preheat barbecue grill. To make salsa, in a small bowl, combine avocado, tomato, onions, cilantro, oil, lemon juice, chili, and garlic. Mix lightly. Season to taste with salt and set aside. In a shallow bowl, stir together lime juice, garlic, pepper, and oil. Stack tortillas, wrap in foil, and set aside. Rinse fish and pat dry, then turn in lime juice mixture to coat well. Cut a piece of heavy-duty foil the same size as fish. Place fish skin side down on foil. Place foil with fish on a grill 4 to 6 inches above a solid bed of medium coals (you can hold your hand at grill level for 4 to 5 seconds) or over medium heat on a gas grill. Set foil-wrapped tortillas at edge of grill. Close lid on gas grill; cover charcoal grill and open vents. Cook until fish is just opaque but still moist in thickest part; cut to test (10 to 12 minutes). Pull off and discard skin from fish; cut fish into 1-inch chunks and transfer to a warm serving bowl. Season to taste with salt. To assemble each taco, place a warm tortilla on a plate; top with chunks of fish, salsa, cabbage, and cheese. Fold tortillas to enclose filling and eat out of hand.
