Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 7x11-inch baking dish. Mix flour, sugar, egg, egg white, vegetable oil, milk, pumpkin pie spice, and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Gently stir in the thawed winter squash. Pour squash into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 1 hour.
