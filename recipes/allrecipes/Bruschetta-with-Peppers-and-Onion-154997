Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Put baguette slices on baking sheet and brush tops with oil. Bake in oven until golden brown. In large skillet melt the butter and brown sugar, add the pepper stir-fry and cook over medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes, or until all the moisture has evaporated and the vegetables are caramelized. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Top each baguette slice with a portion of the pepper mixture and some of the crumbled goat cheese. Sprinkle on basil. Serve while warm.
