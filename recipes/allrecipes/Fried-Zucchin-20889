Place zucchini and onions in a medium bowl and mix together. In a small bowl mix flour, cornmeal, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Pour dry mixture over zucchini/onion mixture, cover bowl and shake well. Let mixture sit for about 30 minutes; a batter will form on the vegetables. In a medium skillet heat oil over medium heat. When oil is hot add breaded vegetables and fry, turning to brown evenly.
