Coat four 5-ounce ramekins with non-stick cooking spray. To prepare custard: Pour 1/4 cup of milk into small, heatproof bowl, sprinkle gelatin, and let stand 5 minutes. Place bowl in a larger bowl of hot water and stir until gelatin dissolves. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, combine SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, clementine or tangerine peel, salt, and remaining 1 1/2 cups milk. Bring just to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to low and cook 5 minutes, stirring frequently, at a bare simmer. Remove saucepan from heat. Stir in gelatin mixture and juice. Pour into a 4-cup glass measuring cup. Evenly divide milk mixture among the ramekins. Chill, loosely covered, for at least 3 hours, or until set. To prepare sauce: In a medium saucepan, combine blueberries, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, and water. Cook over medium heat, stirring, for about 5 minutes or until softened and a sauce forms. To serve: Run a table knife around inner edge of each cup and invert onto serving plates. Serve with sauce.
