Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease an 9x11-inch baking dish. In a large bowl, gently mix together the cooked turkey, cream of chicken soup, corn, carrots, potatoes, and chicken stock until thoroughly combined. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish. In a second bowl, mix the baking mix and milk to form a dough; roll the dough out to a 9x12-inch rectangle on a floured work surface. Place the dough on top of the baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is bubbling and the biscuit dough topping is browned, about 25 minutes.
