Add the remaining cookie mix, egg and flour; mix well. Cover and refrigerate for 1-2 hours or until firm. On waxed paper, roll out the plain and chocolate dough into separate 9-in. x 5-in. rectangles. Cut each rectangle into nine 1-in. strips. Stack the strips in groups of three, alternating plain and chocolate strips, and forming six separate stacks. Form two blocks by placing one plain-topped stack on each side of a chocolate-topped stack and one chocolate-topped stack on each side of a plain-topped stack; press together gently (see how-to box below left). Cut both stacks into 1/4-in. slices. Place 3 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Immediately insert a skewer into each cookie. Remove form pans to wire racks to cool.
