Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir sausage, onion, and green bell pepper until vegetables start to become tender, about 8 minutes; add pineapple and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pineapple is hot, about 5 minutes more. Beat pineapple juice and cornstarch together in a bowl using a whisk. Stir brown sugar, cider vinegar, soy sauce, and minced garlic with the pineapple juice until the sugar dissolves into the liquid; pour over the sausage mixture and cook until the sauce thickens, 5 to 8 minutes.
