Pour vinegar and wine into a glass bowl. Whisk in salt, sugar, and pepper until the sugar has dissolved. Slowly pour the olive oil into the bowl while whisking rapidly to blend together. Stir in garlic, thyme, marjoram, basil, and tarragon; fold in shallots and tomatoes. Store in the refrigerator until serving.
