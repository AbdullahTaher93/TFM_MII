In a large bowl, stir together the orange juice concentrate, lemon juice, lime juice, garlic, onion and herb seasoning and lemon-herb seasoning. Pour into a resealable bag and add fish fillets. Seal and marinate the fish for a couple of hours or overnight in the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Arrange the fish fillets in a single layer in a shallow baking dish. Pour the marinade in with them and cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until fish is cooked through.
