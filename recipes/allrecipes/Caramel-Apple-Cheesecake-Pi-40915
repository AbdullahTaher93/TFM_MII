Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place pie crust on baking sheet; pour 1/2 can of pie filling into crust and spread evenly. Set aside. With a mixer, beat together cream cheese, sugar, lemon juice, and vanilla until fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing after each addition; pour filling over apple layer. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until center is almost set. Cool. Prior to serving, garnish (in this order) with remaining apple filling, caramel sundae syrup, and optional toasted pecans. *Helpful Hint: Spread out pecans evenly on a baking sheet. Place into a 375 degrees F oven for 3-5 minutes or until pecans are well toasted.
