Cut ribs into 2-rib sections. Place ribs in Dutch oven or large saucepan. Add enough cold water to cover ribs completely; cover with lid. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover. Simmer 20 minutes; drain. Preheat grill to medium heat. Grill ribs 10 minutes or until ribs are cooked through, turning occasionally and brushing generously with the barbecue sauce.
