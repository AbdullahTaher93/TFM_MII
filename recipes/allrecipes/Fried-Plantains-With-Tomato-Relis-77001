In a medium saucepan, heat 2 Tbs. oil. Saute the onions and garlic until translucent, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, peppers and bouillon cubes. Cook on low heat for 10 to 15 minutes. Add salt and black pepper. Remove from heat but keep warm. In a large, heavy pan or deep fryer, heat 1 cup oil. Season the sliced plantains with salt and pepper. In small batches, fry them for about 3 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to a paper towel to drain; keep warm. Arrange the plantains attractively on a heated plate and scoop a large spoonful of sauce over each plantain. Serve immediately.
