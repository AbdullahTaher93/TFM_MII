Place potatoes and onion in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Top with chicken. Combine tarragon, sage, salt if desired and pepper; sprinkle over chicken. Cut the top off the garlic bulb (the end that comes to a closed point) so each clove is exposed. Place cut side up in the baking dish. Drizzle oil over garlic and chicken. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 60 minutes. Uncover and bake 10-15 minutes longer or until chicken juices run clear and garlic is soft. Transfer chicken to a serving platter and keep warm. Cool garlic for 5 minutes; gently squeezed garlic into a small bowl and lightly mash. Toss garlic with potatoes and onion; arrange around chicken.
