Set the oven to broil. In a small bowl, stir together the jam and sauce until well blended. Coat a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Arrange the salmon on it, sprinkle on salt and pepper, then spoon 2/3 of the sauce over the fillets. Broil for 5 minutes, or until the fish flakes. Spoon the remaining sauce over the fillets before serving.
