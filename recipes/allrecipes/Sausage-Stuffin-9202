Cook sausage. Drain. Melt margarine. Add enough to sausage drippings to make 1 cup. Saute; onions and celery in margarine/dripping mixture until onion is tender. DO NOT BROWN. Stir in about 1/3 bread cubes. Put in big bowl and add remaining bread cubes, poultry seasoning, and pepper. Watch your hands, it's hot. Mix well. Stuff turkey. You can also omit the sausage, increase the bread cubes to 9 cups, and add a teaspoon or two of salt. You can also add apples, giblets, oysters, etc. This recipe is very adaptable. When cooking extra in the oven, place the stuffing in a buttered casserole dish, and place in a pan of hot water. Cover, and baste with turkey drippings occasionally. It comes out really good.
