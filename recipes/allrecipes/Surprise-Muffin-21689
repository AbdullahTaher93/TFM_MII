Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. Stir together flour, wheat germ, baking powder, salt and brown sugar. In a separate bowl, mix together butter, egg and buttermilk. Stir milk mixture into dry ingredients; mix just until combined. Fill prepared muffin cups half full with batter. Make a depression in the center of each muffin and drop in 1 teaspoon of jam. Cover jam with additional batter. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes.
