Rinse the peaches and pat dry with paper towels. Halve each fruit and discard the pit. Using a small sharp knife, dice the flesh, then divide it between 4 wine glasses or dessert dishes. Rinse an ice cream scoop with hot water and use to scoop the sorbet. Put a scoop on top of the peach in each glass. Add 2 tablespoons sparkling wine to each glass, then sprinkle with the toasted almonds.
