Prepare the cornbread according to package instructions. Once cornbread is cooled, crumble it into a large bowl. Stir in the bread crumbs. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large pot, saute sausage in margarine with the onion, garlic, green bell pepper and celery until tender. Stir parsley, poultry seasoning, sage and salt into the mixture. Pour broth, eggs and cornbread/breadcrumbs into the mixture; mix until the ingredients stick together easily. Transfer to a 9x13 inch pan. Bake covered in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 30 minutes.
