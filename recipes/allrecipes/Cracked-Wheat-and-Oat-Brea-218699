In large bowl, combine boiling water, cracked wheat, oats, honey, butter, and salt; cool to 120 degrees to 130 degrees F, about 15 minutes. Add 1 cup all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, undissolved yeast, and rosemary, if desired. Beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes. Cover; let rest 10 minutes. Divide dough into 3 equal pieces; form each into smooth ball. Arrange balls in greased 9 x 5-inch loaf pan. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Brush top of dough with egg white; sprinkle with oats. Bake at 375 degrees F for 35 to 40 minutes or until done. Cover with foil during last 10 to 15 minutes if loaf is getting too dark. Remove from pan; cool on wire rack.
