Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Arrange beets in a baking dish and pour in water; cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until beets are tender, about 1 hour. Allow beets to cool overnight; remove outer skin and chop beets into bite size pieces. Whisk balsamic vinegar, honey, red wine vinegar, and black pepper together in a bowl. Stir beets, onion, and walnuts into vinegar dressing. Sprinkle with blue cheese, parsley, and salt to serve.
