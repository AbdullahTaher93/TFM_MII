Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease an 8 1/2-inch springform cake pan and line the base with waxed paper. Put the melted chocolate and butter into a small bowl and mix together. Set aside. In a bowl, beat together the egg yolks and sugar until thick and fluffy. Beat in the chocolate mixture. Fold in the flour and nuts. Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold into the cake mixture. Spoon the mixture into the pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 minutes. Turn out onto a wire rack to cool. Chill the cooled cake. To prepare the ice cream, beat together the egg yolks and confectioners' sugar until thick and fluffy. In another bowl, beat together the cream and kirsch until soft peaks form. Fold into the egg yolk mixture. Fold in the mashed kiwi fruit. Cut the chilled cake horizontally in half. Put a half in the base of the springform pan. Pour the ice cream mixture on top and smooth the top. Cover with the remaining cake and freeze for 4-5 hours, or until frozen. To garnish, turn the cake out onto a serving plate. Whip together the cream, sugar, and vanilla until soft peaks form. Put a quarter of the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip. Spread the remaining cream over the top and sides of the cake. Press the grated chocolate around the side. Pipe swirls of cream around the top of the cake and decorate with kiwi slices.
