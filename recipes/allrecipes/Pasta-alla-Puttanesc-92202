In a 4- to 5-quart pan, bring about 2 quarts water to a boil over high heat; stir in pasta and cook, uncovered, until just tender to bite (8 to 10 minutes). Or cook pasta according to package directions. Meanwhile, warm marinara sauce in a 3-quart pan over medium heat. Add hot chili flakes, basil, oregano, olives, anchovies, capers, tuna, and chopped parsley. Cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through. Drain pasta well and pour onto a platter or individual plates; top with sauce. Garnish with parsley and rosemary sprigs, if desired.
