In a skillet, saute onion, green pepper, thyme and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder in oil until vegetables are crisp-tender. Meanwhile, sprinkle steak with remaining garlic powder. Grill or broil steak 5 inches from the heat for 6 to 8 minutes (for medium-rare), turning once, or until desired doneness is reached. Add tomatoes to skillet. Combine reserved tomato juice and cornstarch; add to vegetable mixture. Cook and stir until thickened. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Thinly slice meat; top with vegetables.
