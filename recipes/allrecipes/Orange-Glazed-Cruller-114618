In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add milk, butter, sugar, salt and eggs; mix well. Beat in 2 cups of flour until smooth. Add remaining flour. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Punch dough down; divide in half. Return one portion to the refrigerator. On a floured surface, roll out second portion into an 18-in. x 9-in. rectangle; cut width-wise into 3/4-in. strips. Fold each strip in half lengthwise and twist several times. Pinch the ends to seal. Place on greased baking sheets. Repeat with remaining dough. Cover and let rise until almost doubled, about 35-45 minutes. In an electric skillet or deep-fat fryer, heat oil to 375 degrees F. Fry crullers, a few at a time, until golden, about 1 minute on each side, turning with a slotted spoon. Drain on paper towels. Combine glaze ingredients; brush over warm crullers.
