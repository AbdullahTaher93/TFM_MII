Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine apple pie filling and cranberry sauce in a shallow baking dish. In a medium bowl, mix the butter, oats, and brown sugar until crumbly. Sprinkle evenly over the fruit mixture. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes, or until browned and crisp.
