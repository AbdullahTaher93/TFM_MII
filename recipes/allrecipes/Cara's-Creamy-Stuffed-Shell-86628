Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place shell pasta in the pot, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. Place the beef in a skillet over medium heat, and mix in eggs, oil, garlic, garlic salt, and parsley. Cook until beef is evenly brown. Transfer to a large bowl, and mix with cream cheese and 1 cup pasta sauce. Stuff the cooked pasta shells with the beef mixture, and arrange in the prepared baking dish. Cover evenly with the remaining sauce. Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until bubbly. Sprinkle with Romano cheese just before serving.
