In a large saucepan, combine broccoli, water, ham, soy sauce and one flavoring packet from the noodles (discard second packet or save for another use). Break noodles into small pieces; add to pan. Simmer, uncovered, for 6-8 minutes or until noodles are tender, stirring frequently. Top with olives if desired.
