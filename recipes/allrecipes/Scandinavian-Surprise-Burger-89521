Form burger into eight 2-oz. patties and sprinkle with dill weed, salt and pepper. Slice cheese into thin squares, about 1 1/2" wide. Put cheese in the center of each of four patties. Take the other four patties and place over the cheese, seasoned side down. Crimp the edges together well. Split the buns in half and toast on the grill. Grill the burgers over medium-high flame for about four minutes per side, or until fully cooked. Serve with lettuce and tomato.
