Generously season roast on all sides with salt, black pepper, and granulated garlic. Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over high heat until oil begins to smoke. Add roast to pot and sear to form a crust, about 5 minutes per side. Remove roast and lower heat to medium. Stir onions, celery, and garlic into pot; cook and stir, scraping any brown bits off the bottom, for 1 to 2 minutes. Add oregano and basil to onion mixture; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour dry sherry into onion mixture; bring to a boil while scraping any browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook, stirring, until the liquid is reduced, about 5 minutes. Add canned tomatoes and cook until mixture just begins to bubble. Stir vegetable juice cocktail and wine into tomato mixture. Return roast and any accumulated juices to pot, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes. Stir potatoes, carrots, and onions into pot and simmer until meat and vegetables are tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Remove meat to rest; remove vegetables to a bowl. Slice meat and serve topped with vegetables and sauce.
