Rinse and drain scallops. Peel oranges into segments and slice avocados and onion. Arrange lettuce on large platter, scattering orange segments over lettuce. Fan out the avocado slices on top of lettuce and top with red onion. Heat oil in large skillet over high heat. When oil is very hot, season the scallops and add half to pan. Let scallops cook in pan for 2 minutes then turn over and cook the other side until just golden brown. Place scallops on top of salad and repeat with remaining scallops. Drizzle the dressing and serve immediately.
