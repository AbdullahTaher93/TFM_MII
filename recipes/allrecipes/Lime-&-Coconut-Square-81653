Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Separate the eggs, setting aside 1 egg white for the pie crust recipe. Beat the remaining egg whites with the water and a pinch of salt, cover and set aside. In a medium to large bowl, beat the egg yolks with the cream and lime juice. Add the Splenda and mix well. Add the guar gum and whisk until completely dissolved and then another 30 seconds or more to be sure it is well distributed. Cover and set aside. Make the crust dough on using the single egg white that you reserved (instead of the Just Whites and water). Firmly press dough into a lightly butter non-stick 8x8 baking pan. Take your time and make sure it is very flat and even. Bake for 12 minutes at 350 degrees F or just until the edges start to show a tiny bit of color. Let cool. Meanwhile, toast the coconut for the topping. In a dry fry pan over medium heat add the coconut flakes and stir occasionally until they begin to brown. Transfer to a plate, bowl or paper towel and sprinkle with 1 tsp of Splenda (optional). Set aside. Then in a sauce pan over med-low heat melt the butter. Beat the egg yolk mixture again and then slowly (little by little) pour in the melted butter while whisking. Pour this mixture back into the sauce pan and heat on med-low heat while whisking continuously for about 3 minutes (it seems like forever when you are whisking constantly - but you want to cook the egg yolk but you don't want scrambled eggs). Slowly add the beaten egg whites, whisking rather fast for 30 second and then normally for another minute or two. It should be quite thick at this point, as thick as mayo and developing an elastic quality to it (you'll see). If not, continue cooking until it thickens. Pour the lime mixture over the cooled crust; spread it out evenly paying attention to the edges. Sprinkle the toasted coconut evenly over the top. Refrigerator for at least 1 hour. (Now clean up the kitchen while you wait. I'm sure that you made a bit of a mess!) Cut into 16 squares. Enjoy!
