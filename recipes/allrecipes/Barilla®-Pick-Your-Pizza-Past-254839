Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and grease a 3-quart rectangular baking dish; set aside. In a medium pot warm the Traditional sauce, Italian seasoning, and vegetable toppings. In a large pot bring 4 to 6 quarts of water to a rolling boil; add salt to taste and the Elbows; stir gently. Cook pasta according to package directions; remove from heat, drain well, and return to pot. Add Traditional sauce to the pasta in the pot; stir to combine. Stir in half of the mozzarella; spread evenly into prepared baking dish. Layer on additional toppings and sprinkle with remaining cheeses. Bake for 15 minutes or until cheeses are melted and lightly golden brown.
