Spread goat cheese onto one side of one slice of bread and mango chutney on one side of the other slice of bread. Sandwich bread slices together around the goat cheese and chutney. Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Cook sandwich in melted butter, pressing with the back of a spatula occasionally to assure the cheese melts, until the bread is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
