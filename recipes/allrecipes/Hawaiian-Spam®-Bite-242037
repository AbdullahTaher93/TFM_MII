Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Mix grated luncheon meat, pineapple, bread crumbs, milk, egg, red pepper flakes, salt, black pepper, and white pepper together in a bowl. Spoon about 1 teaspoon meat-pineapple mixture onto the center of each wonton wrapper. Brush the edges of wrapper with water and fold in half diagonally over filling, sealing the edges together. Arrange wontons on the prepared baking sheet; brush each with olive oil. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes.
