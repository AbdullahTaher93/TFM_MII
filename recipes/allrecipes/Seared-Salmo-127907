Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Place a nonstick baking sheet in oven. Season salmon fillets with salt and pepper and heat a skillet over high heat. When skillet is hot but not smoking, coat lightly with cooking spray and place salmon in pan. Cook for 3 minutes without disturbing. When salmon has developed a brown crust, flip and brown other side, about 3 minutes. Transfer salmon to hot baking sheet in oven and roast for another 7 to 10 minutes, depending on thickness, until salmon is cooked through.
