Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a mixing bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, flour, baking powder and sugar. Add corn and pour into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake for 40 minutes. In a small sauce pan, combine butter, sugar, water and flour. Cook until clear. Once corn mixture is cooked, remove from oven, pour butter and sugar mixture over top and serve.
