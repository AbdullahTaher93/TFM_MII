Place each ham slice in a greased 10-oz. ramekin or custard cup. Sprinkle with onions and 1 cup cheese. In a bowl, beat eggs and yogurt until blended; pour into cups. Sprinkle with parsley and the remaining cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Serve immediately.
