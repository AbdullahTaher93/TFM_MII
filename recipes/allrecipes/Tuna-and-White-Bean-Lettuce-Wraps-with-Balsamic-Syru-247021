Place tuna, cannellini beans, onion, parsley, and capers in bowl. In separate bowl, whisk together olive oil, red vinegar, and lemon juice. Salt and pepper to taste. Pour into tuna mixture. Stir gently to combine. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Bring balsamic vinegar to a boil over medium-high heat in a sauce pan. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 1 minute. Add brown sugar and salt and stir to dissolve. Continue stirring until sauce thickens, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Sauce will thicken as it cools. To serve, place tuna on lettuce leaves and drizzle with balsamic syrup and sunflower seeds.
