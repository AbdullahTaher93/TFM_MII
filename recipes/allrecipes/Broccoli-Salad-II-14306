Place turkey bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. Prepare dressing by whisking together the sugar, salad dressing or mayonnaise and vinegar. Pour over broccoli, grapes, onion, turkey bacon and sunflower seeds. Toss until well coated, refrigerate until chilled and serve.
