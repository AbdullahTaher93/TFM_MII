Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)). Sift flour, salt, and baking soda together into a bowl. Repeat sifting process 2 more times. Beat sugar and shortening together until smooth and creamy. Add flour mixture, buttermilk, eggs, lemon extract, vanilla extract, and butter extract; beat until batter is just combined. Pour batter into prepared tube pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 75 minutes. Cool in the pan for 15 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
