Remove and discard large outer leaves and core from the cabbage. Slice cabbage (a little thicker than for cole slaw). Bring to a boil a stock pot of lightly salted water. Add cabbage and cook for about 2 minutes. Drain and set aside. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the celery seeds and the shallots. Stirring frequently, cook for about 2 minutes. Add the heavy cream and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered for about 3 minutes (or until cream reduces enough to thicken). Add the cabbage, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Heat thoroughly (about 2 minutes). Serve immediately.
