Peel orange (save fruit for another use). Place the peel in a small saucepan and cover with water; cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Drain. Cover peel again with water and cook for 3 minutes; drain. Finely chop peel; set aside. In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Combine egg and milk; stir into dry ingredients just until combined. Fold in nuts and orange peel. Pour batter into three greased and floured 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pans to a wire rack.
