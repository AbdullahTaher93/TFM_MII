Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir in leeks and garlic; cover and cook 5 minutes. Add chopped peppers and broth; cover and simmer 30 minutes, until peppers are very soft. Cool to room temperature. Puree soup in batches in a blender or food processor. Whisk in yogurt; season to taste with salt and black pepper. Refrigerate, covered, at least 2 hours, or until cold, before serving. Cut tops from 6 remaining peppers and remove seeds and membranes. Place in a dish that will hold peppers upright. If soup separates, whisk to blend. Pour chilled soup into bell-pepper cups and serve.
