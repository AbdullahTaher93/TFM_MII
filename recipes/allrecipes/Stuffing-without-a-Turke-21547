Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Prepare the stuffing according to directions on package. Over medium-low heat in a large saucepan, place the ground beef, onions and garlic. Slowly cook and stir until the onions are soft and the beef is evenly brown. Drain and set aside. Place potatoes in a large, deep skillet with oil. Slowly cook and stir 10 minutes, or until evenly brown and tender, but firm. Mix the stuffing, ground beef mixture, potatoes, pepper, salt, pimento peppers, olives, sweet pickles and dill pickles in the baking dish. Return to the oven and bake 30 minutes. Serve hot.
