Heat oil in a heavy skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift flour, baking powder, powdered milk, and salt together in a large bowl. Pour water over flour mixture and stir until a sticky dough forms. Form dough into a ball using floured hands. Fry the dough in the hot oil until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer fry bread to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
