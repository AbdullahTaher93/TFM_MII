Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans. Combine lecithin, 3 tablespoons flax seeds, and chia seeds in a bowl; add boiling water. Allow seed mixture to soak until thickened, about 5 minutes. Blend seed mixture in a blender on high speed until smooth. Add almond milk, honey, and molasses; blend until smooth. Sift spelt flour, rye flour, baking powder, and salt together into a bowl; add sesame seeds and 1/2 cup flax seeds. Pour almond milk mixture into flour mixture and mix until dough is evenly combined and holds together. Divide dough between the prepared loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven until bread is cooked through and crust is lightly browned, about 1 hour 20 minutes.
