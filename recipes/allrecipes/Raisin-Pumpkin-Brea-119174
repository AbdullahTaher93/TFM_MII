In a mixing bowl, cream butter and brown sugar. Beat in the eggs, pumpkin, syrup, orange juice and peel; mix well. Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda and cloves; add to creamed mixture just until blended. Fold in raisins and pecans. Transfer to a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean and top is golden brown. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely.
