Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place squash on a baking sheet, flesh-side up. Roast in the preheated oven until tender and slightly brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool until easily handled. Scoop flesh into a food processor; pulse until smooth. Add chicken stock, 1/4 cup at a time, while continuing to pulse, until smooth. Season puree with salt and pepper.
