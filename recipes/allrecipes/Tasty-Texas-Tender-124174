If using chicken breasts, cut into 4-in. strips; set aside. Combine cereal, garlic salt and dill. Dip chicken tenders or strips in oil, then roll in cereal mixture. Place on a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes or until juices run clear. Serve with sour cream for dipping if desired.
