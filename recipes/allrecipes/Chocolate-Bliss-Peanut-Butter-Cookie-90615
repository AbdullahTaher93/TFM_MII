Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coarsely chop 8 of the chocolate squares; set aside. Microwave remaining 8 chocolate squares in large microwavable bowl on full power (100%) 2 minutes, stirring after 1 minute. Stir until chocolate is completely melted. Add sugar, peanut butter, butter, eggs and vanilla; stir with wooden spoon until well blended. Add flour and baking powder; mix well. Stir in chopped chocolate and peanuts. (Note: If omitting peanuts, increase flour to 3/4 cup to prevent excessive spreading of cookies during baking.) Drop rounded tablespoonfuls of dough onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake 12 to 14 minutes or until cookies are puffed and feel set to the touch. Cool on baking sheets 1 minute. Remove to wire racks; cool completely.
