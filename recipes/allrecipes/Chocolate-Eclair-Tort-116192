In a large saucepan, bring water and butter to a boil. Add flour all at once and stir until smooth ball forms. Remove from the heat; let stand for 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue beating until mixture is smooth and shiny. Line a large baking sheet with waxed paper. Draw a 10-in. circle on the waxed paper. Grease the paper. Drop batter by rounded tablespoonfuls just inside the circle outline. Bake at 400 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack. Immediately prick with a fork and cool completely. Cut off top third of puffs. Pull out and discard soft dough from inside. For filling, in a large bowl, whisk milk, pudding mixes and vanilla for 2 minutes; let stand for 2 minutes or until soft-set. Fold in whipped topping. Place bottom ring of cream puffs on a serving platter. Spoon filling inside. Top with top ring. Refrigerate. For icing, in a microwave, melt chocolate and butter with milk; stir until smooth. Stir in vanilla. Add confectioners' sugar and stir until smooth. Cool for 5 minutes. Drizzle over top of cake. Serve immediately. Refrigerate leftovers.
