In a large bowl, combine the first six ingredients. Stir in the egg, egg yolk, baby food and oil just until moistened. Fold in nuts. Spoon into two greased 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 325 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, combine the sugar, buttermilk and butter; bring to a boil. Cool and stir for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in vanilla. Poke holes with a fork in top of loaves. Pour topping over loaves. Cool in pans for 10 minutes or until topping is absorbed. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
