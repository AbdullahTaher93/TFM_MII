Cut tenderloin into 1/2 inch steaks. Slice each steak in half horizontally, from the smallest toward the largest side, until there is only a very small section keeping the two halves connected. Slice a few small scores on the outer edges of each steak to prevent them from curling up when frying. Preheat oil and bacon drippings in a large heavy skillet over medium high heat. In a large shallow dish, combine flour, salt and pepper. In a separate shallow bowl, beat together egg and milk. In another shallow dish, combine bread crumbs and cracker crumbs. Dredge the steaks in the seasoned flour, and using a meat mallet, pound them down to just slightly less than their 1/4 inch thickness. Dip the steaks in the egg mixture, then coat each steak on both sides with the crumbs. Set aside on a clean plate. When all steaks are evenly coated, place prepared steaks gently in a single layer into the hot oil. Fry steaks for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle each steak lightly with lemon juice.
