Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 2 quart casserole dish. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add celery and onion; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Mix in the bread crumbs and parsley and remove from the heat. Add the oysters and eggs, and season with salt, pepper, poultry seasoning and thyme. Stir in enough liquid from the oysters to moisten and mix everything thoroughly. Transfer to the casserole dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is toasted and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
