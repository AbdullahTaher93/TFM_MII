Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. In a large bowl, stir together flour, salt and baking powder. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in milk, mixing just until dough holds together. Form dough into a round and place onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until a butter knife inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean.
