In a shallow glass dish, stir together the lemonade concentrate, soy sauce, celery salt, seasoned salt, and garlic powder. Place steaks in the mixture, cover, and marinate overnight in the refrigerator. Preheat your oven's broiler. Remove pork steaks from marinade, and discard marinade. Place steaks on a broiling pan. Broil about 4 inches from the heat source for 5 to 7 minutes per side, or to desired degree of doneness.
