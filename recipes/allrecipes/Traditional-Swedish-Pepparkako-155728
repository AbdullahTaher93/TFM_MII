Sift the flour together with the baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and cardamom in a mixing bowl. Beat the butter together with the white and brown sugars in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Mix in the egg and corn syrup until smooth. Gradually stir in the flour mixture until evenly blended. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions and wrap tightly each with plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 1 hour, or overnight. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets. Using 1 portion at a time, work on a floured surface and roll out dough to 1/8 inch thick. Cut into shapes with cookie cutter, and place 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until set, about 5 minutes. Cool completely. Store in tightly covered tins.
