Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Combine butter, mustard, onions, poppy seeds and dill seed. Spread insides of buns with this mixture. Place a slice of cheese and a slice of ham inside each bun. Wrap buns in foil and place in preheated oven. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until cheese has melted.
