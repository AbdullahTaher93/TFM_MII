In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the first five ingredients. Add the pork, a few pieces at a time, and shake to coat. In a large nonstick skillet or wok, brown pork in oil. Add salsa and peach preserves; cover and simmer for 10-15 minutes or until meat is no longer pink. Serve over rice if desired.
