Flatten chicken to 1/2-in. thickness. In a shallow bowl, beat egg and water. In another shallow bowl, combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese and soup mix. Dip chicken in egg mixture, then coat with crumb mixture. Place in a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan; drizzle with butter. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until juices run clear. Meanwhile, prepare rice according to package directions. Serve with chicken.
