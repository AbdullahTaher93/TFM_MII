Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Combine orange juice, soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, hot sauce and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. Transfer half the dressing to a small bowl; add scallions, water chestnuts and sesame seeds, and toss. Rub tuna with canola oil and sprinkle with salt and the remaining 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Grill until the fish is opaque, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Add watercress to the large bowl and toss to coat with the remaining dressing. Cut the tuna into 2 portions. Divide the watercress between 2 plates and top with the tuna and scallion-ginger relish.
