Flatten chicken to 1/4-in. thickness. Top each with a slice of ham and cheese; fold to fit. Roll up tightly and secure with toothpicks. In a shallow bowl, combine the flour and paprika. Coat chicken with flour mixture. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Cook chicken for 5 minutes on each side or until browned. Add grape juice and bouillon. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 30 minutes or until chicken is tender. Remove chicken and keep warm. In a small bowl, combine cream and cornstarch until smooth. Gradually stir into pan juices. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Spoon over chicken.
