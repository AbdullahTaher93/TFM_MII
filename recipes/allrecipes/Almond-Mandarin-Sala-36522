In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, cook bacon until evenly brown. Drain, cool, and crumble. To make the dressing, thoroughly blend the vinegar, honey, dry mustard, celery salt, paprika, and olive oil. Place lettuce, oranges, green onion, bacon, and almonds in a serving bowl. Toss with dressing and serve.
