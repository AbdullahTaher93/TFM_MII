Heat 1 teaspoon peanut oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add fenugreek seeds, and fry for a few minutes until they darken slightly. Remove the seeds from the skillet and allow to cool. Place cilantro, cooled fenugreek seeds, dried chilies, salt, and tamarind paste into a blender. Puree until smooth, then transfer to a storage container, and top with 3 tablespoons peanut oil. Store in the refrigerator.
