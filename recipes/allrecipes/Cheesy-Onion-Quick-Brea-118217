In a small nonstick skillet, saute onion in oil until tender; set aside. Place biscuit mix in a bowl. Combine egg and milk; mix well. Stir into the biscuit mix just until moistened. Stir in the onion mixture, 1/2 cup cheese and poppy seeds. Transfer to an 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Drizzle with butter. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean and loaf is golden brown. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Store in the refrigerator.
