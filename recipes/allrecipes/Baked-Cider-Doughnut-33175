Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease the doughnut pan with cooking spray. In a large bowl, stir together the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, powdered milk, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Make a well in the center and pour in the eggs, honey, apple juice concentrate and vanilla. Mix until well blended. Fill each depression in the prepared doughnut pan 2/3 full with batter. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the tops spring back when lightly touched. Allow doughnuts to cool before removing from pan.
