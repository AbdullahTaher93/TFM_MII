Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Line cookie sheet with foil. Place each chicken breast, smooth side down, between pieces of plastic wrap or waxed paper; gently pound with flat side of meat mallet or rolling pin until about 1/4 inch thick. Over each chicken breast, sprinkle 1/4 cup crushed corn snacks and 1/4 of the green chiles; place 1 slice cheese in center. Fold ends of chicken over and tuck in sides; secure with toothpicks. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place seam side down on one side of cookie sheet. In small bowl, toss thawed corn with oil. Place corn on other side of cookie sheet. Bake 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in blender, place roasted peppers, whipping cream and water; cover and blend on high speed 15 seconds or until smooth. In 2-quart saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add garlic; cook and stir 1 minute. Add pepper mixture and bouillon cube; heat to boiling. Cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is reduced and thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove chicken from cookie sheet; place on cutting board. Let stand 5 minutes. Cut chicken into 1/4-inch-thick slices. In 12-inch skillet, heat each tortilla over high heat until blistered on each side; place on individual dinner plates. Place 1/2 cup rice on one half of each tortilla; fan slices of 1 chicken breast leaning on rice. Top chicken on each evenly with roasted pepper sauce, roasted corn and cilantro.
