Cut the shortening into cubes, and toss into flour. Take your hands and crumble it up into a fine, pebbly, grainy sort of dough. Add water, enough to make a soft dough. Form into a ball, and chill for about an hour. When chilled, knead it a couple of times on a floured surface. Roll it out, and proceed to fill with your choice of pie fillings.
