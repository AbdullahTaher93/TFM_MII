Cook chicken and onion with 1 tablespoon water in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until onion is soft. Meanwhile, blend picante sauce with tomato sauce; set aside. Wrap tortillas in moist paper towels. Place on microwave-safe plate; heat on HIGH power for 45-60 SECONDS or until warm and softened. Remove from oven; keep wrapped. Fill each tortilla with 2 tablespoons cheese and 1/4 cup chicken mixture. Roll up; place seam side down in a 13x9x2-inch baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Cover evenly with sauce; sprinkle with remaining cheese. Seal pan with foil. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F oven for 30 minutes or until cheese melts and sauce bubbles.
