Heat oil in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add cubed pork, and fry until browned on all sides. Add cabbage, potatoes, green pepper, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, green onions, leeks and garlic. Season with thyme, basil and oregano. Pour in the red wine and water. Cover, and simmer over low heat for 2 hours, until everything is tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.
