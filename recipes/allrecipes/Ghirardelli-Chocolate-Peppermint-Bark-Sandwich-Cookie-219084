For the dough: Beat together the butter and sugar until smooth. Stir in the 3/4 cup melted and cooled chocolate chips. Stir in the flour, baking soda and salt. OPTION 1: Cookie cutters Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Form the dough into two 5 inch discs. Place a disc on a lightly floured work surface, sprinkle flour on top and use rolling pin to roll dough 1/4 inch thick. Use cookie cutters to cut into 1 1/2 inch circles or star shapes. Repeat with the second disc. After you roll out the second disc combine scraps from each and re-roll. Place 2 inches apart on parchment lined baking sheets. Bake for 15 minutes, switching the trays half way through if you are baking more than one tray at a time. Cool to room temperature. OPTION 2: Roll and cut dough Divide the dough in half. Place half on a piece of floured parchment paper. With your hands, gently shape into a 1 1/2 inch wide log. (You can put a little flour on your hands if needed.) Wrap the parchment paper around the log and gently roll the parchment paper and log together to make the log round. Repeat with the other log and a second piece of parchment paper. Refrigerate logs until hard, about 1 hour. (You want it hard enough so when you slice it your cookies stay round and don't get squished on one side.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Slice the dough 1/4 inch thick. Place 2 inches apart on parchment lined baking sheets. Bake for 15 minutes, switching the trays half way through if you are baking more than one tray at a time. Cool to room temperature. Assemble the sandwiches: Once cookies have cooled, brush the undersides of each with the remaining melted chocolate. Place a peppermint square on top of half the cookies. Place a second cookie, melted chocolate side down on top making a sandwich. Let the chocolate harden, about 30 minutes. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.
