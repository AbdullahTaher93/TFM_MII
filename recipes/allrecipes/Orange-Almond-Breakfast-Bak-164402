Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray bottom only of 13x9-inch (3-quart) glass baking dish with CRISCO(R) Original No-Stick Cooking Spray. In small bowl, beat egg with fork or wire whisk; stir in yogurt until smooth. Unroll dough on cutting board. Set icing aside. Cut each strip in half crosswise. Dip each strip completely in egg mixture, then twist 2 or 3 times; place in baking dish. Bake 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Meanwhile, in 1-quart saucepan, heat icing, butter, orange juice, almond extract and marmalade to boiling over medium heat. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened and shiny. Remove from heat; stir in almonds. Loosen rolls from baking dish with spatula. Drizzle with sauce; serve immediately.
