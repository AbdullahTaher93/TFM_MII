Line 2 sheet pans with foil and set aside. Melt half of the dark chocolate with the butter in the top of a double boiler until smooth. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, roughly chop the remaining chocolate and set aside. To make cookie batter, combine the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt in a small bowl, set aside. In a large bowl, beat the eggs and sugar until thick and light yellow, about 2 minutes. Stir in flour mixture and melted chocolate and beat for 1 minute. Fold in the chopped chocolate and nuts. Drop tablespoons of batter onto the prepared cookie sheet pans about 2 inches apart. Bake in a preheated, 325 degrees F oven for approximately 10 minutes, or until just firm. Remove from the oven, transfer to a wire rack and cool for 5 minutes before removing from the cookie sheet pans.
