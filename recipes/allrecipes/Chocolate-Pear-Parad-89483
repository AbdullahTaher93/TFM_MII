Make brownies, cut into eight portions while warm. Put the brownies on individual serving plates. With the back of an ice cream scoop, make a dent in each brownie the size of a pear half. Pour pears and syrup into a pot; heat with the cinnamon stick until almost boiling. Remove the pears carefully with a slotted spoon, placing them on the brownies cut-side up. Put a small scoop of ice cream in the center of each pear, and top with whipped cream. Drizzle a little chocolate in ribbons across everything, and serve quickly before the ice cream melts.
