Preheat oven to Broil/Grill. Place onions, bell pepper and tomatoes in a broiler pan. Broil until softened and starting to brown. Add chicken, sauce and water as needed for desired consistency. Mix all together. Broil for about 10 minutes, until chicken is cooked through (no longer pink) and sauce is piping hot.
