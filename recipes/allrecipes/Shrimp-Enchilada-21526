In a mixing bowl, combine 4 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, ginger, hot sauce, and shrimp. Coat shrimp well with mixture, and marinate 2 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch glass pie dish with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Fill flour tortillas with marinated shrimp, cheese blend and salsa. Fold tortillas into a roll and place in the greased pie dish. Spread a thin layer of salsa on top of the tortillas. Bake in a preheated oven for 20 minutes or until shrimp are pink.
