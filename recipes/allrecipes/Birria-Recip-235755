Place California chile pods and guanjino chile peppers into a saucepan and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and cool for 5 minutes. Pour chiles and water into a blender; add mixed spices, onion, and salt. Blend until sauce is smooth. Mix stew meat, sauce, and bay leaves in a large pot; cook over medium-low heat until meat is very tender, 3 to 5 hours.
