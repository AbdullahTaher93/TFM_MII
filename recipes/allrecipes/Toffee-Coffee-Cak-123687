In a mixing bowl, blend butter, sugars and flour; set aside 1/2 cup. To the remaining butter mixture, add buttermilk, egg, baking soda and vanilla; mix well. Pour into a greased and floured 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Combine chopped candy and pecans with the reserved butter mixture; sprinkle over coffee cake. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
