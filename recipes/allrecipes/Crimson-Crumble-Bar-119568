In a saucepan, combine the sugar, cornstarch, cranberries and pineapple; bring to a boil, stirring often. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 10-15 minutes or until the berries pop. Remove from the heat. In a large bowl, combine the flour, oats, brown sugar and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in pecans. Set aside 1-1/2 cups for topping. Press remaining crumb mixture onto the bottom of a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until firm; cool for 10 minutes. Pour fruit filling over crust. Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack.
