Puree tomatoes in a food processor. Pour pureed tomatoes into a large pot and place over medium heat. Stir onion, garlic, basil, chives, orange zest, and lemon zest into the tomatoes; cook at a simmer until slightly frothy, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir potatoes, mushrooms, black beans, and salt into the tomato mixture; continue simmering until the potatoes are tender, at least 30 minutes.
