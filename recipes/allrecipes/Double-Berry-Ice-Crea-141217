In a large saucepan combine sugar and gelatin. Stir in LACTAID(R) Whole Milk. Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture just starts to boil. Remove from heat. Whisk about 1 cup of the hot mixture into beaten eggs; return all to saucepan. Cook and stir for 1 to 2 minutes or until mixture coats a metal spoon (temperature will be about 175 to 180 degrees F). Do not boil. Stir in raspberries and strawberries. Cover and chill 4 hours or overnight until completely chilled. (Mixture will be very thick after chilling.) Transfer the mixture to a 4- or 5-quart ice-cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's directions. Makes about 2 quarts.
