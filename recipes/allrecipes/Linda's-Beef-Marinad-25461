In a large jar with a tight-fitting lid, mix the dry red wine, teriyaki sauce, honey, spicy brown mustard, dried minced onion flakes, garlic powder, fines herbs and ground black pepper. Seal the jar, and shake until the ingredients are well-mixed. Place steak or beef tips in a resealable plastic bag. Pour dry red wine mixture into the bag. Place in the refrigerator and allow to marinate at least 8 hours, turning the bag occasionally, before grilling as desired.
