Heat skillet to medium (hot enough to get a sizzle from the meat). Brown ground beef, drain fat and add meat to a large stockpot. On medium heat, combine Hormel(R) Chili with Beans, rinsed chili beans, canned whole tomatoes, tomato sauce and tomato paste in the stockpot. Finely chop and add habanero pepper and medium onion. Stir in masa (corn flour), chipotle pepper powder, chili powder and garlic powder. Add salt, pepper and cayenne pepper to taste. Continue simmering on medium heat for approximately one hour. The longer the chili simmers, the hotter it gets. Serve in a soup bowl with shredded cheddar cheese, a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of scallions on the top.
