Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a 9 inch pie plate with one of the prepared crust, reserving the second crust. Refrigerate both until needed. Place the ground pork, onion, sage, salt, and water in a large pan. Cook on low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching, for 2 hours. Drain off any cooking liquid remaining in the pan. Spoon the pork mixture into the prepared pie crust. Top with the second pie crust, trim as needed, and crimp edges to seal. Pierce the crust in a few places with a fork. Bake in preheated oven until crust is golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Serve hot.
