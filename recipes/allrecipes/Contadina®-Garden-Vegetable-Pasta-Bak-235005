Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Cook pasta in boiling salted water until al dente, or about 2 minutes less than directed on the package. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large deep skillet or saucepan. Add onion, mushrooms, carrots, peppers, garlic and basil. Cook until vegetables are soft, about 8 minutes. Stir in tomato puree, sausage, cooked pasta and 2 Tbsp. parsley. Heat through. Transfer to a 13x9-inch baking dish. Sprinkle evenly with remaining parsley and mozzarella cheese. Bake 10 to 15 minutes until cheese is melted. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
