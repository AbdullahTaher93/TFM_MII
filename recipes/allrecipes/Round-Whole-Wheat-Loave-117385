In a large saucepan, bring milk to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat. Stir in the shortening, honey and salt until shortening is melted. Cool to 110 degrees F to 115 degrees F. Combine the flours; set aside. In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add milk mixture and eggs. Beat in half of the flour mixture until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour mixture to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Shape into round loaves. Place each loaf on a greased baking sheet. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 35 minutes. With a sharp knife, make a deep X in top of each piece of dough. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks; brush with butter. Cool completely.
