In a medium saucepan over low heat, whisk together the cheese, flour and cream until melted and sauce-like. Remove from heat and cool. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together cooled cheese sauce, bacon, mayonnaise and milk until evenly blended. Serve over fresh salads.
