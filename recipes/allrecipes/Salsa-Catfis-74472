Sprinkle the fillets with the pepper and garlic salt. Prepare a hot fire. When ready to grill, place the fish on an oiled perforated grill rack over the fire. Grill until the fish is opaque and just beginning to flake when tested with a fork, about 10 minutes per inch of thickness, turning once halfway through the cooking. Serve the fish topped with salsa.
