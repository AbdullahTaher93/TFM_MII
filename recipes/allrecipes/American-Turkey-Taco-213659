Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir the ground turkey and onion in the hot skillet until the turkey is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Drain and discard any excess grease. Spread one side of the taco shell with avocado and the other side with sour cream. Fill each taco shell with ground turkey and top with Colby cheese and pico de gallo.
