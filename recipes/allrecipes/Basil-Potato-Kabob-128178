Cut the potatoes into 1-inch (2.5-cm) chunks. In a small bowl, mix the oil and basil. Thread the potatoes onto 9-inch (23-cm) skewers and rub all over with the oil mixture. Coat a grill rack with nonstick spray. Fire up the grill and heat for 10 minutes. Place the rack on the grill and place the potatoes on the rack. Grill the potatoes until tender, 20 to 30 minutes.
