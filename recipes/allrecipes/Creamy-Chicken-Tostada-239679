Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and peppers and cook for 5 minutes or until the vegetables are tender-crisp, stirring occasionally. Add the corn, beans and chicken to the skillet and cook until the mixture is hot. Stir in the soup and milk and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes. Squeeze 1 teaspoon juice from the lime. Place the avocado into a medium bowl. Add the lime juice and toss to coat. Divide the chicken mixture among the tostada shells. Top with the avocado mixture and cilantro. Season with hot pepper sauce, if desired.
