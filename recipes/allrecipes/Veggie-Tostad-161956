Preheat broiler on high. Place tostada shells on large baking sheet; spread beans evenly over tostada shells. Set aside. In large bowl, combine avocados, if desired, with lettuce, rice vinegar, oil, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; set aside. Broil prepared shells until very hot, about 1 minute. DO NOT BURN. Immediately top each hot shell with lettuce mixture. Top with cheese and salsa; serve immediately.
