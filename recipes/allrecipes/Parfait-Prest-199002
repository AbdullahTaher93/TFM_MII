In a small bowl, stir the SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, into the yogurt until combined. Set out two parfait, pilsner, or tall wine glasses. Spoon a handful of raspberries into the bottom of each, followed by about cup yogurt, 1 teaspoon granola, and banana and kiwifruit slices. Follow with another dollop of yogurt. Continue layering until all ingredients are used, ending with granola. Top each parfait with whipped topping and a raspberry, if desired.
