Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Trim and discard the root hairs from ramps. Trim tough ends from asparagus. Place ramps and asparagus on a rimmed baking sheet or in a shallow baking dish. Drizzle with olive oil, and toss to coat evenly. Season with salt and pepper, and toss to combine. Arrange ramps and asparagus on the hot grill in a single layer. Grill until hot and grill marks appear, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to platter, and serve hot or at room temperature.
