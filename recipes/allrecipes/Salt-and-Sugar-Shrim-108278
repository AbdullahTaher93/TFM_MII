Rinse shrimp and drain. In a large bowl, mix together salt and sugar. Add shrimp and stir to coat evenly. Cover bowl and chill at least 45 minutes or up to 2 hours. If using wooden skewers, begin soaking in water. Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for direct heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is directly under the food). Rinse salt and sugar mixture from shrimp and pat dry. Thread in a C shape onto metal or soaked wooden skewers. Lay skewers in a rimmed pan. In a glass measuring cup, combine oil, lemon juice and garlic; pour over shrimp and turn skewers to coat evenly. Fig. C. Let stand 5 to 10 minutes. Lay skewers on grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand just above grill level for only 2 to 3 seconds). Keep charcoal grill uncovered; close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning once with tongs, until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and opaque but still moist looking in center of thickest part (cut to test), about 5 minutes. Transfer skewers to a clean platter or plates and serve with lemon wedges to squeeze juice over the top.
