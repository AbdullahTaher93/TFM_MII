Mix garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, coriander, and allspice together in a bowl; add lamb. Form lamb mixture into 10-inch logs the thickness of hot dogs. Whisk egg and water together in a small bowl to make egg wash. Lay puff pastry sheets on a lightly floured work surface; roll gently to smooth the creases. Slice pastry into 10x4-inch strips. Brush egg wash over pastry. Place 1 lamb log on each strip of pastry; wrap dough around lamb and pinch edges to seal. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove plastic wrap and slice each piece of pastry into 8 pieces with a sharp knife. Arrange in a single layer on the lined baking sheet. Brush each piece with egg wash. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Serve with tzatziki sauce.
