Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spoon beans into a shallow 2- to 3-quart casserole. Stir in salsa, 1 tablespoon of the lime juice, and cilantro. Top bean mixture with corn, then sprinkle with cheese. Bake beans and corn in a 400 degree F oven until hot throughout and cheese is melted and bubbling, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, stack tortillas and wrap in foil. Place in the oven until tortillas are warm, about 5 minutes. While bean mixture and tortillas heat, peel and pit avocado. Cut into thin wedges and arrange wedges on a small serving plate. Sprinkle avocado with remaining lime juice. To eat tacos, spoon bean and corn mixture into warm tortillas. Offer avocado wedges and additional salsa to add to taste.
