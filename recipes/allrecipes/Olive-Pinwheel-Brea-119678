Unroll pizza dough and place on a lightly floured surface. Brush with oil; sprinkle with rosemary and olives. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a short side; pinch seam to seal and tuck ends under. Place seam side down on a greased baking sheet. Brush with egg yolk. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool before cutting.
