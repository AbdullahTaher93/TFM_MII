Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. Arrange fish on baking sheet. Season with 1/2 teaspoon cumin, salt and pepper. Combine tomatoes, olives, cilantro, oil and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon cumin in a small bowl. Spoon over the fish. Bake the fish until flaky and opaque in the center, 12 to 15 minutes. Serve immediately.
