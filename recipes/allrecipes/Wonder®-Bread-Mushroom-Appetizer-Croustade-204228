Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Wonder Bread Croustades: Cut crusts from Wonder Bread and flatten with a rolling pin until quite flat, about 1/8-inch thick. Cut circles from the bread with a 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter. (You can cut 2 circles from each slice of bread.) Lightly brush mini-muffin pan with melted butter. Gently press each round of bread into a mini-muffin cup, forming it into a bowl shape. Repeat, making as many Croustades as specified in the recipe. Bake about 9 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Leave them in the muffin pans; set aside. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Mushroom Filling: Melt butter in medium skillet over medium high heat. Cook green onions and mushrooms about 4 to 5 minutes or until moisture evaporates, stirring occasionally. Sprinkle with flour and stir well. Add cream and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Continue cooking until mixture thickens. Remove from heat and stir in parsley, lemon juice and cayenne pepper. Fill cups and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes.
