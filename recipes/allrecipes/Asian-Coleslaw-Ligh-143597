Place ramen noodles in colander; break into quarters. Pour boiling water over noodles to soften slightly. Use a fork to separate noodles. Rinse quickly with cold water; drain. Make a dressing by whisking together the flavor packet from the ramen noodles, olive oil, vinegar, and sweetener in a bowl. Place the ramen noodles, coleslaw mix, green onions, and sunflower seeds in a large bowl; toss to combine. Drizzle dressing over the coleslaw mixture and continue to toss until entire mixture is coated with dressing. Chill for 2 hours before serving.
