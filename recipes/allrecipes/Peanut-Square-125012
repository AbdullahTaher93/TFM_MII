Mix and bake cake according to package directions, using a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Cool. Cut into 24 squares; set aside. In a medium bowl, combine sugar and salt. Add vanilla and enough milk to make a thin frosting. Frost top and sides of squares and immediately roll in peanuts. Place on wire racks to harden.
