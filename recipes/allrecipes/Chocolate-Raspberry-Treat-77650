Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Coat an 8 x 8-inch baking pan with cooking spray. In a large saucepan, over low heat, melt the chocolate and shortening together; stir to combine. Remove from heat. Stir in 1/2 cup preserves, sugar, eggs, vanilla, flour, baking powder and salt. Spread batter in prepared pan; bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until firm but not dry. While brownies are still warm, carefully spread the preserves on top of the brownies. Let cool. If desired, sprinkle cooled brownies with powdered sugar. Cut into squares.
