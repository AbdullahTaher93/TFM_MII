In a saucepan, combine the processed cheese, cocoa, chocolate chips and margarine. Set over medium-low heat; cook, stirring frequently, until melted and well blended. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla, confectioners' sugar and walnuts. Pour into a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Allow to cool and then cut into small squares.
