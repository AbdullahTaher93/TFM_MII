Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan and dust with flour. Mix honey and vanilla extract together in a large bowl until smooth. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl; stir into honey mixture in small portions, integrating each before adding the next. Fold zucchini into batter. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pans 5 to 10 minutes before cutting to serve.
