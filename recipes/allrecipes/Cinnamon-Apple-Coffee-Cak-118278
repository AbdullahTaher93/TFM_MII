In a mixing bowl, beat the cake mix, pudding mix, eggs, sour cream and butter on medium speed for 2 minutes. Pour half into a greased 8-in. square baking dish. Top with apples. Combine the sugar, nuts and cinnamon; sprinkle half over the apples. Top with remaining batter and sugar mixture. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
