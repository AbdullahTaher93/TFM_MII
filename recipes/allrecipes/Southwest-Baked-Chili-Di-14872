Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large mixing bowl, combine Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, half of the olives, jalapeno peppers, garlic and hot pepper sauce. Spread the mixture into a 9-inch pie pan. Bake for 20 minutes, or until heated through. Sprinkle over the dish the remaining olives, chopped tomatoes and green onions.
