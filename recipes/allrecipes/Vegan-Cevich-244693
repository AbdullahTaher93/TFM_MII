Bring water, vegetable broth, and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove cover and let sit for 5 minutes. Spread quinoa onto a baking sheet and refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes. Combine quinoa, avocados, tomatoes, kale, cucumbers, scallions, jalapeno pepper, cilantro, lemon juice, and salt together in a bowl until well mixed.
