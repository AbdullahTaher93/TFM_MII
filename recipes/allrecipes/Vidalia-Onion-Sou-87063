Slice onions thinly. Place half of the onions in a skillet with half of the butter; cook, covered, over medium-high heat until soft, about 10 minutes. Remove to a platter, and cook remaining onions with butter. Return two-thirds of the reserved onions to the skillet. (Reserve the rest for garnish.) Stir in flour until well combined with onions. Slowly stir in chicken broth. Remove from heat, and let cool about 10 minutes. Stir in cream and milk. Pour into a blender, and blend until smooth and creamy. Return to stovetop, and heat through over medium-low heat. Pour into bowls, and garnish with reserved onions and chopped parsley.
