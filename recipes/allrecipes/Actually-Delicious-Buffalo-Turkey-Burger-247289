Preheat a George Foreman(R) Grill or an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Mix ground turkey, onion, panko, 1/4 cup Buffalo wing sauce, parsley, egg, garlic, celery seed, black pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and salt together in a large bowl; form into 12 patties. Grill patties on the grill for 3 minutes, flip and continue grilling until cooked through, about 2 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Top each burger with a slice of Monterey Jack cheese and place each inside a bun. Mix ranch dressing and 6 tablespoons Buffalo wing sauce together in a bowl; spread onto each burger.
