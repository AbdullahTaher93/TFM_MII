Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper-lined plate to drain, reserving bacon grease in the skillet. Dice the bacon once cooled enough to handle. Melt butter in the remaining bacon grease over medium heat. Cook and stir diced bacon, Dijon mustard, chili powder, red pepper flakes, basil, thyme, onion, and garlic until onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Stir wine and seafood seasoning into onion mixture; add shrimp and toss to coat. Pour shrimp and onion mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 20 minutes.
