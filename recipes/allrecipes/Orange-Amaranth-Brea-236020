Stir water, honey, and yeast together in a large bowl. Let stand until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 10 minutes. Whisk bread flour, whole wheat bread flour, amaranth flour, and vital wheat gluten flour together in a bowl. Stir orange zest, vegetable oil, and salt into yeast mixture. Gradually add flour mixture to yeast mixture to form a sturdy dough. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place dough in a large, lightly-oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Lightly grease a loaf pan. Punch down dough, turn onto a lightly floured surface, and knead 5 to 6 times. Form dough into loaf and place into prepared pan. Let rise until doubled in volume, 30 to 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake in preheated oven until the top is golden brown and the bottom of loaf sounds hollow when tapped, about 40 minutes.
