Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking dish. Combine corn, milk, butter, sugar, and eggs in a blender; blend until smooth. Pour mixture into a bowl; stir in pancake mix until batter is well blended. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
