Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Roll out prepared pizza dough to a size that will fit your grill. Place on grill for 5 minutes, or to desired doneness, and flip over. Now add the sauce, cheese, green bell pepper and mushrooms. Cover the grill and allow to cook over high heat for 5 to 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
