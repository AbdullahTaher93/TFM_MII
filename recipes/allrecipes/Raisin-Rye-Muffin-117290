In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt. Combine the water, honey and oil; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in raisins. Fill six muffin cups coated with nonstick cooking spray two-thirds full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm.
