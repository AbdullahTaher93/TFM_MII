Place pork, garlic, onion, carrot, celery, and tomato in a saucepan. Season with chili powder, salt, cumin, oregano, pepper, and bay leaf; add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover and simmer until pork is tender, about two hours. Cool and shred. Use in tacos or tamales.
