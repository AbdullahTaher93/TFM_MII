Heat oven to 400 degrees F. In large bowl stir Simply Potatoes(R), roast beef, mixed vegetables, gravy, salt and pepper until well blended. Divide mixture evenly into each frozen pie crust. Top each with refrigerated pie crust, trimming edges to fit. Pinch edges of both frozen and refrigerated pie crusts together to seal. Cut 4 to 5 slits into top of each pie for ventilation. Bake 50 to 55 minutes or until heated through, covering edges of crust if excessive browning occurs. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
