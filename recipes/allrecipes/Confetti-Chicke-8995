In a large saucepan, combine the carrots, onion, celery, and chicken broth. Stir all together, and let simmer for 20 minutes. In a 3-quart casserole dish, mix soup, sour cream, chicken cubes, mushrooms, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper. Add simmered vegetables and liquid; mix well. In a mixing bowl, mix the flour, baking powder and salt. Mix in eggs, milk, green pepper, pimentos and 1 cup of the cheese until well blended. Drop by spoonfuls on top of casserole. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until golden brown. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup of cheese, and continue baking another 5 to 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
