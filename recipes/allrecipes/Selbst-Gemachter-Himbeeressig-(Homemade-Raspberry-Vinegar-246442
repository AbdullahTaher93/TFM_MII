Mash raspberries with a fork in a bowl. Pour in vinegar; mix well to combine. Transfer to a glass container with a lid; cover and let stand until flavors combine, about 24 hours. Strain vinegar through a fine sieve into a bowl; discard raspberry pieces. Strain vinegar again through a coffee filter into a clean bottle and seal tightly.
