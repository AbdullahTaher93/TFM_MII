Cook beef in 10-inch skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until beef is brown; drain. Stir in Potatoes, Sauce Mix and hot water. Heat to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer uncovered 17 to 18 minutes, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender. Stir in corn; sprinkle with cheese. Cover and simmer 2 to 3 minutes, without stirring, until corn is hot and cheese is melted. Sprinkle with tortilla chips immediately before serving.
