In a saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons butter. Stir in flour until smooth; gradually add milk. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Stir in the mushrooms; set aside. In a bowl, whisk the eggs, cream, salt and pepper. In a skillet, heat the remaining butter until hot. Add egg mixture; cook and stir over medium heat until eggs are completely set. Transfer to a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish; top with mushroom mixture. Sprinkle with bacon. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 32-36 minutes or until heated through.
