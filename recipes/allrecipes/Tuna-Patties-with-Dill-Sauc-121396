Place parsnips in a saucepan and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 30-35 minutes or until tender. Drain well. Place parsnips in a food processor or blender; cover and process until smooth. In a bowl, combine 1 cup pureed parsnips, egg whites, bread crumbs, onions, parsley, lemon juice and peel, dill and pepper. Add tuna and mix well. Shape into eight 1/2-in.-thick patties (patties will be soft). In a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Cook patties for 5-6 minutes on each side or until lightly browned. Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl; serve with tuna patties.
