Rinse chicken; pat dry. With a heavy, flat mallet, gently pound chicken breasts between sheets of plastic wrap until meat is evenly 1/2 inch thick. Set aside. Chop green onions. Add onions to oil in a 12- to 14-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Stir often until onions are lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Lay a slice of soppresata on each chicken breast, pressing lightly so that the two meats stick together. Push onions aside and add chicken, soppresata side down, to pan. Cook just until edges of soppresata begin to brown on underside, about 4 minutes. Turn chicken over and cook until no longer pink in center (cut to test), about 4 more minutes. Transfer chicken, soppresata side up, to a platter; keep warm. To frying pan, add broth, garlic, mustard, lemon juice, and basil leaves. Boil over high heat for 1 minute, then pour over chicken. Garnish chicken with basil sprigs if desired.
