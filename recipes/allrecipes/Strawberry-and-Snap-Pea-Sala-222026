Bring a pot of water to boil and place a steamer insert in the pot. Place peas in steamer, cover, and cook until bright green, about 30 seconds. Drain and run under cold water until peas are cool; set aside. Whisk olive oil, raspberry vinegar, and Dijon mustard in a bowl until well blended. Allow vinegar dressing to rest for a few minutes. Combine sugar snap peas and strawberry slices in a large bowl. Pour dressing over pea mixture, gently tossing to combine. Serve immediately or chill for up to 1 hour.
