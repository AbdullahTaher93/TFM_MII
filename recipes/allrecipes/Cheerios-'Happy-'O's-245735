Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange chocolate chips flat side down on a non-stick baking sheet. Place (hook) a Cheerios 'O' on top of each chip. Carefully place pan in preheated oven. Bake only until you can see the chip is warmed, about 5 minutes. Remove cookie sheet from oven and lightly touch each 'O' to set in the chip. Cool.
