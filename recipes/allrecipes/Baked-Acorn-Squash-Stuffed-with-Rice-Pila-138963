Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut each squash in half crosswise. Scoop out and discard seeds and strings. If necessary, trim the bottom so that the squash sits level, and place on a rimmed baking sheet with open end up. Sprinkle with 1/4 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Cover pan with foil and bake the squash just until moist and tender about 45 to 50 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large skillet sprayed with nonstick vegetable cooking spray over medium-high heat, add olive oil. When heated, add onion (optional), garlic (optional), and celery. Cook 2 minutes and add green peas and carrots. Cover and cook 3 minutes. Add cranberries, sage, thyme, chopped pecans, and 1/2 tsp salt. Add cooked brown rice and mix well. Remove from heat and fill the center of each acorn squash half. Return the foil over the top and return to the oven for 15 minutes. Combine the grated mozzarella cheese and feta cheese and top each filled squash half. Return uncovered to the oven and bake 5 more minutes. Top with chopped fresh parsley.
