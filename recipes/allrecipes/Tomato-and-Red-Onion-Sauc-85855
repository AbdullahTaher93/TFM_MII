In a saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the cherry tomatoes, red onion, balsamic vinegar, chile pepper, garlic, Italian seasoning, sugar, salt and pepper. Simmer for about 15 minutes, then mash the tomatoes to release the juices. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thick, about 45 minutes. Allow to cool, then cover and refrigerate until needed.
