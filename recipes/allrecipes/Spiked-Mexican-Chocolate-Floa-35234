Make the topping: Combine cream, 1 tablespoon sugar and vanilla extract in medium bowl with electric mixer until peaks form. Set aside. Make the hot chocolate: Combine milk, remaining sugar, and cocoa powder in heavy medium saucepan and whisk over medium heat until just simmering. Remove from heat. Add vodka and Kahlua; stir to combine. In an eight-ounce mug, pour 2/3 cup of the hot chocolate. Add one scoop of ice cream. Add a dollop of the whipped cream topping, sprinkle with shaved chocolate and cinnamon powder. Garnish each cup of chocolate with cinnamon stick and serve immediately.
