Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Season the rabbit with salt and pepper, and spread the mustard onto it. Place into a Dutch oven, and pour the oil and white wine around it. Then put in the small onions and sprinkle with the bacon pieces. Bake covered, for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove lid and turn rabbit pieces over. Squeeze some juice from the orange over. Return to the oven, uncovered, for 30 minutes, or until rabbit is tender. Serve with sliced orange and mashed potato. Bon Appetite!!!
