Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, medium heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above the cooking grate only 4 to 5 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). While grill heats, peel onions and cut crosswise into slices 1/3 inches thick. In a large bowl, stir together oil, vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper. Add onions and mix well to coat. If cooking over charcoal, use a grill skillet or basket; if cooking over gas; use a grill sheet or basket. Transfer onions to oiled grill skillet, sheet, or basket (reserve oil mixture in bowl), and place on cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook, turning onions several times with a wide spatula, until lightly charred and limp, 10 to 15 minutes. Return onions to bowl and mix to coat with reserved oil mixture. Scrape into a small serving bowl. Serve warm or at room temperature.
