In a mixing bowl, combine peanut butter, soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, curry powder, garlic and hot pepper sauce. Place the chicken breasts in the marinade and refrigerate. Let the chicken marinate at least 2 hours, overnight is best. Preheat a grill to high heat. Weave the chicken onto skewers, then grill for 5 minutes per side.
