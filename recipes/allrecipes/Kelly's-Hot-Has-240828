Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir turkey in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Transfer browned turkey to a bowl. Heat olive oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir leek and red bell pepper until leek is soft, about 5 minutes; add carrot and cook until carrot is softened, about 5 minutes more. Stir zucchini and crimini mushrooms with leek mixture; cook and stir until mushrooms are completely tender, about 10 minutes. Top vegetable mixture with kale and stir into mixture as it wilts; cook and stir another 5 minutes. Return browned turkey to the skillet, stir with vegetables and season with hot sauce, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until the turkey is reheated, 2 to 3 minutes.
