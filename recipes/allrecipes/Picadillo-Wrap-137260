In 12-inch skillet, cook ground beef over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until thoroughly cooked; drain and return to skillet. Stir in uncooked Rice and Seasoning Mix, water, vinegar, cinnamon and salsa. Heat to boiling. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until rice is tender. Meanwhile, in small bowl, stir milk and Topping Mix 30 seconds until blended; set aside. Stir raisins, almonds and olives into beef mixture. Spoon about 3/4 cup mixture down center of each warm tortilla; roll up. Serve wraps drizzled with topping; garnish plates with lime wedges and cilantro sprigs.
