Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the bread crumbs on a sheet of waxed paper. Coat a large baking sheet with oil. Place the veal or turkey, mortadella or salami, Parmesan, parsley, and salt in a bowl. Mix with your hands just to combine. Shape into balls the size of large marbles. One at a time, dip the meatballs into the egg mixture. Lift out and shake off the excess egg, then drop each meatball into the bread crumbs. With the other hand, toss some crumbs over the meatball and roll it to coat. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Continue until all the meatballs are breaded. Coat all sides with oil from a mister or drizzle all the meatballs lightly with oil and roll them gently to coat with the oil. Bake for about 10 minutes, or until sizzling. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a meatball should register 160 degrees F.
