Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place steaks onto the grill rack of an oven roasting pan. In a small bowl, stir together the seasoning salt, sage and cinnamon. Sprinkle half of the mixture over the tops of the steaks. Roast for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, then sprinkle the top with half of the brown sugar. Roast for 10 more minutes. Turn the steaks over and season the other side with the remaining cinnamon mixture. Roast for 20 minutes, then top with the last of the brown sugar. Once the sugar is bubbling, turn over once more and cook until the other side is bubbling. Remove from oven and serve.
