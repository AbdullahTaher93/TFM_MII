Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir carrots and parsnips in melted butter until lightly browned on edges, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir orange juice, chicken stock, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper into carrots and parsnips. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cover. Simmer until liquid reduces to a syrup, about 10 minutes. Stir often. Season with more salt and black pepper if needed; sprinkle with chives.
