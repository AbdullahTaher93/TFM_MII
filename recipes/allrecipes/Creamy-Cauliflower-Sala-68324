Place egg in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel, and chop. Toss cauliflower florets, tomatoes, bacon bits, cheese, and eggs together in a bowl. In a separate bowl, dissolve sugar into vinegar and lemon. Whisk in mayonnaise until thoroughly combined. Pour dressing over salad, and toss gently to coat. Cover and refrigerate until well-chilled. Toss again gently, and serve.
