Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt butter/margarine and mix in a small bowl with mayonnaise and mustard. Pour mixture into a shallow bowl or plate. Season chicken with salt and pepper to taste. Roll seasoned chicken breasts in mayonnaise mixture, then dip in mixed herbs and place in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours.
