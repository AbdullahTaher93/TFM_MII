Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Coat asparagus with vegetable and arrange on a baking sheet. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Roast in preheated oven until lightly browned at the tips, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, combine lemon juice, butter, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon black pepper in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in on high in microwave until butter is completely melted, about 1 minute; stir to combine. Pour butter mixture over roasted asparagus and toss to coat.
