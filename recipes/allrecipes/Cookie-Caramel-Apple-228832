Wash and dry apples. Insert one popsicle stick in the core of each apple. Heat caramels, water and butter in large heavy bottomed saucepan over low heat, stirring very often until caramels are melted and smooth. Dip apples into melted caramel, spooning caramel over apples to coat. Roll in cookie crumbs, pressing gently into caramel. Place on waxed-paper-lined baking sheet; let stand for 25 minutes or until caramel sets.
