In a bowl, combine the biscuit mix, 2 tablespoons sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon. Combine egg and milk; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Turn onto a heavily floured surface; knead 5-6 times. Roll out to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with a floured 2-1/2-in. doughnut cutter; set centers aside for buttons. For bows, twist each circle to form a figure eight; place on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown. Place buttons on another greased baking sheet. Bake for 6-7 minutes. Brush tops with butter; sprinkle with remaining sugar. Remove from pans to wire racks.
