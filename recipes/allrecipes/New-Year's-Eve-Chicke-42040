Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. Arrange the chicken wings in a single layer in the prepared baking dish. Season with salt and pepper. In a bowl, whisk together the Italian salad dressing, apricot jam, apple juice, and dry onion soup mix. Pour over the chicken. Cover and bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear. Remove lid during final 20 minutes of cooking.
