In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add egg and extracts; mix well. Combine the flour, nutmeg and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. On a lightly floured surface, shape dough into 1/2-in.-wide logs. Cut into 2-in. pieces. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 11-14 minutes or until center is set and edges are lightly browned. Cool for 2 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. For frosting, in a mixing bowl, combine the butter, confectioners' sugar, extracts and enough cream to achieve a spreading consistency. Frost cooled cookies.
