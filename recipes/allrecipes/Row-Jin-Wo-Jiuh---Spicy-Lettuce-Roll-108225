Heat butter in a large skillet; stir in the red pepper, red onion, celery, and pine nuts. Cook and stir until vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the paprika, coriander, and cayenne pepper over the vegetables; stir to blend. Stir in the ground beef and dash of soy sauce. Cook and stir until beef is browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Drain fat. Divide the beef mixture between the lettuce leaves. Gently roll up leaves, encasing the meat. Tie lettuce rolls with long chives. Serve immediately.
