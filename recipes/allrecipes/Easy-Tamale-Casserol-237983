Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Season beef with salt and pepper. Stir onion into the ground beef; cook and stir for 1 minute and immediately remove skillet from heat. Stir pinto beans and crushed tomatoes into the beef mixture. Beat cream-style corn, cornbread mix, and egg together in a bowl until smooth; spread over the top of the ground beef mixture in the skillet. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the corn mixture. Bake in preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the cornbread is set in the middle, about 25 minutes.
