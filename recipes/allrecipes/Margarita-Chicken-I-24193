Preheat oven to Broil. Combine the lime zest, lime juice, tequila, honey, oil, cornstarch, garlic salt and pepper in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring, to thicken the sauce. Broil chicken breasts for 10 to 15 minutes, or until cooked through (no longer pink inside). Baste with prepared sauce for last 5 minutes of cooking time. To serve, arrange a folded tortilla on each of 4 plates; add a chicken breast, 2 tomato wedges and some avocado chunks. Drizzle chicken with remaining sauce and garnish with 2 lime wedges.
