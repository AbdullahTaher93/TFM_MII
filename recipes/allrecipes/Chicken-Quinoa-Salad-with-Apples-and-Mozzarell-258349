Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Spread on a platter; let cool. Combine chicken, Granny Smith apples, mozzarella cheese, parsley, thyme, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Mix in raspberry vinaigrette. Chill salad for 20 minutes. Fold quinoa into the salad. Refrigerate until serving.
