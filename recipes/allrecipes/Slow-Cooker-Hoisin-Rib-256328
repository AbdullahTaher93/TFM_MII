Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread pork ribs on a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Whisk hoisin sauce, sugar, soy sauce, white wine, tomato paste, garlic, chili-garlic sauce, and five-spice powder together in a bowl. Grease a slow cooker insert with cooking spray. Transfer pork ribs to the pot. Cover evenly with hoisin sauce mixture. Cook on Low, stirring halfway through, until pork ribs are tender, about 8 hours.
