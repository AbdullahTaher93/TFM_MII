Heat oven to 375 degrees F. In 8-inch skillet, cook sausage over medium heat, stirring frequently, until no longer pink; drain. In large bowl, mix thawed spinach, cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, garlic and cooked sausage. Unroll dough into 1 large rectangle on ungreased cookie sheet; press into 13x8-inch rectangle, firmly pressing perforations and seams to seal. Spoon sausage mixture in 4-inch-wide strip lengthwise down center of rectangle. Top with slices of both cheeses. With scissors or sharp knife, make cuts 1 inch apart on long sides of dough rectangle to within 1/2 inch of sausage mixture. Fold strips of dough up over sausage mixture to meet in center; pinch to seal. Bake at 375 degrees F for 18 to 24 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from cookie sheet; cut into crosswise slices. Serve warm.
