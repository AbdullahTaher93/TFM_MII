Dissolve 3 teaspoons chicken bouillon in 3 1/2 cups water in a rice cooker. Stir rice, baby bok choy, green onions, carrot, and mushrooms into the bouillon and water mixture. Start rice cooker and cook until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 50 minutes. Dissolve 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon and 1/4 cup water in a small bowl; transfer mixture to a blender. Scoop about 1 cup of the rice mixture into the blender with the bouillon mixture; process until mixture becomes a thin paste, adding more water as needed. Mix the rice paste with the remaining cooked vegetables and rice until thoroughly combined. Season with black pepper.
