Make Maple Barbecue Sauce. Drain and rinse tofu; pat dry. Cut into 1-inch cubes. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add tofu and cook, turning from time to time, until browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons oil to the pan. Add broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms and carrots; cook, stirring often, until just tender, about 4 minutes. Add the barbecue sauce and bring to a simmer. Stir in tofu and serve.
