Rinse rice in several changes of water until water runs clear. Drain. In a 3 quart heavy saucepan, bring water and salt to a boil. Add rice and boil, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes from time water returns to a boil. Drain. Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a small skillet. Saute pistachios until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes; set aside. Toss fruit in a bowl. In a clean saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons butter with cardamom and pepper. Alternately layer rice and dried fruit, beginning and ending with rice and mounding loosely. Make 5 to 6 holes in rice to bottom of pot with the round handle of a wooden spoon. Cover pot with a towel and a lid (fold towel over lid to keep it from burning.) Cook over moderately low heat, undisturbed, until tender and a crust forms on the bottom, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from heat and let rice stand tightly covered and undisturbed, at least 30 to 60 minutes. Spoon rice onto a platter. Break crust into 1-inch pieces and scatter over rice. Sprinkle with pistachios.
