Place ribs in a large pot, cover with water and add thyme, oregano, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and simmer for 40 minutes. Remove from heat and either let stand until ready to barbecue or cook immediately. Meanwhile, mix together the sauce ingredients and blend well. Remove ribs from liquid and brush both sides with the sauce. If possible barbecue the ribs 6 to 8 inches from the coals for 15-20 minutes or until brown and crisp. Basting frequently. Serve with remaining sauce.
