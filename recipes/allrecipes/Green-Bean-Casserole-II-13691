Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix the green beans with the soup and milk. Gently stir in half the French fried onions. Transfer to a non-greased 9x13 inch baking dish, and season with salt and pepper. Top with remaining French fried onions. Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 30 minutes or until bubbly. Serve hot.
