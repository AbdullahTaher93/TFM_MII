Separate cauliflower into florets. Steam in the microwave with 1 Tbsp of water for 2-3 minutes. You'll want the cauliflower to retain most of its crispness, so be careful not to over cook it. Drain. Cut the dill pickles into small chunks, about 1/2 the size of the largest florets. Mix all ingredients together in a non-metallic mixing bowl (or a large jar). Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours (but 24 hours is better). Drain off liquids before serving.
