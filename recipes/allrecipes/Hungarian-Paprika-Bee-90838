In a 4- to 5-quart nonstick pan over medium-high heat, stir onion in oil until onion is limp, about 7 minutes. Add paprika and caraway seed; stir until spices are fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add broth, cover pan, and bring to a boil. Stir noodles into broth, cover, and return to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until noodles are barely tender to bite, 6 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, discard any solidified fat from pot roast and sauce. Scrape sauce from meat into broth. Cut beef into 1/2-inch cubes and stir into broth. Cover and simmer over medium heat until beef is hot, about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Ladle stew into soup bowls. Add salt, pepper, and sour cream to taste.
