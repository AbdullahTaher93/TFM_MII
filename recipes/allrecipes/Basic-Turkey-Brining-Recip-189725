Mix water, kosher or coarse salt, sugar, minced or pressed garlic cloves, and pickling spices. Place meat in a plastic food bag (choose small cuts like pork chops, chicken breasts, or turkey breast slices), pour in brine to cover, then seal and chill 6 to 12 hours. Discard used brine; cook meat as desired.
