Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place French fries on a baking sheet, and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or according to package instructions. Heat the gravy in a small saucepan over medium heat. Place the hot fries in a large serving bowl or on a platter. Pour the gravy over the fries. Sprinkle shredded cheese over the top. Serve when cheese has melted.
