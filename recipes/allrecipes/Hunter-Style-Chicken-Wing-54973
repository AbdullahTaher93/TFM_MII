Sprinkle chicken with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Put flour in resealable plastic bag; coat wings in batches, shaking off excess flour. Wash hands. Heat 1/4 cup oil in nonstick Dutch oven or casserole over medium-high heat. Cook wings, in batches, 6 minutes, or until golden, adding additional oil if necessary. Add mushrooms, tomatoes, wine, and thyme to Dutch oven. Return all chicken to pot. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer 30 minutes, or until juices run clear when thickest part of wing is pierced. Taste sauce and season with salt and pepper if needed. (Refrigerate leftovers.)
