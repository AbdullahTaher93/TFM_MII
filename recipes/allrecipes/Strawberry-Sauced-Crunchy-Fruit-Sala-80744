Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the rice cereal and nuts into a baking pan. Stir in the brown sugar and margarine. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until toasty. Stir occasionally. Set aside to cool. In the container of a blender or large food processor, combine the strawberries, orange juice, confectioners' sugar and vanilla sugar. Puree into a smooth sauce. Set aside. To make the salad, toss the red, green and yellow apples with oranges and pineapple in a large serving bowl. Sprinkle with the nut crunch and spoon strawberry sauce over the top. Or you can serve the toppings on the side.
