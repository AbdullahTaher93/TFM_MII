Melt margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and green bell pepper in margarine until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir mustard, Worcestershire sauce, seafood seasoning, salt, hot pepper sauce, black pepper, and cayenne pepper into the onion mixture. Sprinkle flour over the mixture; stir to integrate. Pour cream over the mixture; bring to a boil, stirring constantly and cook for 1 minute. Fold crab meat into the mixture. Spoon some of the liquid from the skillet into the bowl with the beaten egg yolks to temper the egg; stir. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and stir. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. Transfer crab mixture to a bowl; refrigerate until chilled completely, about 1 hour. Mix bread crumbs, melted butter, and paprika in a shallow bowl. Divide the crab mixture into 4 portions; form into patties. Gently press the patties into the bread crumb mixture to coat. Pour enough corn oil into a flat-bottomed pan to be 1-inch deep; heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook patties in hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
