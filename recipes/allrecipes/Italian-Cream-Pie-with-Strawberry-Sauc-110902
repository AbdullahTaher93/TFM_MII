Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Fit crust into an 8- or 9-inch springform pan, pressing crust up side of pan to top edge. (Do not overwork or allow crust to get too warm.) Prick bottom and side of crust with fork. Bake 9 to 11 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool completely on wire rack. To Make Filling: pour 1/2 cup of milk into a medium saucepan; sprinkle gelatin over milk and let stand 1 minute. Stir in remaining 1/2 cup milk and SPLENDA Sugar Blend. Cook over low heat, stirring until gelatin dissolves. Pour milk mixture into blender; add ricotta and vanilla and process until smooth. Transfer to a large bowl; stir in whipped topping and yogurt. Remove crust from pan; place on a serving plate. Cut a piece of waxed paper long enough to fit around crust with a 1-inch overlap; fold paper lengthwise into thirds. Wrap paper around outside edge of crust, allowing it to extend about 3 inches above top to form a collar; secure with string. Pour filling into crust. Refrigerate until set, about 4 hours. Serve with Strawberry Sauce. To Make Strawberry Sauce: combine SPLENDA Sugar Blend and cornstarch in a medium saucepan. Add strawberries and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil. Cook 1 additional minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat; stir in lemon juice. Cover and chill.
