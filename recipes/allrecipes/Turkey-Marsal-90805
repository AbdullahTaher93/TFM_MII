Place turkey slices between sheets of plastic wrap and pound with a heavy mallet until slices are 1/8 inch thick. Season turkey as desired with salt and pepper. Pour flour into a wide, shallow bowl. Dip each piece of turkey in flour, turning to coat both sides. In a 12-inch nonstick frying pan, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat. Add as many turkey pieces as will fit in a single layer. Cook, turning once, until lightly browned and no longer pink in center (cut to test), about 2 minutes total; repeat to cook remaining turkey, adding 1 more tablespoon butter as needed. When done, transfer cooked turkey to a serving platter and keep warm. Add mushrooms and 1 more tablespoon butter to pan. Cook, stirring often, until mushrooms are browned, about 7 minutes. Add Marsala to pan, scraping pan to free browned bits. With a slotted spoon, lift out mushrooms and spoon them over turkey. Cook pan liquid over high heat, stirring constantly, until reduced to 3 tablespoons, about 1 minute. Stir in remaining butter until melted, then pour sauce over turkey. Garnish with lemon wedges.
