Place potatoes in a large pot of salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes; drain. Heat peanut oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir potatoes in hot oil until lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Add green onion and jalapeno pepper to the potatoes; cook and stir together until the pepper is tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Season potato mixture with kosher salt and black pepper. Remove skillet from heat and sprinkle cheese over potatoes.
