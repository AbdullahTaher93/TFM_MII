Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a rimmed pizza pan or baking sheet. In a large bowl, stir together flour, salt, oregano and black pepper. Mix in eggs and milk; stir well. Pour batter into prepared pan and tilt until evenly coated. Arrange toppings of choice on top of batter. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until crust is set. Remove crust from oven. Drizzle on pizza sauce and sprinkle on cheese. Bake until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.
