Heat the sesame oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the turkey with onion and garlic in the oil until the meat is no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Chop the meat up into crumbles as it cooks. Stir in the garbanzo beans, tomatoes, curry powder, chili sauce, and coconut milk; bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Season with salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes.
