Place tomatoes, onions, celery, parsley and bay leaves in a large pot and cook, covered, on low heat for 1 to 2 hours, until quite soft and fragrant. Remove bay leaves and blend tomato mixture in batches in a food processor or blender, then run through a sieve and return juice to pot. Stir in salt, sugar, seasoning salt, pepper and garlic salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and cook, uncovered, 1 to 2 hours, until thickened.
