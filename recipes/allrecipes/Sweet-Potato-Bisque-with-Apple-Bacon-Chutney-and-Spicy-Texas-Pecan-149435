Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat; add bacon. Cook for about 2 minutes to render the fat. Add onion, carrot, celery, and garlic, and saute for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently. Then add the orange juice and reduce to thick syrup. Add the potatoes and stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. Add SPLENDA(r) Sugar Blend for Baking and cayenne. Ladle mixture into a blender and pure thoroughly in batches; strain and season with salt and pepper. If the soup is too thick, thin with a little chicken or vegetable stock. Serve warm and garnish with Apple-Bacon Chutney and Spicy Texas Pecans (see separate recipes).
