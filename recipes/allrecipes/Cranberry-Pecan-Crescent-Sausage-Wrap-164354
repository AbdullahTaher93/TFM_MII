Heat oven to 400 degrees F. In small bowl, mix cranberries and orange juice. Let stand 15 minutes. Meanwhile, separate dough into rectangles; press each into 8x4-inch rectangle. Cut each rectangle into 8 (about 2-inch) squares. Place 1 sausage on each square; wrap dough around sausage. Pinch edges to seal. Place sausage rolls seam side down in 13x9-inch (3-quart) glass baking dish. Bake 10 to 15 minutes or until light golden brown. Meanwhile, drain orange juice from cranberries into 2-quart saucepan; reserve cranberries. Stir brown sugar into orange juice. Cook over medium heat 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved. Remove sausage rolls from oven. Pour orange juice mixture evenly over sausage rolls. Sprinkle with cranberries and pecans. Bake 10 to 13 minutes longer or until golden brown and bubbly. Serve warm.
