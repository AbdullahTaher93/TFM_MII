Bring 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons water to a boil in a small saucepan. Stir in couscous gradually until evenly moistened. Remove from heat; fluff with a fork. Pour couscous into a salad bowl. Let cool, 5 to 10 minutes. Fold in chickpeas, red bell pepper, and green onions. Whisk lime juice, honey, olive oil, coriander, cumin, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl to make dressing. Drizzle dressing over couscous mixture; stir gently until blended. Arrange nectarine over salad.
