To prepare the rice: In a large saucepan, combine diced tomatoes with juice, water, and a few dashes of hot pepper sauce. (Note: there should be at least 1 cup of juice from the canned tomatoes or 2 cups of total liquid) Add the rice. Reduce heat and cook until the rice is cooked; approximately 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand. To prepare the salsa: Heat canola oil in non-stick wok or skillet with garlic. Add chili powder, about 3 dashes of hot red pepper sauce, peppers, cilantro, tomato, and celery. Stir-fry for about 3-4 minutes. Add lime juice. Heat thoroughly. Serve over bed of rice.
