Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add orzo pasta and cook for about 5 minutes, until tender. Drain. Heat olive oil in a large frying pan or wok over medium-high heat. Fry the garlic and green onions for 20 to 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the tofu, and continue cooking until golden brown. Stir in the tomatoes, lemon juice, and basil; cook for another minute. Combine with the cooked orzo pasta, season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve sprinkled with crumbled feta cheese.
