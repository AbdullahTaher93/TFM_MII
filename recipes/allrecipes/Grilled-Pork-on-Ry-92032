Trim fat off pork chops. Place meat, a few pieces at a time, between sheets of waxed paper or plastic wrap. Pound with a flat mallet until pieces are 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Coat pork with half of the mustard and all of the olive oil. Place pork on a lightly oiled barbecue grill above a solid bed of hot coals (you can hold your hand at grill level only 1 to 2 seconds) or on a gas grill on high heat; close lid of gas grill. Cook, turning once, until pork is white in center (cut to test), 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from grill and keep warm. Place bread on the grill and cook until toasted on 1 side, about 30 seconds. Turn bread over and cover 4 of the slices with equal portions of cheese. Continue cooking bread until bottoms are toasted, another 30 seconds. Place cheese-topped bread slices on 4 dinner plates. Top each with 2 pieces of pork, then mound equal portions of cabbage relish over each. Spread 1 side of remaining plain toasts with remaining mustard. Place mustard-side down over relish and serve.
