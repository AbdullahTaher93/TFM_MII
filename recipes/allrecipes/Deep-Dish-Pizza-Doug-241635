Dissolve yeast and sugar in water in a bowl. Let stand until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. Mix 2 cups all-purpose flour, bread flour, corn oil, and salt together in a bowl; add yeast mixture and knead on a work surface using about 1/2 all-purpose flour until well mixed. Let dough rise in a warm area until doubled in size; about 2 hours.
