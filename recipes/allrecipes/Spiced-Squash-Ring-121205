Wash squash. Cut into 1/2-in rings; remove and discard seeds and membranes. In a shallow dish, beat 4 eggs and milk. In another shallow dish, combine the cornmeal, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg; mix well. Dip squash rings into egg mixture, then into cornmeal mixture; turn to coat. Place in a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan; drizzle with butter. Cover and bake at 400 degrees F for 25 minutes. Uncover; bake 10 minutes longer or until the squash is tender.
