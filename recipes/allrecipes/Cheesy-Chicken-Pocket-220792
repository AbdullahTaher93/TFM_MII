Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, jalapeno pepper, and garlic until tender, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. Combine chicken, Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese, cream cheese, hot pepper sauce, and onion mixture in a large bowl. Spray 5 phyllo sheets each with cooking spray. Stack these 5 phyllo sheets on top of each other and cut into 4 smaller squares. Spoon chicken mixture into each of the 4 squares; fold phyllo dough over and seal the edges. Repeat with remaining phyllo dough and chicken mixture until you have 12 filled pockets. Brush beaten egg on tops of filled phyllo pockets. Place filled phyllo pockets on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
