Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture. Stir in the oats, chocolate chips and marshmallows. Drop by heaping teaspoonfuls 2 in. apart onto greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 9-11 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 1-2 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely.
