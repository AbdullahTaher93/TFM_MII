Place chicken breasts in a single-layer in an 8- or 9-inch square baking pan. Bake, uncovered, in a 400 degrees F oven until meat in the thickest part is no longer pink, 25 to 30 minutes (cut to test). When chicken is nearly done, combine olives, capers, chicken broth, and lemon juice in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart saucepan; stir over medium heat until hot. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer chicken to 2 warm dinner plates and top with olive mixture. Sprinkle with basil and cheese.
