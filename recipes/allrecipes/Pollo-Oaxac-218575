Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the chicken, and season with oregano, minced garlic, and salt and pepper. Cook and stir until the chicken is lightly browned. Stir in the onion, then cover and reduce heat to low. Place tomatillos, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, whole garlic, lime juice, and salt in a blender. Pulse to a chunky consistency. Pour half of the tomatillo mixture over the chicken. Continue simmering until chicken is tender, 35 to 40 minutes more. Serve with remaining sauce and top with Monterey Jack cheese.
