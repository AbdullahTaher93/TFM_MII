Fill a stockpot to half full with water. Stir Italian seasoning, basil, thyme, liquid smoke, olive oil, salt, and white wine into water. Squeeze the lemon wedges over the mixture and drop the wedge into the pot. Bring mixture to a boil over medium heat; add the artichoke halves and continue to boil until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove artichokes from water and drain upside down on paper towel; allow to cool to the touch. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Lightly coat the cooled artichoke halves with cooking spray. Cook artichoke halves on grill until edges are slightly charred. Drizzle with melted butter to serve.
