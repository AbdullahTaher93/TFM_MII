Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine oats, amaranth, sunflower seeds, pecans, walnuts, almonds, flaxseed meal, and ground chia seeds in a very large bowl; stir until thoroughly mixed. Mix honey, maple syrup, coconut oil, brown sugar, butter, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt together in a large saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Cook and stir, about 1 minute. Remove maple syrup mixture from heat. Pour maple syrup mixture over oat mixture in the bowl; stir until oat mixture is moist. Spread evenly on the baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until toasted, stirring mixture halfway through, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a very large bowl. Add raisins, cherries, and blueberries; stir until thoroughly mixed.
