Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Fill a medium skillet with water and bring to a boil. Put the bread on a baking sheet and brush all over with olive oil. Bake for about 8 minutes, or until crisp. Reserve 8 toasts. Push the remaining 8 toasts on the baking sheet close together and sprinkle the Parmesan on top in a thick layer. Bake for about 2 minutes, or until the cheese is melted. Wrap the smoked salmon around the remaining 8 toasts. Reduce the heat under the skillet to moderately low so the water simmers. One at a time, break the eggs into a small bowl and pour them into the simmering water. Cook until the whites are just firm and the yolks are still runny, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the eggs to paper towels and gently blot dry. Put each egg in a small, warmed bowl. Serve immediately with the Parmesan and smoked salmon toasts.
