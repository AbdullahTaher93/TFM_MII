Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking sheet. In a bowl, blend the tomato paste, honey, and basil. Knead the Italian seasoning into the frozen bread dough, and roll into a 12-inch circle on the prepared baking sheet. With a fork, poke holes in the surface of the dough. Drizzle with olive oil. Brush with the tomato paste mixture. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bread is lightly browned.
