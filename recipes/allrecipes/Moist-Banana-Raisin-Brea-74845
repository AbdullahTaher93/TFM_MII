Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 5x9 inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, sugar, peanut butter, egg, banana, and milk. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir the flour mixture into the butter mixture just until moistened. Fold in the raisins and peanuts. Transfer to the prepared pan. Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool in pan for 10 minutes before serving.
