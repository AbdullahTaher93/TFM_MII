Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place tomatoes and garlic cloves in an ovenproof dish, cut side down. Mix oil, balsamic vinegar, sugar, ground pepper, sea salt and rosemary and thyme mixture, then pour on tomatoes and garlic. Bake in the middle of the oven 15-20 minutes, or until tomatoes are tender. Meanwhile, bring chicken stock to a boil on medium heat in a large saucepan. Using a whip, slowly blend in polenta while constantly stirring. Cook on medium-low heat about 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Add butter, chopped herbs and grated cheese. Mix well and season to taste. Pour in a buttered 32 cm x 23 cm (13 in. x 9 in.) rectangular baking dish and smooth surface with a spatula; or spread on a baking sheet covered in buttered parchment paper. Refrigerate about 30 minutes or until polenta is firm enough to be taken out and cut. Cut polenta into 8 equal parts. Lightly oil each piece and grill on barbecue on each side. Place a slice of Le Cendre cheese on each serving of polenta when almost done so that it softens. Serve with tomatoes and garlic confit. Finish with a drizzle of flavoured oil. Garnish with arugula, to taste. Cut polenta into 8 equal parts. Lightly oil each piece and grill on barbecue on each side.
