Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain. Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add green bell pepper and onion; cook and stir until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add shrimp; cook and stir until pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in ham, seasoned salt, garlic salt, salt, and black pepper. Pour cream and milk into the saucepan. Continue to cook, stirring often, until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in cheese. Let sauce cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add pasta and toss to coat.
