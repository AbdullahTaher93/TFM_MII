Preheat oven to 225 degrees F. Warm eggs in bowl of hot water, 5 minutes. Separate whites; reserve yolks for another use. In bowl of electric mixer, beat whites with salt, cream of tartar, and vanilla to soft peaks. Add sugar by the tablespoon, beating until stiff, 2 minutes more. Fold in chocolate chips. Drop scant 1/4 cups of meringue onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake until dry, about 1 hour. Let cool.
