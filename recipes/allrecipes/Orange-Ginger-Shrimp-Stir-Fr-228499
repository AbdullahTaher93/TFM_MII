Stir shrimp, orange juice, garlic, and ginger together in bowl; season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate 15 minutes. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Remove shrimp from the marinade; cook and stir in the hot oil until opaque, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer shrimp to a plate. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil with the oil remaining in the wok. Cook and stir bell pepper, squash, broccoli, onion, carrot, orange zest, and cayenne pepper in the hot oil until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Return shrimp to the skillet, stir into the vegetable mixture, and continue cooking 1 minute more. Serve over cooked rice.
