To make the brownies, spray an 8-inch square pan with nonstick spray and coat with flour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Melt the chocolate and the butter together over a double boiler. Whisk until smooth. Whisk the sugar and egg together in a bowl. Stir the chocolate and butter into the sugar mixture. Stir in the flour. Spread in the prepared pan. Bake for 15 minutes. Cool, remove from the pan and cut into 1/2 inch squares. To make the parfait, whisk together the egg yolks and the sugars. Whisk in the evaporated milk and then the cornstarch. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, with a heat resistant rubber spatula, until thick, about 5 minutes. (If the mixture gets lumpy at anytime during the cooking process, briefly switch to a whisk and whisk until smooth.) Place the mixture in a clean bowl and place plastic wrap directly on the surface. Refrigerate until cold. Whip the cream until soft peaks form. Fold the cream into the cooled mixture. To assemble the parfaits, in the bottom of martini, wine or any clear glass with approximately a 3/4 cup capacity, put about 4 pieces of brownies, about 2 teaspoons caramel sauce, and 2 teaspoons pecans. Top with about 3 tablespoons parfait mixture. Repeat layering with 2 more layers of brownies, caramel sauce and pecans and 1 more layer of parfait, ending with a layer of the brownies, pecans and caramel. Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes or up to overnight.
