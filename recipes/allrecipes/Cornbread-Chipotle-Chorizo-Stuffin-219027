Place cornbread in a large bowl and set aside. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add chorizo and cook until browned, about 10 minutes. Remove chorizo from pan and add to cornbread. Add bell pepper and onion to drippings in skillet and cook over medium heat until softened. Add 1/2 cup broth to skillet and scrape up any browned bits from bottom of pan. Add to cornbread along with parsley, TABASCO(R) Chipotle Sauce, salt, and pepper and mix well. Add additional broth 1 tablespoon at a time until desired consistency is reached (when stuffing holds together slightly). Spoon stuffing into a buttered 2-quart casserole dish. Cover with foil and bake in a 400 degrees F oven for 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake 20 minutes longer.
