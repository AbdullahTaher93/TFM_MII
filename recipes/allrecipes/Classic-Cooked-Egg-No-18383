In large saucepan, beat together eggs, sugar and salt (if desired); stir in 2 cups of the milk. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is thick enough to coat a metal spoon with a thin film and reaches at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove pan from heat. Stir remaining 2 cups milk and vanilla extract into the mixture. Cover and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled; several hours or overnight. Just before serving, pour the egg nog into a bowl or pitcher.
