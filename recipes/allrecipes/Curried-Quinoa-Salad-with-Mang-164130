Bring chicken stock, quinoa, curry powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Once done, scrape the quinoa into a shallow dish and allow to cool to room temperature. Stir in the mango and green onions. Serve either at room temperature or cold.
