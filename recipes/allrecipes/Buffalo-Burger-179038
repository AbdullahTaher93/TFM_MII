Shape the beef into 4 (1/2-inch thick) burgers. Heat the soup and hot sauce in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat. Heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Keep warm. Lightly oil the grill rack and heat the grill to medium. Grill the burgers for 10 minutes for medium or until desired doneness, turning over halfway through cooking. Serve the burgers on rolls with lettuce, onion and tomato if desired. Top with the soup mixture. Sprinkle with the cheese.
