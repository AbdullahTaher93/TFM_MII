Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch pan or line with parchment paper. Melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler and mix with melted butter. In a large bowl, whip the eggs and sugar to full volume. Gently fold the chocolate into the whipped eggs. Quickly but gently fold in the flour. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 minutes, or until the center feels firm to the touch. Do not turn out of pan until completely cool.
