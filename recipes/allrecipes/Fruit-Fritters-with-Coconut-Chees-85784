To make the fritter batter, combine the dry ingredients (flour through ginger) in a large bowl. Mix well. Combine the wet ingredients (vanilla through honey) in a bowl and mix well. Add the wet to dry and mix well. To make the coconut cheese, cream the cream cheese in a mixer until smooth. Add yogurt and vanilla and mix well. Add remaining ingredients and fold into cream cheese mixture. Chill for at least 2 hours before serving. Wash, cut and pat the fruit dry. Dip into the fritter batter and deep-fry in the Enova oil heated to 375 degrees F for about 3 minutes per side or until golden brown. Remove with slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels. Allow to drain for 1 minute. To serve, place 2 slices of the apple fritter in the middle of the plate. Top with the coconut cheese. Arrange the remaining fruit around the coconut cheese. Finish with the chocolate syrup drizzled over the top.
