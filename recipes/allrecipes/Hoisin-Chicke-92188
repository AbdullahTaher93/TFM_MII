Mix hoisin sauce and jam. Place chicken in a single layer in a 9- by 13-inch pan. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven for 15 minutes. Remove pan from oven; spread hoisin mixture onto chicken. Return pan to oven and continue baking until meat is no longer pink in center of thickest part (cut to test), about 10 to 15 more minutes. Baste once with juices. Meanwhile, mix mint, cilantro, onions, and lemon peel. Transfer cooked meat and juices to a platter. Sprinkle mint mixture over and around chicken.
