Pour half-and-half in a small saucepan and sprinkle gelatin over it; let sit until gelatin softens, about 5 minutes. Place saucepan over medium-low heat and cook, whisking constantly, for 3 minutes or until gelatin dissolves completely. Add sugar and stir constantly over medium heat until sugar dissolves, about 1 minute more. Remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes. In a medium bowl, combine buttermilk, lemon zest, and juice. Slowly pour in half-and-half mixture, stirring constantly. Divide blueberries among four 8-ounce glass or ceramic custard cups. Pour mixture over blueberries, dividing evenly among the four cups. Chill until set, about 2 hours, and serve.
