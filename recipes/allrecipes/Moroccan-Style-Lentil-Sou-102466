Heat oil over medium-high heat in large soup kettle. Add onions; cook until tender, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add remaining ingredients excluding salt and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, partially covered, until lentils are just tender, about 30 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste; continue to simmer until lentils are very tender and flavors have fully blended, about 30 minutes longer.
