Place the chicken nuggets on a microwave-safe plate. Cook in microwave until hot in the middle, about 2 minutes. Spread 1 tablespoon tomato sauce on one piece of the hamburger bun; cover the sauce with the American cheese slice. Arrange the chicken nuggets onto the cheese. Pour the remaining tomato sauce over the nuggets; sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese. Top with the other half of the hamburger bun to finish the sandwich.
