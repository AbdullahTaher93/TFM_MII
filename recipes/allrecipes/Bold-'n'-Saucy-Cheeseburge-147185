Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Mix meat and 2 tablespoons of the steak sauce in medium bowl. Shape into 4 (1/2-inch-thick) patties. Spray both sides of onion slices with cooking spray and set aside. Grill patties 4 minutes on each side or until cooked through, adding onions to the grill after 2 minutes and cooking until crisp-tender. Top the burgers with the 2% Milk Singles and continue grilling until the 2% Milk Singles are melted. Place burgers on bottom halves of buns. Top evenly with remaining 2 tablespoons steak sauce. Cover with onions, tomatoes and top halves of buns.
