In a wide frying pan, combine oil, onion, mushrooms, parsley, garlic, basil, rosemary, and oregano. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until onion and mushrooms are soft (3 to 5 minutes). Crumble turkey into pan and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned (about 5 minutes). Add marinara sauce, wine, and bay leaf; bring to a boil. Adjust heat so sauce boils gently; then cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened (about 20 minutes). Meanwhile, in a 5- to 6-quart pan, bring about 3 quarts water to a boil over high heat; stir in pasta and cook, uncovered, until just tender to bite (10 to 12 minutes). Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper; remove and discard bay leaf. Drain pasta well and pour onto a platter or individual plates. Spoon sauce over pasta. Offer cheese to add to taste, if desired.
