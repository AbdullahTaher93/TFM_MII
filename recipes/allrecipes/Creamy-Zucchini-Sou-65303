Melt the butter and heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Mix in the onion, and cook 5 minutes. Mix in the zucchini and tofu. Season with red pepper flakes and oregano. Continue to cook and stir 10 minutes, until zucchini is tender. Pour the vegetable stock into the skillet. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer 35 minutes. In a blender, process the soup and cottage cheese until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to serve.
