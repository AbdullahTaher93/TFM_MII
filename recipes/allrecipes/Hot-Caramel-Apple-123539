Peel about 3/4 in. off the top of each apple; place in a 3-qt. slow cooker. Pour juice over apples. Fill the center of each apple with 2 tablespoons of sugar, three red-hots, 1 tablespoon butter and two caramels. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Cover and cook on low for 4-6 hours or until the apples are tender. Serve immediately with whipped cream if desired.
