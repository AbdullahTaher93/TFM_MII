Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Combine flour, cornmeal, milk, bananas, sugar, vegetable oil, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl until batter is smooth; pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
