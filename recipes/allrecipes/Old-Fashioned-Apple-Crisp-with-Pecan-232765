Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Combine apples and the 1/3 cup brown sugar in a 3-quart rectangular baking dish; set aside until ready to use. For topping, combine rolled oats, the 1/2 cup brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon. Add melted butter; mix well. Stir in nuts. Sprinkle topping over apple mixture. [Cleaning tip: Wipe off any butter or spills on the countertop with Clorox(R) Disinfecting Wipes*. Rinse hands once complete.] Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until apples are tender and topping is crisp. Serve warm with ice cream.
