Rinse the rice until the water runs clear. Put the rice in a medium saucepan with the water, cinnamon sticks, cloves, bay leaves, turmeric, and 1 teaspoon of the salt. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and cook, covered, for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit, without removing the lid, for 10 minutes. In a small frying pan, melt the butter with 2 tablespoons of the oil over moderately high heat. Add the mustard seeds and cook, stirring, until they begin to pop, about 30 seconds. Add the cashews; cook, stirring, for 30 seconds longer. Gently stir the cashew mixture into the rice with a fork. Heat a grill pan or large heavy frying pan over moderately high heat. Thread the shark onto four small skewers; rub with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, the lemon juice, and garlic. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and the pepper. Cook the kabobs, turning, until just done, about 8 minutes. Add the cilantro to the rice and mound on plates. Top with the shark kabobs and serve with the lemon wedges.
