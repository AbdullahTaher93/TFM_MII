In a large bowl, mix ground beef, onion and garlic. Season with salt and pepper, and shape into 4 patties. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil grate. Place patties on the prepared grill, and cook 5 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. Prepare buns by spreading 1 tablespoon of wasabi on the bottom half, and 1 tablespoon mayonnaise on the top half. Top burgers with a slice of cheese, and sandwich inside the buns.
