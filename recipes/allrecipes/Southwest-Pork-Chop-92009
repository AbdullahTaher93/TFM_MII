Wipe chops with a damp paper towel, then press cumin seeds equally onto trimmed sides of each. Heat a wide nonstick frying pan over high heat. Add 1 teaspoon of the butter, tilting to coat pan. Add chops and cook, turning once, until well browned on both sides (about 6 minutes). Stir in garlic. Remove pan from heat, and away from any vent, fan, or flammable materials. Stir broth, tequila, and lime juice into pan. Return to high heat and bring to a boil. Then reduce heat and simmer until chops are no longer pink in center; cut to test (about 4 more minutes). Transfer chops to a platter and keep warm. Increase heat to high and boil pan juices until reduced to about 1/4 cup (about 2 minutes). Add remaining butter, in a single piece, and stir until blended into sauce. Season to taste with chili, salt, and pepper; pour sauce over chops. Garnish with lime wedges, if desired.
