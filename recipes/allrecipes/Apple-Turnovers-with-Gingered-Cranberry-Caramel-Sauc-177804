Stir the sugar and pumpkin pie spice in a small bowl. Brush the turnovers with the butter and sprinkle with the sugar mixture. Bake and cool the turnovers according to the package directions. Heat the caramel sauce, ginger and cranberries in a 1-quart saucepan over low heat until the mixture is hot. Serve the turnovers with the sauce. Top with the whipped cream, if desired.
