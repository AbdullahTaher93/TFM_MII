Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the tilapia fillets in a glass baking dish and rub on all sides with the olive oil. Stir together chili powder, cayenne pepper, and cumin in a small bowl. Sprinkle the tilapia on both sides with the spice mixture, then sprinkle orange zest over top. Bake in preheated oven until the tilapia is no longer translucent and flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes.
