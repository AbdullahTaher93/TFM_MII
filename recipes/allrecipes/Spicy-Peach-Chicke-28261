Preheat the oven broiler. In a small bowl, mix peach preserves, honey, spicy brown mustard, and hot pepper sauce. Arrange chicken pieces on a medium baking sheet. Season with Creole seasoning. Brush with the peach preserves mixture, reserving some of the mixture for basting. Turning occasionally and basting often with reserved peach reserves mixture, broil 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
