In a large resealable plastic bag or shallow glass container, combine the first nine ingredients; add pork and turn to coat. Seal or cover and refrigerate overnight. Drain, discarding the marinade. Grill roast, covered, over indirect heat for 1-1/2 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 160-170 degrees F. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing.
