Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix the warm melted butter, thyme, sage, and sugar together in a small bowl. Place cubed butternut squash in prepared baking dish. Drizzle with seasoned butter. Roast uncovered in preheated oven until tender, about 20 minutes. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Toast quinoa in oil until light brown, about 5 minutes. Add Swanson(R) Chicken Broth to quinoa and bring to a boil. Cover and turn heat to low. Cook for 10 minutes without disturbing. Remove from heat and let sit covered until broth is absorbed, about 3 minutes. Stir the quinoa and pumpkin seeds into the roasted squash.
