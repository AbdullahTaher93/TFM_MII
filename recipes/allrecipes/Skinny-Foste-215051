Heat butter, brown sugar, and orange juice in a skillet over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the banana. Cook until the banana has softened and the sauce is slightly syrupy, flipping the banana occasionally, about 2 minutes. Serve each slice of banana with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Drizzle with the sauce and sprinkle with almond slices.
