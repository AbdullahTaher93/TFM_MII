Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or line 12 muffin cups with paper liners. Place oats, mashed bananas, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons maple syrup, eggs, almond milk, coconut oil, vanilla extract, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a blender or food processor; blend or process until batter is smooth. Gently stir chocolate chips into batter using a spoon. Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling them 3/4 full. Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown, about 22 minutes. Cool for 10 to 15 minutes before eating.
