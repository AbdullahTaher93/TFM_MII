Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease (or use cooking spray) bottom of 13x9-inch rectangular pan. Stir brownie mix, chocolate syrup, water, oil and 2 eggs for fudgelike brownies (or 3 eggs for cakelike brownies) in medium bowl, using spoon, until well blended. Spread in pan. Arrange candies rows (5x4) on batter. Press candies into batter slightly. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until toothpick inserted 2 inches from side of pan comes out clean or almost clean. Cool completely. For 20 brownies, cut into 5 rows by 4 rows. Store tightly covered.
