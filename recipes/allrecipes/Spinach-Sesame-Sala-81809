Prepare the dressing first. In a jar with a tight fitting lid add all the dressing ingredients and shake well. Set aside for about 30 minutes, so the flavors can meld. If you are not using the tahini you can subtract 1g net carb from each of the 2 salads. Be sure that your spinach is dry. Toss the spinach with some of the dressing, just enough to lightly wet it. Divide between 2 plates. Separate the rings of onion and add on top of the spinach. Add the egg slices and sprinkle each with the toasted sesame seeds. Drizzle some more dressing over the eggs and serve immediately.
