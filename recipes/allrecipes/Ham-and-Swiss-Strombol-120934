Unroll dough on a greased baking sheet. Place ham over dough to within 1/2 in. of edges; sprinkle evenly with onions, bacon and cheese. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long side. Pinch seams to seal and tuck ends under. Place seam side down on baking sheet. With a sharp knife, cut several 1/4-in.-deep slits on top of loaf. Bake at 350 degrees F for 26-30 minutes or until golden brown. Cool slightly before slicing. Serve warm.
