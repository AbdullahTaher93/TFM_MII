In a small pan, dissolve the agar-agar in 1 1/4 cups water over medium heat. In another pan, combine the sugar, remaining 1 1/4 cups water, milk, coconut cream, and almond extract over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Pour the sugar mixture into a bowl then add the agar-agar mixture, making sure to blend well. Set in the fridge for 2 to 3 hours, or until set. Cut into cubes and place in serving bowls, topping with fruit if desired.
