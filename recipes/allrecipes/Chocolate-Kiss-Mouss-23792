Remove wrappers from chocolate pieces. Combine marshmallows and milk in small saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until marshmallows are melted and mixture is smooth. Remove from heat. Pour 1/3 cup marshmallow mixture into medium bowl; stir in brandy and food color, if desired. Set aside. To remaining marshmallow mixture, add 36 chocolate pieces; return to low heat, stirring constantly until chocolate is melted. Remove from heat; cool to room temperature. Beat whipping cream in small bowl until stiff. Fold 1 cup whipped cream into chocolate mixture. Gradually fold remaining whipped cream into reserved mixture. Fill 4 parfait glasses about three-fourths full with chocolate mixture; spoon or pipe remaining mixture on top. Refrigerate 3 to 4 hours or until set. Garnish with additional chocolate pieces, if desired.
