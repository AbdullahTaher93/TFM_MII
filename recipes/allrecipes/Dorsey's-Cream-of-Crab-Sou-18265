In a large stockpot, melt butter over medium heat. Add onions and celery; saute until onions are transparent, about 4 minutes. Stir in flour, mixing well. Cook for about 1 minute, stirring constantly. Do not burn, or let it go lumpy. Add water, chicken broth and chicken soup base; stir until smooth. Bring to a boil. Stir in parsley and diced potato. Reduce heat and simmer for about 20 minutes. Stir in cream, soy sauce, crab meat and seasonings. Raise heat to medium and bring chowder just to a boil. Serve hot.
