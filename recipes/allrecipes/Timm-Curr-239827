Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until halfway tender, about 8 minutes. Drain and reserve potato-cooking water. Place carrots into a pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until halfway tender, about 4 minutes. Drain. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Saute chicken and onion in hot oil until onion is translucent and chicken is no long pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduced heat to medium. Stir garlic, curry powder, cinnamon, cloves, and cayenne pepper into chicken mixture; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir potatoes, carrots, garbanzo beans, diced tomatoes with juice, tomato paste, and lemon juice into chicken mixture. Pour reserved potato water into chicken mixture until desired consistency is reached, about 2 cups. Cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through and potatoes and carrots are tender, 10 to 15 minutes more. Season with salt and black pepper.
