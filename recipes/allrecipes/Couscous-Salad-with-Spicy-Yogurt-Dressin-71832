To make the couscous: Heat the oil in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and celery and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened. Stir in the couscous, coating with oil. Cook and stir for 1 minute until lightly toasted. Add the water and bring to a boil, stirring gently. Remove from the heat. Let stand, covered, for 30 minutes until cool and the liquid is absorbed, uncovering occasionally to fluff with a fork. To make the spicy yogurt dressing: In a large bowl, mix together the lemon juice, yogurt, oil, ginger root, garlic, cumin, coriander, and pepper. Whisk before serving. To make the salad: Transfer the couscous to a large serving bowl. Spoon the currants or raisins, chickpeas, bell peppers, cilantro or parsley, and scallions into separate mounds around the couscous. Add the dressing. Toss all the ingredients together at the table. Garnish with the lemon wedges, if using.
