Preheat oven to Broil. Lightly brush chicken breasts with melted butter and broil for 2 to 3 minutes each side, or until just lightly browned. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place browned chicken in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In large bowl combine the reserved cherry liquid, sugar, chile sauce, water, Worcestershire sauce, onion, raisins and salt and pepper to taste. Mix all together and pour mixture over chicken. Cover dish and bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 1 hour.
