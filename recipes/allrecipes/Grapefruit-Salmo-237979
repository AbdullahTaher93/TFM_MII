Whisk grapefruit juice, soy sauce, garlic powder, ground ginger, and salt together in a small bowl. Lay salmon into a shallow baking dish with the skin-side down; pour grapefruit juice mixture over salmon. Cover baking dish with plastic wrap and marinate salmon in refrigerator for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven until the salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 40 minutes.
