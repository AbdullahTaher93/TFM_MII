Preheat broiler. Trim crusts from bread slices, then cut into 20 assorted shapes, using 2-inch fluted round cookie cutter to cut circles and sharp knife to cut triangles. Tear enough of the bread trimmings into fine crumbs to measure 1/2 cup crumbs; set aside. Mix butter and thyme; brush evenly onto bread cutouts. Place in single layer on baking sheet. Broil 2 min. or until golden brown. Meanwhile, mix reserved bread crumbs with shrimp, cheese, mayo and salt. Spread evenly onto toast cutouts. Broil an additional 8 to 10 min. or until hot and bubbly.
