Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef, onion, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Return skillet to burner over high heat. Add water; cover skillet and bring to a boil. Stir macaroni into the boiling water-ground beef mixture; cover and lower heat to medium. Cook, keeping covered, for 5 minutes. Stir, cover, and cook until macaroni is tender, about 5 more minutes. Stir processed cheese food into ground beef-macaroni mixture until melted. Remove from heat; stir in sour cream.
