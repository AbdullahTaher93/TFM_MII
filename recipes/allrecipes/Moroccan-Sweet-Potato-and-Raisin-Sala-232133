Place raisins into a bowl, cover with boiling water, and let stand to plump. Place sweet potatoes into a saucepan, cover with 2 cups water, and bring to a boil. Add honey, butter, salt, cinnamon, black pepper, turmeric, and saffron to potatoes; reduce heat to low. Simmer until potatoes are tender but not mushy, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain raisins and stir into sweet potato mixture. Continue to simmer until mixture has thickened, about 10 more minutes. Let cool before serving.
