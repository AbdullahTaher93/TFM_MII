Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above cooking grate only 2 to 3 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). Meanwhile, cut tomatoes in half crosswise and set on a platter; liberally season with salt, pepper and herbs. Drizzle with olive oil. Place tomatoes cut side up on cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook without turning until hot in center, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer with a wide spatula to a clean platter.
