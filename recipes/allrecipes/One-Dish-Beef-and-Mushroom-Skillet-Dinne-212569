Cook the beef, onion and garlic in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until it's well browned, stirring often to separate the meat. Pour off any fat. Stir the soup, broth, thyme, tomatoes and zucchini in the skillet. Heat to a boil. Stir in the pasta. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 15 minutes or until the pasta is tender.
