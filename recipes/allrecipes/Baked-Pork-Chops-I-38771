Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Place pork chops in the skillet, and brown about 5 minutes on each side. Remove from heat. In a small bowl, mix brown sugar, salt, pepper, and dry mustard. Arrange pork chops in a medium baking dish. Sprinkle with lemon juice, season with brown sugar mixture, and cover with tomato sauce. Pour water into the baking dish. Cover, and bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
