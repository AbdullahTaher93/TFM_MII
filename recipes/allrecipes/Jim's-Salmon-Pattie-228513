Mix both amounts of salmon, crushed crackers, eggs, mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, red pepper flakes, and dry mustard together in a bowl. Chill in refrigerator to allow flavors to combine, 30 minutes. Form mixture into 6 patties. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; fry the salmon patties until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side.
