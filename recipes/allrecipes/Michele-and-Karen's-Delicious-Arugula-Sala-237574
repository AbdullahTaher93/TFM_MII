Gently toss arugula, beets, avocado, and olives together in a large bowl. Warm goat cheese in the microwave slightly, about 30 seconds; add to arugula mixture. Whisk olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and mustard together vigorously in a small bowl until smooth; drizzle over the salad and toss to coat ingredients in dressing.
