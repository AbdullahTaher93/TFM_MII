Preheat oven to 270 degrees F (132 degrees C). Rinse corned beef in running water to remove about 1/2 of the salt and trim away any fat. Place corned beef in a baking dish and spread a 1/4-inch layer brown sugar over beef. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (65 degrees C) is reached, about 2 hours.
