Sprinkle five-spice powder over pork and toss to coat. In a large nonstick skillet or wok coated with nonstick cooking spray, stir-fry pork for 3 minutes or until brown. Remove and keep warm. Stir-fry fennel seed in 3/4 teaspoon oil for 30 seconds. Add the broccoli, celery, carrot and onions; stir-fry for 3 minutes or until crisp-tender. Remove and keep warm. Stir-fry the rice in remaining oil for 2 minutes. Stir in soy sauce and pepper. Return pork and vegetables to the pan; cook and stir until heated through.
