Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling water until done, approximately 8 to 10 minutes. Drain pasta, but reserve water for later use. In a large skillet over medium heat, warm oil and saute garlic, onion, and mushrooms until soft. Place escarole on top of vegetables in the skillet, and cover until the escarole is wilts. Stir in tomato sauce and beans. Season with oregano and sugar, and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer over low heat for approximately 15 to 20 minutes. Mix the cooked pasta into the sauce. Mix in 1 cup of the reserved pasta water; stir in more if necessary to achieve desired consistency.
