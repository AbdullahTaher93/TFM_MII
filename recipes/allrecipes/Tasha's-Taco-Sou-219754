Heat a large pot over medium-high heat and stir in the ground beef. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Add the ranch beans, pinto beans, corn, tomatoes with green chiles, processed cheese food, half-and-half cream, heavy cream, taco seasoning, and ranch dressing mix. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue to simmer until cheese food is melted, about 20 minutes.
