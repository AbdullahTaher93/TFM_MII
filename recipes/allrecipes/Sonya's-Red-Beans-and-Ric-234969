Place red beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain and rinse. Combine beans, ham hock, and salt in a stockpot; pour in enough water to cover. Bring bean mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until beans are softened, 30 to 40 minutes. Stir onion, green bell pepper, parsley, tomato sauce, green onions, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, black pepper, oregano, thyme, cayenne pepper, and hot sauce into bean mixture. Cover stockpot and cook until vegetables are tender, about 1 hour. Mix sausage into bean mixture and cook for another 45 minutes. Remove ham hock before serving.
