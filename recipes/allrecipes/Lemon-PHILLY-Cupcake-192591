Beat on medium speed 2 minutes. Spoon batter evenly into 24 paper-lined muffin cups. Bake 21 to 24 minutes or until wooden toothpick inserted in centres comes out clean. Cool in pans 10 minutes; remove to wire racks. Cool completely. Meanwhile, beat sugar, cream cheese, butter and juice with electric mixer on low speed until well blended. Frost cupcakes.
