Cut zucchini in half lengthwise. With a spoon, scoop out and reserve pulp, leaving 3/8-in. shell. Cook shells in salted water for 2 minutes; remove and drain. Chop zucchini pulp; place in a bowl. Add the bread crumbs, eggs, tomato, Parmesan cheese, parsley and garlic. Stir in broth, salt and pepper. Stuff into zucchini shells. Place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Drizzle with butter. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes or until golden brown.
