Mix bread crumbs, salt, and pepper in a resealable plastic bag. Whisk egg lightly in a bowl. Dip scallops in egg; place in the bread crumb mixture in the bag. Seal bag and shake until scallops are coated with bread crumbs. Bring butter, olive oil, and lemon juice to a simmer in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add breaded scallops; cook, shaking skillet occasionally, until browned, 6 to 7 minutes.
