Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Combine pork belly strips, water, dark soy sauce, honey, garlic, and ginger in a Dutch oven over low heat; bring to a gentle simmer, about 10 minutes. Cover and transfer to the oven. Bake in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until pork belly is soft and tender, about 2 hours. Sprinkle spring onions and cashew nuts on top. Cover and let stand until spring onions soften, about 5 minutes. Bring water, rice, and salt to a boil in a large saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain in a colander and rinse with tap water. Heat olive oil in a wok over medium-high heat until smoking. Cook and stir rice until coated with oil and heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in green peas, egg, and 1 tablespoon soy sauce; cook until egg is set and peas are heated through, about 3 minutes. Serve pork belly over rice.
