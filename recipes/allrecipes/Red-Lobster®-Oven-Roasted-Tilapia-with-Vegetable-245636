Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lay aluminum foil squares on a work surface. Place 5 spears of asparagus in the center of each square; distribute equal amounts of the green beans, carrots, and artichoke hearts among the squares. Lay tilapia fillets over vegetables. Top each fillet with basil, Italian seasoning, garlic salt, salt, and pepper. Place 1 tablespoon butter and a drizzle of olive oil on each fillet. Top with tomato slices, lemon slices, and a squeeze of lemon juice. Fold aluminum foil edges together over each fillet to create a tightly sealed packet. Place packets on a baking sheet and bake in preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 20 to 30 minutes.
