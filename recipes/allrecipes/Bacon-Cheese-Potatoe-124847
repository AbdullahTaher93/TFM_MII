Peel the potatoes; place in a saucepan and cover with water. Cook until tender but firm; drain and cube. In a bowl, mix potatoes with onion, cheese and mayonnaise. Transfer to an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with bacon and olives. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes or until heated through. If desired, sprinkle with parsley and paprika.
