Place cauliflower in a pot and cover halfway with water; bring to a boil and cook until completely mushy, 15 to 20 minutes. Mash cauliflower with a hand blender or potato masher until the consistency of mashed potatoes. Mix eggs, psyllium husks, and salt into mashed cauliflower until smooth and fully incorporated. Let mixture sit for 20 minutes. Separate mixture into balls smaller than tennis balls and larger than golf balls. The dough will be sticky. Roll each ball on a work surface coated in coconut flour until wraps are thin. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Place wraps in the hot skillet and cook until crisp and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Cool wraps on a wire rack.
