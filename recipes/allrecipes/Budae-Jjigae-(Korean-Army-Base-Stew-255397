Divide luncheon meat into 2 piles on either side of a stock pot. Layer sausage, onion, and kimchi on top, leaving an empty space in the center of the pot. Mix red pepper powder, soy sauce, gochujang, garlic, and black pepper together in a small bowl; pour into the center of the pot. Sprinkle in green onion. Pour in chicken broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer stew, stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, about 10 minutes. Bring a pot of water to a boil; add ramen noodles. Cook and stir until partially cooked and softened, about 2 minutes. Drain; stir into stew. Cook and stir until ramen noodles are tender but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Top stew with American cheese.
