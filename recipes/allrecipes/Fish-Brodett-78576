Cut the lobster and sole into 1 inch chunks. Toss the lobster and sole with the shrimp and lemon juice, set aside. Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the garlic and onions; cook and stir until translucent. Pour in the tomatoes, vinegar, and wine; bring to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes. Pour in water; add the marinated fish, basil, and parsley; simmer for about 30 minutes, until the lobster has cooked through. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve with a nice, crusty bread.
