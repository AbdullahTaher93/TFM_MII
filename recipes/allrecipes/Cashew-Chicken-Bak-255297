Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a large casserole dish with cooking spray. Spread brown rice at the bottom of the casserole dish. Layer celery, red bell pepper, and green pepper on top. Top with chicken. Mix water, soy sauce, rice vinegar, garlic, ginger, cumin, pepper, and salt in a small bowl. Pour over chicken. Arrange water chestnuts on top. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is tender, about 45 minutes. Add cashews. Continue baking until browned, about 10 minutes more.
