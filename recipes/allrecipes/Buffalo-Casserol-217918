Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix the sour cream, onion powder, garlic powder, dill, and parsley in a large bowl until combined; stir in the cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, and hot pepper sauce. Mix in the chicken broth, a little at a time, and gently stir in the rice and cooked chicken. Scrape into a 2-quart casserole dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the casserole is browned and the rice is tender, about 1 hour.
