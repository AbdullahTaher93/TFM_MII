In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Stir in the rice. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a skillet over medium heat, cook the sausage until evenly brown. In a medium baking dish, mix the cooked rice, cooked sausage, picante sauce, and sour cream. Top with Cheddar cheese. Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until cheese is bubbly.
