Mix together the milk, Cheez Whiz, and Cheddar in a medium bowl. Microwave the mixture for a minute, then stir until creamy. Pour the cheese sauce over the cooked macaroni and stir again. Dump the whole mess into a casserole dish. Top with the cracker crumbs. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes, or until the cheese begins to bubble.
