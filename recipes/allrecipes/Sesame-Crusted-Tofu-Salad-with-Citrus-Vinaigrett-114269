In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce with the chives, ginger, sesame oil, garlic and shallot. Spread the sesame seeds on a large plate. Press one side of each slice of tofu into the sesame seeds so the seeds adhere. In each of 2 large nonstick skillets, heat 2 tablespoons of the pure olive oil until shimmering. Add the tofu, coated side down, and cook over moderate heat until lightly golden, about 9 minutes. Carefully flip the tofu slices, pour the soy mixture between them and simmer for 3 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix the sherry vinegar with the orange juice, lemon juice and extra-virgin olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Add the mesclun, mint and basil and toss to coat. Mound the salad in shallow bowls or on plates and scatter the tomatoes all around. Transfer the tofu to the bowls and serve.
