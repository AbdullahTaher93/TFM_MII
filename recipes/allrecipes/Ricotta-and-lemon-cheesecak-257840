Heat the Philips Airfryer to 160C. Zest and juice the lemon. In a bowl, combine the ricotta, sugar, vanilla essence, 1 tbsp lemon juice and the lemon zest. Stir the ingredients until they are well combined and form a homogenous consistency. Add the eggs one at a time and stir well. Add the corn starch and mix well. Pour the mixture into the oven dish. Place the dish into the Philips Airfryer basket and slide the basket into the Airfryer. Set the timer for 25 minutes. The cheesecake is ready when the timer rings and the center is set. Place the dish on a wire rack and leave to cool completely.
