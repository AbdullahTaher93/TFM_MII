Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir melted butter, rosemary, garlic powder, salt, and ground black pepper together in a bowl; add bread cubes and toss to coat. Spread cubes onto a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Turn croutons with a spatula and continue baking another 5 minutes; serve immediately.
