Heat a large skillet over medium heat while preparing chops. Rub both sides of the chops with oil and season with rosemary, salt and pepper. Whisk broth, mustard, brown sugar and lemon juice in a small bowl; set aside. A couple of minutes from cooking, increase heat under skillet to medium-high. Add chops to skillet; saute, weighting the chops with a second, smaller skillet and turning them once, until well browned on both sides and cooked through, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove chops from skillet and add mustard mixture to the hot skillet; simmer until reduced to sauce consistency, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve chops with a spoonful of sauce.
