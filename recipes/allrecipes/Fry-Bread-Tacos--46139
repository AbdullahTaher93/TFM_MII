In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown the ground beef. Drain off the grease, and season with chili powder and garlic powder. Stir in kidney beans. Remove from heat, and set aside. On a lightly floured surface, roll balls of dough out into circles about 6 to 8 inches across, and 1/4 inch thick. Flip the dough over so it is sticky-side up, and place meat mixture over half of the circle. Fold dough over, and pinch to seal. Trim if necessary to make a half-moon shape. Place filled tacos onto a lightly greased cookie sheet, and cover with a towel or greased plastic wrap. Heat one inch of oil in a large heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). Fry tacos for a few minutes on each side, or until golden. Remove to paper towels to absorb grease. Slit the top, and put cheese into the tacos while they are hot. Feel free to add any additional taco toppings too.
