In a small saucepan, combine the cornstarch, ginger, soy sauce and water until smooth. Stir in the marmalade, lime juice, oil and garlic until blended. Bring to a boil; cook and stir mixture for 1-2 minutes or until thickened. Place the pork chops in a greased 8-in. baking dish. Spoon glaze over pork, turn to coat. Top with the lime slices. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 30-40 minutes or until pork juices run clear.
