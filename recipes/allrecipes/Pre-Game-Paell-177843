Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the rice and cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly. Stir in the stock, salsa and turmeric and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover the skillet and cook for 15 minutes. Stir in the kielbasa, shrimp and chicken. Cover the skillet and cook for 5 minutes or until the rice is tender and most of the liquid is absorbed.
