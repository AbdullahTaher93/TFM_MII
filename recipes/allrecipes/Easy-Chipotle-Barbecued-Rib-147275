Preheat grill to medium heat. Cut ribs into 2-rib sections. Mix remaining ingredients; set aside. Place ribs in large pot. Add enough cold water to cover ribs completely; cover with lid. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer 20 minutes. Drain. Grill ribs 10 min. or until cooked through (160 degrees F), turning occasionally and brushing generously with the barbecue sauce mixture.
