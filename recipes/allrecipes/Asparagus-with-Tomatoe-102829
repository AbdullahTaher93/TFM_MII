Place the asparagus in a large skillet and fill with about 1 inch of water. Cover the pan and set over high heat. When the water comes to a boil, cook for 2 minutes or until the asparagus is bright green and almost tender. In a separate skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the garlic; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add the tomato to the skillet and cook for about 1 minute or until heated through. Season with salt and pepper. Add asparagus to the pan and cook for about 2 minutes, until hot.
