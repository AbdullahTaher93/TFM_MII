Unroll breadstick dough; cut each piece in half widthwise and separate. In a large resealable plastic bag, combine Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning. Add dough pieces, a few at a time, and shake to coat. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-13 minutes or until golden brown. Meanwhile, place pizza sauce in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover; microwave on high for 1-2 minutes or until bubbly. Sprinkle with the mozzarella cheese. Microwave 1 minute longer or until cheese is melted. Serve with breadsticks.
