Cook, breaking up turkey with spoon, until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in beans, tomato sauce, 1 cup water and chipotle; bring liquid to boil. Reduce heat. Simmer until chili thickens and flavors come together, about 10 minutes. Season with Adobo. Divide chili among serving bowls. Top with cheese, avocado and cilantro.
