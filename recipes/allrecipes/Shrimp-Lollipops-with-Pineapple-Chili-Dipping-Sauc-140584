In a food processor fitted with a steel blade, add the shrimp meat, ginger, garlic, cilantro and soy sauce. In a small bowl, combine egg white and corn starch and whisk until frothy then add to the shrimp mixture. Pulse until chopped well. Cover and refrigerate mixture for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the Pineapple Chili Dipping Sauce; in a small bowl, combine chopped pineapple and chili sauce. Set aside. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. To form and serve lollipops: for each skewer, form about 1 1/2 tablespoons of chilled shrimp mixture around the tip of each skewer forming a slightly oval shape. Place onto a lightly oiled baking sheet with sides not touching. Bake in preheated oven for about 10 to 12 minutes or until cooked through. Serve lollipops with the dipping sauce and garnish with chopped cilantro.
