Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, 1 tablespoon garlic basil spread, and Italian seasoning in the hot oil until onion has softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in pepper rings and mushrooms; cook and stir until mushrooms have softened, about 5 minutes. Pour in Marsala wine and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add beef broth and roast beef and stir until the beef is warmed through, 3 to 4 minutes. Spread each ciabatta roll with 1 tablespoon garlic basil spread and 1 tablespoon horseradish sauce. Top with 3 slices Swiss cheese. Place sandwiches on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the bread is toasted, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, pile the beef-onion mixture into each sandwich and pour 1 to 2 tablespoons pan juices over the filling. Transfer the remaining pan juices to small bowls for dipping.
