In a 4- to 5-quart pan over medium-high heat, frequently stir sausage until well browned, about 7 minutes. Pour from pan and set aside. To pan, add 1 cup broth, onions, and garlic. Boil over high heat until liquid is almost gone, then stir often until onion bits are lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir remaining 2 cups broth into pan, scraping browned bits free, then add sausages and beans. Cover pan and cook over high heat until boiling. Stir in escarole and cook just until it wilts, about 2 minutes. Ladle into wide bowls.
