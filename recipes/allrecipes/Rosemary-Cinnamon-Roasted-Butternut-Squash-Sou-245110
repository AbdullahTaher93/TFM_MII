Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper, and spread the rosemary sprigs on the baking sheet in a single layer. Place squash cubes in a large bowl. Toss with melted butter until evenly coated. Add brown sugar, ground cinnamon, salt, and pepper and toss again to coat evenly. Arrange the squash cubes evenly over the rosemary sprigs on prepared baking sheet. Roast in preheated oven until squash is tender, about 25 minutes. Remove rosemary sprigs with tongs, and any stray pieces of rosemary. Lift parchment paper and slide roasted squash pieces into 3-quart pot. Add Swanson(R) Unsalted Chicken Broth and bring to a boil. Remove pot from heat. Using an immersion (or regular) blender, blend the squash mixture until smooth.
