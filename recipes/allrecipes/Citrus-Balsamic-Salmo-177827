Season the salmon with the black pepper. Place the salmon into a 2-quart shallow baking dish. Drizzle with the olive oil. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15 minutes or until the salmon flakes easily when tested with a fork. Heat the stock, vinegar, cornstarch, orange juice, brown sugar and orange zest in a 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat to a boil. Cook and stir until the mixture boils and thickens. Serve the salmon with the citrus sauce. Garnish with the orange slices.
