Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place the oysters on a large baking sheet and cook 8 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the shells have opened. Squeeze the juice and pulp from the limes into a small serving bowl. Mix in the pepper. Serve oysters on the half shell with the sauce.
