Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a 9 inch x 9 inch baking dish with cooking spray. Bring the water to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Add the cornmeal in a slow, steady stream, whisking constantly. Bring to a boil. Stir in the cheese. Remove from the heat and pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake for 35 minutes, or until firm. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, oregano, and fennel seeds and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes, or until fragrant. Stir in the tomatoes, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring frequently, for 8 minutes, or until the tomatoes are cooked down and juicy. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes, or until the sauce is slightly thickened. Cover and keep warm. Serve the polenta with the sauce.
