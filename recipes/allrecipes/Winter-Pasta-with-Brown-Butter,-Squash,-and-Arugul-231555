Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spread squash into a baking sheet. Drizzle olive oil and sprinkle salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper over squash; toss to coat. Roast in the preheated oven until squash is browned and softened, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven and keep warm. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 11 minutes. Drain linguine, reserving 1 cup pasta water. Melt butter in a pot over medium heat until bubbling and slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Cook and stir garlic and pine nuts in the brown butter until fragrant, 2 minutes. Add linguine, arugula, 1 cup Parmesan cheese, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and enough pasta water to moisten to the mixture. Toss until Parmesan cheese melts. Transfer linguine mixture to serving plates and top with roasted squash and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese.
