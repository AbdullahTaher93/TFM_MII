In a large saucepan over medium low heat combine the chicken, cream of mushroom soup, cream of chicken soup, cream cheese, sour cream and 2/3 of the cracker crumbs. Mix well and cook until all blended together and cream cheese has melted. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Transfer casserole mixture into a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish and top with remaining cracker crumbs. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 15 minutes or until crackers turn golden brown. Spoon into bowls and enjoy!
