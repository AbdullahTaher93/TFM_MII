Steam the spinach until just wilted. In a medium skillet heat the oil until hot and saute the onions and mushrooms. Stir together with the spinach. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs well. Stir in the ricotta, feta, and basil. Butter a deep dish pie pan. Place a sheet of phyllo on the bottom of the pan, and brush melted butter over the sheet. Repeat until there are 5 or 6 sheets in the pan. Spread the ricotta mixture over the phyllo. Layer 5 or 6 more sheets of filo brushed with butter on top of the cheese. Spread spinach mixture over the phyllo. Top the pie with 5 or 6 more sheets of phyllo brushed with butter. Trim dough to the edge of the pie dish. Bake at 375 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 1 hour, or until pie is golden brown.
