Trim excess fat from beef. Cut beef with grain into 2-inch strips; cut strips across grain into 1/8-inch slices. (Beef is easier to cut if partially frozen, about 1 hour.) Mix broth, cornstarch, fish sauce, vinegar and brown sugar. Heat wok or 10-inch skillet over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon oil; rotate wok to coat side. Add beef, gingerroot and garlic; stir-fry about 3 minutes or until beef is brown. Remove beef from wok with slotted spoon. Add 1 tablespoon oil to wok; rotate wok to coat side. Add carrots and onions; stir-fry about 5 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender. Stir in beef, water chestnuts and lemon peel; heat to boiling. Stir in broth mixture. Cook and stir about 1 minute or until heated through. Serve beef mixture over rice.
