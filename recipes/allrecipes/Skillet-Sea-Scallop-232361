Combine bread crumbs and salt in a large resealable plastic bag. Add scallops, a few at a time, and shake to coat. Repeat with remaining scallops. Melt butter in olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; fry scallops until browned and opaque, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer scallops to a plate and keep warm. Stir wine, lemon juice, parsley, and garlic into skillet and bring to a boil. Simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Pour lemon-wine sauce over scallops to serve.
