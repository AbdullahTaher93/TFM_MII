Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and return spaghetti to pot. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in the hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Add parsley, garlic, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, turmeric, and cumin seeds to onion; cook and stir until garlic is softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir tomatoes and sugar into onion mixture and cook until heated through and fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour tomato sauce mixture over spaghetti and mix well. Stir yogurt and salt into spaghetti mixture.
