In 1-cup glass measure or small jar, combine wasabi with water; let stand 10 minutes. Add vinegar, oil, brown sugar and sesame seeds. (This can be made ahead to allow flavors to blend.) Reserve 2 to 3 tablespoons dressing. Toss remaining dressing with cabbage, radishes, cucumber and sunflower kernels. Grill or broil salmon 8 to 10 minutes per inch of thickness or until fish flakes easily with a fork, brushing with reserved dressing during last 2 minutes of cooking. Serve salmon with slaw.
