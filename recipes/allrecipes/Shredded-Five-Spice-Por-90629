Drain juices from pork into a liquid measuring cup and add water, if necessary, to make 1 cup. Pour juices into a 1 1/2- to 2-quart pan. Add garlic, if using, and five spice, sugar, soy sauce, and vinegar. Bring to a boil over high heat and boil until reduced to 1 cup, stirring often, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Preheat oven to 450 degree F. As sauce reduces, pull pork apart into small pieces with your fingers. Put meat in a 10- by 15-inch pan and spread level. Bake until lightly browned and sizzling, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven, add reduced sauce, and mix. Serve over hot cooked rice; top with hoisin or plum sauce, green onions, and cilantro sprigs, if desired.
