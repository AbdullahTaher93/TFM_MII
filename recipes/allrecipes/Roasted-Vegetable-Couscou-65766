Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In a large mixing bowl, toss yams, onions and zucchini with olive oil, salt and pepper. Spread onto a baking sheet and roast for 30 minutes until lightly browned and tender. While vegetables are cooking, heat broth to a boil in a medium sized saucepan. Stir in cous cous and scallions, cover and cook for 1 more minute. Remove from heat and set aside for 5 minutes, then uncover and fluff with a fork. Mix in Lindsay Kalamata olives, garbonzo beans, cashews, parsley, orange juice and cinnamon. Season with a dash of cayenne pepper to taste. Top couscous with roasted vegetables and toss together just before serving.
