Cut tofu into 1-inch-by-3/4-inch pieces and blot on a paper towel to dry. In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, sugar, and sesame oil and set aside. Carefully crush the tea by rubbing it between your fingers; do not crush it to a powder. Place on a small plate. Dip tofu pieces into the egg and roll in the tea leaves. Brush off excess leaves. Heat vegetable oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Fry tofu pieces, turning, until golden brown on all sides, about 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and place tofu on a paper towel to absorb excess oil. Transfer tofu to a serving dish or bowl, drizzle with soy-sauce mixture, garnish with scallions, and serve immediately.
