Cook rice according to package directions. When rice is almost ready, melt butter in a skillet and gently toast the pecan halves. Remove from pan, leaving the butter. Reheat pan, add shrimp and brown on one side. Turn shrimp over and push them to one side of the pan. Place mushrooms in the middle and allow mushrooms to gently soften. Mix rice into pan with shrimp and mushrooms. Stir in pecans and quartered tomatoes.
