Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Put oats, flour, brown sugar, and salt in a food processor and pulse a few times to blend. Add butter and pulse about 25 to 30 times until mixture looks pebbly. In a large bowl, toss pears with cardamom. Divide pears evenly among four 1-cup ramekins. Sprinkle about 2 1/2 tablespoons topping over them, covering the pears completely. Place ramekins on a baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes or until topping is golden brown and crunchy.
