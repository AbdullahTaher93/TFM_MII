Dice jalapeno and chop cilantro; set aside. In a medium sized pot over medium heat, cook ground beef, chopped onion, both peppers and cumin, stirring occasionally, until beef is no longer pink, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add beans, broth and salsa; reduce heat to a simmer and cook for about 10 to 15 minutes. Serve topped with chopped cilantro.
