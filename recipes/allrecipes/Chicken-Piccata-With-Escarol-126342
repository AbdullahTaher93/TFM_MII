Coat the broiler-pan rack with cooking spray. Preheat the broiler. Season both sides of the chicken breasts with the thyme, pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon of the salt. Place the chicken on the broiler-pan rack and broil 2 inches to 3 inches from the heat for 5 minutes per side, or until a thermometer inserted in the thickest portion registers 160 degrees F and the juices run clear. Place the chicken on a platter and keep warm. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet coated with cooking spray over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds, or until fragrant. Add the escarole and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 minutes, or until the greens begin to wilt. Add the tomatoes and the remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt and cook for 3 minutes, or until the tomatoes are soft and the escarole is completely wilted. Place the vegetables on the platter with the chicken. In a cup, combine the broth and cornstarch and stir until dissolved. In the same skillet, whisk together the cornstarch mixture, lemon peel, and lemon juice and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute, or until the sauce is slightly thickened. Add the butter and any juices that have collected on the platter and return to a boil, stirring constantly. Cook just until the butter is melted and the sauce has thickened. Pour the sauce over the chicken and vegetables.
