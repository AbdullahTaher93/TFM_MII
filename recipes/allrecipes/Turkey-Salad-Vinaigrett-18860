In a medium bowl, combine the vinegar, oil, lime juice, salt, ground black pepper and ginger. Whisk this together well, then stir in the onion, jalapeno, chile pepper and turkey. Cover and refrigerate for several hours. Line a salad plate with the red leaf lettuce and spoon the chilled turkey salad over the top.
