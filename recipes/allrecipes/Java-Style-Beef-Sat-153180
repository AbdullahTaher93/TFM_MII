In a mortar with a pestle, mash together the garlic, shallots, galangal, chile peppers, and macadamia nuts into a fine paste. Add the shrimp paste and oil, continue mashing until incorporated. Place the paste into a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook and stir until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Stir the beef into the sauce and cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Pour in the water, palm sugar, bouillon cube, and salt. Simmer until the water has evaporated, about 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in the kecap manis and lime leaves, then spread the beef out on a baking sheet or large dish, and allow to cool until cool enough to handle. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the beef cubes from the tray, and thread onto skewers, reserve any leftover sauce for basting. Cook on preheated grill for a few minutes until slightly browned; baste occasionally with the leftover sauce.
