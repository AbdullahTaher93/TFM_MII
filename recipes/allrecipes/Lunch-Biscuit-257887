Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray 8 muffin cups with cooking spray. Mix Cheddar cheese and ham together in a bowl; fold in biscuit dough pieces. Add pizza sauce and lightly mix. Spoon mixture into the prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are puffed and browned, about 20 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from muffin cups.
