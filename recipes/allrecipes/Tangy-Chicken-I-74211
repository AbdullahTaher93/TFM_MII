Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. In a saucepan over low heat, mix the butter, lemon juice, cider vinegar, garlic salt, onion salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until butter is melted. Arrange chicken pieces in the prepared baking dish. Pour the butter mixture over the chicken. Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven. Turn chicken pieces, and continue baking 30 minutes, or until chicken juices run clear.
