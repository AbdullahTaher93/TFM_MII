Mix honey and mustard together in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Heat butter in a skillet over medium-high heat and lay pork chops into the hot butter. Sprinkle chops with half the garlic powder and cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Turn chops over, sprinkle with remaining garlic powder, and pan-fry chops for 3 more minutes. Brush honey mustard sauce over chops, turn them over, and cook for 5 minutes; turn chops onto other side and brush with honey mustard sauce. Cook until chops are no longer pink inside and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a chop reads 165 degrees F (75 degrees C), about 5 more minutes.
