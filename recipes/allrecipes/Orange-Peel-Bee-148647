Combine the beef, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, and baking soda in a bowl and mix thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate 1 to 3 hours. Heat peanut oil in a wok or large, nonstick skillet over high heat. Stir in garlic, ginger, orange zest, and red pepper flakes, and cook until the garlic begins to brown, 20 to 30 seconds. Add the beef; cook and stir until the beef begins to brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Whisk together 1 tablespoon soy sauce, orange juice concentrate, rice vinegar, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon cornstarch in a small bowl. Stir into the beef, and cook until the sauce has thickened and turned clear, about 30 seconds.
