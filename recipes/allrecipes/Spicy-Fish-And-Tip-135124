In a small bowl, mix the oil and red-pepper flakes and microwave for 30 seconds to make chile oil. Set aside. Tear off two 18-inch sections of foil and smooth them flat. Arrange an equal amount of spinach and asparagus in the center of each piece of foil. Place a fillet on top of each pile. Then top each fillet with scallion slices and chile oil. Halve the lime half, and squeeze the juice from each piece over the fish. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper, and seal the foil (fold up and over the fillets, then crease the sides to form a tent- the fish will bake and steam simultaneously). Bake in a 450 degree Fahrenheit oven for 10 to 12 minutes.
