Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Place the flour into a bowl. Add cubed pork and toss until coated. Shake off the excess flour and place pork in the hot oil. Cook until browned on each side, and then remove from the pan. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and melt the butter in the pan. Add the onion, garlic and shallot; season with thyme, rosemary, basil, salt and pepper. Cook and stir until the onion is tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Mix in the potatoes and cook for another 5 minutes. Pour the wine and beef broth into the pot, and add the pork and apple. Cover and cook for about 45 minutes, until potatoes and apples are tender.
