Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place farfalle pasta in the pot, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain. In a skillet over medium heat, cook the sausage until evenly brown. Mix in the roasted red peppers, mushrooms, and vodka, and bring to a boil. Cook and stir 5 minutes, until most of the vodka has evaporated and mushrooms are tender. Mix the tomatoes, half-and-half, and red pepper into the skillet. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring frequently, 15 minutes. Serve over the cooked pasta, and top with Parmesan cheese.
