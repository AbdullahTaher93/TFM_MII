Rinse and drain the salad greens. Put all the dressing ingredients in a jar and shake. Place the shrimp in a bowl and pour the dressing over them. Put them in the fridge while you get everything else ready. Combine the mango, onion, celery, and mint leaves in a bowl. Add the shrimp and dressing and mix thoroughly. Place a bed of salad greens on two plates and divide the shrimp and mango mixture over each plate.
