In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast the quinoa until it has a nutty aroma. Remove from heat, rinse and drain in a fine mesh strainer. Bring water to a boil in a saucepan, add salt, and slowly add toasted quinoa. Cook until tender and the outer rings appear on the grains, 15 to 20 minutes. Strain through a fine mesh colander. Place in a large bowl to cool. In a small bowl, combine cranberries, lime juice, olive oil, honey, garlic, serrano pepper, mint, cilantro, shallot, and arugula. Stir into the cooled quinoa and add salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Place 1 cup of baby arugula on each salad plate. Top with quinoa mixture, avocado, and grapefruit.
