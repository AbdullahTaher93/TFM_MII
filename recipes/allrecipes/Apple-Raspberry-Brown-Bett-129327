Lightly grease an 8-inch-square baking dish. In a large saucepan combine apple juice, apple jelly, and cornstarch. Stir until blended. Stir in apples and cook over medium-high heat until mixture comes to a boil. Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Gently fold currants or raisins into mixture and then spoon into the baking dish. Layer the raspberries on top. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a small bowl combine the topping ingredients and mix well. Sprinkle over the fruit and bake until topping is nicely browned, about 25-30 minutes.
