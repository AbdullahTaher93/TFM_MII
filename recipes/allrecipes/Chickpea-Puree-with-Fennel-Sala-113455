In a medium saucepan, cover the chickpeas with water by 2 inches and bring to a boil. Simmer over moderately low heat until tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Keep adding water as necessary so the chickpeas are always submerged in 1 inch of water. Remove them from the heat and season with salt. Drain the chickpeas, saving the cooking liquid. In a large skillet, heat 6 tablespoons of the olive oil. Add the onion, rosemary and oregano and cook over moderate heat until softened, 6 minutes. Add the chickpeas and 2 cups of the cooking liquid and simmer, mashing with a spoon, until most of the liquid has been absorbed, 5 minutes. Discard the rosemary. Press the puree through a food mill. Season with salt and keep warm. In a medium bowl, mix the lemon juice with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Add the fennel and toss to coat. Mound the chickpea puree and salad on plates. Top with the Parmesan shavings. Drizzle with olive oil and serve with crostini.
