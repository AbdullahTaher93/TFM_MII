Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan. Combine cornflakes, Parmesan cheese, sesame seeds, paprika, and oregano in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for up to 4 months. Dip chicken pieces in milk, then roll in about 1 1/4 cups coating mix. Place in baking pan. Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 45 to 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
