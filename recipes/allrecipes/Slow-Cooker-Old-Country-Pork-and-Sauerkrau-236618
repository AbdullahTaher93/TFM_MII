Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook pork loin in hot skillet until browned completely, 1 to 2 minutes per side; transfer to a slow cooker. Season pork with caraway seeds, salt, and pepper. Pour sauerkraut and tomatoes over the pork; top with onion slices. Cook on High for 1 hour. Switch slow cooker to Low and continue cooking until the pork is cooked through, 5 to 6 hours more. The internal temperature of the roast should be at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
