In a large skillet heat oil over high heat. Saute the onion until almost translucent. Add the stew meat and cook on high heat until meat is browned on all sides; about 3 to 5 minutes. Pour 2 cups water, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce into the skillet. Stir in garlic powder, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Meanwhile combine the gravy mix with 1 cup water. Mix thoroughly and stir into the meat mixture. Bring to a boil stirring frequently until slightly thickened.
