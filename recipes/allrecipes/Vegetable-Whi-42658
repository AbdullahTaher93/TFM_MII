Place the turnip, carrots, onion, and potatoes in a pot with water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and cook until fork-tender. Drain the water from the vegetables, and stir in the butter until melted. Beat with an electric mixer, adding milk gradually, until light and fluffy. Do not beat for too long, just until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve hot.
