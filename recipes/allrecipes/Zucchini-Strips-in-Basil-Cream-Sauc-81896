To toast the pine nuts, use a non-stick dry skillet over medium heat. Add the pine nuts and stir occasionally until they just start to get brown. Transfer to a paper towel. In the skillet over medium-high heat, add the butter and the garlic. Saute for 1 minute (careful not to burn). Add the sherry and 30 seconds later add the cream and salt and pepper. Let the cream reduce to about 2 Tbsps. Add the zucchini, toss and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until tender. Add the basil, stir and immediately remove from heat. Toss in the cheese and pine nuts and serve.
