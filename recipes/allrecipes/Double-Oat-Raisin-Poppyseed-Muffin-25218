Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 6 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. In a mixing bowl, mix flour, baking powder, nutmeg, sugar, and orange peel. In a separate bowl, mix eggs, margarine, and milk. Stir flour mixture into the wet ingredients until just moist. Stir in raisins, poppy seeds, and oats; mix well. Spoon batter into prepared muffin pan; fill muffin cups about 3/4 full. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of muffin comes out clean. Serve warm.
