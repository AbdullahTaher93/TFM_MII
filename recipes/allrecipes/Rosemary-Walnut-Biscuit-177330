Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Spread walnuts on a baking sheet and bake until lightly golden, about 8 minutes. Let cool. In a food processor, whirl walnuts until coarsely chopped. Blend in flour, baking powder, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Add butter; pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Transfer flour mixture to large bowl. Stir in milk until evenly moistened. Knead 3 or 4 times, until dough comes together, then transfer to floured work surface. Pat dough out until it is 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick. Using a 2-inch-round biscuit cutter, cut out biscuits; transfer to a baking pan or large plate. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and freeze up to 4 days. The day you serve them, thaw biscuits at room temperature, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Transfer biscuits to ungreased baking sheet. Bake until golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve warm.
