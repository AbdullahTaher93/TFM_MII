Bring brown rice and 3 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, 45 to 50 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the sesame oil over medium heat. Stir in the curry powder and red pepper flakes. Cook for a few seconds until fragrant. Pour in the remaining 3 cups of water, bouillon cube, and lentils. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the lentils are nearly tender, about 15 minutes. Make four shallow indentations in the cooked lentils with the back of a spoon, and crack a whole egg into each indentation. Recover, and continue cooking until the eggs have cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 5 minutes for medium-well. Serve over the brown rice.
