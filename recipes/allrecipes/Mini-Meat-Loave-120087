In a bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Shape into six loaves, about 5 in. x 2 in. x 1-1/2 in. Place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. In a bowl, combine the sauce ingredients. Spoon half over the top and sides of loaves. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes. Spread with remaining sauce. Bake 20-30 minutes longer or until meat is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F. Serve immediately; or cool, wrap individually and freeze for up to 3 months.
