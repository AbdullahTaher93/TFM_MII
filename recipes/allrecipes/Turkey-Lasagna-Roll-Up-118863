Cook the noodles according to package directions; rinse and drain. In a nonstick skillet, cook the turkey and onion over medium heat until turkey is no longer pink. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, bring broccoli and water to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5 minutes or until crisp-tender; drain. Add the broccoli, ricotta, egg, milk, thyme and salt to the turkey mixture. Spread over each noodle; drizzle each with 1/4 cup spaghetti sauce. Carefully roll up jelly-roll style. Place seam side down in an 8-in. square baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Drizzle with remaining spaghetti sauce. Cover and bake at 375 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until heated through. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
