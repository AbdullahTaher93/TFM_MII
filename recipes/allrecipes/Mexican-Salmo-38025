In a medium nonreactive bowl, mix olive oil, juice of 2 limes, roasted red peppers, garlic, allspice, cinnamon, cumin, sugar, salt and pepper. Place salmon steaks in bowl, and rub with the mixture. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour. Preheat the broiler. Arrange salmon steaks on a medium broiler pan, and broil 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until flesh is easily flaked with a fork. Mix tomato wedges and green onions in a small bowl. Serve salmon with the tomato mixture and lettuce. Garnish with lime wedges.
