Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups or line with paper liners. Beat butter, applesauce, 1 cup white sugar, and brown sugar in a large mixing bowl until smooth and creamy. Mix in eggs and vanilla extract, then stir in sour cream, Greek yogurt, and orange juice until thoroughly combined. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and salt in a separate bowl. Gently stir the flour mixture into the wet ingredients just until moistened; fold in cranberries and pecans. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups, filling them 2/3 full. Combine 1/4 cup sugar with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a bowl and sprinkle the cinnamon sugar over the muffins. Bake in the preheated oven until muffins are lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean or with moist crumbs, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool muffins in pans for 10 minutes before turning out to finish cooling on wire racks.
