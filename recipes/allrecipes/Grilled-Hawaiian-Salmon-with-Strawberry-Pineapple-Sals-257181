Mix strawberry preserves, soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, sesame oil, garlic powder, onion powder, ginger, and pepper together in a bowl to make marinade. Pour 1/3 cup into a glass measuring cup; reserve. Place salmon fillets in the bowl. Marinate salmon in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Mix strawberries, pineapple, onion, and parsley in a bowl to make salsa. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Oil a stainless steel grill basket. Place salmon fillets skin-side up in the basket; cook for 6 minutes. Flip and continue cooking skin-side down, about 6 minutes more. Divide salmon fillets among serving plates; drizzle reserved 1/3 cup marinade on top. Spoon salsa on top.
