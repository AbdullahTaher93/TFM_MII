Place water in a 2-qt. microwave-safe dish; cover and heat until boiling. Add potatoes, carrots, celery, onion, salt and pepper. Cook, uncovered, on high for 8-10 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender; set aside (do not drain). Meanwhile, in a 3-qt. dish, microwave butter on high for 50-60 seconds or until melted. Stir in flour until smooth. Gradually stir in milk. Cook, uncovered, on high for 6-7 minutes or until thickened, stirring every 2 minutes. Add the cheese. Heat for 1 to 1-1/2 minutes or until the cheese is melted. Stir in the corn and reserved vegetables. Cook on high for 2-3 minutes or until heated through.
