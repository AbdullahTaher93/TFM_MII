Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a large baking dish or casserole. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add unpeeled potatoes and bay leaf and cook until potatoes are tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain. Cool until potatoes can be handled. Peel and chop into bite-sized pieces. Pour soup into a bowl. Stir in butter, sour cream, green onions, and 1 cup of the Cheddar cheese. Mix well and pour over the potato pieces. Stir gently until blended. Pour into prepared baking dish. Bake uncovered for 30 minutes. Toss together remaining Cheddar cheese and crushed cornflakes and sprinkle over the top of the potatoes. Bake until browned and bubbly, 10 to 15 more minutes.
