With a sharp paring knife, cut an oval 'rugby ball' shape into each cherry tomato and scoop out the flesh. The cherry tomato should resemble an eye socket. Place a mozzarella ball (eyeball) in each of the cherry tomatoes (eye socket). Slice the olives so that each yields 4 'o'-shaped pieces; place 1 slice onto each mozzarella eyeball to form the 'pupil.' If the black olives do not sit very well, you may wish to use a paring knife to make a shallow round cut in the mozzarella to push the olive slice in, holding the 'pupil' in place.
