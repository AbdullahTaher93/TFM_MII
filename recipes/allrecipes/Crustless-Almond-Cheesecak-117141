In a small mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar for 2 minutes or until smooth. Add the egg and almond extract; beat on low speed just until combined. Pour into a 7-in. pie plate coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes. Remove to a wire rack; cool for 5 minutes. Combine topping ingredients; spread over cream cheese filling. Bake 7-8 minutes longer or until set. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around edge of pan to loosen; refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving. Serve with assorted fruit if desired.
