In a mixing bowl, combine the first seven ingredients; mix well. Chill for 1 hour or until firm enough to shape. Shape into 2-in. logs; place on a waxed paper-lined baking sheet. In a microwave or double boiler, melt chocolate chips and shortening. Dip one end of each log into chocolate or drizzle chocolate over logs. Return to waxed paper-lined sheet; chill until chocolate is set.
