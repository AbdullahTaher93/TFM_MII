Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12 cup muffin pan with paper liners. In a large bowl, mix together the apple, cheese, applesauce, eggs and olive oil. Combine the whole wheat flour, oats, baking powder and minced garlic; stir by hand into the wet ingredients until well blended. Spoon into the prepared muffin cups. Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the tops of the muffins spring back when lightly pressed. Cool completely before serving.
