Place the raisins in a bowl; add boiling water. Cover and let stand for 10 minutes; drain. In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar; add eggs. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture. Stir in the corn, nuts and raisins. Pour into two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake 350 degrees F for 60-70 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
