For Crispy Tortilla Strips: Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut 3 (12-inch) flour tortillas into 3/8-inch strips; cut strips into 2 inch pieces and toss with 1 tablespoon oil. Spread out on rimmed baking sheet; bake until crisp, about 7 minutes, tossing occasionally. Yields 8 servings (about 3 cups). In large saucepan, heat oil. Add sweet potatoes, celery, onion, garlic and cumin; cook and stir for 5 minutes. Add broth, chicken and tomatillos; bring to boil; reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Just before ready to serve, stir in 1 cup of the tortilla strips along with the Avocado and cilantro. Season with pepper, if desired. Serve in bowls topped with remaining 2 cups tortilla strips and sour cream, if desired.
