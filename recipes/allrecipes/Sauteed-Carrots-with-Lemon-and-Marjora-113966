In a medium nonstick frying pan, heat 1 1/2 tablespoons of the oil over moderately low heat. Add the garlic, carrots, sugar, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, the pepper, and the dried marjoram, if using. Cook, covered, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Uncover the pan. Raise the heat to moderate and cook, stirring frequently, until the carrots are very tender and beginning to brown, about 8 minutes longer. Remove the pan from the heat. Stir in the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt, the lemon juice, and the fresh marjoram, if using.
