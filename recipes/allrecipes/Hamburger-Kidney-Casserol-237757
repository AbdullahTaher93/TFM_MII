Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir onion, bell pepper, garlic, chili powder, and salt with the ground beef; cook and stir until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir kidney beans, tomatoes, and rice into the beef mixture; pour into a large casserole dish and top with American cheese and olives. Bake in preheated oven until the cheese is beginning to brown around the edges, 45 to 50 minutes.
