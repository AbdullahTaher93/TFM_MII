Place chicken in resealable plastic bag, coat with eggnog, and refrigerate, 1 to 3 hours. Mix together panko, flour, garlic, chicken bouillon, baking soda, garlic salt, Italian seasoning, dried thyme, paprika, ground cinnamon, and ground nutmeg in a bowl for the breading mixture. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Remove chicken from eggnog mixture and gently press each piece into breading mixture to coat, shaking off excess. Discard the eggnog. Fry chicken until golden brown, about 3 to 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Place fried chicken on cooling racks to drain over a baking sheet.
