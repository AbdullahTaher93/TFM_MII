Place the steaks on a lightly greased grill 4 to 6 inches above a solid bed of medium-hot coals. Cook, turning as needed, until evenly browned on the outside and a thermometer inserted in the center registers 145 degrees F (for medium-rare). Cut to test for doneness (about 15 minutes). Meanwhile, place the tomatoes on the grill, cut sides up, and brush them lightly with 1 tablespoon of the oil. When the tomatoes are browned on the bottom (about 3 minutes), turn them over and continue cooking until soft when pressed (about 3 more minutes). While the tomatoes are grilling, combine the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil, the onion, and garlic in a medium frying pan with a heatproof handle. Set the pan over the coals (or set on the stove over medium-high heat). Cook, stirring often, until the onion is limp and golden (about 10 minutes). Stir in the basil. When the tomatoes are soft, stir them into the onion mixture, then set the pan aside on a cooler area of the grill (or cover and keep warm on the stove). When the steak is done, place it on a board with a well (or on a platter). Spoon the tomato relish alongside the steak. Season with salt and pepper, and garnish with basil sprigs, if using. To serve, cut the meat into thin slices. Combine the accumulated meat juices with the tomato relish, if desired.
