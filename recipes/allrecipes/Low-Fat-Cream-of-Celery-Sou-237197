Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir celery and onion in hot oil until celery is almost completely tender, about 5 minutes. Add chicken broth, garlic salt, butter flavoring, parsley, celery seed, and black pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover the saucepan with a lid, and simmer until celery is completely soft, 5 to 10 minutes more. Remove from heat. Pour milk and potato flakes into a jar, cover the jar with a lid, and shake until flakes and milk are completely combined. Pour celery mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Return pureed celery soup to saucepan. Heat soup in the saucepan over low heat; stir milk-potato flake mixture into soup until completely incorporated and hot, 3 to 5 minutes.
