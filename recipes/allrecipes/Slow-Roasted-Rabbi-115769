Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Season the rabbit with salt and pepper. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the rabbit pieces and brown on all sides. Place in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, onion, ketchup, garlic, paprika, Worcestershire sauce and water; pour over the rabbit. Bake uncovered for 90 minutes in the preheated oven, basting frequently. Meat should be very tender when done.
