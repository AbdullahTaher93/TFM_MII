Rinse chicken pieces in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Mix the corn flakes, garlic salt, pepper and paprika in a shallow dish. Dip the chicken pieces in the egg then roll in the corn flakes mixture. Heat oil in a non-stick skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken pieces in the hot skillet and cook until internal temperature of the leg reaches 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) and the juices run clear.
