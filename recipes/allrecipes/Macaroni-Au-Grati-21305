Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 2 quart casserole dish. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Transfer to prepared casserole dish and lay cheese slices over macaroni. Sprinkle with paprika. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add milk and flour, stirring until it thickens. Stir in salt and pepper and pour over macaroni and cheese. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
