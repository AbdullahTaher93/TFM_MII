In a large, resealable plastic bag, combine soy sauce, red wine, ginger, garlic and black pepper. Seal, and shake to mix ingredients. Add salmon fillets, squeeze out excess air, and seal. Refrigerate for 1 hour, turning frequently so all sides get coated with the marinade. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium high heat and lightly oil grate. Place salmon on hot grill, flesh side down. Cover and cook until grill marks form, about 3-5 minutes. Carefully turn salmon and cook until just opaque throughout, about 3-5 minutes longer. Remove from grill and serve.
