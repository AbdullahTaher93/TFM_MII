In large saucepan melt butter over low heat. Add marshmallows and stir until completely melted. Remove from heat. Add Kellogg's(R) Rice Krispies(R) cereal. Stir until well coated. Using buttered spatula or waxed paper, press mixture evenly in 15 x 10 x 1-inch pan coated with cooking spray. Cool. Using 4-inch cookie cutter coated with cooking spray cut into snowman shapes. (If desired, use 2-, 1 3/4- and 1 1/2-inch round cookie cutters coated with cooking spray to cut into circles.) Decorate snowmen with frosting and/or candies. (If using circles, for each snowman connect three different sized circles together with frosting. Decorate with remaining frosting and/or candies.) Best if served the same day.
