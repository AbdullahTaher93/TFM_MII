To prepare dressing, mix mayonnaise, sour cream, lemon juice, and dill until smooth. Set aside. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the cashews. Combine remaining nuts, peas, onions, celery, and shrimp. Add dressing and mix lightly. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Line a serving platter or bowl with lettuce. Spoon salad into center; garnish with reserved cashews and, if desired, dill.
