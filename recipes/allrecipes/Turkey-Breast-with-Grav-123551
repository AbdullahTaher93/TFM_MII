Place turkey breast in a shallow baking pan; coat the outside of the turkey with nonstick cooking spray. Tuck onion and celery underneath in the breast cavity. Combine seasonings; rub over turkey. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 2-1/2 to 3 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 185 degrees F, basting every 30 minutes. Remove turkey and keep warm. For gravy, combine flour and water in a saucepan until smooth. Add pan drippings and bouillon. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly; boil for 2 minutes. Slice turkey; serve with gravy.
