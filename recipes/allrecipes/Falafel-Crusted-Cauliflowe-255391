Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place cauliflower onto the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with oil, salt, and pepper; toss until coated. Sprinkle on falafel mix; toss until combined. Spread out evenly on the baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven, tossing once, until browned and cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes.
