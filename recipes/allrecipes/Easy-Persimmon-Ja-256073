Combine persimmon flesh, sugar, persimmon skin, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a small pot over medium heat; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until persimmon flesh softens and jam thickens, about 10 minutes. Cool jam until set, about 30 minutes. Transfer to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator.
