Heat oil over low heat in a large skillet. In a shallow dish combine bread crumbs, oregano, cumin, salt and pepper. Place beaten eggs in a separate shallow plate. Dip each steak in eggs then dredge in bread crumb mixture. Increase heat to medium-high. Cook steaks until cooked through and browned, about 4 to 5 minutes each side. Serve with lemon wedges.
