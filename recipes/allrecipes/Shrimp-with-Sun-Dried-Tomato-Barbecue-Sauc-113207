Heat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine the sun-dried tomatoes and boiling water. Let sit for 20 minutes. Put the sun-dried tomatoes and their soaking liquid in a blender. Add the Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, and salt and blend to a coarse puree. In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over low heat. Add the garlic, jalapenos, and ginger and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Add the chili powder and pepper and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds longer. Add the butter and melt. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the tomato mixture. Add the shrimp and stir to combine. Put the shrimp and sauce in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish in an even layer. Bake the shrimp until just done, about 11 minutes.
