Drain pineapple, reserving 3 tablespoons juice. Set pineapple aside; set juice aside for frosting. In a mixing bowl, cream shortening and sugar. Add egg; mix well. Add pineapple and vanilla; mix well. Combine flour, baking soda, baking soda and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Drop by tablespoonfuls 2 in. apart onto greased baking sheets. Bake at 325 degrees F for 17-20 minutes or until golden. Immediately remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks. For frosting, in a small bowl, combine confectioners' sugar with enough of the reserved pineapple juice to achieve a smooth spreading consistency. Frost cooled cookies.
