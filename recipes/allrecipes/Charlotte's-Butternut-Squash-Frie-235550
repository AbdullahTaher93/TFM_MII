Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly oil a baking sheet. Mix squash, olive oil, paprika, garlic, thyme, and salt together in a bowl until evenly coated; spread in a single layer onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until squash is tender and lightly browned, 30 to 40 minutes.
