Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions. Drain and cool. Mix spinach, cheeses, 1/4 cup of Ranch and seasonings in large bowl. Set 1/2 cup of pasta sauce aside. Pour remaining sauce into greased shallow casserole dish at least 10 inches in diameter. To assemble flowers, spread 2 to 3 tablespoons of cheese mixture on each noodle and roll up. Place flowers, curly side up, in casserole dish. Mix remaining Ranch with pasta sauce; drizzle over each flower. Cover and bake for 30 minutes or until heated through.
