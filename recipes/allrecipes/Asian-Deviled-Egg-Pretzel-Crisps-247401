Slice each hard-boiled egg in half, remove the yolk, and place into a food processor or blender. (Reserve the whites for another use.) Add mayonnaise, soy sauce, wasabi, ginger, and rice wine vinegar, and process until smooth. Add the panko bread crumbs, and pulse until they're incorporated into the yolk mixture. Spread (or pipe) the yolk mixture onto a Snack Factory(R) Pretzel Crisps(R), and sprinkle with black sesame seeds and green onion slices. If not serving right away, refrigerate until ready to serve for up to 3 hours.
