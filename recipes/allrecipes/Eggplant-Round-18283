In a shallow dish, combine corn meal, chili powder, oregano and salt. Dredge each eggplant slice in this mixture until coated on both the sides. Shake off excess. Heat a small layer of oil in a large skillet. When the oil is hot arrange a layer of the the eggplant rounds in the oil and fry uncovered for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the rounds over fry until golden brown. Continue adding oil and frying the rounds until they are all fried. Serve either hot or cold.
