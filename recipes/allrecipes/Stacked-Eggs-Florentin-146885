Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly coat 2 1-cup ovenproof glass bowls or ceramic ramekins with cooking spray. Crack 1 egg into each ramekin and season with salt and pepper. Divide spinach evenly between 2 ramekins. Crumble goat cheese over spinach and top with tomato slice. Place ramekins on baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes. Remove from oven. If you like your eggs well done, let them rest in ramekins for 5 minutes. Run knife around inside edges of ramekins to loosen eggs. Turn ramekins over onto plates. Season with salt and pepper.
