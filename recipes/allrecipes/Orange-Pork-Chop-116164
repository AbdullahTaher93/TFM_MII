Sprinkle both sides of pork chops with salt and pepper. In a nonstick skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, cook chops for 3-4 minutes on each side or until browned. Transfer to an 8-in. square baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. In the same skillet, cook garlic for 1 minute. Stir in the orange juice concentrate, broth and Worcestershire sauce; bring to a boil. Remove from the heat. Pour 1/4 cup sauce over pork. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), basting twice with sauce. Bring the remaining sauce to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until reduced to 1/2 cup. Serve pork chops with sauce and rice.
