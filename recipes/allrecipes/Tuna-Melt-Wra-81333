If broiling, pre-heat oven on broil to 350 degrees F. In a bowl, combine the tuna, celery, pickle relish, light mayonnaise and lemon juice, mixing well to create the 'tuna melt' mix. Down the center of each tortilla, place an equal portion of the tuna mix and top each with 1/4 cup of Cheddar cheese. Place each prepared tortilla on a broiler pan and place under the broiler (for microwaves, use a microwave-safe plate) and cook until the cheese begins to bubble (approximately 1 1/2-2 minutes). Once each tuna melt is cooked, fold the long end of the tortilla over ingredients and roll tightly and transfer them to individual plates.
