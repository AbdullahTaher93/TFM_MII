Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Thread chicken onto skewers alternately with vegetables. Grill 3 to 4 min. on each side or until chicken is cooked through and vegetables are crisp-tender, turning frequently. Meanwhile, mix mayo and barbecue sauce until well blended. Serve with the kabobs for dipping.
