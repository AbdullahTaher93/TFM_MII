Whisk garlic, soy sauce, sugar and oil in a large bowl until the sugar is completely dissolved. Add beef and mix thoroughly. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat; add the beef and marinade and cook, stirring frequently, until the beef is cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes. Add onion, zucchini and mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are tender, 4 to 5 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Serve garnished with scallions and toasted sesame seeds, if desired.
