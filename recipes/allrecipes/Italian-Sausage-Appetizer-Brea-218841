In a skillet, brown sausage until no longer pink; drain. On a lightly floured surface, roll bread dough to a 16-inch x 12-inch rectangle. Transfer dough to a greased baking sheet. Combine cream cheese and garlic, spread lengthwise over center third of dough. Top with the sausage, peppers, olives and cheese. Fold dough over filling, pinching seam to seal. Make slits across top of dough every 2 inches. Brush lightly with water and sprinkle with poppy seeds. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing.
