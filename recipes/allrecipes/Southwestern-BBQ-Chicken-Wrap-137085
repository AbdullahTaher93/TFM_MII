Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Unroll both cans of dough onto work surface. Separate each into 4 rectangles; stretch each slightly into 5 1/2x5-inch rectangle, firmly pressing perforations to seal. In large bowl, mix barbeque sauce with shredded chicken, beans, 3/4 cup of the cheese, 1/2 cup of the tomatoes and 1/4 cup of the onions. Spoon about 1/2 cup chicken mixture lengthwise down half of each dough rectangle to within 1/4 inch of edges. Fold dough over filling; press edges to seal. Place on ungreased large cookie sheet. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15 to 20 minutes or until deep golden brown. Meanwhile, spoon sour cream into small serving bowl, sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup onions and 1/4 cup tomatoes. To serve, cut each wrap in half crosswise. Serve with sour cream mixture. Garnish with fresh fruit and cilantro sprigs. Serve warm.
