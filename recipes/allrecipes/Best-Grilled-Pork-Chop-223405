Mix water, soy sauce, vegetable oil, lemon pepper seasoning, and minced garlic in a deep bowl; add pork chops and marinate in refrigerator at least 2 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove pork chops from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Cook the pork chops on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
