Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Beat together eggs, sugar, oil, flour, baking powder, vanilla and salt. Spread 2/3 of the batter into a greased 13x9-inch baking pan. Spread LUCKY LEAF Cherry Pie Filling on top of batter. Drop the remaining batter by spoonfuls on top of the pie filling layer. Stir together the sugar and the cinnamon. Sprinkle over top of cake. Bake for 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Serve warm or cooled.
