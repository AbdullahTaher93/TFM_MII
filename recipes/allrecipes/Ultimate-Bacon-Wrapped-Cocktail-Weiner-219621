Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a large baking pan with nonstick cooking spray. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, stir together Chili Sauce, Cranberry Sauce and 1/2 cup of syrup until smooth. Simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, and set aside. Meanwhile, wrap each wiener with a piece of bacon and place seam side down on baking sheet. Repeat with remaining wieners. Drizzle wieners with remaining 1/2 cup of syrup. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until bacon is crispy. Serve with warm cranberry sauce mixture for dipping sauce.
