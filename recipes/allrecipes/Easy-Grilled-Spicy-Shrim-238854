Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Put shrimp in a large bowl; add chile sauce, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, and cumin and toss to coat. Place shrimp onto the preheated grill using large tongs and cook until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, 3 to 4 minutes.
