Mix all of the ingredients for the marinade in a shallow dish. Add the pork tenderloin and turn to coat. Cover and marinate for at least 30 minutes, or overnight. To prepare the salsa, halve and peel the avocado and remove its pit, then mash the flesh in a bowl. Add the remaining salsa ingredients and mix well, then season to taste. Cover and chill until serving time. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat a large nonstick skillet over a medium-high heat until hot. Remove the meat from the marinade and pat it dry with a paper towel. Coat the pan with cooking spray, add the pork, and cook on all sides until brown. Push the pork to the side and add the onions and peppers to the pan. Cook until the vegetables are tender and lightly charred and the pork is cooked through, about 12 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, wrap the tortillas (stacked) in foil and warm in the oven for 5 to 10 minutes, or stack them between paper towels and heat on medium in the microwave for 1 minute. Remove the skillet from the heat. Lift out the pork and cut it into thin strips, then return it to the pan and mix it well with the onions and peppers. To serve, pile the pork, onions, and peppers into the tortillas, roll into cone shapes, and top with salsa.
