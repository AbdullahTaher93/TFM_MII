Place the pea pods and water in a microwave-safe bowl; cover and cook on high for 3-5 minutes or until crisp-tender. Meanwhile, in a small skillet, cook onion in 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat until crisp-tender. Drain peas; add to onion mixture. Add salt, pepper and remaining butter; toss to coat. Cook and stir until heated through.
