Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Combine confectioner's sugar, evaporated milk, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract in a small bowl. Beat butter and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Mix in egg and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl. Gradually add flour mixture to creamed mixture, mixing well. Roll dough into 1-inch balls and place on prepared baking sheet; make an indentation with finger in center of each cookie. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes. Fill depressions with jam and continue to bake until lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Cool for 2 minutes, then remove to wire racks. Drizzle confectioner's sugar glaze mixture over warm cookies; cool completely.
