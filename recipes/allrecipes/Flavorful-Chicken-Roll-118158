Make a lengthwise still through the thickest portion of each chicken breast to within 1/2 in. of the opposite side. Open chicken so it lies flat; cover with plastic wrap. Flatten to 1/4-in. thickness. Discard plastic wrap. Place a single layer of spinach over chicken. In a small bowl, combine the cream cheese, feta cheese, basil and pepper; spread over spinach. Top each chicken breast with a ham slice, trimming if necessary. Roll up and secure with toothpicks. In a shallow bowl, beat the egg and milk. Place bread crumbs in another bowl. Dip chicken rolls in egg mixture, then coat with crumbs. Place seam side down in a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until chicken juices run clear. Discard toothpicks before serving.
