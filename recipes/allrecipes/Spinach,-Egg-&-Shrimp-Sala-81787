For the dressing: put the mayonnaise, ketchup, relish, horseradish, water and lemon extract into a jar and shake well. Taste to see if you prefer some salt or pepper added. On two individual plates place the spinach. Slice the eggs and arrange on the plates. Sprinkle the shrimp evenly over the two plates. Drizzle the dressing over the salad. You probably will not need all of it. Chop or mince the scallion and sprinkle over the salads as a garnish. Serve.
