Using small-hole strainer, drain liquid from Pico de Gallo Salsa; discard liquid. Transfer remaining tomato mixture to medium bowl. Mix in black beans, cheese and cilantro until combined. Divide black bean mixture evenly over half of each tortilla (about 1/2 cup each). Fold tortillas in half. Heat large griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. Brush with oil. Place filled tortillas on griddle. Cook, carefully flipping once, until tortillas are golden brown and crisp and cheese filling melts, about 5 minutes. Cut quesadillas into wedges. Serve with your favorite GOYAÂ® Salsita variety, if desired.
