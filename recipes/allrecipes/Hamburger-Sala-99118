Fry the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp, turning as needed. Remove to paper towels and drain off the grease from the skillet. Crumble the ground beef into the same skillet; cook and stir over medium heat until evenly browned. Add the onions and cook just until wilted. Transfer the beef, onions and bacon to a slow cooker, crumbling the bacon as you put it in. Pour in the baked beans and pinto beans. Stir in the ketchup, vinegar, brown sugar, white sugar and mustard powder. Cover and heat on Low setting for 5 to 6 hours before serving.
