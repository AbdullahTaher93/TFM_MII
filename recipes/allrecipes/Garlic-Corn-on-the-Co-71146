Preheat grill for medium heat, or preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place each ear of corn on a separate square of aluminum foil. Place 1 tablespoon of butter on each one, and sprinkle with garlic powder. Wrap ears tightly with the foil. Place ears of corn on the grill or in the oven for 20 to 30 minutes, turning over occasionally.
