Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Scatter pieces of sweet potato, carrot, and parsnip onto a jelly roll pan; drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and black pepper. Roast in the preheated oven until vegetables are partially soft, about 30 minutes. Scatter thyme sprigs over vegetables and drizzle with maple syrup. Return to oven and bake until vegetables are soft, about 15 more minutes.
