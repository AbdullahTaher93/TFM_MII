Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Place the meat in the oil and saute for 5 minutes per side. Pour out 1 cup of the pepper juice from the jar and pour into the skillet. Add the water, garlic salt and ground black pepper to taste. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 40 minutes, flipping meat halfway through cooking. Add about 10 to 12 hot cherry peppers and heat for 5 more minutes.
