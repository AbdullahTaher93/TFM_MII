Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch square baking dish. Cut each Wonder Bread slice into 4 or 5 strips. Spread the fruit in the baking pan and cover with a layer of bread strips. In a separate mixing bowl, beat together the butter, sugar, flour and egg. Gently spread over the fruit and bread. Bake 40 to 50 minutes, or until golden brown.
