In a bowl, combine flour and salt. Cut in shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Combine milk and egg yolk; mix well. Gradually add to dry ingredients until dough forms a ball. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. On a lightly floured surface, roll out half of pastry to fit an ungreased 13-in. pizza pan. Sprinkle with cornflakes. Top with apples. Combine sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over apples. Roll out remaining pastry to fit top of pie. Place over apples; cut slits in top. Seal pastry and flute edges if desired. Brush with beaten egg white. Sprinkle with additional sugar if desired. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until golden. For glaze, combine confectioners' sugar, vanilla and enough water to achieve desired consistency. Drizzle over pizza.
