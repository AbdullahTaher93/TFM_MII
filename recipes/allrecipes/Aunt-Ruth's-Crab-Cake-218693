Stir the cracker crumbs and water together in a mixing bowl. Let stand 1 minute to soften the crackers. Add the crabmeat, egg, mustard, and mayonnaise. Season with Worcestershire sauce, seafood seasoning, salt, and black pepper; stir until evenly mixed. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Form the crab mixture into patties 3/4-inch thick. Cook in the hot oil until golden brown on each side and hot in the center, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.
