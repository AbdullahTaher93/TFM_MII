In a medium non-metal bowl, combine shrimp, oil and thyme. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or up to 6 hours. For rosemary skewers: Pull half of the leaves off each stalk, so that leaves remain on one end. Sharpen the other end into a point with a paring knife. Thread shrimp onto the pointed end of each skewer, as shown in photo. Heat a grill, grill pan, or broiler. Cook shrimp about 3 minutes per side, until they turn opaque and start to curl slightly. Place on serving platter; sprinkle with sea salt.
