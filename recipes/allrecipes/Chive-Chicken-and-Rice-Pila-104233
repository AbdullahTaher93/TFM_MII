In 13x9-inch casserole dish, combine long grain and wild rice mix using hot water, spice packet and butter, according to package directions. Brush chicken pieces with pizza sauce. Season chicken evenly with Morton(R) Kosher Salt and garlic mixture. Top each with three (3) tomato slices then chives. Place chicken pieces on rice mixture. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25 to 30 minutes, or until chicken juices run clear and rice is cooked through. (Internal temperature for chicken breast pieces is 170 degrees F.) Let stand 5 minutes then serve. Garnish with additional snipped chives, if desired.
