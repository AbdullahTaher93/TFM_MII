Light the grill or heat the broiler. Using 41/2 tablespoons of the oil, brush both sides of each slice of bread. Sprinkle both sides with the table salt. Grill or broil the bread, turning once, until crisp and golden on the surface but still soft inside, about 4 minutes in all. Rub the sardines all over with the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil and sprinkle with the coarse salt. Grill or broil the sardines for 4 minutes. Turn and cook until golden brown and just done, about 3 minutes. To serve, top each piece of grilled bread with 4 sardines.
