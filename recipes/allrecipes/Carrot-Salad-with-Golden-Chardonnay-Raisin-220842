Soak raisins in Chardonnay white wine in a bowl until plump, about 1 hour. Drain and reserve any remaining liquid from the plumped raisins. Mix carrots, mayonnaise, and chives together in a large bowl. Fold plumped raisins into carrot mixture. Mix reserved soaking liquid into the salad a tablespoon at a time until desired texture is achieved.
