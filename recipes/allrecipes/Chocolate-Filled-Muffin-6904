Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease 12 muffin cups. In large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon. In a small bowl, beat egg slightly. Stir in milk and oil. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour the egg mixture into the well, and stir to moisten. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups until 3/4 full. In a small bowl, mix milk powder with hot water. Stir vigorously to blend well. Mix in butter and almond flavoring. Stir in coconut. Form into as many balls as muffins. Push into top center of each muffin. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes.
