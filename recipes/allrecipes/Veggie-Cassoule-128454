Rinse beans and discard any stones or shriveled beans. In a medium saucepan, combine beans and 3 cups of the water. Let soak overnight. Drain. Return beans to the pan. Add onions, garlic, and remaining 1 1/2 cups of water. Heat to boiling over high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 1 hour. Remove from heat. Stir in leeks, breakfast links, roasted peppers, carrots, salt, and black pepper. While beans are cooking, soak tomatoes in hot water 10 minutes, or until soft. Drain, reserving soaking liquid. Chop tomatoes. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Coat a 2-quart (30 x 19-cm) baking dish with nonstick spray. Stir tomatoes and soaking liquid into bean mixture. Spoon into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with rosemary. Top with bread crumbs. Bake 1 hour, or until carrots are tender and bread crumbs are golden brown.
