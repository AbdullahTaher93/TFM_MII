Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove from heat, and set aside to cool. Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Cool, peel, and slice. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken, stirring occasionally, until no longer pink and juices run clear. Whisk remaining oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl until lightly emulsified; set aside. Place tomatoes, broccoli, peas, and corn together in a large mixing bowl; toss to combine. Add chicken, eggs and rice, and toss again. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving. Toss with dressing to coat just before serving.
