Whisk 1/4 cup cornstarch, 3 tablespoons rice wine, and 2 tablespoons soy sauce together in a bowl. Add chicken to the marinade and stir to coat completely. Set aside to marinate for 15 minutes. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet. Cook and stir chicken in the hot oil until completely browned; remove from oil with a slotted spoon to a bowl, retaining oil and drippings in the skillet. Pour remaining 1 tablespoon oil into the skillet and let it get hot before adding garlic, ginger, and red chile peppers; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Return chicken to the skillet; cook and stir until the chicken is nearly cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Whisk 1/4 cup rice wine, 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup cornstarch, sugar, water, vinegar, and sesame oil together in a bowl; pour over the chicken mixture. Cook until the sauce begins to bubble, 3 to 5 minutes. Add peanuts and green onion; cook and stir 1 minute more.
