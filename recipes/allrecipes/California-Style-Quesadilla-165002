Combine the first four ingredients in a bowl; stir well. Cover, chill and reserve. Combine the goat cheese, chopped bell peppers, cream cheese, and jalapenos in a bowl, and stir well. Spread about 2 tablespoons of the cheese mixture over each tortilla, and fold in half. Cook quesadilla in a large non-stick skillet with cooking spray over medium heat, approximately 3 minutes per side. Cut each quesadilla half into thirds (each person gets 3 wedges). Arrange quesadilla halves and 1/4 cup papaya mix on each of 6 plates. Garnish with cilantro sprigs if desired.
