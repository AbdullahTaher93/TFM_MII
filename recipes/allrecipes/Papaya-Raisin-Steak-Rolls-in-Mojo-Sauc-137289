In small bowl, mash papaya with fork until fairly smooth but pulpy. Stir in raisins; set aside. In another small bowl, mix garlic powder, salt and pepper. Place steaks side by side on waxed paper-lined work surface. Sprinkle garlic powder mixture evenly over one side of each steak; pat and press into steak. Turn steaks over; spread about 2 tablespoons papaya mixture in center of each steak. Starting with one short side, tightly roll up each steak; secure end with toothpick. Spray 12-inch skillet (or 10-inch skillet, 2 inches deep) with cooking spray; heat skillet over medium heat. Add rolls to skillet; cook uncovered over medium heat 5 minutes. Turn rolls; cook 5 minutes longer. Meanwhile, in medium bowl, mix all mojo sauce ingredients. Pour mojo sauce over steak rolls in skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer uncovered 20 to 30 minutes, stirring and spooning sauce over rolls occasionally, until meat thermometer inserted in center of rolls reads 140 degrees F. Remove toothpicks; serve steak rolls topped with mojo sauce.
