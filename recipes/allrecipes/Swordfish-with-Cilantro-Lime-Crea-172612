Rinse swordfish steaks and pat dry. Dust with bread crumbs. Melt butter in a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat; add swordfish and cook until browned on bottom, about 4 minutes. Turn fish over and cook until browned on the other side and opaque but still moist in center (cut to test), 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer fish to a warm platter; keep warm. Add onion to pan and stir just to wilt, about 30 seconds. Add cilantro, lime juice, and cream, stirring until it boils vigorously, 1 to 2 minutes. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Divide fish among 3 dinner plates. Pour sauce equally over fish. Garnish each plate with a lime wedge and cilantro sprigs.
