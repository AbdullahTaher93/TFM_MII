Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until some of the fat renders into the pan, about 5 minutes. Stir onion and garlic into the bacon and continue cooking until the bacon is crisp and the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes more. Stir green beans, water, vinegar, salt, and pepper into the bacon; cook at a simmer until the liquid is mostly evaporated, 10 to 12 minutes. Top with bread crumbs and cheese; stir gently.
