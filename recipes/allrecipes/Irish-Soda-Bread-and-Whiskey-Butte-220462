Place raisins in a small bowl; pour in whiskey and allow to soak overnight. The next day, drain raisins and reserve the leftover whiskey. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart casserole dish. Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl. Stir drained raisins, orange peel, and caraway seeds into dry ingredients. Beat in buttermilk and 1/4 cup melted butter to make a thick batter. Transfer batter to prepared casserole dish. Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. Beat 1/2 cup butter in a bowl until fluffy; beat in reserved whiskey, 1 teaspoon at a time, to taste. Serve with soda bread.
