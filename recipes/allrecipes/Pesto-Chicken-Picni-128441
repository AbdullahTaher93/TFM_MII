To make the pesto: In a food processor or blender, combine the spinach, basil, broth, Parmesan, pine nuts, oil, and sour cream. Process until smooth. To make the sandwiches: Coat a grill rack or broiler pan with nonstick spray. Preheat the grill or broiler. Cook the chicken 4 inches from the heat for 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until no longer pink in the center when tested with a sharp knife. Transfer to a plate and coat both sides of the chicken pieces with the pesto. Slice the bread in half horizontally. Scoop out about 1 inch of the soft bread center from each half; reserve for another use. On the bottom half of the bread, layer the olives, prosciutto, chicken, peppers, artichokes, tomatoes, and mozzarella. Cover with the top half of the bread and cut into wedges.
