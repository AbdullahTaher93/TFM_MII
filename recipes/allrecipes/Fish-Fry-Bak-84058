Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish with fish sticks. Sprinkle fries in a layer over the fish. Mix together the cream of celery soup, milk, and mayonnaise; pour over the fish and fries. Bake uncovered for 45 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool slightly before serving.
