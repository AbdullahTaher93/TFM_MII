In large bowl, combine potato flakes, corn, Cheddar cheese, flour, cornmeal, seasoned salt, basil, garlic powder and pepper; mix well. Add milk and egg; mix well. Let stand 2 to 3 minutes or until liquid is absorbed. Melt 1 to 2 tablespoons of the butter in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Drop potato mixture by 1/4 cupfuls into skillet. Carefully press each to form 3-inch round. Cook 6 to 8 minutes or until golden brown, turning once. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Repeat with remaining butter and potato mixture as necessary.
