Mix 1/2 of the package of dry mashed potatoes in burger. Prepare the other half of the package of mashed potatoes with 1 cup hot water and let cool to room temperature. Once cooled, add cheese and diced peppers, if using, and mix thoroughly. Form 8 thin burger patties. Place 2 tablespoons of mashed potatoes on top of each of 4 of the patties. Top with another patty and seal edges. Using your favorite method (we like the grill), cook to desired doneness.
