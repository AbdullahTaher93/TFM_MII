Chop 8 Lit'l Smokies smoked sausages and reserve the rest. In a saucepan over medium-high heat, heat chopped smoked sausages in olive oil with garlic until just browned. Add white wine and milk. In a separate bowl, toss the brie and Cheddar cheeses with flour, thoroughly coat. Slowly whisk cheese mixture into the saucepan. Continue to whisk until smooth and thick, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Saute the remaining smoked sausages in a skillet until browned. Serve warm fondue with Lit'l Smokies smoked sausages, apple slices and toasted baguette. Drizzle fondue and apples with honey.
