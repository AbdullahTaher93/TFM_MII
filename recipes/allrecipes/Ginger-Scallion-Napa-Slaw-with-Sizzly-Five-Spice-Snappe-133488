In a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil, 1 turn of the pan. Score the skin side of the fish with a few crosshatch marks to keep it from curling. Season the fish with salt, pepper and the five-spice powder. Put the fish in the skillet, skin side down, and cook, turning once, until it's no longer raw in its thickest part, about 4 minutes on each side. In a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil, 3 turns of the pan. When the oil ripples, add the ginger, garlic and cabbage. Wilt and sear the cabbage for 3 to 4 minutes, then add the scallions and cook for another minute. Add the soy sauce, vinegar and honey. Toss the cabbage to coat evenly with the sauce and season to taste with salt and pepper. Pile the ginger-scallion cabbage on dinner plates and top with the red snapper.
