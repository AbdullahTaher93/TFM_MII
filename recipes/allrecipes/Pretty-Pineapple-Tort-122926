In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and 3/4 cup sugar. Beat in egg yolks. Drain pineapple, reserving 2/3 cup juice (discard remaining juice or save for another use). In a bowl, combine juice, 3/4 cup pineapple and vanilla (set remaining pineapple aside for the filling). Combine dry ingredients; add to the creamed mixture alternately with pineapple mixture. In a small mixing bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Add remaining sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until stiff peaks form. Fold a fourth of the egg whites into batter; fold in remaining whites. Spoon into two greased and floured 9-in. round cake pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 28-32 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pans to wire racks to cool completely. For filling, beat the cream, sugar and extract in a mixing bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold in reserved pineapple. Split each cake layer in half horizontally. Spread about 3/4 cup filling between each layer; spread remaining filling over the top. Sprinkle with almonds.
