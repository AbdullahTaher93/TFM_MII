Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 2 quart casserole dish. Arrange potatoes in the bottom of the casserole dish. Crumble ground beef over potatoes, and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and ground black pepper. Spread onions over meat, and then beans. Pour undiluted soup over everything. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cover. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove cover, and continue baking for 1 hour.
