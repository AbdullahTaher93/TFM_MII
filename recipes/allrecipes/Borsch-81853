In a soup pot over medium-high heat, add the olive oil, beets, sliced onion, and the chopped celery. Saute for 3 minutes. Add the cabbage and saute another 3 minutes. (Yes, everything is supposed to turn that color. Isn't it lovely!) Add the stock, vinegar, thyme and salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Stir occasionally. Your can puree all of the stew if you like but I generally only do about 1/2 of it, especially if this is the main course. You can use a food processor, blender or a hand held blender wand. Taste test and add salt or pepper as needed.
