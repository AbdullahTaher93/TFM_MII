Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease a baking pan. In a small bowl, mix together the butter, 1 tsp oregano and the paprika. Set aside. Thaw the spinach in the microwave and squeeze off the excess liquids. (See note). Alternatively you can steam fresh spinach In a mixing bowl, beat the egg. Add the spinach, feta cheese, flax seed, 1/2 tsp oregano, garlic powder and a pinch of nutmeg. Blend well. Rinse and pat dry the chicken breasts. Slide your finger under the skin creating a pocket but be carefully not to tear any holes in the skin. Stuff the spinach mixture under the skin of each breast. Place in the greased baking pan. Using a basting brush, coat the skin with the butter paprika mixture. Bake at 350 degrees F, uncovered for 40 minutes or until juices run clear or internal temperature of 180 degrees F. If the skin is not crispy then put the pan under the broiler for the last 3 to 5 minutes.
