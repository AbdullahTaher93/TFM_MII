In a bowl, smear the garlic halves on the bottom and side of the bowl to release just a touch of its oil and flavor. Discard the garlic (or reserve it for some other recipe). Add the raspberries and the vinegars to the bowl. Smash together. You can strain the seed out if you desire. Add the thyme, salt and peppers. While whisking vigorously, add a little of the walnut oil at a time. You can use extra virgin olive oil if you prefer.
