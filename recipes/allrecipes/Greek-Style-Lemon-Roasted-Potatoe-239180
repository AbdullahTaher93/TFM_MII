Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Put potato wedges into a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil and lemon juice over the wedges and toss to coat. Season potatoes with salt, oregano, and black pepper; toss again to coat. Spread potato wedges in a single layer in a 2 inch-deep pan. Pour chicken broth over the potatoes. Roast potatoes in preheated oven until tender and golden brown, about 1 hour.
