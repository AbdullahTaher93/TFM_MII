In a large pot, bring about 1 inch of water to a boil. Sprinkle the fish with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper. Fold each fillet in half and put the fillets in a steamer basket over the boiling water. Reduce the heat to moderately high, cover, and steam until just done, about 10 minutes for folded 1/2-inch-thick fillets. Transfer the fillets to plates. Meanwhile, in a large frying pan, heat the 2 tablespoons oil over high heat. Add the mushrooms and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Top the fish with the mushrooms. Reduce the heat to moderately low. Heat the remaining teaspoon of oil in the pan; add the ginger, scallions, and garlic. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in the soy sauce, dry mustard, wine, and broth. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Spoon the sauce over the mushrooms and fish.
