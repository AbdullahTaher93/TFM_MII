In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook ground beef and onions, stirring to break up the chunks of meat, until nicely browned on the outside and no trace of pink remains, 8-10 minutes. Let cool. In a large bowl, combine Mann's Broccoli Cole Slaw, kidney beans, Cheddar cheese, tomato and olives tossing to mix well. Add salsa, tossing again to coat. (Salad can be made up to this point 24 hours in advance, cover, and refrigerate.) Add meat and onions; toss well. Add salad dressing and chips; toss well to mix.
