Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a casserole dish with butter or oil. Place the sweet potato chunks into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Mash the potatoes with a potato masher. Add the brown sugar, butter, condensed milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt to the mashed potato; beat with a wire whisk until fluffy. Crack the eggs into the bowl and continue whisking until the mixture is light in color; pour into the prepared dish. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 90 minutes.
