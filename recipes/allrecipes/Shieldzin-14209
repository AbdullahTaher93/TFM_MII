Cut cucumbers lengthwise, scoop out seeds with a spoon, and slice cucumbers into bite-sized pieces. Transfer to a salad bowl. In a small bowl, mix together salt, oil, sugar, rice wine vinegar, and soy sauce. Pour over cucumbers, and gently toss. Refrigerate several hours before serving, tossing every now and then.
