Place ham on a greased rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 50-60 minutes. In a saucepan, combine the sugar, cornstarch and salt. Add the orange juice, water, lemon juice and butter. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until thickened. Add the orange and lemon peel. Brush about 3 tablespoons of sauce over ham. Bake 10-15 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 140 degrees F and ham is heated through. Serve remaining sauce with ham.
