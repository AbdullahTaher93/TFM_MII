Combine pumpkin pie filling, ricotta cheese, cannellini beans, and garlic in a food processor or blender; process until completely smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Fill a small bowl with water. Place a damp paper towel over the wonton wrappers. Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray. Drop teaspoonfuls of the pumpkin filling into the center of each wonton wrapper. Dip a finger in the bowl of water and run around the edges. Fold wrappers in half, sealing the filling inside. Arrange filled ravioli on the baking sheet. Chill ravioli until filling is set, 5 to 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop 5 to 8 ravioli in the water; cook until they float to the top, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet with a large slotted spoon and keep warm in the preheated oven. Repeat with remaining ravioli. Pour balsamic vinegar into a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat; reduce heat and simmer, whisking constantly, until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Whisk in vegetable broth until sauce reaches desired consistency. Drizzle sauce over ravioli.
