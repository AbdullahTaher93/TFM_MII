Using a sharp knife, remove skin and white pith from the orange and grapefruit and discard. Cut the segments away from their surrounding membranes into a bowl (discard seeds). Squeeze any remaining juice from the membranes into the bowl. Drain the segments and measure the juice. Add enough water, if necessary, to make 1/2 cup and set the juice and fruit aside. Combine flour, salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Dredge chicken breasts lightly in the flour mixture. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until golden on the outside and no longer pink inside, 3 to 4 minutes per side. (Reduce heat to medium if the chicken is browning too quickly.) Remove and keep warm. Add remaining 1 teaspoon oil to the pan. Add leeks and cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add reserved fruit juices and vermouth and bring to a boil. Boil until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add marmalade, reserved fruit, mint and salt and pepper to taste. Return chicken to the skillet and reheat gently.
