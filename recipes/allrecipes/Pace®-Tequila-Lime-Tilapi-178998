Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a 3-quart shallow baking dish with the cooking spray. Place the fish fillets into the baking dish. Spoon 1/4 cup salsa onto each fillet. Top each with 1 tablespoon cheese. Bake for 10 minutes or until the fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Sprinkle with the cilantro, if desired.
