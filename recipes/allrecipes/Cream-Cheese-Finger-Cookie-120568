In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and cream cheese until light and fluffy. Beat in vanilla. Combine the flour, sugar and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture. Stir in pecans (dough will be crumbly). Shape tablespoonfuls into 2-in. logs. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until lightly browned. Carefully roll warm cookies in confectioners' sugar; cool on wire racks.
