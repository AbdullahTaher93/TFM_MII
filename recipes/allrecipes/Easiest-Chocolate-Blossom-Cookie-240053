Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Mix cake mix, pumpkin puree, and chocolate chips together in a bowl. Scoop batter using a cookie scoop and place on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are set, about 15 minutes. Place baking sheets on a wire rack and gently press a chocolate kiss into the center of each cookie. Allow cookies to cool and set.
