Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Generously grease 2 miniature muffin tins. Mix zucchini, Swiss cheese, bread crumbs, eggs, onion soup mix, Parmesan cheese, and basil together in a large bowl. Spoon mixture by the rounded teaspoon into the prepared muffin tins. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
