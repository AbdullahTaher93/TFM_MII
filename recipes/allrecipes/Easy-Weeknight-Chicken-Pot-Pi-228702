In medium bowl, stir together cooking sauce, poultry seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until smooth. Stir in vegetables and chicken. Spoon into crust-lined pie plate. Top with second crust; seal edge and flute. Cut slits in several places in top crust. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until crust is golden brown. After 15 minutes of baking, cover edge of crust with strips of foil to prevent excessive browning. Let stand 10 minutes before serving. Cut into wedges
