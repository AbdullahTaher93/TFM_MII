Coat the bottom of a skillet with a thin layer of olive oil; heat over medium heat. Cook and stir sausage slices in skillet until browned, 3 to 5 minutes; add garlic and continue cooking until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add broccoli rabe to the skillet; season with lemon zest, red pepper, and sea salt. Drizzle olive oil over the broccoli rabe and toss to coat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the broccoli rabe is completely wilted, about 15 minutes. Squeeze lemon half over the sausage and broccoli rabe mixture.
