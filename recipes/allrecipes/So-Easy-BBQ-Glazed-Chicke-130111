Preheat grill to medium heat. Pour 1/4 cup of the dressing over chicken in shallow dish or resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate 10 min. or up to 24 hours to marinate. Mix remaining 1/4 cup dressing, barbecue sauce and marmalade; set aside. Place chicken on grill; cover. Grill 12 to 15 min. or until cooked through (170 degrees F), turning occasionally and brushing with sauce mixture during last few minutes of cooking. Let stand, covered with foil, for a few minutes before serving.
