Flatten bread with a rolling pin. In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar and yolks. Spread on bread; roll up, jelly-roll style. Combine cinnamon and remaining sugar. Lightly dip rolls in butter, then in cinnamon-sugar. Place on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes.
