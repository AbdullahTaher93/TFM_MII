Heat a stockpot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground lamb, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until the lamb is completely browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir tomatoes, black beans, hot pepper sauce, and beef stock with the lamb mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer up to 2 hours.
