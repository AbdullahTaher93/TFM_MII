Heat oil in a heavy Dutch oven over medium high heat. Sear chicken on all sides until browned. Stir in dirty rice mix and water. Stir in crawfish, shrimp, sausage, mushrooms, bell pepper, onion and garlic. Bring mixture to a boil, and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until rice is tender, and moisture is absorbed, 25 to 30 minutes.
