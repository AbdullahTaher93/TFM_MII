Preheat grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Season halibut steaks with salt and black pepper. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir chanterelle mushrooms with a pinch of salt in hot oil until soft and caramelized, about 10 minutes. Stir corn and peppers into mushrooms until corn is toasted, about 2 minutes. Pour water into mushroom mixture; bring to a simmer and cook until reduced, about 5 minutes. Stir lemon juice and butter into mushroom mixture until butter melts and liquid is almost evaporated. Cook halibut steaks on the preheated grill until until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Divide mushroom mixture between two plates and sprinkle tarragon over each. Top mushrooms with halibut steaks.
