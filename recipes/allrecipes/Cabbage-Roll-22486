Mix together ground pork, rice, garlic and onion. Take a leaf of cabbage and put meat in the center. Tuck in sides and roll up, secure with a toothpick. Place tomato soup in a pot along with water. Place cabbage rolls in pot and boil lightly for at least 1 1/2 hours or until cooked through. Sauce will thicken as it cooks.
