Sprinkle the pork with 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper. Place on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 15 minutes. Combine marmalade, water, ginger and remaining salt; spoon over pork. Bake 10-15 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
