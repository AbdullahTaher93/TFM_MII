In a microwave-safe bowl, combine vinegar, 1/3 cup water, and dried tomatoes. Cover tightly and microwave on high (100%) until steaming (about 45 seconds). Let stand, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are soft (about 20 minutes). Meanwhile, in a 5- to 6-quart pan, bring about 3 quarts water to a boil over high heat. Stir in pasta and cook, uncovered, until just tender to bite (10 to 12 minutes). Or cook pasta according to package directions. While pasta is cooking, lay prosciutto strips on a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high (100%), turning once, just until hot (15 to 20 seconds). Pour canned tomatoes into a strainer over a large bowl, reserving juice. Chop the tomatoes and add to juice in bowl. Drain pasta and add to bowl chopped tomatoes. Add dried tomatoes and their liquid, garlic, parsley, and olive oil. Mix lightly, then add prosciutto and 1/4 cup cheese. Mix again, then season to taste with salt and pepper, adding more cheese, if desired.
