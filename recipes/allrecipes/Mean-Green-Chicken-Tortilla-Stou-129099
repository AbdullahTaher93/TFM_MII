In a large soup pot, heat the EVOO, 2 turns of the pan, over medium-high heat. Add the tomatillos, zucchini, onion, jalapenos and garlic and season with the cumin and salt and pepper. Cook until the onion is softened and the tomatillos become sauce-like, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the beer and cook over high heat until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken broth and thyme, cover and bring to a boil. Stir in the chicken and cook at a low boil for about 6 minutes. Discard the thyme stems (the leaves will have fallen into the stoup). Season with salt and pepper. Crush a handful of tortilla chips into 4 bowls and sprinkle with the cheese. Ladle the chicken stoup on top. Squeeze a lime wedge into each bowl and top with the scallions and cilantro.
