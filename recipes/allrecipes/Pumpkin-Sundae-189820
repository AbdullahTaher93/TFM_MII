In a large bowl, mix ice cream, pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice, and 4 to 6 tablespoons caramel topping to taste. Scoop mixture equally into 6 to 8 tall stemmed glasses. Mix 1/2 cup caramel topping with the rum; spoon equally over ice cream. Place filled glasses in freezer. Cover and freeze until firm, at least 2 hours or up until next day. To make brittle, pour sugar into a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat. Shake pan often until sugar liquefies and turns golden, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in nuts and immediately pour onto a piece of buttered foil set on baking sheet. Tilt pan so syrup spreads into a thin layer. Let cool until firm, at least 10 minutes. With a knife, break into large pieces; reserve 6 to 8 pieces. Place remaining pieces in a plastic bag; coarsely crush with a rolling pin or mallet. Store airtight up to 2 days. About 15 to 20 minutes before serving, remove sundaes from freezer. To serve, stick a large piece of brittle into each sundae; sprinkle sundae with crushed brittle.
