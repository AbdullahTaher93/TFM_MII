Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8-inch square baking dish with parchment. Stir flour, 1/4 cup cocoa powder, sugar, and baking powder together in a bowl. Whisk milk, applesauce, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl; pour into flour mixture and stir with a fork until just combined into a batter. Spread the batter into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Whisk brown sugar, remaining 1/4 cup cocoa powder, and hot water together in a bowl until the sugar and cocoa dissolve; pour over the batter in the baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 40 minutes; cool brownies slightly in pan before cutting to serve.
