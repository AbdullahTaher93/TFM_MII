Dredge chicken pieces in flour until well coated. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat and brown coated chicken pieces slowly in hot oil. Meanwhile, combine reserved mushroom liquid with the tomatoes, soy sauce and garlic in a large saucepan and stir together. Add browned chicken and onion and stir together; cover saucepan and simmer over low heat for 45 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and tender. Stir in mushrooms and olives and bring all to a boil; serve hot, coating with additional soy sauce if desired.
