In a large saucepan, combine the onions, green bell pepper, mushrooms, water, oregano, red pepper, garlic salt, and hot pepper sauce. Cook and stir over medium heat until the onions soften, about 4 minutes. Add the chicken breast pieces and cook until opaque and no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes. In a food processor combine the undrained tomatoes, peanut butter, and bouillon. Cover and process until smooth. Add the tomato and peanut mixture to the chicken and cook until the sauce is slightly thickened and heated throughout.
