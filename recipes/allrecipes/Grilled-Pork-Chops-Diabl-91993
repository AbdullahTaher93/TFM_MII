In a small bowl, mix chili powder, cumin, garlic, onion, and oil. Spread about 1 tablespoon of the chili mixture on each side of each chop. Place each chop between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. With a heavy, flat-sided mallet, pound meat firmly but gently all over to a thickness of about 1/4 inch. Place pork on a lightly oiled grill 4 to 6 inches above a solid bed of hot coals (you can hold your hand at grill level for only 2 to 3 seconds) or over high heat on a gas grill. Close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning once, until pork is well browned on both sides and no longer pink in center; cut to test (5 to 6 minutes). Serve pork with avocado slices; garnish with cilantro sprigs and orange wedges. Squeeze juice from the oranges over meat and avocado to taste.
