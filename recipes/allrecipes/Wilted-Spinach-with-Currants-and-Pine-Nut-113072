Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic, pine nuts and currants and cook until the pine nuts are slightly browned, about 1 minute. Increase the heat to medium-high, add the spinach and toss with tongs until wilted. Season the spinach with salt. Remove the pan from the heat, drizzle the spinach with the lemon juice and serve.
