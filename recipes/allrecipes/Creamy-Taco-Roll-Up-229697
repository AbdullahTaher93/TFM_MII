Beat cream cheese, sour cream, salsa, hot sauce, and taco seasoning together with an electric mixer in a bowl until smooth. Fold in green chiles, black olives, and green onions. Spread a thin layer of cream cheese mixture onto each flour tortilla. Roll up each tortilla. Chill for 30 minutes; cut into bite-sized slices to serve.
