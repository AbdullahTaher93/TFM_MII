In a bowl, combine biscuit mix and sugar. In another bowl, beat the egg and milk; add to dry ingredients and stir well. Add nuts and gumdrops; stir just until mixed. Pour into three greased 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pans to wire racks to cool completely.
