Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; saute onion until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir chickpeas with liquid from can, lemon juice, coriander, cumin, garam masala, and curry powder into onion mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring often, until liquid is mostly evaporated and sauce is thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir spinach into sauce and simmer until wilted, about 5 more minutes.
