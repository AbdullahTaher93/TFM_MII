Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch cake pan with cooking spray. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir in mashed pumpkin. Mix in honey, milk, oil, and egg until batter is smooth. Pour batter into the greased cake pan. Gently press cashews into the batter for decoration. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool in the pan, 5 to 10 minutes.
