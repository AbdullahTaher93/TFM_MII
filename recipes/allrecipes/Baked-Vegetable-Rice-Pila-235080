Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix chicken broth, rice, corn, peas, carrot, and onion together in a casserole dish; cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until rice is tender and broth has been absorbed, about 30 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and sprinkle pilaf with Cheddar cheese; cover with aluminum foil. Continue baking until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.
