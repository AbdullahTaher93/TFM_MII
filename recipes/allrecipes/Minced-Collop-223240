Crumble the ground beef into a skillet over medium heat; add onion, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir the ground beef until no longer pink, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir oats into beef mixture to coat in beef drippings. Pour beef stock over beef mixture; bring to a boil, place cover on the skillet, and reduce heat to low. Cook at a simmer until the oats are cooked, about 30 minutes. Stir Worcestershire sauce through the beef mixture to serve.
