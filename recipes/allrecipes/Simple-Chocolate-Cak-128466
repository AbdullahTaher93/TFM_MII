Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease an 8" or 9" round cake pan (20 x 4-cm or 23 x 3.5-cm sandwich or cake tin). In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, oil, vanilla extract, and egg yolks. In a medium bowl, with an electric mixer on high speed, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Stir the flour mixture into the yogurt mixture until just blended. Fold the egg whites into the flour mixture. Pour into the prepared pan. Bake for 35 minutes, or until a wooden stick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool on a rack for 5 minutes. Remove to the rack to cool completely.
