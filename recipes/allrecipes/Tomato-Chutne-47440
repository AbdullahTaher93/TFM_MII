Place cherry tomatoes in a medium saucepan. Add just enough water to cover the bottom of the pan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and let cook until tomatoes are soft and broken. In a medium bowl, mix together the white onion, green onion, cilantro, and chile peppers. Add hot cooked tomatoes, and mix well. Season with salt, pepper and lemon juice to taste.
