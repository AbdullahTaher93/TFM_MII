In large saucepan over medium heat, add oil and onions. Cook until softened. Crumble and cook sausage until browned and cooked through. Add potatoes, broth, kale and nutmeg. Bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to simmer for one hour. For a creamier texture, some of the soup can be pureed in a blender. To serve: brush baguette slices with oil (and parmesan if desired) and broil until toasted. Place 2 slices in each soup bowl. Pour soup over bread and serve.
