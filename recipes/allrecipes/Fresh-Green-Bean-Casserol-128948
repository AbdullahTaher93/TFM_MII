Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a 1 1/2-quart baking dish or deep-dish pie plate. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in flour; cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in ranch dressing and beans. Cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens slightly. Spoon into prepared baking dish. Melt remaining butter and toss with onions and crushed croutons. Sprinkle over beans. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until beans are hot and topping is golden brown.
