Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat the olive oil in a skillet over high heat. Cook the garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with the rosemary, salt, and pepper. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook until completely browned, about 5 minutes per side; transfer the chicken to a 9x13-inch baking dish, reserving the pan drippings. Stir the cream cheese, cream of mushroom soup, white wine, and the drippings from the skillet together in a bowl; pour over the chicken. Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is cooked completely and no longer pink in the middle, 45 to 50 minutes.
