Sprinkle chicken with paprika. In a large skillet, brown chicken in 2 teaspoons butter. Place the vegetables in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Top with chicken. Melt the remaining butter; stir in the tarragon, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Pour over chicken and vegetables. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until chicken juices run clear and vegetables are tender.
