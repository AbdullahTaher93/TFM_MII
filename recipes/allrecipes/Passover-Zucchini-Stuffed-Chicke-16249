Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet or 9x13 inch baking dish. Wash and clean the chicken breasts. Place farfel in a bowl and cover with hot water for 3 or 4 minutes, until soft. Drain and squeeze out water. In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine zucchini, farfel, eggs, chicken soup powder, onion, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Place 2 to 3 tablespoons of the stuffing under the skin of each chicken piece and arrange them on cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 40 to 50 minutes. Drain off fat and serve.
