Bring the water to a rolling boil and salt to taste. Drop fresh pasta into the boiling water and cook until the noodles float to the top of the pot, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain immediately and return to the pot. Top with pieces of softened butter and the grated cheese; toss lightly until noodles are well coated. Season with freshly ground black pepper and serve.
