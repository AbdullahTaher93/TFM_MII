Spread chocolate-hazelnut spread evenly over 2 slices of bread. Arrange marshmallows over chocolate-hazelnut spread. Place remaining 2 slices bread over marshmallows creating 2 sandwiches. Spread butter over both sides of each sandwich. Place both sandwiches in a skillet over medium heat and grill until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.
