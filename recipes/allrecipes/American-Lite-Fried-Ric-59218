In a medium saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Stir in rice. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook garlic and rice in oil for about 2 minutes, stirring frequently to avoid burning the garlic. Add broccoli and cauliflower florets and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 5 minutes. Toss green onions, carrots, cabbage, and water chestnuts into the pan, and cook another 5 minutes, or until vegetables are tender. Add additional water as needed to keep vegetables moist. Drizzle with soy sauce, and toss to coat.
