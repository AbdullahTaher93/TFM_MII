Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Cook the sausage in a skillet over medium heat. Remove to a plate. Add the celery, carrot, and onion. Cook for 10 minutes. Dump the vegetables into a casserole dish and stir in the beans, beer, and tomatoes (with juice). Crumble in the sausage and mix everything up. Top with bread cubes, cover with foil, and bake for 20 minutes. Uncover, drizzle the butter over the bread, and bake (without foil) for 8 to 10 minutes, or until bread is golden brown.
