Lightly coat the bowl and blade of a food processor with non-stick cooking spray and puree the 3/4 cup raisins to yield 1/4 cup of raisin paste. (The paste will be very sticky). Set aside. In a large, heavy skillet, heat the oil over high heat; add the onion and saute, stirring frequently until golden brown. Stir in the crushed coriander and anise seeds. Then add the chili powder, sugar, cinnamon, garlic and cloves; cook the mixture for 1 minute over moderate heat, stirring constantly. Add the cocoa powder, peanut butter, chicken broth, tomatoes, raisin paste, reserved raisins and salt; simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally for about 10 minutes or until the sauce is slightly thickened and bubbly. Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Grill or broil the chicken until cooked through. Place each breast on a serving plate and surround with about 1/4 cup of sauce. Serve with warm tortillas.
