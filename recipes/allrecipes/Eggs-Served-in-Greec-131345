Spray a small, ovenproof bowl or casserole dish (approximately 4.5 inches in diameter) with olive oil. Place bowl in a large pot, then add water to the pot until the water is about half as high as the bowl. Place pot over high heat and add the egg whites to the bowl. As soon as the water boils, turn heat to low and cover. Cook the eggs 12 to 16 minutes or until center is no longer runny. In a small food processor, combine the tomatoes, basil, olives, and garlic. Pulse until ingredients are finely minced. Stir in the feta. Spread 1 tablespoon of the pesto mixture on the bread. Carefully remove the egg from dish, using a butter knife to loosen it. Invert the egg onto the bread. Add the remaining pesto mixture to top. Serve immediately.
