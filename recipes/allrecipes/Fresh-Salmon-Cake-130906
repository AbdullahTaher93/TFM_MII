Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil and place in the oven to warm. In a large bowl, combine the eggs, mayonnaise, onion, bell pepper, scallions, garlic, parsley, basil, dill, lemon juice, Old Bay seasoning, and Tabasco sauce. Season with the salt and black pepper. Mix well. Gently fold in the salmon and 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs. Be careful not to overmix. The mixture should be very wet, with lumps of salmon. Warm 1 tablespoon of the oil in a nonstick griddle or skillet. Place the remaining 11/2 cup bread crumbs in a bowl. Divide the salmon into 12 portions and form each portion into a loose cake. Drop it into the bread crumbs and lightly coat both sides. Shake off the excess crumbs. Gently place each cake in the preheated pan. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until lightly browned and cooked though. Remove from the pan and place on the baking sheet in the oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining cakes, adding the remaining 1 tablespoon oil if necessary.
