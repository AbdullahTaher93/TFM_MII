Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry until cool enough to handle. Peel the potatoes, and mash until smooth while they are still hot. Add the butter, Cheddar cheese, garlic, and cilantro, mash until the ingredients are incorporated, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Form the mashed potatoes into 10 balls, and slightly flatten between the palms of your hands. Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat, and grease with cooking spray. Cook the poofies 5 at a time until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining poofies. Poofies are best served warm.
