In a small bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, milk, Splenda, and the cardamom. Mix until blended then continue to mix until it becomes very smooth (another minute or so). I like to cut the strawberries in half and then slice them thin. They can be used to line a wine glass for a beautiful presentation, then carefully spoon in the ricotta mixture. But if I'm in more of a hurry then I just cut the strawberries into tiny bites and stir them into the pudding. Refrigerate for 30 minutes or more. Or serve it right away.
