In a large self-closing plastic bag, combine first six ingredients; mix well. Place salmon in bag and seal tightly. Turn bag gently to distribute marinade. Refrigerate 15 minutes or up to 30 minutes for stronger flavor. Turn bag occasionally. Lightly grease grill rack. Preheat grill to medium heat. Remove salmon from marinade; reserve the marinade. Grill 12-15 minutes per inch of thickness or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Brush with reserved marinade up until the last 5 minutes of cooking time. Discard leftover marinade.
