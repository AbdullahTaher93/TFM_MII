Place ribs into a large saucepan. Cover with cold water, then place over high heat, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 40 minutes, then drain, and allow to cool to room temperature. In a large bowl, mix together the honey, coconut milk, and lime juice. Stir in the lime zest, garlic, ginger, chile pepper, green onions, and salt. Toss the ribs with the marinade, cover, and refrigerate overnight, turning on occasion. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange the ribs in a shallow baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until tender, 30 to 35 minutes.
