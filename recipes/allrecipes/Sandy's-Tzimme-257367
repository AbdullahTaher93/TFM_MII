Stir together carrots, orange juice, sugar, oil, zest, and ginger in a large skillet or 5-quart pot; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until carrots are tender and glazed, about 15 minutes. Stir in prunes and simmer until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in salt and pepper.
