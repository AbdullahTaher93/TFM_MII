Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Stir quinoa, cucumber, onion, and pomegranate seeds together in a bowl. Stir lemon juice, olive oil, mint, salt, and pepper into quinoa; toss to coat.
