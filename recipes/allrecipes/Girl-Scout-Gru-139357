Cut four pieces of heavy duty aluminum foil in to plate sized pieces. Cut ground beef in to four equal pieces and place each piece in a sheet of aluminum foil. Divide the remaining four ingredients up between the four packages. Fold the packages up just like a gift, making sure that all the edges are sealed. Place on a medium heat grill for 15 minutes. Serve right in the aluminum foil or place on a plate.
