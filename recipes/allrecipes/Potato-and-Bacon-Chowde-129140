In a saucepan, over high heat, bring the milk just to a boil. Meanwhile, in another large saucepan, heat the oil over a medium-high heat. Add the bacon and onion and cook, stirring frequently, 2 minutes. Add the flour and stir to combine, then slowly add about one-quarter of the hot milk, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan to mix in the flour. When the roux thickens, stir in the remaining hot milk. Add the potatoes and parsnip. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Bring just to a boil, stirring occasionally. Adjust the heat so the soup bubbles gently. Half cover the pan and continue cooking until the vegetables are nearly tender, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Stir in the spinach and continue cooking until the spinach wilts, 1 to 2 minutes. Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning, if necessary. Ladle into a warm tureen or individual bowls and serve at once.
