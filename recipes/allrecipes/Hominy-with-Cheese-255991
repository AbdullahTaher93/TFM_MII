Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine hominy, milk, 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese, tomato, green bell pepper, water, butter, jalapeno pepper, and salt in a heavy skillet. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until cheese and butter have melted, about 5 minutes. Transfer hominy mixture to an 8-inch baking dish; sprinkle remaining cheese evenly on top. Bake in the preheated oven until top starts to brown, about 30 minutes.
