Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan, combine wine, broth, garlic, and shallots. Bring to a boil over high heat; then boil, uncovered, stirring occasionally until reduced by half, 8 to 10 minutes. Add cream to pan and return to a boil. Stir often until reduced to 1 cup, 3 to 5 minutes. Add basil, oregano, and parsley. Reduce heat to low and simmer gently for 2 minutes. In a small bowl, combine butter and flour. Stir into wine sauce over low heat and simmer for 1 minute. Remove pan from heat. Add lemon juice, then season to taste with hot pepper sauce and ground white pepper. Set aside. Cut cooking parchment, into 4 sheets, each 12 by 15 inches. Place a piece of fish in the center of each paper and sprinkle lightly with salt and ground white pepper. Top each portion of fish with one-fourth of the sauce. (If your fish touches the edges of the paper, you can fold it over before topping with sauce.) To seal each packet, bring together long ends of parchment and make a 1-inch fold, then another, pressing lightly to crease paper. Turn over. Seam side down, double-fold ends of packet, again pressing lightly to crease paper, and tuck under fish. Transfer packets to a 10- by 15-inch rimmed pan, spacing equally apart. Bake in the center of a oven until fish is just opaque but still moist-looking in center of thickest part (cut a small slit through parchment into fish to test), about 15 minutes. Transfer packets to individual plates. To serve, cut packets open with a sharp knife or scissors just enough to expose fish without letting juices run out. Garnish with basil sprigs.
