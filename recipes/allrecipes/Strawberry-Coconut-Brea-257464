Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with shortening. Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Mix in eggs, one at a time, until well blended. Mix in coconut milk, lime juice, tamarind paste, and durian extract. Combine flour, poppy seeds, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into the creamed butter mixture until batter is just moistened. Add guava juice, 1 teaspoon at a time, if batter needs more moisture. Carefully fold strawberries into batter; pour into the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes on a wire rack before removing. Cool completely before slicing.
