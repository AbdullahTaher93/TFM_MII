In a large resealable plastic bag, combine fish and lime juice; seal bag and turn to coat. Let stand for 15 minutes. In a shallow dish, combine the flour, taco seasoning, cumin and cayenne. Drain fillets; coat with flour mixture. In a large skillet, cook fillets in oil over medium-high heat for 6-8 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
