Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine spices with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper; reserve 1 tablespoon of the mixture for the sauce. Rub both sides of ribs with remaining mixture. Place ribs, fatty side up, on a rimmed baking sheet, and cover tightly with foil; bake until tender, about 1 1/2 hours. (There will be hot liquid in baking sheet when removed from oven.) Meanwhile, make sauce: In a small saucepan, combine tomato puree, honey, Worcestershire, garlic, reserved spice mixture, and 3/4 cup water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened and reduced to about 1 1/2 cups, 20 to 25 minutes. Heat grill to medium. Cut ribs into four equal parts. Brush ribs generously with barbecue sauce; grill until charred in spots, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Serve with remaining sauce.
