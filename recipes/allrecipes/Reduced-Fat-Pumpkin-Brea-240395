Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf pans. Beat sugar and cream cheese together with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add pumpkin puree, applesauce, eggs, and vanilla extract; beat until smooth. Stir all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into pumpkin mixture until batter is just combined. Pour batter into prepared loaf pans, filling each about 1/3 full. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Cool in the pans for 15 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
