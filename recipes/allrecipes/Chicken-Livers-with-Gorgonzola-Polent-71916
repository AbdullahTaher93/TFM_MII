Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and bell pepper, and season with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until tender. Add mushrooms and garlic to the skillet, and cook for a few minutes until fragrant. Move the vegetables to the sides of the skillet, and add the chicken livers. Cook livers for 5 minutes, turning frequently. Stir tomatoes and wine into the skillet, and turn the heat to medium-high. Simmer for 20 minutes, or until most of the liquid is gone. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, pour chicken stock into a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Slowly pour in polenta while stirring vigorously. Cook for a few minutes, then stir in milk. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for about 5 minutes, until thick. Stir gorgonzola into the polenta until melted. Spoon polenta onto plates, and cover with the chicken liver sauce.
