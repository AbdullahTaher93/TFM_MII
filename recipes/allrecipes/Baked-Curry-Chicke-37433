Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Mix 1/4 cup of the flour, salt and pepper in medium bowl. Coat chicken pieces with flour mixture. Place chicken, skin sides up, in single layer in shallow baking pan. Dot with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until chicken begins to brown. Meanwhile, melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in medium saucepan on medium-high heat. Add apple, onion, 2 tablespoons of the coconut, garlic and curry powder. Cook and stir until onion is tender but not browned. Stir in remaining 1 tablespoon flour and chicken broth; bring to boil. Remove from heat. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Pour sauce over chicken pieces. Sprinkle with remaining 1 cup coconut. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. Place chicken and sauce on serving platter. Serve over rice, if desired.
