Cut 1 pound nectarines from pits into a blender or food processor. Whirl until mixture is a smooth puree, scraping container sides as needed. If desired, to remove tender bits of peel, rub puree through a fine strainer into a bowl. In another bowl, whip cream until it holds soft peaks. Add sugar and vanilla and continue to whip until distinct peaks form. Fold in nectarine puree and cinnamon. Spoon into wine or martini glasses. Garnish, if you like, with nectarine slices and cinnamon sticks.
