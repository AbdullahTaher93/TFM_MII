In a large (5-quart) heavy pot, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high. Season chicken generously on all sides with salt and pepper. Place 3 chicken legs in pot; cook, turning once, until browned, about 10 minutes total. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining chicken and oil. Add onion and 1/4 cup water to pot; cook, stirring to loosen browned bits on bottom. Add turmeric, ginger, and cinnamon; cook, stirring occasionally, until onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Return chicken to pot. Add 2 cups water and half the prunes; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; partially cover, and simmer until chicken is cooked through and very tender, about 45 minutes. Transfer chicken to a platter; cover tightly with aluminum foil to keep warm. Add remaining prunes to pot; raise heat to high. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce has thickened, about 10 minutes more. If not serving immediately, top chicken with sauce, cover and refrigerate up to 1 day in an airtight container. Otherwise, divide chicken among serving plates, and top with sauce.
