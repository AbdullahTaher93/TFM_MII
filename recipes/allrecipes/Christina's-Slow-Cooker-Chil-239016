Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Mix diced tomatoes and tomato paste together in the slow cooker; add chili powder, oregano, cumin, chipotle pepper powder, and cayenne pepper and stir. Layer ground beef, kidney beans, onions, bell peppers, jalapeno peppers, and garlic over tomato mixture. Cook on High for 3 hours. Reduce heat to Low and cook until flavors have blended, at least 3 hours more. Add more diced tomatoes, if desired.
