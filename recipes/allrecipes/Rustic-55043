Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add the rotini and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the garlic in the hot oil until it begins to brown, 3 to 5 minutes; stir in the parsley and cook another 30 seconds; remove from heat immediately and spoon over the drained pasta; season with salt and pepper. Top with Parmesan cheese.
