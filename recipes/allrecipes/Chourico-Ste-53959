Place the water, chourico, potatoes, cabbage, carrots, onion, celery, canned vegetables, parsley, garlic powder, celery salt, and red pepper in a large pot. Bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and continue to simmer the soup until the vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes. If soup is too thin, stir in cornstarch dissolved in water to thicken.
