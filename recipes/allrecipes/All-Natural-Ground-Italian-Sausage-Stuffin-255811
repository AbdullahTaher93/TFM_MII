Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a skillet, cook and crumble sausage in 1 tbsp. olive oil until no longer pink, about 5 minutes; set aside. In a large bowl, combine bread cubes and remaining 3 tablespoons oil. Sprinkle with pepper; toss to coat. Transfer to a greased 10x15-inch baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes or until crisp and lightly browned, stirring once. Remove pan to a wire rack to cool slightly. In a very large bowl, combine reserved sausage, the bread cubes, Parmesan cheese, green pepper, sun-dried tomatoes, olives, basil, and garlic. Whisk eggs and water in a bowl; pour over bread mixture and toss to coat. Transfer to a buttered 9x13-inch baking dish. Dot with butter. Bake, uncovered, until heated through, 35 to 40 minutes.
