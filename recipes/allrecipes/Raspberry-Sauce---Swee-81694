In a sauce pan over medium heat, add the water and the berries. Cook for about 10 minutes until the berries have broken up and formed a sauce. Taste to see if you desire any Splenda. If you intend to strain the sauce to remove the seeds then this is when to do it. Simply pour through a strainer and push the pulp through using the back of a spoon. To thicken the sauce add a pinch of guar gum (up to 1/4 tsp) and stir vigorously. It takes a bit of time for the guar gum to thicken fully (about 3 minutes). It does not have to be on the heat to thicken. If you accidentally get it too thick then just add more water.
