Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Add beef; cook and stir until no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour onion and beef mixture into an ungreased 8-inch baking dish. Layer corn and black beans on top. Stir biscuit baking mix, milk, Cheddar cheese, egg, and jalapeno peppers together in a bowl until well-blended. Pour evenly over black beans in the baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Serve topped with salsa and sour cream.
