Place the chicken into a 4-quart slow cooker. Sprinkle with the chili powder and cumin. Pour in the broth. Cover and cook on LOW for 8 to 9 hours* or until the chicken is cooked through. Remove the chicken to a cutting board. Using 2 forks, shred the chicken. Reserve 1 cup liquid in cooker, adding additional broth, if needed, to make 1 cup. Stir the soup into the cooker. Stir in chicken. Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Layer half the chicken mixture, tortillas and cheese in a 13x9x2-inch baking dish. Repeat the layers. Bake for 30 minutes or until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Serve over the rice.
