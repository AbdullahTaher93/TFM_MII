Chop black olives and green olives in a food processor or a food chopper. Mix cream cheese, 4 ounces Cheddar cheese, chopped olives, and taco seasoning together in a bowl using an electric mixer on low speed. Increase speed to medium and mix until well combined. Transfer cheese mixture to a flat serving plate. Shape cheese mixture into a 2-inch-thick carrot shape using a silicone bowl scraper. Press 2 ounces Cheddar cheese over the entire "carrot". Insert parsley sprigs into the top of the "carrot". Remove excess cheese from the plate using a damp napkin. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
