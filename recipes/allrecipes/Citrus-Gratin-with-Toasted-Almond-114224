Preheat the broiler. Set the oven rack 8 inches from the heat. Using a sharp knife, peel the grapefruits, oranges and tangerines, removing all of the bitter white pith. Working over a bowl, cut in between the membranes to release the sections into the bowl. Gently stir in the cinnamon and lime zest. Spread the citrus sections in individual gratin dishes. In a small bowl, toss the almonds with the turbinado sugar, oil and salt. Scatter the almonds over the fruit. Broil for about 2 minutes, rotating the dishes until the almonds are deep golden brown. Serve at once.
