Combine frozen cherries, dried cherries, granulated sugar, tapioca and almond extract in a large mixing bowl; mix well. (It is not necessary to thaw cherries before using.) Let cherry mixture stand 15 minutes. Line a 9-inch pie plate with pastry; fill with cherry mixture. Sprinkle with nutmeg. Dot with butter. Adjust top crust, cutting slits for steam to escape. Bake in a preheated 375-degrees F oven about 1 hour, or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly. If necessary, cover edge of crust with foil to prevent over browning.
