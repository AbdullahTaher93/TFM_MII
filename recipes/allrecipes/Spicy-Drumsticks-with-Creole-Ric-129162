Heat the broiler to medium. Put the flour, paprika, pepper, garlic, chiles, thyme, and a pinch of salt in a plastic bag and shake to mix. Make 2 slashes in each chicken drumstick and rub with the olive oil. Toss them one at a time in the bag to coat with the spice mixture; shake off any excess mixture. Place the chicken on the broiler rack and broil until golden and cooked through, turning often, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, make the Creole rice. Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Add the onion, pepper, and celery and saute until soft, about 2 minutes. Stir in the rice, then add the stock and kidney beans. Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer until all the stock is absorbed and the rice is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir the chopped parsley into the rice and season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon the rice onto 4 plates and place 2 drumsticks on top of each portion. Serve hot, garnished with sprigs of parsley.
