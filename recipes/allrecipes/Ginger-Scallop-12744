In a medium skillet saute the green onions in 2 tablespoons of the butter. Stir in the carrots and cook for 30 seconds. Stir in the ginger and the wine. Once hot add the cream, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, over high heat until the sauce is reduced by half. Stir in the scallops and cook for 1 minute. Add the remaining butter and stir until melted. Serve.
