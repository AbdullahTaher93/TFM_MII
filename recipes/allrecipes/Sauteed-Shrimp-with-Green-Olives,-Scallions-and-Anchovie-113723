Heat the olive oil In a large skillet. Add the scallions and garlic and cook over moderate heat until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the anchovies and cook, mashing them with a fork, for 2 minutes. Add the olives and stir for 1 minute to heat through. Add the shrimp and cook, turning once or twice, until they start to curl, about 2 minutes. Add the wine and simmer, stirring, until the shrimp are just cooked, about 1 minute longer. Remove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the butter and lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Transfer the shrimp to plates and serve.
