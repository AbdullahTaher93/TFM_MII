Heat the canola oil in a skillet. Stir the red curry paste into the hot oil; cook and stir for a few seconds before adding the garlic and shallot. Cook and stir the garlic and shallot until fragrant. Add the sardines; toss around in the pan to brown the skin a little bit and cover it well with the paste mixture. Gently stir the coconut cream into the mixture and continue to toss to coat the sardines. Allow mixture to come to a boil until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.
