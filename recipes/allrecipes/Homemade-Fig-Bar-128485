Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease baking sheets. Coarsely chop the figs and place in a food processor. Add the raisins and pulse until fairly smooth. Place in a medium saucepan. Add the 1 1/2 cups water, granulated sugar, and cardamom. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes, or until the mixture thickens. Remove from the heat. In a food processor, combine the flour, oat bran, brown sugar, and salt. Process briefly. Add the butter. Process until well-combined. Slowly add the remaining water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the mixture forms a ball. Turn the mixture onto a floured surface. Divide in half. Using a rolling pin, roll into 2 rectangles, each 3-inch (7.5 cm) wide and 24-inch (60 cm) long. Spoon half of the fig mixture down the center of each rectangle. Carefully fold the sides over the fig mixture, pinching the edges together in the center. Cut into 1 1/2 inch-long (3.75 cm) pieces. Place on the prepared baking sheets. Bake for 10 minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool on a rack for 2 minutes. Remove to the rack to cool completely.
