Whisk tamari, sesame oil, mirin, honey, vinegar, ginger, green onions, and garlic together in a bowl until marinade is evenly mixed. Place tuna steaks in the marinade and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Spread sesame seeds onto a plate. Remove tuna from marinade and discard marinade. Press tuna into sesame seeds until evenly coated. Heat olive oil in a cast iron skillet over high heat until very hot; cook tuna in the hot oil until cooked to desired doneness, 30 seconds to 5 minutes per side.
