Combine the broth, cider, peppercorns, cloves and bay leaf in a large pot, cover and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, add the chicken and vegetables, and simmer, skimming if necessary, until tender, about 20 minutes. Spoon out the peppercorns, cloves and bay leaf and discard. Season to taste with salt. Let the dish cool slightly before serving to pets.
