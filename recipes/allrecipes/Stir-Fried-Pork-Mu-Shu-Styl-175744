Cut pork chops into very thin slices. Pour half the oil into a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan. Place pan over high heat. When pan is very hot, add pork. Stir-fry until meat is lightly browned but still pink in center, about 1 minute. Pour from pan and set aside. Add remaining oil to pan and return to heat. When pan is very hot, add mushrooms, cabbage, and onion. Cover and cook until vegetables exude juice, 1 to 2 minutes. Add a teaspoon or two of broth to vegetables, if necessary, to prevent them from burning. Uncover and sir-fry until liquid evaporates, about 1 minute more. Mix together broth, sherry, 1 to 2 tablespoons plum sauce, and cornstarch until smooth. Add to vegetables in pan along with pork. Stir until sauce boils and thickens and pork is no longer pink in center, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a serving bowl. To eat, spread additional plum sauce to taste on a tortilla. Add pork mixture and, if desired, cilantro sprigs to taste. Fold tortilla over filling.
