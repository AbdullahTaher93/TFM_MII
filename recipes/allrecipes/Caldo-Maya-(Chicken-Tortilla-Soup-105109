Skin chicken. In a 4-1/2-quart pot place chicken pieces, water, half the onion, half the celery, the tomato, cilantro, salt, cumin, cayenne pepper, and black pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 40 to 50 minutes or until chicken is tender. Remove chicken pieces and set aside to cool slightly. Strain the broth mixture, reserving broth and discarding the vegetables. Return the broth to the pot. Add the remaining onion and celery and the carrots. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, for 20 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Meanwhile, cut poblano peppers in half lengthwise; remove the stems, membranes, and seeds. Place peppers, cut side down, on a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake in a 425 degrees F oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until skins are dark. Wrap in the foil; let stand until cool enough to handle. Pull the skin off gently and slowly using a paring knife. Discard skin. Chop peppers. Remove chicken from bones; discard bones. Chop the chicken. Stir chicken and poblano peppers into broth mixture. Heat through. Ladle into bowls. If desired, garnish with avocado, cilantro, green onions, and tortilla strips.
