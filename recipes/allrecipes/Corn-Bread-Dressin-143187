In a large bowl, combine crumbled corn bread and bread; set aside. In a medium saucepan, cook onion and celery in butter over medium heat about 5 minutes or until tender. Remove from heat. Stir in LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk. Add egg, thyme, and sage. Add onion mixture to corn bread mixture, tossing gently to coat. Add broth to moisten the stuffing as desired. Transfer stuffing to a 1 1/2-quart shallow casserole. (Or, use the mixture to stuff a 10- to 12-pound turkey.) Bake the casserole, covered, in a 325 degree F oven for 40 to 45 minutes or until heated through. (If baked in turkey, stuffing must reach a temperature of 165 degrees F.)
