Place chicken in a roasting pan; dot with butter. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F; bake for 2 hours. Pour cider over chicken. Add potatoes, onions and peppers to the pan; place bacon over chicken breast. Bake 1 hour longer, basting often. Add tomatoes to the pan. Bake 30 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees F. Cover and let stand 10 minutes before carving. Thicken the pan juices for gravy if desired.
