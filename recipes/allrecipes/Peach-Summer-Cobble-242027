Mix 1 cup flour, milk, melted butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and baking powder together in a bowl until batter is combined. Combine 1/4 cup brown sugar, 4 teaspoons flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon, and allspice together in a bowl; add water and mix. Stir peaches into brown sugar filling. Spoon filling into the prepared baking dish. Spread batter over the filling; top with white sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until filling is bubbling and top is golden brown, 45 to 60 minutes.
