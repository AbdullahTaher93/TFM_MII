Rinse chicken and pat dry. Place each piece between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. With a heavy, flat-sided mallet, pound meat firmly but gently to a thickness of about 1/4 inch. Coat chicken lightly with flour; shake off excess. Melt half of the butter in a wide nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Fill pan with chicken; without overlapping, add more as pieces shrink, using about half the chicken. Cook, turning as needed, until chicken is browned on both sides and no longer pink in center; cut to test (3 to 4 minutes). Transfer to a warm platter and keep warm. Add remaining butter and chicken and repeat to brown all the pieces. Add shallots to pan; cook, stirring, until soft (1 to 2 minutes). Add wine, cream, broth, and chopped tarragon. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Boil, stirring often, until reduced to about 2/3 cup (2 to 3 minutes). Add grapes to sauce. Cook, shaking pan often, just until grapes are hot (about 1 minute). Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper, then pour evenly over chicken. Garnish with tarragon sprigs, if desired.
