Melt butter in a small saucepan; stir in flour. Blend in salt, mustard, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce and onion. Combine pineapple juice, milk and egg yolk; mix well. Gradually stir into butter mixture. Bring to a gentle boil; cook until thickened. Remove from the heat and set aside. Top each piece of ham with a slice of cheese and two to three broccoli spears. Spoon 1 tablespoon sauce over broccoli. Roll-up, securing with toothpicks if necessary. Place, seam side down, in a greased shallow baking dish. Top with remaining sauce. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until heated through. Remove toothpicks if used.
