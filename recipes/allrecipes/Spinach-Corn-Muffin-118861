In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, brown sugar, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, beat the egg, milk and oil; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in the spinach, cheese and jalapenos. Coat muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray; fill two-third full with batter. Bake at 400 degrees F for 18-22 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 2 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
