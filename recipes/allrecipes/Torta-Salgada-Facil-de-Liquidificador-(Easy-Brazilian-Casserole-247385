Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a baking dish with butter. Spread ham, peas, and corn in the bottom of the baking dish. Whisk eggs and flour together in a large bowl. Pour in 3/4 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoon cold milk and mix until well-combined. Season with salt and pepper and pour into the baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until center is set and edges are golden, about 30 minutes.
