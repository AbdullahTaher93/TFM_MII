In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar, olive oil, honey, vinegar, and lemon juice. Set aside. Place the salad greens in a pretty bowl, and top with sliced avocado and strawberries. Drizzle dressing over everything, then sprinkle with pecans. Refrigerate for up to 2 hours before serving, or serve immediately.
