In a mixing bowl, combine the oats, sugar, butter and salt. Stir in boiling water; cool to 110 degrees F to 115 degrees F. Dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir into oat mixture with egg and enough flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Roll to 1/2-in. thickness. Cut with a floured 2-1/2-in biscuit cutter. Place 2 in. apart on lightly greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks. Serve warm.
