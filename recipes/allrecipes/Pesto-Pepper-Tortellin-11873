Prepare tortellini according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a skillet, saute red pepper and garlic in butter or margarine until pepper is crisp and tender. Stir in cream and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until slightly thickened. Add walnuts, basil and onion and heat through. Drain tortellini, add to sauce and toss to coat. Serve with your favorite garnish.
