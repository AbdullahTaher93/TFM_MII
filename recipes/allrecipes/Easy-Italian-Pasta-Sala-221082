Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Rinse pasta in cold water until cool; drain. Toss drained pasta, tomatoes, green bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, cucumber, black olives, and celery together in a large bowl. Pour Italian-style dressing over the pasta mixture; toss to coat. Chill salad 20 minutes before serving.
