Warm tortilla in microwave on high until soft, about 20 seconds. Stir together mayonnaise and mustard in a small bowl. Spread mayonnaise mixture in the center of the tortilla to within 1 inch of edges. Place Montreal smoked meat along the center of the tortilla, 2 inches from top and bottom and 4 inches from sides. Sprinkle Mexican cheese blend over meat. Fold in bottom and top of tortilla, then fold in sides. Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat; cook wrap, seam side down, until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Press wrap with a spatula to flatten while cooking. Remove from pan and cut in half.
