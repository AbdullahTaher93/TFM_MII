For garlic croutons, in a medium skillet over medium heat cook garlic in the 2 tablespoons olive oil or salad oil just until golden. Add cubed French bread, stirring to coat evenly. Transfer bread cubes to a shallow baking pan. Bake in a 300 degree F oven for 10 minutes. Stir. Bake about 5 minutes more or until the cubes are dry and crisp. For dressing, in a blender container combine the 1/4 cup salad oil, egg product, vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, anchovy paste, and Worcestershire sauce. Cover and blend until smooth. In a large salad bowl combine romaine, chicken, green onions, Parmesan cheese, and garlic croutons. Pour the dressing over the salad. Toss gently and serve immediately. Pass coarsely ground pepper.
