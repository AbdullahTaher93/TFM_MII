Coat the beef with flour. Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook in 2 batches until it's well browned, stirring often. Stir the beef, consomme, salsa, onion, beans, corn, chili powder, cumin and garlic powder in a 3 1/2-quart slow cooker. Cover and cook on LOW for 8 to 9 hours* or until the beef is fork-tender.
