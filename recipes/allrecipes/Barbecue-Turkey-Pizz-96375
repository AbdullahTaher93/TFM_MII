Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. Slice turkey into 1/4-inch-thick strips. Bring 4 cups water to a boil in large saucepan over high heat. Stir in turkey; cover and remove from heat. Let stand 3 to 4 minutes or until turkey is no longer pink in center. Drain; toss with 2 tablespoons barbecue sauce and set aside. Brush oil evenly over prepared crust. Spread remaining 1/4 cup barbecue sauce over crust, leaving 1-inch border. Arrange onion slices over sauce. Top with turkey, bell pepper and cheese. Bake 10 minutes or until crust is dark golden brown. Sprinkle with cilantro and cut into 8 wedges.
