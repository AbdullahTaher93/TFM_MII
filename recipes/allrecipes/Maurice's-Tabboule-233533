Place the bulgur in a large bowl and cover with water by 3 inches; soak for 45 minutes. Drain and squeeze to remove excess water. Mix cucumbers, tomatoes, parsley, green onions, yellow onions, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and ground black pepper together in a bowl. Stir bulgur into cucumber mixture; toss. Refrigerate tabbouleh at least 5 hours before serving.
