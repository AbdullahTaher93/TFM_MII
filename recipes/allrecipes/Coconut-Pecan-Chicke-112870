Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Put yogurt in a small bowl, and set aside. In a shallow pie plate, combine coconut, panko and pecans. Dip chicken strips in yogurt to cover, then roll in panko mixture. Place strips on an oil-sprayed baking sheet. Spray top of chicken. Bake 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350, and bake 15 more minutes. Check that coating browns but does not burn. If desired, broil 2 minutes for an even crunchier top.
