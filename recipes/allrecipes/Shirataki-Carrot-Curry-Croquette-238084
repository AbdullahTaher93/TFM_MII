Wrap a paper towel around the grated carrots and place in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until tender, about 1 minute. Cool carrots to room temperature and squeeze out as much juice as possible. Rinse and thoroughly dry the shirataki noodles. Blend in a food processor until the consistency of small grains of rice is reached; transfer to a bowl. Mix carrots, egg whites, chives, cilantro, curry powder, onion flakes, garlic powder, and salt with the ground noodles until evenly combined. Coat a skillet with cooking spray and place skillet over high heat. Drop a heaping spoonful of the noodle mixture into the skillet and gently flatten with a metal spatula. Cook until lightly browned, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining noodle mixture.
