Coat a large skillet with nonstick cooking spray. Place over medium heat and add the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the onion, two-thirds of the garlic, and bay leaf. Cook, stirring, for 6 to 7 minutes, until the onion begins to soften and become translucent. Reduce the heat to medium and add the tomatoes and sprig of basil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce starts to thicken, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer on low heat while you prepare the broccoli and chicken. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Cover a large baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper. Sprinkle the remaining garlic over the broccoli, and season with salt and pepper. Wrap the broccoli tightly in aluminum foil. Set aside. Place the flour on a piece of waxed paper or aluminum foil. In a shallow bowl, beat the egg whites. On another piece of waxed paper or aluminum foil, mix the bread crumbs with the oregano, rosemary, 2 tablespoons Parmesan, and season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Sprinkle both sides of the chicken cutlets with salt and pepper. Lightly dredge the cutlets in the flour, then dip in the egg whites, shaking off any excess egg, then dredge in the bread crumb mixture. Coat both sides of each cutlet with nonstick cooking spray and place on the prepared baking sheet. Bake the chicken and foil packet of broccoli until the cutlets are golden and the broccoli is tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the broccoli and chicken from the oven. Preheat the broiler. Sprinkle the cutlet with the mozzarella and remaining 1 tablespoon Parmesan. Place under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes, until the cheese is golden. (Watch carefully -- they can burn easily!) Transfer the chicken and broccoli to a platter. Remove the bay leaf from the tomato sauce and ladle the sauce around the chicken. Sprinkle with the torn basil and serve immediately.
