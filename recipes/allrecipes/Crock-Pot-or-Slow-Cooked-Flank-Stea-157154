Season the flank steak with salt and pepper and place into a slow cooker. Add the carrot and onion; season with thyme and bay. Pour in the water. Cook on High for 4 hours; turn the steak over and press down into the liquid. Continue cooking until a fork easily passes through the meat, about 4 hours more.
