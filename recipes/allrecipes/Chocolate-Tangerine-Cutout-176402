Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Melt 1/4 cup butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in 30-second intervals until melted. Add cocoa powder and tangerine oil; mix until smooth and cool. Cream together remaining 1 cup butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add cocoa mixture; mix well. Add egg yolks, vanilla and zest until combined. Gradually add flour, scraping down sides of bowl, as necessary, until combined. Divide dough in two and place each piece on large sheet of plastic wrap. Flatten into 1/2-inch thick discs, wrap and refrigerate until firm enough to roll out, about 30 to 45 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to 1/4-inch thickness and cut into desired shapes. Place shapes on parchment-lined baking sheets; bake 10 to 12 minutes until firm and edges are beginning to brown. Remove to a cooling rack; cool completely. Meanwhile, in bowl of electric mixer, on low speed beat together powdered sugar, egg white powder, juices, zest and tangerine oil until moistened. Beat 2 to 3 minutes more on high speed. Adjust with more juice or powdered sugar to desired consistency; add food coloring, if desired. Frost cookies and decorate with sugars, as desired. When frosting is set, store cookies at room temperature in an airtight container, separating layers with wax paper for up to 1 week.
