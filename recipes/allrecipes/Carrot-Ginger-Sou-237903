Place baby carrots in a large pot with enough water to cover by several inches; bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 10 minutes; drain and return carrots to the pot. Pour chicken stock, 2 cups water, and coconut milk over the carrots; add onion, ginger, sea salt, and black pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer for 45 minutes. Pour soup into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth and return to the pot. Stir cilantro through the soup; season with salt and pepper.
