Preheat an oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Melt the butter with the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pan fry the chicken breasts until golden brown on both sides, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Place 2 ounces of mozzarella cheese on each chicken breast, then sprinkle parsley and capers on top. Reduce heat to medium, cover pan, and allow cheese to melt, about 3 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a large baking dish, and cover with aluminum foil. Keep the chicken warm in the preheated oven while you finish the sauce. Whisk together the cornstarch and water in a small bowl; set aside. Cook and stir the garlic over medium-low heat in the same skillet used to cook the chicken until fragrant, scraping up any bits of chicken and cheese, about 1 minute. Pour in the white Zinfandel wine, and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the heavy cream and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly, until the sauce begins to thicken. Gradually stir the cornstarch mixture into the cream sauce until thickened. Season with salt and black pepper. To serve, pour the cream sauce over the chicken.
