Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Cook turkey, butter and poultry seasoning in 10-inch skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until turkey is no longer pink; drain. Split each pita bread around edge with knife to make 2 rounds. Line bottom and about halfway up sides of ungreased square pan, 9x9x2 inches, with pita breads (they will overlap slightly in middle). Layer turkey, tomato and celery on pitas. Mix remaining ingredients except paprika; spoon over top. Sprinkle with paprika. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until topping is light brown.
