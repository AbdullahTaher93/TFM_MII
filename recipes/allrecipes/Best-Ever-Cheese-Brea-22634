Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice the French baguette in half lengthwise. In a medium bowl, mix the Monterey Jack cheese, Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise and chopped green onions. Spread the mixture evenly over the bread halves. Bake in the preheated oven 15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.
