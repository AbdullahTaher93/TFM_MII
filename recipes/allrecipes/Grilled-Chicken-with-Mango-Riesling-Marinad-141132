Place mango, garlic, water, lemon juice, olive oil, and Riesling into a blender. Season with thyme, oregano, cilantro, and onion powder. Blend until smooth. Pour 2/3 of the marinade into a resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken breasts, seal, and mix until chicken is coated. Place in the refrigerator to marinate 5 to 6 hours. Store the remaining marinade in a sealed container. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Remove chicken breasts from marinade, shake off excess, and discard remaining marinade. Grill chicken until no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes per side. Brush chicken with the reserved marinade during the final 5 minutes of cooking.
