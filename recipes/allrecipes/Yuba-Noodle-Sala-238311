Whisk vegetable oil, vinegar, peanut butter, honey, ginger, chili sauce, soy sauce, and sesame oil together in a bowl until dressing is smooth and creamy. Toss yuba strips, cilantro, carrots, cabbage, and green onions together in a bowl. Pour about 1/2 of the dressing over the salad and stir to coat. Stir remaining dressing into salad until salad is dressed to your liking; top with black sesame seeds.
