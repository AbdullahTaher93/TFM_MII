Melt butter or margarine in a large skillet. Add the oil and ham and saute lightly. Add the cooked spaghetti, bacon, cheese, garlic, parsley, salt and pepper. Stir well. Turn off the heat and pour beaten eggs over all. Toss to coat evenly, then add the olives and pimentos and toss again. Serve at once.
