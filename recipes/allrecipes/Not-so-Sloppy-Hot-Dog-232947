Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add celery and onion; cover skillet and cook until celery and onion are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir tomato soup, ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce into ground beef mixture; season with taco seasoning, garlic powder, and salt. Simmer mixture, stirring frequently, until flavors have blended, 15 to 20 minutes. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil; boil hot dogs in the boiling water until cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove hot dogs from water using thongs. Place each hot dog into a toasted bun; top each hot dog with ground beef mixture.
