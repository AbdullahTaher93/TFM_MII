Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat 2 baking sheets with cooking spray. Finely chop the almonds in a food processor or by hand. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Place the egg whites, vanilla extract, cream of tartar, and salt in a large bowl. With an electric mixer on high speed, beat until the whites are frothy. Gradually add the sugar, beating until stiff glossy peaks form. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in the nuts and coffee granules just until blended. Drop the batter by rounded teaspoons onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Bake for 20 minutes, or until lightly browned. Place the cookies on racks and let cool completely. Store in an airtight container.
