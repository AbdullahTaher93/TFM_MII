Melt honey-flavored butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; saute onion in butter until golden and glazed, 5 to 7 minutes. Add Brussels sprouts to the skillet; season with salt and pepper. Saute sprouts until crisp-tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove skillet from heat, drizzle wine over the sprouts, and toss to coat.
