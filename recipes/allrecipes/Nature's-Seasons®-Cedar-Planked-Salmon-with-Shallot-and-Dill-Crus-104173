Season salmon fillets with 1 tablespoon of Morton(R) Nature's Seasons(R) Seasoning Blend, gently pressing the spices to adhere; set aside. In a bowl combine honey, dill, shallot, lemon juice and the remaining teaspoon of Morton(R) Nature's Seasons(R) Seasoning Blend. Spread tops of salmon fillets evenly with honey dill shallot mixture. Preheat grill to high (about 500 degrees F). Place plank in the barbecue and bake for 2 to 3 minutes until the wood begins to crackle and smoke. Carefully open lid and place salmon fillets on to plank. Close lid and bake for 15 to 18 minutes until cooked to medium. (An instant read thermometer should read 145 degrees F). The salmon does not need to be turned over. Carefully remove plank from grill and transfer salmon to a serving platter. Garnish with wedges of lemon and serve.
