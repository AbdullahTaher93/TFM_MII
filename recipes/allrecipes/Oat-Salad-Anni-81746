In a sauce pan, bring the water to a boil. Add the oats, chili powder, garlic powder, lemon pepper and salt. Bring back to a boil then reduce heat to a simmer. Cook for 20 minutes stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, dice the celery and cucumber and mince the scallion and bell pepper. Toss in a bowl with the lemon juice and olive oil. Let marinate while the oats cook. When the oats are done, drain in a colander and rinse quickly with cool water to wash away a bit of starch but not so much that you wash way nutrients and flavor. Fluff with a fork a few times as it cools. Let cool for about 5 minutes. Add the oats to the veggies and toss well. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
