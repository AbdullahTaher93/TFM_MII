Cook pasta according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a blender or food processor, place the basil, parsley, Parmesan cheese, salt, garlic and nutmeg. Cover and process on low for 1 minute or until very finely chopped. While processing, gradually add the oil in a steady stream. Drain pasta; top with the pesto and toss to coat.
