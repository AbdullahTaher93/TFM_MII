Cook the beef and garlic in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until the beef is well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat. Stir the beef mixture, tomatoes, 1/2 can soup and Worcestershire in a 3-quart shallow baking dish. Heat the remaining soup, water and butter in a 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat to a boil. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Stir in the milk. Stir in the potatoes. Spoon the potatoes over the beef mixture. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are lightly browned.
