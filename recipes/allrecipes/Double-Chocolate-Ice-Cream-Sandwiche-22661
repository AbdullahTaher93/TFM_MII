Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Beat shortening, granulated sugar, brown sugar, eggs and vanilla in large bowl until creamy. Stir together flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt; add to egg mixture. Stir in chocolate chips. Drop by heaping tablespoons onto ungreased cookie sheet. Flatten each with palm of hand or bottom of glass into a 3-inch circle about 1/4-inch thick. (Add 2 tablespoons flour if dough is too soft to handle.) Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until almost set. Cool 1 minute; remove from cookie sheet to wire rack. Cool completely. Place scoop of slightly softened ice cream on flat side of one cookie; spread evenly. Top with second cookie, pressing lightly. Wrap in foil; immediately place in freezer. Freeze until firm.
