Whisk egg whites, water, coconut flour, and baking powder together in a large mixing bowl until smooth. Melt 1 to 2 teaspoons coconut oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat, swirling pan to coat surface to the edges. Pour about 3 tablespoons batter into the hot skillet, tilting pan to spread batter around. Cook until bottom side is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes; flip and continue cooking until other side is also browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with remaining coconut oil and batter.
