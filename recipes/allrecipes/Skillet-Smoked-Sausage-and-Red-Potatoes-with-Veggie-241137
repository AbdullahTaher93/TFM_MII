Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet. Add potatoes; cook and stir to coat potatoes with oil. Cover and cook for 15 minutes, turning occasionally. Add sausage, onion, zucchini, yellow squash, and green chili. Season with onion powder, paprika, parsley, and salt. Cover and cook until veggies are beginning to soften or to taste, about 10 minutes.
