In a 2- to 3-quart pan over high heat, bring 4 cups water and 1/4 cup of the peanut sauce to a boil. Stir in rice and carrots. Cover, remove from heat, and let stand until liquid is absorbed, 5 to 7 minutes. Meanwhile, in a microwave-safe bowl, mix steak strips with remaining 6 tablespoons peanut sauce. Microwave on Medium heat 2 minutes or until warm. Spoon rice into bowls; top equally with sauced beef strips and green onions. Add more peanut sauce to taste, if desired.
