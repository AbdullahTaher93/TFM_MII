In saucepan, combine egg yolks, sour cream, granulated sugar, flour, vanilla and salt. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened, about 5 minutes. Pour into baked pie shell; set aside. In large mixing bowl, immediately beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually add brown sugar; continue to beat until stiff. While filling is still warm, spread egg white topping over filling. Sprinkle with chopped pecans. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until golden.
