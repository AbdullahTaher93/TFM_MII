Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool. Stir eggs, celery, and peas together in a large bowl. Whisk low fat mayonnaise, yellow mustard, sugar, vinegar, celery seed, and salt in a separate bowl, dissolving the sugar. Pour dressing over vegetables and stir in macaroni until thoroughly coated with dressing. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.
