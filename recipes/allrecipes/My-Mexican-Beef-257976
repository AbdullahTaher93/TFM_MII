Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook until tender, about 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes, green chile peppers, and chipotle peppers. Bring to a simmer. Stir shaved steak, cumin, coriander, salt, pepper, and cinnamon stick into the saucepan. Bring back to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat and cover; cook, stirring occasionally, until steak is very tender, about 1 hour. Discard cinnamon stick and stir cilantro into the saucepan.
