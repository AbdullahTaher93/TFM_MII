In Ziploc(R) bag, combine 3/4 cup Marinade and shrimp. Marinate in refrigerator for 30 minutes. Remove shrimp; discard used marinade. On skewers, alternate shrimp with pineapple, onions and peppers. Grill kabobs over medium heat, brushing with remaining Marinade, until shrimp just turn pink, about 4 minutes per side.
