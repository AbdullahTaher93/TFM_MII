Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken in a saucepan, and add just enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook for about 10 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through. Drain, and transfer to a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish. Stir in the cream of chicken soup, onion, broccoli, water chestnuts, mayonnaise, and half of the communion wafers. Spread evenly in the dish, and sprinkle the remaining wafer crumbs over the top. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until browned and bubbly.
