WRAP onion wedges with bacon; secure with long wooden picks. Place in a large shallow dish. COMBINE sugar, vinegar, and molasses; drizzle over onion wedges. Cover and chill 1 hour. REMOVE onion wedges from marinade, reserving marinade. GRILL, covered with grill lid, over medium-high heat (350 degrees to 400 degrees) 20 minutes or until onion wedges are crisp-tender, turning and basting occasionally with reserved marinade.
