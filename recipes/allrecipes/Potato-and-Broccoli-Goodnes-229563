Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 12 to 15 minutes. Drain and cut into cubes. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir broccoli in the hot oil until tender, about 4 minutes. Stir in onion; cook until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir cubed potatoes into broccoli mixture; cook and mash until potatoes begin to soften and resemble mashed potatoes, about 5 minutes. Season with cumin, salt, and black pepper. Spread mashed potato-broccoli mixture atop French bread slices.
