Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread bread cubes into the prepared baking dish. Mix raisins, maple-flavored extract, and rum-flavored extract together in a bowl; pour in enough water to almost cover raisins. Heat raisin mixture in microwave until raisins are plump, about 1 1/2 minutes; set aside to cool slightly. Beat milk, pumpkin puree, sweetened condensed milk, eggs, raisin mixture, brown sugar, butter, molasses, vanilla extract, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, allspice, and ginger together in a large bowl until smooth; pour over bread. Set mixture aside until bread has absorbed the liquid, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.
