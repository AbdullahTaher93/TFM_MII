In a small bowl, blend the oil, vinegar, wine, garlic, shallots, tarragon, salt and pepper. Place lamb chops in a large resealable plastic bag. Pour in marinade, seal and refrigerate for 1 hour. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate. Place lamb chops on the grill; cook until grill marks form, about 5-6 minutes per side for medium, or to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Discard remaining marinade. Remove from grill, let rest 5 minutes and serve.
