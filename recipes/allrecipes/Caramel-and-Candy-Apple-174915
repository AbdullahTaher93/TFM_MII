Insert wooden stick into stem end of each apple. Butter five (4-inch) squares parchment or waxed paper and place, buttered sides up, on baking sheet. Heat caramels and water in medium saucepan over medium low heat, stirring constantly, until caramels are completely melted. Dip apples into caramel until evenly coated, spooning caramel over apples if needed. Allow excess caramel to drip off; scrape bottoms of apples with spatula. Hold apple over dish of topping and spoon topping over caramel until coated; repeat. Place on parchment. Refrigerate 5 minutes or until ready to serve. Let stand 15 minutes before serving if chilled.
