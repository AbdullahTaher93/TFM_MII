Place balsamic vinegar, oil, rosemary, salt, pepper, garlic and pork in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours to marinate. To prepare coulis, puree plums in a blender or food processor. Press mixture through a fine mesh sieve to remove all skins and solids. Place plum puree in a small saucepan with wine and sugar; simmer over low heat for 10 minutes or until slightly thickened, then stir in rosemary. Let cool. Grill pork over medium heat until it reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees F. Let rest for 5 minutes then cut into 1/4-inch thick diagonal slices. Pour plum coulis on a platter and top with sliced pork. Garnish with additional fresh rosemary and grilled plum slices, if desired.
