Heat oil in a 6-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add ground beef and cook until crumbly and no longer pink. Stir in tomatoes, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, cayenne pepper and salt. Simmer for 2 minutes, stirring often. Stir in peanut butter and brown sugar until combined. Add tomato sauce; simmer for 5 minutes. Add beans. Heat an additional 3-4 minutes, until heated through. Spoon into bowls and top with cilantro and chips.
