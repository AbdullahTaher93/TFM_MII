Heat oil in a wide nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until soft and lightly browned (about 5 minutes). Stir in garlic, then remove pan from heat and transfer onion mixture to a small bowl. While onion is cooking, in another bowl combine tuna, celery, mayonnaise, and mustard; mix lightly to combine well. Spread 4 slices of the bread equally with tuna mixture; top each with a fourth of the onions, a fourth of the cheese, and remaining bread slices. Toast sandwiches in same frying pan over medium heat, turning once, until toasted on both sides (6 to 8 minutes total). Serve hot.
