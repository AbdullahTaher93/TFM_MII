In a bowl, combine the first 10 ingredients; mix well. Pour half of the marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add tenderloins. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 8 hours, turning occasionally. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade. Drain and discard marinade from meat. Grill, uncovered, over indirect medium-hot heat for 8-10 minutes on each side, basting with reserved marinade, until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) and juices run clear. Let stand for 5 minutes. Serve with rice.
