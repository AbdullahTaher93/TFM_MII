Heat canola oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat, and pan-fry the chicken drumsticks and thighs until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Remove the chicken pieces, and set aside. Stir onion and garlic into the hot skillet, and cook and stir until the vegetables are browned, about 8 minutes. Pour in apple cider vinegar, soy sauce, and water; stir in bay leaves, peppercorns, and the cinnamon stick. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, scraping up and dissolving any browned flavor bits from the bottom of the pan. Return chicken pieces and any juice that has formed to the pan. Cover, reduce heat to a simmer, and simmer until the chicken is thoroughly cooked, about 45 minutes.
