Preheat oven to 385 degrees F (196 degrees C). Place garlic cloves on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Roast in the preheated oven until golden and soft, stirring once halfway through, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven and smash each clove with a rolling pin, meat tenderizer, or bottom of a glass. Chop smashed garlic finely. Combine garlic, 1 cup blue cheese crumbles, sour cream, mayonnaise, and lemon juice in a bowl; mix thoroughly. Fold in remaining blue cheese crumbles gently.
