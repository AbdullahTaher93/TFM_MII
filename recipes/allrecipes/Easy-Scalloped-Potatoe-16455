Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a casserole dish. Layer the bottom the casserole dish with potatoes. Cover the potatoes with a layer of cheese, followed by a light dusting of flour, salt and pepper. Repeat the layering process until all of the ingredients are used up. Pour milk over the entire casserole. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until the potatoes are tender, about 45 minutes. Remove foil and return to oven; bake until cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown.
