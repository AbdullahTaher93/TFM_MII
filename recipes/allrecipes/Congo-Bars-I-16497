Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10x15 inch jellyroll pan. Stir together the flour and brown sugar, set aside. Stir together the melted butter and eggs until well blended; stir into the flour mixture. Fold in the chocolate chips. Spread batter evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Let cool for 10 minutes, then cut into bars while still slightly warm.
