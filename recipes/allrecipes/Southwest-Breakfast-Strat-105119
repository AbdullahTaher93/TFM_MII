Lightly coat a 2-quart rectangular baking dish with cooking spray. Cover the bottom of the prepared baking dish with French bread slices, cutting to fit. In a medium bowl, combine egg product, chili peppers, and black pepper. Pour egg mixture evenly over bread. Sprinkle with Canadian-style bacon or ham. Top with tomato slices and cheese. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. Bake, uncovered, in a 350 degrees F oven about 25 minutes or until a knife inserted near center comes out clean. Before serving, sprinkle with cilantro.
