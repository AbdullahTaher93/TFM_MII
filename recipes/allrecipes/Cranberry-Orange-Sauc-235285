Mix cranberries, brown sugar, orange zest, orange juice, and cinnamon sticks together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until cranberries pop and sauce is thickened, about 15 minutes. Transfer sauce to a bowl and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour. Remove cinnamon stick from sauce and serve at room temperature.
