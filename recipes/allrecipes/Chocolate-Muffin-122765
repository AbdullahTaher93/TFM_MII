In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder and baking soda. In another bowl, whisk the applesauce, milk, egg substitute and vanilla until smooth. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Coat muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray; fill three-fourths full with batter. Sprinkle with almonds. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until muffins test done. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pan to a wire rack.
