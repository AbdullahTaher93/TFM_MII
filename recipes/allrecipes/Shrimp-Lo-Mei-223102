Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Whisk chicken broth, sugar, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, and cornstarch in a bowl. Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Cook and stir shrimp and garlic in hot oil until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add prepared sauce and chopped green onions to the shrimp mixture; cook until the sauce thickens, 2 to 3 minutes. Toss cooked spaghetti with the mixture to coat the noodles in sauce. Serve immediately.
