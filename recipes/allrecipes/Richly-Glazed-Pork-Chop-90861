Sprinkle chops generously with pepper; set aside. In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add chops and cook, turning as needed, until well browned on both sides (8 to 10 minutes total). Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine preserves and mustard; spoon evenly over browned chops. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and cook until chops are still moist and look faintly pink to white in center; cut to test (8 to 10 minutes). With a slotted spoon, transfer chops to a warm platter and keep warm. Add vinegar to pan, increase heat to high, and cook, stirring, to loosen pan drippings. Boil sauce until reduced to about 1/4 cup (2 to 3 minutes). Spoon sauce over chops.
