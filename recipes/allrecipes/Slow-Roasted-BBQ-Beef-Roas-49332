Prepare an outdoor rotisserie grill for medium heat. Cut slits on all sides of the roast, and insert garlic slices. In a small bowl, mix paprika, salt, pepper, rosemary, and thyme. Rub the mixture over the roast. Place roast on the prepared rotisserie, and cook 2 to 5 hours, to a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Allow to rest about 20 minutes before slicing.
