Cut up tomatoes into very small pieces and place in a bowl. Mince garlic very fine and add to the tomatoes. Finely dice onion and add it to the mixture. Smash the olives and then chop them into fine pieces, add to mixture in the bowl. Roll your basil leaves together and cut into 1/8-inch strips, then cut across them until they are in fine short strips. Add salt and cracked black pepper, use as much or as little as you like. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and 1/2 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar. (You can use extra oil and vinegar if desired, but try to keep it at a 2:1 ratio.) Stir and let the mixture sit at room temperature for two hours, stirring about every half-hour. Serve over toasted Italian bread or Italian crackers
