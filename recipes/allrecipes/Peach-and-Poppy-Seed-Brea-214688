Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare 2 9x5-inch bread pans with cooking spray. Stir the applesauce, sugar, honey and eggs together in a bowl; fold the chopped peaches into the applesauce mixture. Add the baking soda, vanilla extract, almond extract, poppy seeds, and flour; stir to combine into a batter. Pour about half of the batter into each of the prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
