In a mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the sour cream and vanilla; mix well. Combine flour, baking soda and salt; add to the creamed mixture and mix well. Spread half into a greased 9-in. square baking pan. Combine topping ingredients; sprinkle half over batter. Carefully spread remaining batter on top; sprinkle with remaining topping. Gently swirl topping through batter with a knife. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool.
