Cover raisins with warm water in small bowl and soak at least 30 minutes or up to overnight. Whisk together yogurt, sugar, salt, cayenne (to taste), and 1/2 tablespoon of the mint in medium bowl. Add a few teaspoons of water if too thick. Drain raisins and add to yogurt dressing along with carrots and walnuts. Stir well and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon mint.
