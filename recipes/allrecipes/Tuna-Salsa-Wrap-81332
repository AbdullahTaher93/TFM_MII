Warm each tortilla according to the package instructions. In a small bowl, combine the first five recipe ingredients in the order given, mixing well to create a 'tuna salsa' mix. Lay each one of the warmed tortillas on a cutting board. On the center of each tortilla, place an equal portion of the shredded lettuce, tuna mixture and top each with a pinch of shredded Cheddar cheese. Fold the long end of the tortilla over ingredients and roll tightly.
