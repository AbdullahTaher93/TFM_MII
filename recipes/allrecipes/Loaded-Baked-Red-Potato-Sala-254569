Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and cool until easily handled, about 10 minutes. Cut into cubes and place in a large bowl. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble into small pieces. Mix bacon, sour cream, yogurt, Cheddar cheese, chives, ranch dressing mix, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Pour over potatoes and toss gently to coat. Refrigerate potato mixture until chilled, at least 1 hour.
