Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir oats, almonds, coconut, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, pecans, and salt, together in a large bowl. Stir butter and honey together in a small saucepan over low heat until the butter is fully melted. Stir vanilla extract into the melted butter. Pour butter mixture over oats mixture; stir until evenly coated. Spread the mixture onto 2 large baking sheets into single, even layers. Bake in preheated oven 10 minutes. Remove from oven and gently turn the granola. Continue baking until golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Set granola aside to cool to room temperature; transfer to a large bowl. Gently fold cranberries into the granola.
