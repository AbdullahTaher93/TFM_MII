Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place beans in a Dutch oven or large casserole dish. Mix in bacon, brown sugar, and onion; season with salt and pepper. Add just enough water to barely cover the beans. Cover, and bake for 6 to 8 hours in the preheated oven. Add more water if necessary.
