Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Fill a pot with water and add the salt; bring to a boil. Cook potatoes in the boiling water until tender, about 12 minutes. Transfer potatoes to a bowl and mash until chunky. Mix peas, pepper, and coriander into potatoes. Press pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish; fill with potato mixture. Sprinkle mint over filling. Carefully place second pie crust over the filling and pinch both crusts together to seal. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
