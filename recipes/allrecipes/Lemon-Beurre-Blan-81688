In a sauce pan over medium-high heat, boil the wine, vinegar and shallots until it reduces to about 2-3 Tbsps (15 or 20 minutes). Set heat to lowest setting and whisk in the cream. Then add about 3 Tbsps of the butter at a time, whisking thoroughly (do not let it boil). Whisk in the lemon juice and serve immediately.
