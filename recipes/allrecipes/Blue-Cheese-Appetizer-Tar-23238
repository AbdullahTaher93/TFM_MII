Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Place flour in large bowl; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Mix in water with fork until flour is just moistened. Shape into a ball. Roll out pastry on lightly floured surface into 12-inch circle. Place in 9 or 10-inch tart pan with removable bottom or pie pan. Press firmly on bottom and up sides of pan. Cut away excess pastry; prick all over with fork. Bake for 17 to 22 minutes or until very lightly browned. Meanwhile, combine cream cheese and blue cheese in large mixer bowl. Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until creamy (1 to 2 minutes). Continue beating, gradually adding whipping cream, egg and pepper until well mixed (1 to 2 minutes). Spread into baked pastry shell. Sprinkle with roasted red pepper, pine nuts and parsley. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until filling is set. Let stand 20 minutes before serving. Cut into wedges. Cover; store refrigerated.
