In a saucepan, combine orange juice and cranberries; bring to a boil. Reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until cranberries are softened; drain. In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, confectioners' sugar and lemon extract until smooth. Fold in cranberry mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in egg and sweet potatoes. Combine the dry ingredients; gradually add to creamed mixture. Fold in cranberries and nuts. Transfer to a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-65 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cover loosely with foil if the top browns too quickly. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve with the cream cheese spread.
