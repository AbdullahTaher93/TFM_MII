Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add onions and garlic and cook until softened, about 8 minutes. Stir in chiles, cinnamon, cumin, basil, peanuts, cheese, and chicken. Mix well, cover and simmer over low heat until chicken is cooked through and seasonings have blended, 25 to 30 minutes. Just before serving, stir in yogurt and cook for an additional 3 minutes.
