Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Tear off four 14-inch pieces of foil and coat with cooking spray. Place a salmon fillet in the center of each piece. In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce and sherry. Spoon 1 tablespoon over each fillet. Crimp the foil and seal into packets. Reserve the remaining soy sauce mixture. Place the packets on a baking sheet and bake for 12 minutes, or until the salmon is just opaque in the thickest part. Meanwhile, heat the canola oil in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, scallions, and ginger and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes, or until the scallions have wilted. Add the sesame oil and the remaining soy sauce mixture and bring just to a boil. Stir in the cilantro. Divide the hot noodles among 4 plates. Open the packets and place the salmon and juices over the noodles. Top with the scallion mixture.
