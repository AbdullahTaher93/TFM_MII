In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in egg and vanilla. Gradually add flour and mix well. Divide dough in three portions. Stir chocolate into one portion; mix well. Add pecans and green food coloring to the second portion. Add cherries, almond extract and red food coloring to the third. Roll each portion between two pieces of waxed paper into an 8-in. x 6-in. rectangle. Remove waxed paper. Place chocolate rectangle on a piece of plastic wrap. Top with the green and pink rectangles; press together lightly. Wrap with plastic wrap and chill overnight. Cut chilled dough in half lengthwise. Return one rectangle to the refrigerator. Cut remaining rectangle into 1/8-in. slices. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 5-7 minutes or until set. Cool for 2 minutes before removing to wire racks. Repeat with remaining dough.
