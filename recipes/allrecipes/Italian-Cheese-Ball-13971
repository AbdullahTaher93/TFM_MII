In a large bowl, mix together pecans, bread crumbs, cheese, eggs, and onion. Shape into golf ball size balls. Heat oil in an electric deep fryer or heavy saucepan to 365 degrees F ( 170 degrees C). Add cheese balls to hot oil, and fry until brown. Fry in batches to maintain oil temperature. Transfer to an 8 inch square baking pan. In a medium bowl, mix together tomato juice, tomato soup, and cumin. Cover cheese balls with sauce. Sprinkle additional cheese on top, if desired. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15 minutes.
