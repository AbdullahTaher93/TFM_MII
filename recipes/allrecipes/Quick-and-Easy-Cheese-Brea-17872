Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, mix together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cheese. In another large bowl, beat together egg, milk and oil. Stir the flour/cheese mixture into the egg mixture, stirring until just moistened. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of loaf comes out clean.
