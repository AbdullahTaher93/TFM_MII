Place steak on broiler pan rack; broil for 6-8 minutes on each side. Meanwhile, in a saucepan or microwave-safe bowl, combine remaining ingredients. Cook until preserves are melted. Set aside 1/2 cup; brush remaining sauce over steak. Broil 2-3 minutes longer or until meat reaches desired doneness (for rare, a meat thermometer should read 140 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F). Slice meat on the diagonal; serve with reserved apricot sauce.
