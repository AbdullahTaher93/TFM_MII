In a mixing bowl, cream butter and brown sugar. Beat in egg and vanilla. Combine the flour, oats, salt and baking powder; gradually add to creamed mixture. Stir in chopped pecans and miniature chocolate chips. In a saucepan, melt chocolate chips with milk; stir until smooth. Roll dough into 1-in. balls. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Using the end of a wooden spoon handle, make an indentation in the center of each ball. Fill with a rounded teaspoonful of melted chocolate; top with a pecan half. Bake at 350 degrees F for 14-16 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.
