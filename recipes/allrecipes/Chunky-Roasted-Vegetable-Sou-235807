Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large soup pot (4 quart); add the garlic and leeks and cook over medium-high heat until the leeks are very soft. Turn off the heat. Combine the salt, pepper, celery seed and oregano in a large bowl. Add the potatoes, carrots, broccoli, celery and onion and toss well. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of the oil to the mixture, tossing again to coat. Transfer the veggies to a baking sheet, keeping them in a single layer. Roast them for about 30 minutes, turning them once or twice. Add the roasted vegetables to the soup pot with the tomato juice and wine. Tie the parsley and thyme together with kitchen string and add to the pot. Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat to simmer and cook for 25 minutes. Remove the parsley and thyme and discard them. Stir in the lemon juice. Taste and correct the seasoning, adding more salt if desired. Serve piping hot with crusty bread and a salad.
