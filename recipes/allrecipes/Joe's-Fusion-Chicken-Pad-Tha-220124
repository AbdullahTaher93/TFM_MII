Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season chicken with salt and black pepper; set aside. Whisk sugar, cayenne pepper, white wine vinegar, fish sauce, and peanut butter together in a bowl. Coat the inside of a large skillet or wok with olive oil and place over high heat. Cook and stir chicken in the hot oil just until the meat is white outside but still pink inside, about 3 minutes. Remove chicken and set aside in a bowl. Lower the heat under the skillet to medium-low. Cook and stir garlic in the skillet until it becomes translucent, 1 to 2 minutes. Cook and stir eggs into garlic until loosely cooked, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour peanut sauce into the garlic and eggs, and stir to combine. Bring sauce to a simmer. Stir rice noodles into the boiling water. Cook until noodles are still slightly tough, about 5 minutes. Drain the noodles. Return chicken to the skillet with eggs and sauce. Simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, stirring frequently, 5 to 8 more minutes. Stir bean sprouts, rice noodles. and beef broth into the skillet. Bring to a simmer, and cook until noodles are tender and most of the broth has been absorbed, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with green onions to serve..
