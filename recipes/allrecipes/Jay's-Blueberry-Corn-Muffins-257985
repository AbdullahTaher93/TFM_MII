Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin. Mix cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir in buttermilk, butter, and egg. Fold blueberries into the batter. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin tin. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
