Cut bread in half horizontally, then cut each piece in half lengthwise to make 4 long pieces of equal size. In a small bowl, beat together butter and pesto until smooth. Spread mixture equally on cut side of bread. Place bread pieces on a baking sheet, butter side up. Bake in a 450 degrees F oven until bread is lightly toasted and pesto butter is melted and bubbling, about 10 minutes. Serve hot or warm.
