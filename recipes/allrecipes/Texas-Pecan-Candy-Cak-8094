Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch tube pan with a removable bottom. Combine cherries, pineapple, and dates; sprinkle with flour, and toss to coat. Add pecans and coconut; mix thoroughly by tossing. Stir in the sweetened condensed milk, mixing well. Spoon into prepared pan, and smooth the top. Bake for 1 1/2 hours. Cool the cake in pan on a wire rack. When completely cool, remove from pan. Wrap in foil tightly. Refrigerate. Cut cake when cold.
