In a pan, simmer sun-dried tomatoes in 1 1/2 cups water until very soft; discard water. In a large pot, saute onion and green pepper in oil until softened. In a food processor or blender, combine sun-dried tomatoes and 1 bottle clam juice until smooth; add to pot. Stir in remaining clam juice, diced tomatoes, wine, garlic, herbs, bay leaves and olives. Simmer 20 minutes. Add beans, fish, fennel seeds, salt and pepper. Simmer until fish is done, about 10 minutes. Remove bay leaves. Ladle into bowls; sprinkle with cheese.
