Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Make the Almond Coconut Crust. You can use 1 fresh egg white instead of the powdered egg whites if you prefer. Press dough into your pan. (I prefer a tart pan with the removable bottom). Bake at 350 degrees F for about 8 minutes. Allow to cool before filling. Filling: Mix into the soften cream cheese the yogurt and Splenda. Then mix in the beaten eggs. Distribute the berries over the bottom of the pie crust, then pour the yogurt mixture over the berries. Bake for 40 minutes or until firm (no jiggle in the center when you shake it a bit) and the top is slightly brown. Let cool for at least 10 minutes. This can be served warm, at room temperature or chilled.
