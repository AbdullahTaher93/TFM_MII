Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Place squash halves cut side down in a large roasting pan. Add 1 cup water; cover with aluminum foil. Bake until translucent and flesh pulls away from skin, about 50 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes. Using a fork, separate flesh into strands. Discard skins. In a large bowl, toss together squash, butter, and herbs. Season with salt and pepper. Serve.
