Scoop the yolks out of eggs and discard or save for another use. Run egg whites under cool water to remove any remaining yolk. Arrange whites on a serving platter. Blend salmon, cottage cheese, chives, seafood seasoning, dill, and lemon juice in a food processor until just combined. Pour salmon filling into a plastic bag and snip off 1 corner. Pipe filling into each egg and sprinkle paprika over filling. Chill in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
