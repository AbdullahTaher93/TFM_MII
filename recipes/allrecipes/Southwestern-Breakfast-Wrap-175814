Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. With a pastry brush, lightly coat each tortilla on 1 side, using 1 tablespoon of the butter. Stack tortillas and wrap in paper towels. Cook stack in a microwave oven at full power (100%) until warm to touch, about 1 1/2 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk eggs to blend with 1/4 cup sour cream, bell pepper, chopped cilantro, cumin seeds, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the pepper. Lay flour tortillas on a counter in a single layer. Sprinkle each with about 1 tablespoon cheese. Pour remaining butter into a large frying pan on medium heat. Add eggs and stir gently with a wide spatula until softly set, about 3 minutes. Remove eggs from heat. Divide eggs evenly among tortillas, spooning onto a quarter section of each. Sprinkle evenly with remaining cheese. Fold each tortilla in half over egg, then fold again to make a triangle. With a wide spatula, transfer tortillas, filling side down, to a baking sheet (filled tortillas should be touching each other). Bake until cheese melts, 3 to 4 minutes. With a wide spatula, put 3 filled tortillas on each plate. Top each portion with about 2 tablespoons salsa and sour cream, and garnish with cilantro leaves. Add salt and additional salsa to taste.
