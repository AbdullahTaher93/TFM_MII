Combine the tuna with the mayonnaise in a bowl, and mix until well combined. Mix together the spinach, carrot, apple, mozzarella cheese, and blueberries in a bowl, and gently fold in the tuna salad, making sure not to crush the blueberries. Microwave the flour tortillas for about 10 seconds, until slightly warmed and pliable. Scoop about 1 1/2 cups of the spinach-tuna mixture into the center of each tortilla, fold up the bottom 2 inches to enclose the filling, wrap, and serve.
