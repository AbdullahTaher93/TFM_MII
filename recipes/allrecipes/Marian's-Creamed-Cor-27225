Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium low heat. Mix in sugar and stir until dissolved. Mix in corn and stir to coat. Stir in cream cheese and cook until melted and well blended. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish. Top with bread crumbs and dot with butter. Bake in the preheated oven 20 to 30 minutes, until lightly browned.
