Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a medium, heavy saucepan, combine the skim milk, low-fat milk, and chocolate. Warm over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the chocolate is melted and the milk is hot. (The mixture does not need to be completely smooth.) Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, cocoa powder, egg, egg whites, vanilla, and cinnamon. Gradually whisk in the hot milk mixture until smooth. Spread the bread cubes evenly in an 8- or 9-inch (20- or 23-cm) square baking dish and sprinkle with the currants. Pour the milk mixture over the bread cubes, moistening them well. With a spoon, press the bread down into the milk. Bake the pudding for 25 to 30 minutes, or until just set. Remove from the oven and transfer the baking dish to a rack to cool briefly. To serve, place the confectioners' sugar in a small strainer and dust over the warm pudding. Garnish with fresh raspberries or other fresh fruit, if desired.
