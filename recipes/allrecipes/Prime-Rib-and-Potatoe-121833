Combine the oil and garlic; rub evenly over roast. Place roast, fat side up, in a small roasting pan. Place a potato on each side of roast. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 2 to 2-1/2 hours until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well done, 170 degrees F). Let stand for 10 minutes before carving.
