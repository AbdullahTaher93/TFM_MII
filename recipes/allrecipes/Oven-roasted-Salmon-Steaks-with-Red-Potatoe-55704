Scrub potatoes and cut each in half. In a 9- by 13-inch pan, mix potatoes with 2 teaspoons oil, then turn potatoes cut side up. Bake in a 425 degree oven for 10 minutes. Turn potatoes cut side down and bake until barely tender when pierced, about 10 minutes longer. Meanwhile, with a vegetable peeler, pare peel (orange part only) from orange. Mince peel. In a small bowl, combine peel, remaining 2 teaspoons oil, oregano, cumin, chili powder, chopped cilantro, and pepper. Rinse salmon and pat dry. Rub seasoning mixture on cut sides of fish. Push potatoes to sides of pan. Set salmon steaks in a single layer in the center of the pan. Bake until salmon is opaque but still moist-looking in the center of the thickest part (cut to test), 8 to 10 minutes. As salmon bakes, use a small, sharp knife to cut membrane from orange; discard. Cut between membranes to release fruit segments; discard any seeds. Transfer salmon steaks to warm plates, and add equal portions of potatoes. Garnish with orange segments and cilantro sprigs. Add salt to taste.
