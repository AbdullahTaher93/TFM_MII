Place eggs in a large saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil; remove from heat, cover, and let sit until eggs are cooked through, about 10 minutes. Drain hot water; cover eggs with cold water. Peel eggs and place in a quart-size Mason jar. Combine soy sauce, water, sugar, minced onion, and sesame oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until sugar is dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes. Cool briefly, about 5 minutes. Pour over eggs in the jar. Refrigerate eggs until flavors are absorbed, at least 6 hours.
