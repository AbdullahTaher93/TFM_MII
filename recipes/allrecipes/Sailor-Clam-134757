Place clams and enough water just to cover them into a saucepan with a tight fitting lid. Cover tightly and bring to a boil over high heat; steam until the clams open, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain clams, reserving the water. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and onion, cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 3 minutes. Pour in white wine and increase heat to high. Season with saffron, red pepper flakes, and vegetable bouillon, then pour in the cooking liquid from the steamed clams, and bring to a boil. Stir together flour and water until dissolved. Pour into the boiling sauce and stir until thickened. Season to taste with salt if needed. Add the clams in their shells, and toss until coated with sauce. Sprinkle with chopped parsley to serve.
