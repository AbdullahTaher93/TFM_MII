Dredge chicken in flour; heat oil in a large skillet and brown, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. In a large saucepan combine the tomato sauce, corn and onion and bring to a boil. Stir in chili powder, garlic, red pepper flakes and salt. Add chicken and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 60 minutes, to allow flavors to blend and penetrate the chicken.
