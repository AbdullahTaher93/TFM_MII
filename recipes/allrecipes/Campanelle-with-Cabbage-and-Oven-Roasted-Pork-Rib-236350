Marinate pork ribs overnight with 3 of the minced garlic cloves, rosemary, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and black pepper, to taste. Place ribs in a shallow roasting pan, cover with aluminum foil, and bake in a 425 degrees F oven for 20 minutes; remove from oven, add wine, and bake uncovered for an additional 15 minutes. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook Campanelle according to package directions. Meanwhile, saute in a medium skillet the remaining garlic in 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat for 2 minutes, or until garlic turns slightly golden in color. Add cabbage, chicken broth, salt, and pepper to taste; simmer until the cabbage is tender and thoroughly cooked. Remove meat from the ribs and add to the sauce; simmer for 5 minutes. Drain Campanelle and toss with the sauce. Stir in butter and cheese and toss before serving.
