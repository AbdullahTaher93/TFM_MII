Place egg whites in a mixing bowl; let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Add cream of tartar and vanilla; beat on medium speed until foamy. Gradually beat in sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until soft peaks form. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; fold into egg white mixture. Set aside. In another large mixing bowl, beat egg yolks and water until thick and lemon-colored. Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt; gradually beat into egg yolk mixture. Beat in vanilla. Alternately spoon yellow batter and white batter into an ungreased 10-in. tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Immediately invert pan; cool completely. For frosting, combine sugar, flour and salt in a saucepan. Stir in pineapple juice until blended. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Cool. Fold in whipped topping. Remove cake from pan to a serving plate. Spread frosting over top and sides of cake. Store in the refrigerator.
