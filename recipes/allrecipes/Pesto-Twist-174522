Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place pastry sheets on lightly floured surface. Roll each sheet into 12-inch square. Spread pesto over one rolled pastry sheet. Sprinkle nuts and cheese evenly over pesto. Lay second sheet on top and press lightly. Cut into twelve 1-inch-wide strips. Twist each strip and place on baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes or until light golden brown.
