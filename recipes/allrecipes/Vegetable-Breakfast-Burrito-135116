In a 1-quart microwavable dish, stir the bell pepper and onion in the oil, until they're good and greasy. Nuke for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the vegetables soften. Stir in the tomatoes and mushrooms and nuke for 2 to 3 minutes, or until hot. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs and black pepper. Pour the eggs over the vegetables and mix it all up. Nuke for 2 to 4 minutes, stirring twice, until the eggs are almost set. Top with the cheese and nuke for 1 to 3 minutes, or until the cheese is melted. Microwave the tortillas for 10 to 20 seconds, until warm. Spoon some egg filling onto each tortilla, roll up, and top with some of the salsa.
