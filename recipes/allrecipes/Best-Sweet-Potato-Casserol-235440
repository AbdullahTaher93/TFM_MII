Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk yams, eggs, 1/2 cup butter, white sugar, coconut, milk, and vanilla together in a bowl until smooth; pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Stir pecans, brown sugar, butter, and flour together in a separate bowl until crumbly; sprinkle over the yam mixture. Bake in preheated oven until the topping is slightly browned, about 30 minutes.
