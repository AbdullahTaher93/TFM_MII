Heat oil in a heavy-duty skillet over high heat. Place 4 to 5 plantain slices in a single layer in the pan and cook until golden brown and tender, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper-towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining plantain slices. Sprinkle cooked plantains with salt and drizzle with lime.
