Place ham slices on work surface, with long sides slightly overlapping. Repeat with the Singles and lettuce, making a separate stack for each ingredient. Stack pepper strips near one of the long ends of the ham slices; roll up. Place on the stack of Singles and roll up to create second layer. Place near one of the long ends of the lettuce leaves and roll up again. Spread dressing onto tortilla. Place lettuce roll-up near bottom edge of tortilla; roll up tightly. Cut into slices. Place in airtight container or wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
