In a large bowl, stir together all ingredients (oats through walnuts). Fill 4 jars or plastic containers and seal with lids. (Optional: garnish the top with additional walnuts or apples.) Refrigerate overnight. Oats can be prepared up to four days in advance (great for planning ahead for a busy week).
