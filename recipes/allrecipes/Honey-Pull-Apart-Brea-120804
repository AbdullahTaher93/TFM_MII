In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the milk, shortening, sugar, salt, eggs and 2 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a stiff dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Roll each into a 16-in. x 12-in. rectangle. brush with butter. Combine remaining filling ingredients; spread over dough to within 1/2 in. of edges. Roll up, jelly-roll style, starting with a long side. Pinch seam to seal. Cut each into 16 slices. Place, cut side down, in a greased one-piece 10-in. tube pan. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until golden brown. Cool in pan for 10 minutes before inverting onto a serving plate. In a small saucepan, combine glaze ingredients; heat until sugar is dissolved. Drizzle over warm bread.
