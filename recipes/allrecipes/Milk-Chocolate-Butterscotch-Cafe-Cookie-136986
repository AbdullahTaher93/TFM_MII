Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 1 large or 2 small cookie sheets with cooking spray. In large bowl, break up cookie dough. Stir or knead in brown sugar and vanilla. Stir or knead in oats, butterscotch chips and chocolate. (Dough will be stiff.) On cookie sheets, drop dough by rounded 1/4 cupfuls 2 inches apart. Flatten each with fingers until 1/2 inch thick. Bake 13 to 18 minutes or until cookies are slightly puffed and edges are golden brown. Cool 1 minute; remove from cookie sheets to cooling racks.
