Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 10 Texas-size muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. Whisk sugar, coconut oil, and grapeseed oil together in a bowl. Add eggs and lime zest; whisk until smooth. Whisk whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, flaked coconut, flaxseed, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir milk and lime juice together in another bowl. Whisk milk mixture into sugar mixture. Gently fold flour mixture into sugar mixture until batter is just combined. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Transfer muffins to wire racks to cool.
