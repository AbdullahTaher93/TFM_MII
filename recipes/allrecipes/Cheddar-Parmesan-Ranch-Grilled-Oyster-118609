Light grill using Kingsford(r) Charcoal with Sure Fire Grooves(tm). Mix breadcrumbs, olive oil, lemon juice, Ranch mix, fennel tops and bulbs, and bacon in a bowl, set aside. Drizzle each oyster with Cheddar Parmesan Ranch dressing. Grill oysters, shell side down, for about 1 1/2 minutes. Top each oyster with about a teaspoon of remaining Parmesan Cheddar Ranch dressing, then pack with breadcrumb mixture. Sprinkle each oyster with cheese and place back on grill. Cover with lid or pan; grill until cheese melts and breadcrumb mixture is crisp.
