In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, cook the millet, stirring frequently, for 4 minutes, or until the grains are fragrant, browned in spots, and just beginning to crackle. Add the water, broth, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 25 minutes, or until the millet is tender, some grains have burst, and the water has evaporated. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, soak the raisins in the sherry. Heat the oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the almonds and cook, stirring frequently, for 4 minutes, or until lightly toasted. Stir in the rosemary and raisins and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Remove from the heat. Fluff the millet with a fork. Stir in the almond mixture and sprinkle with the parsley.
