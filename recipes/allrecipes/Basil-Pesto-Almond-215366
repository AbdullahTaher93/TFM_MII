Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. Combine the egg whites and basil in a blender; process on low speed until mixture is pureed. Toss egg white mixture with the almonds. Drain in a colander. Stir together cheese, salt and garlic powder in a medium bowl. Add drained almonds and toss to coat. Place almonds in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. Bake for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes. Cool completely and store in an airtight container.
