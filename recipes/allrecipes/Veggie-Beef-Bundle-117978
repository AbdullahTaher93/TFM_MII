Coat four pieces of heavy-duty foil (about 12 in. square) with nonstick cooking spray. Place 1/2 cup potatoes on each square. Shape beef into four patties; place over potatoes. Combine soup mix and water; spoon half over patties. Top with mushrooms, green beans and remaining soup mixture. Fold foil around meat and vegetables and seal tightly. Place on a baking sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until meat is no longer pink and potatoes are tender.
