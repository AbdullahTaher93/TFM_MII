In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, poppy seeds, baking soda and lemon peel. Combine the remaining ingredients; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Spoon into two greased 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
