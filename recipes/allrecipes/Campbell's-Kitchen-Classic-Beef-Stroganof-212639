Season the beef with the black pepper. Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook until well browned, stirring often. Remove the beef from the skillet. Pour off any fat. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion and cook until tender. Stir in the soup, water, sherry, if desired, and tomato paste and heat to a boil. Return the beef to the skillet and cook until the beef is cooked through. Remove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the yogurt. Serve the beef mixture over the noodles and sprinkle with the parsley.
