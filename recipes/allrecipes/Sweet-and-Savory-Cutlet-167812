Combine water, orange juice, sherry (or Madeira) and miso in a medium bowl; whisk until smooth. Add prunes and rosemary; set aside. Place flour in a shallow dish. Season turkey with salt and pepper and lightly dredge in the flour, shaking off excess. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the turkey and cook until golden, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Heat the remaining 2 teaspoons oil in the pan over medium heat. Add shallot and mushrooms; cook, stirring, until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the miso mixture; cook, stirring, until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low and return the turkey and any accumulated juices to the pan. Simmer gently, spooning sauce over turkey, until heated through, about 1 minute.
