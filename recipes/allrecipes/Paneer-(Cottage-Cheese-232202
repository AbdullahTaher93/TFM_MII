Heat milk in a heavy bottom pot over medium-high heat until boiling. Remove from heat and add vinegar. Stir a couple times until curds separate from whey, about 5 minutes. Line a colander with cheese cloth. Pour curds and whey through colander and drain. Wrap curds with cheesecloth and place a heavy pot fill with water over curds to press and drain completely, about 2 hours. Curds will form a soft disk.
