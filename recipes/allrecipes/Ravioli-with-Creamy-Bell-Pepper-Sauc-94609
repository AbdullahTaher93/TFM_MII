Bring water and 2 tablespoons salt to a boil in a large soup kettle. Add ravioli and following package times as a guide, cook until just tender; drain. Heat milk and broth in a 1 quart Pyrex measuring cup in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. Heat butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add bell pepper and garlic and saute until tender, 2 to 4 minutes. Add flour; stir until incorporated. Whisk in milk mixture; cook until sauce is thick and bubbly. Stir in cheese and parsley; adjust salt and pepper. Arrange a portion of ravioli on each plate, topping each with sauce and a little extra Parmesan cheese.
