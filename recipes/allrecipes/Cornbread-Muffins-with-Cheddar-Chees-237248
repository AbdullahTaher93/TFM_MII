Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. Beat milk, sour cream, butter, and egg together in a large mixing bowl until smooth; add flour, cornmeal, chopped corn, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk mixture until dry ingredients are just moistened; fold Cheddar cheese into the batter. Divide batter between 12 muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
