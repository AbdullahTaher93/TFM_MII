In a blender or food processor, cover and process the watermelon, lime juice and sugar in batches until smooth. Pour into a freezer-proof container. Cover and freeze for 30 minutes or until edges begin to freeze. Stir and return to freezer. Repeat every 20 minutes or until slushy, about 90 minutes. Spoon 3/4 cup into bowls or glasses; add 1/4 cup soda.
