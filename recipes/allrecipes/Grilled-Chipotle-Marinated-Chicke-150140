Place garlic, onion, chipotle peppers, and vinegar into a blender. Puree until smooth, then add water, lime juice, cumin, paprika, salt, black pepper, and hot sauce. Blend until incorporated, then add Worcestershire until mixed. Pour marinade over chicken in a large bowl, and toss to coat. Cover, and marinate in refrigerator 6 hours to overnight. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil grate. Remove chicken from marinade, and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade. Grill chicken until juices run clear, turning frequently, about 20 minutes.
