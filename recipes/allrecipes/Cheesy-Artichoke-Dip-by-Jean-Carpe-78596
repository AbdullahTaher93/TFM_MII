Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cook artichokes according to package directions; chop roughly. Set aside. In a food processor, mix all ingredients except artichokes and Parmesan cheese until smooth. Stir in artichokes. Pour mixture into a 9-inch baking dish. Sprinkle with Parmesan. Bake for 30 minutes. If top hasn't browned, put under broiler. Let sit for 15 minutes before serving (it may be watery when first removed from the oven). Serve with toasted whole-wheat pita chips.
