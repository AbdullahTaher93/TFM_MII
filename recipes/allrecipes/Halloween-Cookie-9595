Sift flour with soda and salt. In a separate bowl, cream margarine, peanut butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg and vanilla. Fold in flour mixture until just blended. Shape into rolls about 3 inches in diameter. Wrap in wax paper and chill in refrigerator overnight or until firm. Slice rolls 1/8" thick. Make Halloween faces using peanuts, raisins, chocolate or butterscotch chips, or red candies for eyes, nose and mouth. Use colored coconut or chocolate sprinkles for hair. Bake on an ungreased cookie sheet at 375 degrees F for about 12 minutes.
