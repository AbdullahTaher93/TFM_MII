In a saucepan, place the cannellini beans, garlic, sausage, onion and kale with just enough water to cover. Season with 2 teaspoons of parsley, thyme and salt and pepper if desired. Bring to a boil and cook until vegetables are tender. Serve immediately garnished with Parmesan cheese and remaining fresh parsley.
