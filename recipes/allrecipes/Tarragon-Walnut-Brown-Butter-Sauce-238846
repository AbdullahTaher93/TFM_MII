Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until butter is a light-tan, nutty color and fragrant, 6 to 10 minutes. Stir walnuts into butter; cook and stir in hot butter until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add lemon juice, remove skillet from heat, add tarragon, and season with salt and black pepper.
