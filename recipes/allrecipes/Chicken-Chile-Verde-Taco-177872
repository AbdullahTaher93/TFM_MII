In a serving bowl, combine cabbage, cilantro, and salsa; set aside. Rinse chicken, pat dry, and cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-wide strips; set aside. In a wide nonstick frying pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes. Increase heat to high and add chicken. Cook, stirring often, until chicken is no longer pink in center (cut to test), 4 to 6 minutes. Add cumin and oregano; stir for 15 more seconds. Spoon chicken mixture into a serving dish and keep warm. Wrap tortillas in a cloth towel and microwave on full power (100%) for about 1 1/2 minutes or until heated through. To assemble tacos, spoon cabbage mixture, chicken mixture, and cheese into tortillas; fold to enclose and eat out of hand.
