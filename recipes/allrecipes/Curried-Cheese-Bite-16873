Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium bowl, combine olives, green onions, cheese, salt and curry powder. Spread this mixture on top of the sliced muffins. Arrange muffins on a cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) until cheese is melted and slightly browned, about 10 minutes. Cut muffins into bite-sized wedges.
