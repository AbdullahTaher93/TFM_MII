In a small mixing bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Beat in the flour, oil and salt until smooth. Turn onto a heavily floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a bowl coated with nonstick cooking spray, turning once to coat the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. Grease six muffin cups with the butter. Combine garlic powder, Parmesan cheese, oregano and basil; sprinkle into cups. Punch dough down; divide into six portions. Shape each into a ball; place in prepared cups, turning once to coat. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 425 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm.
