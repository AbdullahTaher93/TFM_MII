Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease muffin tin with cooking spray or line with paper liners. Beat buttermilk, honey, mashed banana, canola oil, egg, egg white, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Combine whole wheat flour, baking powder, flax seeds, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl. Mix in dates and walnuts. Pour in buttermilk mixture; mix batter until blended. Scoop batter into the prepared muffin tin. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool, about 15 minutes.
