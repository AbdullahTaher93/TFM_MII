Whisk together the first 10 ingredients. Add onion; set aside 1/4 cup. Pour remaining marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add chicken. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight, turning occasionally. Drain and discard marinade. Grill the chicken, covered, over indirect medium heat for 45 minutes or until juices run clear, turning and basting with reserved marinade every 8-10 minutes. To bake chicken: After marinating, place chicken in a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Pour all of the marinade over it. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1-1/4 hours or until juices run clear, basting occasionally.
