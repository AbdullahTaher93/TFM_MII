Cut peppers in half lengthwise; remove seeds, stems and center membrane. Stuff each half with about 2 teaspoons of cream cheese. Wrap with bacon and secure with toothpick. Place on a broiler rack that has been coated with non-stick cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until bacon is crisp. Remove toothpicks. Serve immediately.
