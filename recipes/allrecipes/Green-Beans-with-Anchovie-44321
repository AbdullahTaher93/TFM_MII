Place the green beans in a medium saucepan, and mix in the garlic, water, and lemon juice. Cover, and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes, until tender but crisp. Drain, and transfer to a medium bowl. In a small bowl, mash the anchovy fillets and about 1 tablespoon reserved oil. Toss into the bowl with the green beans. Season with pepper. Serve immediately.
