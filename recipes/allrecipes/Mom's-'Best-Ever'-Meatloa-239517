Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix ground beef, bread crumbs, 1/2 can golden mushroom soup, egg, dried minced onion, and salt together in a bowl until smooth; shape into an 8x4-inch loaf and move to a baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 75 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Stir remaining soup with hot water in a saucepan; bring to a simmer. Ladle soup mixture over meatloaf.
