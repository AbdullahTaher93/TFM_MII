In a medium bowl, mix peanut butter, soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, garlic, coriander and coconut milk; divide mixture between 2 large resealable bags. Place pork pieces in one bag and chicken pieces in the other. Seal bags; shake gently, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Preheat grill for high heat. Thread marinated pork or chicken onto skewers; discard marinade. Place skewers on hot grill. Cook covered, turning once, until grill marks appear and meat is cooked through, about 8-10 minutes. Remove from grill and serve.
