Cover cookie sheet with waxed paper. Hold each strawberry by stem and dip three-fourths of the way into yogurt, leaving top of strawberry and stem uncoated. Place on cookie sheet. Freeze 30 minutes to set first layer. Dip strawberries again in remaining yogurt for thicker coating. Sprinkle chocolate chips over yogurt-dipped strawberries, using small spoon. Refrigerate uncovered about 2 hours before serving. Store any remaining strawberries tightly covered in freezer, and serve within 1 week.
