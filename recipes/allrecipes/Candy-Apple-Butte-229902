Toss apples and lemon juice together in a bowl. Put about half the apples in a slow cooker with cinnamon candies, brown sugar, ginger, and cloves; stir. Pour enough apple juice over the mixture to nearly, but not quite, cover the apples. Cook on Low, stirring occasionally, until the candies dissolve, about 1 hour. Increase heat to High and continue cooking until the apples have begun to lose shape, about 4 hours. Add remaining apples to the slow cooker. Reduce heat to Low and continue cooking until desired thickness is reached, at least 3 hours.
