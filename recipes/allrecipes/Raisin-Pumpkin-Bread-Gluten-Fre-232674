Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. Beat brown sugar and butter together in a mixing bowl. Add pumpkin, eggs, buttermilk, and maple syrup; beat into the sugar mixture. Stir flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, and cloves together in a separate bowl; blend into the pumpkin mixture. Fold raisins into the resulting batter; pour into prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
