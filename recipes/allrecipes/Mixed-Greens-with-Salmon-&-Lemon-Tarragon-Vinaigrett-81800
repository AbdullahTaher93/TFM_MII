The salmon should be broken into large chunks and free of any skin or fat. In a small mixing bowl whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, lemon zest and tarragon. In a large bowl, toss the salad greens with just enough of the vinaigrette to lightly coat (about 1/2 more or less). Arrange the greens on individual serving plates. Top each with the salmon, the chopped olives and the chopped bell pepper. Drizzle the remaining vinaigrette over each plate. Serve.
