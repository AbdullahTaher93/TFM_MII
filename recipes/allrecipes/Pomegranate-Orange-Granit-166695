In a large bowl, combine pomegranate juice, orange juice and sugar. Whisk until sugar is dissolved. Pour mixture into a 13x9-inch baking pan; cover with plastic wrap. Place in freezer and freeze overnight or a minimum of 6-8 hours. To serve, scrape a large spoon across the surface to create large ice particles. Spoon granita into chilled glasses.
