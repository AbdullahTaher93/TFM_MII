Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. In a medium bowl, stir together 1 1/2 cups all-purpose and the whole wheat flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Cut in butter with a pastry blender until mixture is the consistency of course cornmeal. Stir in cherries, cranberries, and blueberries. Set aside. In a small bowl, stir together egg, buttermilk, orange peel, and vanilla. Make a well in center of flour mixture and pour in buttermilk mixture. Using a fork, stir just until flour mixture is moistened. (Do not over mix.) Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead 10 to 12 times with floured hands. Place dough on sprayed baking sheet. Sprinkle with as much of the 3 teaspoons of flour as necessary, and pat into a 9-inch round. Cut through to form 8 wedges, but leave in a circle. Brush the beaten egg white over the tops of the wedges with a pastry brush. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove from oven and re-cut wedges. Cool scones on baking sheet for 5 minutes. Remove scones from baking sheet and cool on wire rack. Glaze: In a small bowl, stir together powdered sugar, orange juice-water mixture, and orange extract. Stir in enough of the water to make a desired drizzling consistency. Drizzle glaze over cooled scones.
