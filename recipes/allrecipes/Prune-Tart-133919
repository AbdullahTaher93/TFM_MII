To prepare the filling: combine prunes, water, and sugar in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until the prunes are soft. Remove from heat and set aside. To prepare the pastry: combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Work butter into the flour until mixture resembles coarse sand. In a separate bowl, combine the eggs, milk, and vanilla until smooth. Stir into flour mixture until just combined. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll the dough to 1/4 inch thick on a floured surface. Cut into 3 inch squares, then make a slice into each square starting from each corner, and cutting to within 1/2 inch of the center. Place 1 tablespoon of filling into the center of each square. Fold one of the cut halves of each corner into the center, forming a pinwheel shape; press folded ends together gently to seal. Place the cookies onto prepared baking sheet and bake in preheated oven for 15 to 18 minutes, or until golden brown.
