Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (220 degrees C). Position oven rack in the center of the oven. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or foil. Remove pin bones using tweezers or needle-nosed pliers. Place salmon fillet on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with dill, salt, and pepper. Dot the top with pieces of butter. Bake salmon in the preheated oven until the fish feels firm to the touch and flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes.
