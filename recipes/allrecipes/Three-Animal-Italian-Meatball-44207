Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine ground meat, onion, eggs, bread crumbs, oats, and seasoning in a large bowl. Shape into 2-inch diameter balls. Heat enough vegetable oil in a large saute pan to be 1/2 inch deep. Brown meatballs in hot oil for about 5 minutes. Transfer to a glass baking dish. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes.
