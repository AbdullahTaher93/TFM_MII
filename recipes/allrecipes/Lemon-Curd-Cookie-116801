In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in egg and extracts. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture. Stir in pecans. Divide dough in half; shape into logs. Wrap each in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours or until firm. On a floured surface, roll each portion to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut with a 3-in. fluted round cookie cutter dipped in flour. With a floured 1/2-in. round cookie cutter, cut out the centers of half of the cookies. (Reroll small cutouts if desired.) Place solid and cutout cookies 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool. In a saucepan, combine the sugar, cornstarch and salt. Stir in lemon juice until smooth. Cook and stir until slightly thickened and bubbly, about 2 minutes. Stir a small amount into egg yolks. Return all to the pan; bring to a gentle boil; stirring constantly. Cook and stir 2 minutes longer until mixture reaches 160 degrees F and coats the back of a metal spoon. Remove from the heat; stir in butter and lemon peel. Pour into a bowl; cover surface with plastic wrap. Chill for 2-3 hours (mixture will be thick). Spread 1 tablespoon filling over solid cookies; top with cutout cookies; pressing down lightly. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Store in the refrigerator.
