In a large skillet, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp. Remove to paper towels. Add oil to the drippings; saute onion for 3 minutes. Add rice; stir until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 30 minutes or until rice is tender. Sprinkle with bacon.
