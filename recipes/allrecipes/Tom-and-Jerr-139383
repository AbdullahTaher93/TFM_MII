In small mixing bowl, whisk yolks briefly. Add sugar, 1 tablespoon rum, vanilla extract, allspice, cloves, and cinnamon, and whisk again. Set aside. Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in another large bowl until stiff and glossy. Fold whites into yolk mixture, and set aside. In medium saucepan over low heat, bring milk to simmer and remove from heat. While milk is warming, briefly stir egg batter, then add 1 1/2 tablespoons to each mug. Slowly add 4 tablespoons of rum to each mug, stirring constantly to prevent curdling. Fill each mug with hot milk, stir, sprinkle with nutmeg, and serve.
