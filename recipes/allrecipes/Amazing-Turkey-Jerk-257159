Combine ground turkey, soy sauce, honey, Worcestershire sauce, apple cider vinegar, liquid smoke, garlic powder, pepper, ginger, olive oil, and beef bouillon in a large bowl. Mix well and cover. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 12 hours. Tape 2 paint stir sticks 2 inches apart on a flat work surface. Cover with a large piece of plastic wrap. Place a golfball-sized piece of turkey mixture between the sticks. Cover with another piece of plastic wrap. Roll turkey mixture into a thin strip using a rolling pin. Transfer strip to a dehydrator tray. Repeat with remaining turkey mixture. Dehydrate at 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) until thoroughly dried, 5 to 8 hours.
