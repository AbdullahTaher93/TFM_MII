In a mixing bowl, cream the butter, sugar and lemon peel. Add flour; mix well. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour. Divide dough in half. Flatten each portion and roll out between two pieces of waxed paper to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with 2-in. cookie cutters into desired shapes (such as hearts, spades, diamonds and clubs). Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 325 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until cookies are lightly browned. Cool on wire racks.
