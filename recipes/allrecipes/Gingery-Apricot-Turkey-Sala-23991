In a large bowl, toss together the turkey, apple, celery, apricot and cashew pieces. Set aside. In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, sour cream, apricot preserves, nutmeg, ginger and pepper. Spoon over the salad mixture and fold dressing in until well-blended. Serve over a bed of lettuce in a tortilla wrap or pita pocket.
