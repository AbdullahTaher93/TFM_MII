In a resealable plastic bag, combine the flour, salt, and pepper. Add the pork, seal the bag, and toss to coat well. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the pork and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until browned. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, or until golden. Add the tomatoes (with juice), vinegar, carrots, potato, and thyme. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 2 hours, or until the pork and vegetables are tender.
