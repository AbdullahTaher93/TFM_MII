Preheat large saute pan on medium-high 2-3 minutes. Coat both sides of chicken with Creole seasoning. Place oil in pan, then add chicken; cook 2-3 minutes on each side or until golden. Reduce heat to medium-low. Arrange asparagus spears over chicken. Add 2 tablespoons water and cover; cook 4-5 minutes or until chicken is 165 degrees F and asparagus is tender. Transfer asparagus to serving plates; top with chicken. Whisk together 3/4 cup water, yogurt, and dry soup mix in small saucepan; bring just to a boil on medium. Reduce heat to low and stir in green chiles; simmer 2-3 minutes or until thickened. Spoon sauce over chicken and serve.
