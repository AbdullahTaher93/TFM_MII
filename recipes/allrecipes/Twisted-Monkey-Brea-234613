Separate biscuits and cut in quarters. In a bowl, combine sugar and cinnamon. Roll biscuit pieces in cinnamon sugar to coat, and drop them in a greased Bundt pan. Make sure they are distributed evenly. On the stove top, heat the butter, brown sugar, and sugar to a boil until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in apple butter. Pour mixture over the dough, and bake in a pre-heated 350 degrees F oven for 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes, turn upside down onto serving plate, and remove pan.
