Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners. Mix raisins and orange juice together in a small bowl. Combine rice flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, allspice, and xanthan gum in a large bowl. Mix carrots, oil, water, and dry egg replacer together in a separate bowl. Fold in raisin mixture. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture; pour in carrot mixture. Mix until batter is moistened. Spoon batter into the prepared tin, filling each cup 3/4 full. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
