Cream shortening. Add sugar substitute, egg, vanilla and milk and blend well. Add half the flour, mix well and stir in chocolate and the rest of the flour. With cookie press, press onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Use hands and make small ball if you do not have press. Putting flour on your hands, this keeps dough from sticking. Press down with fingers on top of each cookie. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 minutes.
