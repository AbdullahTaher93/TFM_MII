Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 2-quart casserole dish. Mix rice, sour cream, Monterey jack cheese, green chiles, and salt together in the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the rice mixture. Bake in preheated oven until hot in the center, about 30 minutes.
