Heat grill. If necessary, cut larger beef cubes to make 16 cubes. Toss beef together with soy sauce, garlic, rosemary, mustard and thyme. Toss remaining vegetables with olive oil in a large bowl. For each kabob, alternate, 4 cubes beef, 2 tomatoes, 2 mushrooms, two peppers and 4 pieces onion onto skewers. Grill kabobs over medium high heat for 8 to 10 minutes for medium rare or to desired degree of doneness.
