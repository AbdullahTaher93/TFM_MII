Place the cut up chicken into a large resealable bag or a 9x13 inch casserole dish. Pour the buttermilk over the chicken, seal or cover and refrigerate for 24 hours. Remove the chicken from the buttermilk. In a bowl, stir together the salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, thyme, flour and sugar; pour onto a plate. Heat the shortening and bacon drippings in a large skillet or electric skillet to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture and place it into the hot fat. Fry on one side for 10 minutes, then turn and fry 10 minutes on the reverse side. If softer skin is desired, cover the skillet for the last 10 minutes. Remove and drain on brown paper grocery bags. (The smaller pieces will be finished first. The chicken is done when the juices run clear.)
