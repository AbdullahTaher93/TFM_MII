Prepare charcoal or gas grill. In a small saucepan, combine brown sugar, beer or apple juice, Dijon mustard and pumpkin pie spice. Cook glaze over medium-high heat, stirring several times, until it starts to bubble. Remove from heat. Grill each ham steak 1-2 minutes each side before applying glaze. Baste ham steaks with glaze, grill 2 minutes, turn and baste again; grill an additional 2 minutes. Serve hot.
