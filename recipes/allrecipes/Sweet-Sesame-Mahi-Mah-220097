Toss the pineapple, cilantro, red onion, and lime juice together in a bowl until evenly mixed; set aside. Rub the mahi mahi fillets with the sesame oil to lightly coat. Sprinkle the sesame seeds evenly over one side of each fillets; gently press the seeds into the fish to assure they stick. Heat the vegetable oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Lay the fillets with the seeded side down into the hot oil; cook for 4 minutes, turn, and continue cooking until the flesh turns opaque and flakes easily with a fork, another 3 to 5 minutes. Serve with the pineapple mixture.
