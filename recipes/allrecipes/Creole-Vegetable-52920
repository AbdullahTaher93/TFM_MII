In a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until evenly brown. Set aside, reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat. Saute onion and green pepper in bacon fat until tender. Stir in tomatoes, green beans, salt, and pepper. Cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Stir in corn, cover, and continue cooking until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. In a small bowl, mix together flour and water. Stir into vegetables, and cook until thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in evaporated milk. Crumble bacon over top. Serve immediately.
