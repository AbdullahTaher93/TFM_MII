Place chicken in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. In a saucepan, whisk flour and water until smooth. Stir in brown sugar, ketchup, vinegar, lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Cool. Stir in the remaining ingredients. Pour over chicken. Cover and refrigerate for 2-4 hours. Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 35-45 minutes or until chicken juices run clear.
