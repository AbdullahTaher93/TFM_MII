Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until soft. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the broth, water, tomatoes (with juice), lentils, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 40 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. Remove and discard the bay leaf. Stir in the escarole, vinegar, and mild-pepper sauce. Cook for 5 minutes to blend the flavors.
