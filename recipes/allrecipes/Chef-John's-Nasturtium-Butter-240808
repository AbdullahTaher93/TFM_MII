Smash flower petals with a pinch of salt in a mortar and pestle until a paste forms. Stir butter and smashed petals together in a bowl until well-combined. Place butter in the center of a piece of plastic wrap, wrap the butter, roll into a small log shape, and refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes.
