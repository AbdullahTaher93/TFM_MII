To prepare sauce: Mix 2 tablespoons yogurt, mayonnaise, chutney and 1/2 teaspoon curry powder in a small bowl. Cover and chill. To prepare burgers: Preheat grill to medium-high or preheat broiler. Combine pork, turkey, breadcrumbs, 1/4 cup yogurt, 2 tablespoons curry powder, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Shape into four 3/4-inch-thick patties. Grill or broil the patties until no longer pink inside and an instant-read thermometer reads at least 160 degrees F, about 5 minutes per side. Serve the burgers on buns, topped with the sauce and watercress.
