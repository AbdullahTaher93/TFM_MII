Place steak, 1 tablespoon oil, curry paste, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; toss to coat. Marinate steak 20 minutes at room temperature (or longer, or overnight, in the refrigerator). While steak marinates, cook noodles in boiling salted water until al dente (do not overcook). Drain; rinse briefly with warm water. Set aside. Heat remaining tablespoon oil in a wok (or 12-inch nonstick skillet) over medium-high heat. Add shallots and stir-fry until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add steak and stir-fry until browned all over, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; stir in coconut milk and sugar. Bring to simmer; cook until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir in noodles and basil; simmer 30 seconds. Serve in deep bowls with lime wedges.
