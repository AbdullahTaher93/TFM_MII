Combine chicken broth, star anise, ginger paste, and sriracha hot sauce in a stockpot; bring to a boil. Add tofu, broccoli, mushrooms, and carrots and cook until vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Bring a separate pot of water to a boil. Remove pot from heat and add rice noodles to the water; let stand until noodles are softened, about 4 minutes. Drain water and rinse noodles under cold water. Remove star anise from broth mixture. Pile cold noodles into serving bowls and top with broth mixture; garnish with green onion.
