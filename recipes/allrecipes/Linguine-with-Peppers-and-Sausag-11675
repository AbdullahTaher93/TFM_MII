Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente. While the pasta is cooking, prepare the sauce. Saute sausages in a heavy skillet over medium high heat until light brown, breaking up clumps with back of spoon. Add peppers, onion, and garlic; saute until tender. Add wine and simmer until liquid is slightly reduced, about 6 minutes. Drain pasta, and add to the skillet. Toss to combine. Add cheese, and toss to blend. Serve.
