In small bowl, mix together Fajitas Spices & Seasonings, oil, lime juice and Garlic Powder With Parsley. Place chicken in large Ziploc(R) bag. Pour on fajitas-marinade mixture; seal bag and toss to coat chicken. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to overnight. Remove chicken from bag; discarding marinade. Grill or broil chicken 10 to 15 minutes or until thoroughly cooked. Let cool slightly, slice thinly or cut into cubes. To arrange salads, place chicken on beds of lettuce. Top each with equal portions of onion, tomato and avocado. Drizzle with ranch-style dressing.
