Blend orange juice, olive oil, green onion, lemon juice, chives, cilantro, parsley, balsamic vinegar, fennel seed, and salt together in a blender until dressing is smooth. Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread hazelnuts out on a baking sheet. Roast hazelnuts in the preheated oven until toasted and fragrant, 7 to 10 minutes. Pour nuts onto a clean towel and rub to remove skins; roughly chop hazelnuts and discard skins. Combine quinoa and cranberries in a large bowl; pour dressing over the top and toss to coat. Stir apple and hazelnuts into quinoa mixture just before serving. Season with salt.
