Place dried porcini mushrooms in a small bowl with enough warm water to cover. Soak 20 minutes, or until rehydrated, and chop. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Place tilapia in the skillet, and season with kosher salt and pepper. Sprinkle with 1/2 the lemon zest. Pour half the lime juice over the tilapia, and continue cooking 5 minutes. Flip the tilapia, and season with kosher salt and pepper. Sprinkle with remaining lemon zest, and cover with remaining lime juice. Stir remaining butter, green onions, and porcini mushrooms into the skillet. Continue cooking 5 minutes, or until fish is easily flaked with a fork.
