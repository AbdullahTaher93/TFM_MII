Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease a 1-quart casserole. Heat the butter in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the flour and garlic. Gradually stir in the milk. Cook and stir for 5 minutes or until the mixture boils and thickens. Stir the cheese, nutmeg and black pepper in the saucepan. Cook and stir until the cheese is melted. Gently stir in the crabmeat. Spoon the crab mixture into the casserole. Bake for 20 minutes or until the top is lightly browned. Serve with the crackers for dipping.
