To make the compote: Combine cider, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, and cinnamon in medium-size heavy saucepan. Stir over low heat until SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener dissolves. Increase heat to high and boil 1 minute. Stir in lemon juice. Reduce heat to medium and add vanilla, lemon peel, apples, pears, grapefruit, apricots, and cherries to cider-cinnamon syrup. Simmer 30 minutes, periodically stirring gently. Transfer to medium serving bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and chill 1 hour or longer until ready to serve. To make the creme: In small bowl, mix ricotta, cream cheese, SPLENDA(R)Granulated Sweetener and lemon peel. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use. To make the crepes: Combine flour, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, and salt in a medium bowl and whisk to combine. Place eggs, milk, butter, vanilla, and lemon peel in a blender. Pulse milk mixture to combine; add flour mixture and blend until it reaches the consistency of cream. Heat 9-inch nonstick pan over medium-low heat. Coat pan with non-stick cooking spray and ladle 3 tablespoons batter into center of pan, tipping and swirling pan to spread batter to edge. When just set, about 40 to 60 seconds, use a thin, flexible spatula to flip crepe, and cook 20 to 30 seconds longer until completely opaque. Repeat with remaining batter to make 16 crepes. To serve, spoon 1 tablespoon creme into center of warm crepe and gently roll into cigar shape. Place 2 crepes on each of 8 dessert plates and sprinkle with confectioners sugar, if desired. Spoon 1/3 cup fruit compote over each serving.
