The tomatoes would traditionally be peeled and seeded. Feel free to do that. I prefer to leave the peel on (for the extra nutrients). Remove the stems and cut into halves. Squeeze each half over a bowl and most of the seeds will come out. Discard the seeds. Chop the tomatoes. In a soup pot over high heat, add the chicken stock, tomatoes and bouquet garni. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to a simmer. Cover and cook for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, saute the onion and garlic in olive oil until tender. Add to the soup pot. After the soup has cooked for 20 minutes, remove the bouquet garni and puree the soup with a hand mixer or by putting it through a food processor or blender. Return the soup to the soup pot. Add the cream, mint and basil. Simmer for at least 5 minutes or up to 15 minutes more. Taste test and add salt and pepper as needed.
