Heat about 1 inch of oil in a large skillet to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Combine baking mix, sugar, cocoa sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl; add chocolate milk, eggs, and cream and stir until batter is smooth. Pour batter into a funnel, placing your finger on the hole to keep batter from dripping. Swirl batter into the hot oil; cook until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Transfer funnel cakes to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
