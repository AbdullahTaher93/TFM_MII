In a large frying pan, cook the pepperoni over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Drain. In a large glass or stainless-steel bowl, whisk the lemon juice, oregano, salt, and black pepper. Add the oil slowly, whisking. Add the lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, olives, cheese, and pepperoni and toss to coat.
