Place chicken wings in large resealable plastic bag or glass dish. Add 1/2 cup of the marinade; turn to coat well. Refrigerate 30 minutes or longer for extra flavor. Remove chicken wings from marinade. Discard any remaining marinade. Grill chicken wings over medium heat 20 to 25 minutes or until cooked through, turning occasionally. Meanwhile, mix remaining 1/2 cup marinade and honey in large bowl until well blended. Add grilled chicken wings; toss to coat well. Place on serving platter. Sprinkle with sesame seed.
