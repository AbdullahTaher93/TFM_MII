In a 10- to 12-inch pan over medium-high heat, stir oil, garlic, and onion often until onion begins to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add tomato and chilies; simmer until tomatoes are soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat; add crab. Meanwhile, stack tortillas, wrap in foil, and warm in a 350 degrees F oven, about 10 minutes. To make salsa, mix cucumber, chili, pineapple, lime peel, lime juice, and cilantro. Spoon about 1/3 cup crab filling onto a tortilla; add salsa and salt to taste. Fold in half to enclose filling; repeat for remaining tacos.
