Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 16 muffin cups with paper liners. Combine 2 cups flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl. Combine white sugar, melted butter, and eggs in another bowl; whisk until smooth. Mix in bananas, cranberries, and 1/2 cup walnuts. Fold in flour mixture and mix until a lumpy batter forms. Spoon batter into lined cups, filling each 3/4 full. Mix brown sugar and 3 tablespoons flour in a small bowl. Cut in cubed butter with a pastry cutter or two knives until pea-sized crumbles form. Mix in 1/3 cup walnuts. Sprinkle walnut crumble over batter. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes.
