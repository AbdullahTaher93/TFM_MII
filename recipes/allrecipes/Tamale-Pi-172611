Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Oil or spray a 2- to 2 1/2-quart round casserole or souffle dish. Spray a large skillet with nonstick cooking spray. Add beef, salt and pepper to taste, onion, and garlic and cook over medium-high heat, breaking the meat up with a fork, until its no longer pink, about 7 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, chili powder, cumin, corn, black beans, and olives. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes, breaking up tomatoes with a spoon. Pour into prepared dish. Prepare cornbread mix according to package directions (you will need an egg and milk). Pour cornbread mixture evenly over top. If desired, sprinkle with cheese. Bake for 20 minutes or until cornbread is golden and firm when tapped.
