Cook the penne according to the package directions. In a large skillet saute the pepperoni until crispy (about 5 to 8 minutes). Drain all but 1 tablespoon of the grease. Add the shallot and garlic. Cook until translucent. Stir in the tomatoes and simmer for about 3 minutes. Stir in the cream and cook until reduced (about 8 minutes). Add the parsley and remove from the heat. Add the drained pasta and toss, garnish with parmesan cheese.
