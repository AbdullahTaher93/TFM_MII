Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease or line 12 muffin cups. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Stir in the milk, egg, butter and chocolate chips. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups or flat bottomed ice cream cones. Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
