Peel parsnips and slice into 1/4 inch rounds. Bring a pan of lightly salted water to a boil, and add parsnips. Cook for about 5 minutes, until tender but still crisp. Drain, and cool slightly. Dip slices in melted butter, and place on a baking sheet. Refrigerate until the butter is firm, about 30 minutes. Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Coat parsnip slices in flour, then fry in the hot oil until golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels, and season with salt, chili powder and cayenne to taste.
