In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta until al dente according to package instructions. Drain and rinse pasta under cold water; leave in colander, and set aside. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, heat oil and garlic over medium. Cook, stirring, until garlic is fragrant and sizzling, about 1 minute. Remove from heat; let stand 10 minutes. Pour garlic oil through a sieve into a large bowl; discard garlic. Add pasta and herbs to oil. Season generously with salt and pepper; toss to combine. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve, chilled or at room temperature. (Salad may be made up to 2 days in advance; before serving, taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.)
