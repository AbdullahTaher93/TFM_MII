Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Heat butter and oil in a large saucepan. Add Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, lemons, hot sauce, Italian seasoning, garlic, paprika and salt to the saucepan. Mix well and simmer 5 to 7 minutes. Divide shrimp between two Dutch ovens. Pour 1/2 of the sauce into one Dutch oven and 1/2 of the sauce into the other. Heat the sauce in both Dutch ovens to a simmer and cook the shrimp for 6 to 8 minutes; until the shrimp begin to turn pink. When the shrimp have begun to turn pink pour the shrimp and sauce from both Dutch ovens into a large baking pan (or two pans depending on how much sauce you have). Bake the shrimp for 10 minutes, stirring once.
