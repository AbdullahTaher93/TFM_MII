Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place Parmesan cheese, olive oil, onion powder, garlic powder, pepper, salt, and potatoes into a resealable plastic bag. Seal the bag, then shake to coat the potatoes with the seasoning. Spread the potatoes over a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, about 25 minutes.
