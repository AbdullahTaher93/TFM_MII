Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin or line with paper liners. Beat rice flour, rice, sugar, applesauce, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and baking powder in a large bowl with an electric mixer for 2 minutes. Add zucchini and blend for 1 minute. Fill muffin cups about 2/3 full with batter. Bake in the preheated oven until muffins are browned on top and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.
