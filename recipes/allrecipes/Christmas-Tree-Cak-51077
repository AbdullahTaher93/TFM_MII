Make cake as directed for 13x9x2-inch rectangular pan, using water, oil and eggs. Cool 10 minutes in pan. Remove from pan. Cool completely, about 1 hour. Freeze cake uncovered 1 hour for easier frosting. From the middle of one short side, make a diagonal cut to each corner on opposite side, making 3 triangular pieces. Make tree shape by arranging 2 outer pieces with straight 13-inch sides together on aluminum foil-covered tray or cutting board; frost top. Place remaining center piece on top. See diagram for more detail (see Note). Frost sides and top of cake. Press candy cane pieces in end of tree to make trunk. Sprinkle with colored sugar to look like boughs. Arrange gumdrops on cake to look like lights or ornaments. Store loosely covered.
