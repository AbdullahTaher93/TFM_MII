Place the peppers on a broiler pan and broil, 3 inches away from the broiler element, turning, until blackened all over. Transfer the peppers to a dish and allow to cool. Remove the stems, peel away the skin and core, and wipe the seeds out with paper towels. Cut the pepper into 1/4-inch wide strips. Set aside. (Alternatively, you can char the peppers on a grill.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush a baking sheet with 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil. Place the asparagus on the baking sheet and turn to coat in the oil. Roast for 5 to 7 minutes, or until a knife is easily inserted into the stalk. Transfer the asparagus to a cutting board, and cut crosswise in half. Arrange the asparagus on a platter with the charred bell pepper strips. Combine the remaining olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and salt and pour over the salad. Cover the salad and let it marinate at room temperature for several hours before serving.
