Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Season the tenderloins with 2 teaspoons of the coriander, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and the pepper. In a large ovenproof frying pan, heat the oil over moderately high heat. Add the tenderloins and brown on all sides, about 3 minutes. Put the pan in the oven and cook until the tenderloins are just done to medium, about 15 minutes. Transfer the tenderloins to a carving board and leave to rest in a warm spot for about 5 minutes. Pour off all the fat from the pan. Put the pan over moderate heat and add the port. Bring to a boil, scraping the bottom of the pan to dislodge any brown bits. Add the broth, prunes, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Boil until reduced to approximately 1/2 cup, about 3 minutes. Whisk in the remaining 1/2 teaspoon coriander and the butter. Slice the tenderloins and serve topped with the prunes and sauce.
