Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put a heavy baking sheet in the oven to heat. Split the rolls in half and spread the cut sides with the pesto, right to the edges. Arrange 3 slices of tomato on each half and sprinkle with the corn kernels and grated mozzarella. Divide the tuna, shrimp, and squid rings between the pizzas. Season with salt and pepper to taste and drizzle each pizza with 1 teaspoon oil. Put the pizzas on the hot baking sheet and bake until the cheese just melts, 10 to 12 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
