Fill ice into cocktail glass and place in the freezer. Place 2 lime wedges and the sugar cube into a cocktail shaker and mash well with a cocktail muddler. Pour in ice, lime juice, and vodka, cover, and shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Remove ice from cocktail glass; wipe dry with a paper towel. Rub a lime wedge around the rim of the glass. Strain the contents into the chilled glass and garnish with a twist of lime zest.
