In a Dutch oven, bring water and potatoes to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 12 minutes. Drain. Place potatoes in a mixing bowl; beat on low until mashed. Add cream cheese, eggs, chives, salt and pepper; mix well. Divide potato mixture between two greased 2-qt. baking dishes. Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese and butter; sprinkle over potatoes. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until top is browned and potatoes are heated through.
