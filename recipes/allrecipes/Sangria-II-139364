Bring sugar and water to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then boil over moderately high heat 5 minutes. Cool syrup to room temperature and pour over fruit in a small bowl. Chill, covered, 4 hours. Drain fruit in a large sieve set over another bowl and reserve fruit and syrup separately. Fill a large glass pitcher one-fourth full with ice and add wine, fruit, and 1 cup syrup (save leftover syrup for another use). Stir wine, gently mashing fruit with a wooden spoon, then add sparkling water to taste, starting with 1 cup. Serve sangria in wineglasses with 1 or 2 slices of fruit in each glass.
