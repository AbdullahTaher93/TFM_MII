Cook the pasta as directed on package until just tender; drain, cover and keep warm. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage; saute, breaking up the meat until brown, about 4 to 6 minutes. Add garlic and pepper flakes; continue to saute until garlic is golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomatoes; bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer partially covered to blend flavors, about 10 minutes. Add vodka and cream; return to a simmer and cook until sauce is thick enough to just coat the pasta, about 5 minutes. Add pasta and parsley to sauce; season with salt and pepper and toss thoroughly.
