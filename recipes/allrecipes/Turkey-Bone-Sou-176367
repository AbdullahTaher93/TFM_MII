Place the turkey carcass in a large stockpot with a lid. Pour the chicken broth over the turkey to mostly cover. Drop in the onion, celery, and garlic. Bring to a boil over medium heat, cover, and simmer for 2 hours, turning the carcass occasionally. Remove the carcass from the stock and set aside to cool. Remove the onion, celery and garlic from the stock and drop them into a blender along with about 1/2 cup of the stock, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the vegetable mixture moving before leaving it on to puree. Pour the pureed onion, celery, and garlic back into the stock. Remove as much cooked turkey meat from the carcass as possible and add the meat to the stock. Stir in the chopped turkey breast, frozen mixed vegetables, rice, canned kidney beans, salt, pepper, oregano, basil and paprika. Bring the soup to a boil, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, 20 to 30 minutes.
