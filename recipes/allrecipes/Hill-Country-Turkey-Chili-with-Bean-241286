Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir ground turkey and garlic in hot oil until browned completely, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour beef broth over browned turkey mixture, bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook for 20 minutes. Stir crushed tomatoes, onion, tomato paste, and diced tomatoes and green chiles with the turkey mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until thick, about 1 hour. Stir black beans into the chili; cook until the beans are heated through, about 10 minutes more.
