In a bowl, combine the eggs, a third of the soup and 1/4 cup milk; mix well. Stir in stuffing mix and tuna. Shape into eight patties. In a skillet, brown patties in butter for 3-4 minutes on each side or until heated through. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, heat remaining soup and milk. Serve with patties.
