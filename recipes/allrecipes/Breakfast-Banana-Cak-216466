Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch round cake pan. Combine the flour, oats, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a mixing bowl; set aside. Beat the brown sugar, eggs, bananas, vanilla extract, orange zest, and butter in a bowl until smooth. Stir the dry mixture into the egg mixture until smooth; fold in the coconut and almonds. Pour into the prepared cake pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
