Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Combine the tuna, mayonnaise, and mustard in a medium bowl, using a fork to mash the ingredients together. Top each bagel half with half of the tuna mixture. Sprinkle the tops with shredded Cheddar cheese. Place bagel halves on a baking sheet. Bake the bagel halves in preheated oven until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes.
