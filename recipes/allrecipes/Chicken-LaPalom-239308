Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Thoroughly blend cream of chicken soup, mayonnaise, lemon juice, and curry powder in a 2-quart casserole dish. Stir chicken and mixed vegetables through the soup mixture. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the mixture. Stir corn flakes, butter, and parsley together in a bowl; sprinkle over the top of the casserole. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, remove foil, and continue baking until the edges begin to brown, about 25 minutes more.
