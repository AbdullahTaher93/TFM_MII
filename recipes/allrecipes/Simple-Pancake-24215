In a bowl, stir together flour, sugar, salt and baking soda. In a separate large bowl, beat together eggs, milk, vanilla, vegetable oil and margarine. Stir dry ingredients into egg mixture; mix until smooth. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
