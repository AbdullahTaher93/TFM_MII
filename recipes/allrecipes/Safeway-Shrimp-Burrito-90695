Cook rice mix according to package directions. Meanwhile, mix yogurt with garlic, then add salt and pepper to taste. When rice is almost done, place a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over high heat. When pan is hot, add oil and spinach leaves. Stir until leaves wilt, about 2 minutes. Mix in shrimp, remove from heat, and drain liquid from pan. Enclose tortillas in microwave-safe plastic wrap and heat in a microwave oven at full power (100%) until hot and steamy, 45 to 60 seconds. Onto each warm tortilla, spoon 1/4 of the rice, 1/4 of the spinach mixture, 1 tablespoon yogurt sauce, and 2 tablespoons salsa. Fold 1 side of the tortilla over the filling, then fold opposite side over and roll to enclose. Accompany the burritos with remaining yogurt sauce and tomato salsa to add to taste.
