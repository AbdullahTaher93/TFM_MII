Mix white rice, flour, eggs, parsley, Parmesan cheese, salt, and black pepper together with a wooden spoon in a bowl. Shape spoonfuls of the mixture into balls. Heat oil in a large saucepan or deep-fryer over medium heat until hot. Fry balls a few at a time until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels.
