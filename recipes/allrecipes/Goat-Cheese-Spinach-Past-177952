Fill a 6- to 8-qt. pan 2/3 full with water; bring water to a boil over high heat. Add fettuccine; cook just until tender to bite, 5 to 6 minutes. Add spinach and cook until wilted, 30 to 45 seconds. Drain fettuccine and spinach; return to pan. Meanwhile, in a 1 to 2 quart pan over high heat, bring chicken broth to a boil. Add cheese and stir until melted; remove from heat. Add cheese mixture to fettuccine and spinach; mix to coat. Spoon pasta mixture onto a platter; scatter sliced cherry tomatoes over top. Add salt and pepper to taste.
