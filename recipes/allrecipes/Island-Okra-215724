Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion and garlic; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the okra, salt, and pepper. Increase the heat to high; cook and stir until the okra begins to brown, about 10 minutes. Pour the lime juice over the okra and continue cooking for 2 minutes.
