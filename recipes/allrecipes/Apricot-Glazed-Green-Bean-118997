Place beans in a steamer basket in a saucepan over 1 in. of water. Bring to a boil; cover and steam for 7-8 minutes or until crisp-tender. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the preserves, butter and salt. Heat, uncovered, on high for 30 seconds or until butter is melted. Transfer beans to a serving bowl; add apricot mixture and toss to coat.
