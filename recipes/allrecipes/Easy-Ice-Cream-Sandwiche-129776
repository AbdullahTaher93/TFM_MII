Mix vanilla ice cream with chopped peanuts, chocolate, marshmallows or cookies. Place in freezer for 20 to 30 min. or until firm enough to hold its shape. Spoon about 2 Tbsp. of the ice cream mixture onto bottom side of each of 15 of the cookies; cover with second cookie, top side up, to make a total of 15 sandwiches. Roll edges in additional chopped peanuts, chocolate or cookies. Freeze 1 to 2 hours or until firm.
