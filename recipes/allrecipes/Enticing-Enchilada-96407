Heat oven to 375 degrees. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add bell pepper, onion and garlic; cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Crumble turkey into skillet; sprinkle with seasoning and cook about 8 minutes or until no longer pink, stirring occasionally. Stir in 1/2 cup enchilada sauce. Remove from heat; stir in 1 cup cheese. Spread 1/2 cup enchilada sauce over bottom of 13 x 9-inch baking dish. Spoon about 1/3 cup turkey mixture down center of each tortilla. Fold bottom of tortilla up over filling, fold in sides and roll up. Place seam side down in prepared dish. Spoon remaining enchilada sauce evenly over enchiladas. Cover with foil; bake 20 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining 1 cup cheese. Return to oven and bake uncovered 10 minutes or until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbly. Garnish with lettuce and tomato. Top with avocado, if desired.
