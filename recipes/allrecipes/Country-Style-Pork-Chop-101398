Using a sharp knife, cut a horizontal slit in the side of each chop, forming a pocket for stuffing. Set aside. Combine hot water, melted butter and instant bouillon in small mixing bowl until bouillon is dissolved. Add stuffing mix, corn, bell pepper, onion, basil and pepper. Stir until all liquid is absorbed. Spoon corn mixture into pockets in chops. Close with wooden picks or small skewers. Place pork chops, standing on end, in a slow cooker, cover and cook on low heat setting 6 to 7 hours or until pork chops are tender. Remove pork chops from cooker. Pour drippings into 4-cup measure. Pour 1 1/2 cups dripping back into slow cooker. Turn to high heat. Dissolve cornstarch in water. Stir into drippings. Cover and cook about 15 minutes, stirring at least once. Spoon 1/4 cup sauce over each serving.
