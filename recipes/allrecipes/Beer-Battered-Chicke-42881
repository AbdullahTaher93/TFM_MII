Rinse chicken, and slice into 1 inch strips. In a medium bowl, stir together 1 cup flour, and baking powder. Mix in the eggs and beer. Heat oil in a deep heavy skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place remaining 1/2 cup flour in a small bowl. Coat chicken strips in flour, then dip floured strips into the batter. Fry a few at a time in hot oil, turning once, until coating is golden brown on both sides. Remove, and keep warm until serving.
