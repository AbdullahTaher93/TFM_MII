In a deep skillet, mix together the cheriyaki glaze, Worcestershire sauce, mirin and soy sauce. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Place the crabs side by side in the sauce, with the top shell down. Cook for about 5 minutes, then turn and cook for 5 more minutes. Remove to serving plates, and serve with plenty of napkins!
