Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the snow peas, and cook for 2 minutes, then add the water chestnuts, mint, and sesame seeds. Cook and stir until the snow peas are tender, and the water chestnuts are hot, about 3 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.
