Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Line large shallow baking sheet with parchment paper. On a cutting board, place 1 sheet of phyllo dough. Fold in thirds to measure 5 inches by 8-3/4 inches. Spray lightly from edge to edge with non-stick vegetable spray. Sprinkle with 1/8 tsp oregano. Place one sausage link at the top of the dough and roll up tightly, pressing ends of dough together to seal. Repeat using remaining three sausage links and phyllo sheets. Cut each roll into 4 sections. Place, 1/2 inch apart, seam side down, on baking sheet. Lightly spray tops of each section with non-stick vegetable spray. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 tsp oregano. Bake in preheated oven for about 10 minutes or until appetizers are golden brown. Immediately remove from baking sheet and cool slightly. Serve with prepared marinara sauce.
