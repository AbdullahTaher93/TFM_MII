Heat oven to 375 degrees. Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions. In a large skillet, heat the oil and saute the onion until translucent, about 4-5 minutes. Add the ground turkey and saute, stirring, until meat is browned, about 8 minutes. Stir in Italian seasoning. Add chopped tomatoes and simmer 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix together ricotta, asiago, basil leaves, salt and pepper. Spread cup spaghetti sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Lay down a layer of noodles over the sauce. Layer the ricotta mixture over the noodles. Place another layer of noodles over the ricotta mixture. Spread cup spaghetti sauce on top of the noodles. Layer the remaining noodles over the ricotta mixture, overlapping slightly to create ruffled layers. Spread the remaining spaghetti sauce and sprinkle with the mozzarella. Cover pan with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for 10 more minutes, until the cheese bubbles.
