Butter two 2-cup au gratin dishes. Place 1 fillet on bottom of each, then layer with scallops, crabmeat, shrimp, cheese and a second fillet; set aside. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Melt butter. In a medium mixing bowl, combine yolks, lemon juice, mustard and salt; mix on high and slowly add butter in a steady stream until sauce is thick and creamy. Pour sauce over fillets. Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes; sprinkle with parsley and paprika. Serve.
