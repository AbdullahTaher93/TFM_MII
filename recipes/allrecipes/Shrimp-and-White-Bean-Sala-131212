In a medium skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add garlic and rosemary and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add shrimp and stir-fry until pink and opaque. Add broth, cover, and lower heat. Simmer until shrimp are cooked through, about 4 minutes more. Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon, careful to let oil drain back into the skillet. In a large bowl, toss with white beans and lemon juice until well mixed. Store in refrigerator until cool. Once cooled, stir in scallions and serve.
