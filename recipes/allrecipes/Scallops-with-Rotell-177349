In a 6-qt. pan, bring 4 qts. water to a boil over high heat; stir in pasta and cook, uncovered, until just tender (about 10 minutes). Meanwhile, place scallops in a large bowl. Add paprika, basil, thyme, mustard, and white pepper; mix until well coated. Heat oil in a wide nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add scallops and cook, stirring often, just until opaque in center; cut to test (about 3 minutes). Lift out and set aside, reserving juices in pan. Drain pasta well. Transfer to a warm, deep platter and keep warm. Increase heat to high and cook reserved juices until reduced to about 3 tbsp. Add broth and bring to a boil. Stir cornstarch mixture and add to broth. Bring to a boil again, stirring. Remove from heat and stir in sour cream and scallops; spoon over pasta.
