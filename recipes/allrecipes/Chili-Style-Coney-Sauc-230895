Stir lean ground beef, water, tomato sauce, chili seasoning mix, yellow mustard, onion powder, and garlic powder together in a large saucepan; bring to a boil, stirring often. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until ground beef is no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Remove lid and simmer sauce until thickened, about 20 more minutes.
