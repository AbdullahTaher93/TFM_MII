Combine olive oil, rice vinegar, sherry vinegar, mustard, 1/2 teaspoon sea salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper together in a jar. Place a lid on the jar and shake until dressing is well-combined. Let sit at room temperature until flavors blend, at least 30 minutes. Place edamame in a saucepan and cover with water; cook over medium-high heat until water just begins to boil and edamame is tender yet still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water. Stir black beans, lima beans, edamame, onion, basil, feta cheese, and tomatoes together in a large bowl. Pour dressing over the top and toss to coat. Season with sea salt and black pepper and refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes.
