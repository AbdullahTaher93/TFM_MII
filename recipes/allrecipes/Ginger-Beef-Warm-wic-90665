Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Mix dressing and ginger; spread onto cut sides of rolls. On the bottom half of each roll, layer 1/4 of the beef, onions, red bell peppers, and cheese. Place the other half of each roll on top, wrap the sandwiches in foil, and place them on a baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. Serve warm.
