In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the flour, salt and pepper. Flatten chicken to 1/2-in. thickness; place in bag, one piece at a time, and shake to coat. In a large skillet over medium heat, brown chicken in butter. Stir in wine or broth. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 12-15 minutes or until chicken juices run clear. Drizzle with lemon juice.
