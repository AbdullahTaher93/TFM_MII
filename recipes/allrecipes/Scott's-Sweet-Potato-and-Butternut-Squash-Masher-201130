Place the sweet potatoes and butternut squash into a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Mash the sweet potatoes and butternut squash, then add cinnamon, nutmeg, and syrup. Mix until smooth.
