In a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add the tuna steaks; cook for 3 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Transfer to a broiler pan. Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper. Cover with basil leaves. Top with tomato and cheese. Broil 4-6 in. from the heat for 2 minutes or until the cheese is melted.
