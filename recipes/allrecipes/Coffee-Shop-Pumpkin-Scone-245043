Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Mix flour, white sugar, baking powder, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger together in a large bowl; cut in butter and shortening using a pastry cutter or 2 knives until mixture is crumbly. Mix pumpkin, egg, and half-and-half together in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture just until combined. Turn dough onto a floured work surface and shape into a 1/2-inch-thick square. Cut dough into pizza-like wedges and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer scones to a wire rack to cool. Whisk confectioners' sugar, milk, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice together in a bowl; drizzle over scones.
