Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Season both sides of veal chops with salt, black pepper, and cumin. Put 3 to 4 slices butter in the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish; sprinkle in about 1/4 of the mozzarella cheese, 1/4 of the provolone cheese, and 1/4 of the white Cheddar cheese. Arrange a layer of veal chops atop the cheese layer. Top each chop with 2 to 3 slices butter, 1/3 of the mushrooms, and 1/4 of the mozzarella cheese, 1/4 of the provolone cheese, and 1/4 of the white Cheddar cheese. Continue layering with the remaining ingredients. Pour enough water into the casserole dish to just cover the bottom; cover dish with aluminum foil and an oven-safe lid. Bake in the preheated oven until veal is no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour.
