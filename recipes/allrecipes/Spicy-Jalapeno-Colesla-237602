Combine cabbage, onion, carrots, and jalapeno peppers together in a bowl. Blend egg, lemon juice, white vinegar, and salt in a food processor until smooth. Slowly drizzle oil into egg mixture through the feeding tube while the food processor is running until mayonnaise is smooth and thickened. Mix mustard, sugar, cider vinegar, chipotle chile pepper, and celery salt into mayonnaise until dressing is smooth and evenly combined. Stir dressing into cabbage mixture until evenly coated. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until flavors blend, at least 2 hours.
