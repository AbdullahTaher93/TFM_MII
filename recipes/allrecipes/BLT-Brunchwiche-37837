Cover bottom half of each bagel with 1 lettuce leaf and 1 tomato slice; set aside. Mix eggs, milk and hot pepper sauce in small bowl, set aside. Cook and stir green pepper in medium skillet sprayed with no stick cooking spray on medium heat 2 to 3 minutes or until tender-crisp. Pour egg mixture over green pepper and cook without stirring. As egg mixture sets, lift slightly with spatula to allow uncooked portion to flow underneath. Continue cooking until egg mixture is set. Top each bagel half with 1/4 of the cooked egg mixture, 2 bacon slices and top half of bagel.
