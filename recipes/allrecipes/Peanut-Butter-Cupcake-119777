In a mixing bowl, cream the butter, peanut butter and brown sugar. Beat in egg and vanilla. Combine the dry ingredients; add to creamed mixture alternately with milk. Fill paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 350 degrees F for 26-30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely. For frosting, cream peanut butter and sugar in a small mixing bowl. Add the honey and vanilla. Beat in enough milk to achieve a spreading consistency. Frost cupcakes.
