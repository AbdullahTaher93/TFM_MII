Heat charcoal or gas grill to medium. Combine ground pork, onion, cheeses, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce and garlic in large bowl; mix well with hands. Shape into 1-inch thick patties (9 to 12); sprinkle pepper and salt on both sides. If a smokier flavor is wanted, add a small handful of pecan or oak wood chips to fire about 10 minutes before putting patties on. Grill burgers approximately 15 minutes until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F, turning every 5 minutes.
