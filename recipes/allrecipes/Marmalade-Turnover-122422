In a bowl, combine butter and cheese. Add flour; stir until mixture forms a ball. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to 1/8-in. thickness; cut into 2-3/4-in. circles. Place 1/2 teaspoon marmalade on each circle. Fold pastry over and seal edges with a fork. Cut slits in top of pastry. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 5-9 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.
