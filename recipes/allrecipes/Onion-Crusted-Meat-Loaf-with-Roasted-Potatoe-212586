Thoroughly mix 1/2 cup soup, beef, 1/2 can onions, egg and Worcestershire in a large bowl. Place the mixture in a 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan and firmly shape into an 8 x 4-inch loaf. Spoon the remaining soup over the meat loaf. Arrange the potatoes around the meat loaf. Bake at 400 degrees F for 1 hour or until the meat loaf is cooked through. Stir the potatoes. Sprinkle the remaining onions over the meat loaf and bake for 3 minutes or until the onions are golden.
