Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion and garlic; season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook and stir until the onion has begun to soften, about 1 minute. Add the pierogies, and cook until slightly browned on each side, about 5 minutes per side. Sprinkle with dried parsley to serve.
