In a blender, whirl 1 tablespoon of the almonds, 1 tablespoon of the flour, and 2 teaspoons sugar until almonds are finely ground. Set aside. In a bowl, combine 2 cups flour and 1/4 cup sugar. Add 3/4 cup of the butter, cut into small pieces. Rub with your fingers until fine crumbs form. Add 1/4 cup water, and stir just until dough holds together. Pat into a ball. On a lightly floured board, pat dough into a flat disk, then roll into a round, 15 inch wide, 1/8 inch thick. Slide pastry onto a 14- by 17-inch baking sheet; if pastry tears, press edges back together. Sprinkle almond mixture onto pastry, leaving 3-inch rim uncovered. Peel, core, and cut pears into 1/4-inch slices. Overlap pear slices onto pastry to cover almond mixture, leaving 3-inch rim. Lift rim and lay over pears, folding pastry neatly. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons. sugar and remaining sliced almonds over pears. Melt 1 tablespoon butter (in a small pan over direct heat or in a microwave-safe bowl in microwave oven). Brush pastry rim with butter and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar. Bake on center rack in a 400 degrees F oven until pastry is golden brown, about 40 minutes. Slide tart onto a platter. Serve tart hot, warm, or cool, cut into wedges.
