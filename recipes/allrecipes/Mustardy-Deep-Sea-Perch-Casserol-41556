Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Gradually stir in flour, and cook until slightly brown. Gradually stir in the milk, raisins, and hazelnuts, stirring constantly. Continue stirring, and add the mustard, lemon juice, and hot pepper sauce. Remove from heat, and set aside. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Season the fish fillets with salt, pepper, and paprika on both sides. Place the fillets in a single layer in an oven-proof baking dish. Arrange banana slices over the fish, then pour the mustard sauce over all. Bake for about 30 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
