Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and soda. Combine eggs, buttermilk, honey, and oil; add slowly to the dry ingredients. Mix until blended. Pour into non-stick muffin cups, making them about two-thirds full. Bake until golden, about 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the muffins from the pan and cool completely.
