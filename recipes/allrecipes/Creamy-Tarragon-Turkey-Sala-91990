Remove large leaves and tender sprigs from watercress; discard coarse stems. Rinse watercress and drain well. Divide among 6 shallow individual bowls and set aside. Toast pecans in a wide nonstick frying pan over medium heat until golden (about 4 minutes), shaking pan often. Remove from pan and set aside. Heat oil in pan over medium-high heat. Add turkey and cook, stirring often, until no longer pink in thickest part; cut to test (3 to 5 minutes). Remove from pan with a slotted spoon; set aside. In a large bowl, stir together mayonnaise, sour cream, minced tarragon, salt, and pepper. Stir in grapes, celery, pecans, and turkey. Mound turkey mixture equally atop watercress in bowls. Garnish with tarragon sprigs, if desired.
