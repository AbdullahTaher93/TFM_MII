Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat eggs, oil, sugar, and vanilla together until thick. Stir zucchini, pineapple, flour, soda, salt, baking powder, spices, raisins, and walnuts into the egg mixture; blend well. Pour batter into two 9x5 inch greased loaf pans. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes then turn out onto a wire rack.
