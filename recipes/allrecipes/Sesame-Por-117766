In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch, broth and soy sauce until smooth; set aside. In a skillet or wok, heat oil; stir-fry the pork and garlic for 5 minutes. Add broccoli coleslaw mix; stir-fry 3-4 minutes longer or until meat is no longer pink and broccoli is crisp-tender. Stir cornstarch mixture and add to the pan. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1 minute or until thickened. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Serve with rice if desired.
