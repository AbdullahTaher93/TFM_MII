Toss the potatoes in a pot of water and boil them for 15 to 20 minutes. While they cook, stir together the olive oil, vinegar, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, and pepper in a large bowl. Dump the steak into the bowl, then drain the potatoes and add them as well. Cover the bowl and let everything marinate in the refrigerator for 4 to 8 hours. When you're ready to eat, thread your kebabs with alternating pieces of steak, potato, and onion. Cook the kebabs on a broiler pan that's been sprayed with nonstick spray, grilling them for 6 minutes per side or until the steak is done to your liking.
