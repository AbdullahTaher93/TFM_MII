In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, saute garlic in oil 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in onion and cook 2 minutes more. Stir in tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until al dente; drain. Toss hot pasta with tomato mixture. Serve.
