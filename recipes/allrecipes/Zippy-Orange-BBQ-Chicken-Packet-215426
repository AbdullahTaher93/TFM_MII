In 1-quart saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Stir in chicken, barbecue sauce, orange juice concentrate and honey. Remove from the heat; stir in green onions. Set aside. Separate dough into 4 rectangles; press perforations to seal. Spoon 1/2 cup chicken mixture onto half of each rectangle; sprinkle with cheese. Fold dough over filling; press edges with fork to seal. Place on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.
