Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place chicken breasts in a baking pan. Mix Parmesan cheese and mayonnaise in a bowl; spread evenly over chicken breasts. Coat with bread crumbs; sprinkle with herbes de Provence. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
