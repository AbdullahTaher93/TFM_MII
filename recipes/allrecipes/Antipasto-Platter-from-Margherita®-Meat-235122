Combine mozzarella cheese, dressing and basil in a small decorative bowl; chill at least 30 minutes or up to 1 day. Fold or roll the deli meats and arrange attractively on a large serving platter. Arrange the bowl of cheese, bell peppers and olives attractively around meats. Garnish the platter with basil sprigs if desired. Place the toast or crackers in a napkin lined basket and have frilly wooden picks or small forks available for serving the antipasto.
