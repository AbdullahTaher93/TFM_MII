Place potatoes into a pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes; drain. Mix processed cheese, French-fried onions, bacon bits into potatoes and smash together using a potato masher. Stir milk into potatoes, increasing amount until desired consistency is reached.
