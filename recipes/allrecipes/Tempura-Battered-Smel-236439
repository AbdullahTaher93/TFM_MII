Whisk rice wine and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a bowl. Lightly dust smelt with about 1 tablespoon flour. Add smelt to rice wine mixture; cover bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large wok to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix ice water, 1/2 cup flour, cornstarch, egg yolks, sesame seeds, sesame oil, baking powder, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a bowl. Remove smelt from rice wine mixture and dip, 1 at a time, into the flour mixture until evenly coated. Discard remaining rice wine mixture. Carefully fry smelt, 2 or 3 at a time, in the hot oil until golden on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towel-lined plates. Repeat frying with remaining smelt. Serve warm.
