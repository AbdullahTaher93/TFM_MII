Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 8 half-cup ramekins with nonstick cooking spray. In a large bowl, mix eggs, pumpkin, milk, SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, salt, and vanilla. Divide pudding among ramekins. Place ramekins in a 9 x 13-inch baking dish, and add enough warm tap water to the baking dish so that the bottom third of the ramekins is submerged (about inch of water). Carefully slide the baking dish into the oven. Bake until puddings are set, about 45 to 55 minutes. Remove puddings from oven and sprinkle each with 1 teaspoon pecans. Serve warm or at room temperature.
