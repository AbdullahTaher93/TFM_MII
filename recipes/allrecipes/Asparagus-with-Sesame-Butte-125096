Place asparagus spears in a large skillet; add boiling water and salt. Cook for 5-7 minutes or until tender. Remove asparagus and keep warm. Drain cooking liquid, reserving 1/2 cup in a small saucepan. Combine cornstarch and cold water; stir into liquid. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly; cook and stir 1 minute more. Stir in butter until melted. Spoon over asparagus; sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve immediately.
