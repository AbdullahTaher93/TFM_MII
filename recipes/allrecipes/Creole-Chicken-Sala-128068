In a shallow glass baking dish, combine the tomato puree, water, garlic, paprika, soy sauce, hot-pepper sauce, and black pepper. Add the chicken and turn to coat with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate, turning occasionally, for at least 1 hour. Broil the chicken, 4 inches (10 cm) from the heat, until no pink remains, 5 to 7 minutes on each side. Let it cool and cut it into bite-size pieces. In a large bowl, combine the chicken, celery, onion, red pepper, rice, yogurt, and mayonnaise. Serve immediately or chill until ready to serve.
