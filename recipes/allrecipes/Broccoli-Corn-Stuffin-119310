In a skillet, saute the onion in 1 tablespoon butter. In a bowl, combine the corn, broccoli, egg, salt if desired and pepper; mix well. Add the onion mixture and 3/4 cup of croutons. Spoon into a greased 1-qt. baking dish. Melt the remaining butter; toss with remaining croutons. Sprinkle over the top. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until heated through.
