Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat 13x9-inch cake pan lightly with no-stick cooking spray. Stir together flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Beat oil, peanut butter, sugar, eggs and milk in a large mixing bowl. Stir in carrots, walnuts, coconut and pineapple. Add flour mixture and stir until combined. Spread evenly in prepared pan. Bake 32 to 37 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool completely on wire rack. Stir frosting and peanut butter until combined. Spread on cooled cake. Place 3 tablespoons peanut butter in a resealable plastic bag. Microwave on HIGH 10 seconds. Make a small cut in one corner of bag. Drizzle peanut butter over top of cake in lines across the short side. Then using a table knife, lightly slice through peanut butter down the long side to create design.
