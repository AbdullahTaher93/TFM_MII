Preheat grill pan on medium-high (or preheat grill). Season steaks with salt and pepper (wash hands). Place steaks in grill pan (or on grill); grill 3-4 minutes on each side or until 145 degrees F (for medium-rare). Let steaks stand 5-10 minutes before serving. Preheat medium saucepan on medium-high 2-3 minutes. Place oil in pan, then add mushrooms; cook and stir 1-2 minutes or until lightly browned. Stir in wine; cook and stir 1-2 minutes until liquid has reduced by about one-half. Whisk in gravy, mustard, and Creole seasoning; cook and stir 3-4 minutes or until hot. Remove sauce from heat; whisk in butter. Drizzle sauce over steaks; serve.
