Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Place leeks and garlic in the pan and slowly cook and stir 10 minutes, or until tender and lightly browned. Mix in the chicken broth and salt. Reduce heat and simmer approximately 15 minutes. Increase heat to medium low and stir in the romaine lettuce. Cook 5 minutes. Stir in the tarragon. Remove from heat. In a blender, blend the soup until smooth. Return soup to the saucepan and warm over medium heat. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
