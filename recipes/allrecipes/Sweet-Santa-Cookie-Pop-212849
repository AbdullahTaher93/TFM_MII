Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 cookie sheet pans with the parchment paper. Knead the flour into the refrigerated cookie dough until smooth. Roll out the dough to a scant 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out 10 triangles and 10 circles, re-rolling the scraps if necessary. Line up the circles on the prepared pans, and press a lollipop stick halfway into each circle. Arrange a triangle on top of each circle, overlapping it by 1/2 inch, with the tip curved to resemble a hat. Bake for 12-17 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from the oven, transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely. Using the photo as a guide, decorate the cookies. Tint 3/4 cup of the frosting light pink; set aside. Spoon the remaining frosting into a resealable plastic bag; then snip a small corner and pipe frosting onto each hat to cover it. Decorate with M&M'S(R) Brand Chocolate Candies; place a mini marshmallow at the very top. (For better results, work on one cookie at a time.) Spread the pink frosting onto the circle part, and arrange the face with M&M'S(R) Brand Chocolate Candies for the eyes, nose and mouth. Use marshmallows cut in half for the beard, and whole marshmallows for the brim of the hat.
