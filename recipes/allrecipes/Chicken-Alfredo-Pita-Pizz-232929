Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Season chicken with garlic salt; cook and stir in hot oil until no longer pink in the middle, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool. Spread 1 tablespoon hummus over one side of each of the pita rounds nearly to the edges. Top with layers of pesto and alfredo sauce. Sprinkle a layer of chopped spinach over the alfredo sauce; top with even portions of chicken, artichoke hearts, feta cheese, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and mushrooms. Drizzle remaining olive oil over the pizzas. Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and crust on pitas is slightly brown, about 15 minutes.
