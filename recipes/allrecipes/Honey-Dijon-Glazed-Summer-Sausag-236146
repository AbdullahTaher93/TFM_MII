Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Cut summer sausage into 1/8-inch thick slices, cutting only about three-quarters of the way through the summer sausage. For the glaze, in a bowl, combine the honey, mustard and brown sugar. Place summer sausage on a foil lined baking pan. Spoon glaze over sausage and between slices. Bake, uncovered, for 40 min., basting with glaze once. Before serving, slice sausage completely.
