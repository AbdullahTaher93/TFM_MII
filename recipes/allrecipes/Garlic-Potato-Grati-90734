Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Butter a shallow 2 1/2-quart pan or baking dish. Arrange potato slices in pan so that they overlap and are level. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, combine whipping cream with melted butter and garlic; pour over potatoes. Bake, uncovered, until potatoes are brown and tender when pierced, about 45 minutes. Sprinkle cheese over potatoes; bake until cheese melts, 8 to 10 minutes longer.
