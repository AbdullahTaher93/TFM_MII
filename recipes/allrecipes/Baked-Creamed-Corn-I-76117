Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8 inch casserole dish. In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and cream cheese, and dissolve the chicken bouillon. Mix in the corn. Season with pepper, nutmeg, and salt. Stir in the cream. Transfer the mixture to the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle with cheese, and top with crackers. Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly browned.
