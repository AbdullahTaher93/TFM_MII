Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Grill the sausages on the preheated grill until the sausages are browned, and no longer pink in the center about 5 minutes on each side. Cut the cooked sausage into 1/2-inch slices. While the sausage is grilling, melt the butter spread in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the sauerkraut, celery flakes, onion, caraway seeds, brown sugar, and pepper. Cook and stir until the sauerkraut begins to brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in the sausage slices. Serve hot.
