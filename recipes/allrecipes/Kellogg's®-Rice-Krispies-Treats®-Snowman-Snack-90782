Melt butter or margarine in large saucepan over low heat. Add marshmallows and stir until completely melted. Remove from heat. Add KELLOGG'S RICE KRISPIES cereal. Stir until well coated. Using buttered spatula or waxed paper, press mixture evenly in 15 1/2 x 10 1/2 x 1-inch pan coated with cooking spray. Using a 4-inch snowman cookie cutter, cut into snowman shapes when cooled. If a snowman cookie cutter is not available, use 1 1/2-inch, 1 3/5-inch and 2-inch round cookie cutters. Using prepared frosting, connect each circle to make a snowman and decorate as desired with remaining ingredients. Best if served the same day.
