Preheat grill to medium heat. Make pocket in each chop by carefully making a horizontal cut in 1 side of each chop, being careful to not cut all the way through chop to opposite side. Set aside. Mix apple, cracker crumbs, pecans, 2 Tbsp. of the mustard and the raisins until well blended. Spoon evenly into pockets in chops. Press cut sides together to seal pockets; secure with toothpicks. Grill chops 30 to 35 min. or until chops are cooked through, turning over after 15 min. and brushing with the remaining 1 Tbsp. mustard.
