In a small stainless steel or enamel saucepan combine fruit and vinegar. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Boil gently, uncovered, for 3 minutes. Remove from heat and cover loosely with cheesecloth; cool. Pour mixture into a clean 1-quart jar. Cover jar tightly with a nonmetallic lid (or cover with plastic wrap and then tightly seal with a metal lid). Let stand in a cool, dark place for 2 weeks. Line a colander with several layers of 100% cotton cheesecloth. Strain vinegar mixture through the colander and let it drain into a bowl. Discard fruit. Transfer strained vinegar to a clean 1-pint jar or bottle. If desired, add a few additional pieces of fresh fruit to the jar or bottle. Cover the jar or bottle tightly with a nonmetallic lid (or cover with plastic wrap and then seal tightly with a metal lid). Store vinegar in a cool, dark place for up to 6 months.
