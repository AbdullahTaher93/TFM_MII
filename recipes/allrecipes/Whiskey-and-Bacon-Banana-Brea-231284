Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray 5 mini loaf pans with cooking spray. Place bananas, vanilla extract, banana extract, and whiskey-honey liqueur into the work bowl of a stand mixer and mix well. Transfer banana mixture to a bowl. Beat butter, sugar, eggs, and bacon drippings in a clean bowl using stand mixer until butter mixture is fluffy, about 3 minutes. Stir banana mixture into butter mixture. Place bacon slices into a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Mix bacon into moist ingredients. Combine flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder on a large paper plate and use paper plate as a funnel to add flour mixture to moist ingredients in mixer bowl; beat until batter is thoroughly combined. Pour batter into prepared mini loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle of a loaf comes out clean or with moist crumbs, about 45 minutes.
