Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking pan with sliced potatoes. Arrange the pork chops on top of the potatoes. In a bowl, stir together the cheddar cheese and French onion soups. Pour the soup over the pork chops. Cover pan and bake in preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until internal pork temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Sprinkle chops with Monterey Jack cheese and serve.
