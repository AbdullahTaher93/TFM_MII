Preheat your oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Combine macadamia nuts, soy sauce, garlic, hot sauce, brown sugar, olive oil, and black pepper in a food processor; blend until the mixture is the consistency of paste. Spoon a thick layer of the macadamia mixture on top of each tilapia fillet. Place the fish macadamia mixture-side up on the prepared baking sheet. Under the broiler, cook fish until the macadamia crust is golden brown and the tilapia flakes easily, about 15 minutes.
