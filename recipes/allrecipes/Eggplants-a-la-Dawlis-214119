Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Brush both sides of each eggplant slice generously with olive oil; arrange in a single layer in the bottom of a broiler pan. Scatter about half of the cracked coriander seed over the eggplant slices. Cook under the broiler until browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Flip and season with the remaining coriander seed; cook under the broiler until browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk the lemon juice, basil, and salt together in a bowl; drizzle over the broiled eggplant slices. Serve warm.
