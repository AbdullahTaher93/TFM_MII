In a heavy 1-qt. saucepan, combine sugar, milk and syrup. Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture boils. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, uncovered, until a candy thermometer reads 234 degrees F (soft-ball stage), stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat. Add butter; do not stir. Cool, without stirring, to 160 degrees F. Stir in pecans. Beat vigorously with a wooden spoon until mixture just begins to thicken but is still glossy. Quickly drop by spoonfuls onto waxed paper. Cool. Store in an airtight container.
