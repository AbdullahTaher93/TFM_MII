Combine the water, lentils, spinach, green chile peppers, ginger, turmeric, and salt in a large pot over medium-high heat; bring to a boil and cook until the lentils are tender and the water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Heat the oil and ghee together in small skillet; fry the curry leaves, red chile peppers, cumin seeds, mustard seed, and asafoetida powder in the mixture until the seeds begin to splutter. Stir the mixture into the lentil mixture. Sprinkle the ground red pepper over the mixture and cook another 5 minutes. Serve hot.
