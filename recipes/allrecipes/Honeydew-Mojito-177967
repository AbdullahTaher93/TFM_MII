In a food processor, whirl melon, 2 tablespoons simple syrup, 1/4 cup lime juice, and chopped mint until mixture blends to a smooth slush. Taste for sweetness; add more syrup, if desired. (To make ahead and store up to 2 weeks, scoop slush into a resealable freezer bag and seal. When ready to use, let stand a few minutes at room temperature to soften.) Mix remaining 1/4 cup lime juice, rum or ginger ale, and 2 tablespoons simple syrup. Scoop melon slush equally into tall glasses (about 1 cup size); add mint sprig to each. Add equal amounts of rum mixture. Fill with club soda. Dust drinks with nutmeg. Serve with straws to swizzle and sip.
