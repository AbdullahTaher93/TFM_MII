Mix lettuce, black beans, corn, red bell pepper, jicama, carrots, scallions, basil, and cilantro together in a large bowl. Juice 2 limes and drizzle juice over salad; toss lightly. Combine chicken and barbeque sauce in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until chicken is warmed through, about 45 seconds. Arrange chicken and avocado on top of the salad and squeeze remaining lime over salad.
