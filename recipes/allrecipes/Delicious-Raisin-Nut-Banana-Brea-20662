Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the bottom of a 9x5 inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, stir together cereal and milk. Let stand 5 minutes, until cereal is soft. Stir oil and egg into milk mixture until well combined. In a separate bowl, combine flour, white sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir flour mixture into milk mixture and fold in mashed banana; pour into prepared loaf pan. Bake 50 to 55 minutes, until top springs back when lightly touched. Let cool in pan 10 minutes before removing to wire rack to cool completely.
