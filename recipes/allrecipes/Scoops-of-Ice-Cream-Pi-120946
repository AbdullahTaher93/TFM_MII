Soften 1 pint of ice cream. Combine the cookie crumbs, nuts and butter. Press onto the bottom and up the sides of a 9-in. pie plate. Spread with the softened ice cream. Cover and freeze until firm. Scoop remaining ice cream into small balls; pile into crust. Cover and freeze for up to 2 months. Remove from the freezer 10 minutes before serving. Arrange raspberries between scoops. Garnish with mint if desired.
