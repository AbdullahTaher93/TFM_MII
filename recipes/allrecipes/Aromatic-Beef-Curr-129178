Heat the oil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add the onion and mushrooms and saute until the onion slices begin to color, about 2 minutes. Add the beef together with the ginger, garlic, chiles, ground coriander, cardamom, turmeric, and nutmeg. Stir-fry 2 minutes, then add the tomatoes with their juice and the cornstarch mixture. Bring to a boil, stirring. Stir in the yogurt and honey. Bring back to a boil, then reduce the heat, cover, and simmer 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the cardamom rice. Put 2 cups cold water in a saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil. Add the rice, cinnamon stick, and cardamom pods. Bring back to a boil, then cover tightly and simmer until the rice is tender, 10 minutes. Drain off any excess water and return the rice to the saucepan. Stir in the lemon juice and keep covered until the curry is ready to serve. Stir the spinach, lime juice, and chopped cilantro into the curry and let the leaves wilt down into the sauce. To serve, spoon the curry over the rice and garnish with fresh cilantro leaves.
