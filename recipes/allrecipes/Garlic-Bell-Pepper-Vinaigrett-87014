Choose a clean bottle or jar with a well fitting lid or cork. Put the peppers, garlic, parsley, and basil into the jar or bottle. Pour in olive oil, italian dressing, and red wine vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover with lid, shake well to mix, and refrigerate at least 2 days to allow flavors to develop.
