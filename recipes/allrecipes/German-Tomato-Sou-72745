Heat a large Dutch oven or soup pot over medium-high heat. Crumble in the ground beef. Cook, stirring frequently, until evenly browned. Drain excess grease. Stir in the cabbage, potatoes, carrots, onion, tomato soup, milk and water. Bring to a boil, then simmer over medium heat for 30 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and cook for 1 1/2 hours before serving.
