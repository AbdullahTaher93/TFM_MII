In a heavy saucepan, combine the brown sugar, milk and corn syrup. Cook and stir over medium heat until sugar is dissolved and mixture comes to a boil; boil for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in chocolate chips, vanilla and coffee granules with a wooden spoon. Continue stirring until mixture is smooth and thick, about 5 minutes. Stir in walnuts. Shape into two 9-in. logs; wrap each in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight. Unwrap and cut into slices.
