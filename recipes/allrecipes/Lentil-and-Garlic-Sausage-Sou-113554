Heat the 1/4 cup of olive oil in a large saucepan. Add the sausage and cook over moderately low heat until it starts to brown, about 7 minutes. Add the carrots, garlic, onion, fennel and bay leaf and cook over moderate heat until softened, about 8 minutes. Add the wine and boil over moderately high heat until the pan is almost dry, about 5 minutes. Stir in the lentils, broth and water and bring to a boil. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the lentils are tender, 1 hour. Discard the bay leaf. Stir the rosemary into the soup and season with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls. Sprinkle with cheese, then drizzle with olive oil and serve.
