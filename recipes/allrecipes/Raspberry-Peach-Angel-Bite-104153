Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil a 13x11 inch-baking sheet. Set aside. Make Angel Bites: Place egg whites in a medium mixing bowl. Whip on high speed using an electric beater or wire whisk until frothy. Add SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, vanilla and salt. Mix on high speed until medium-stiff peaks form (approx. 20-30 seconds). Spoon rounded tablespoons of egg white mixture onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated 350 degree F oven 10-15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan. Cool. Make filling: Drain thawed raspberries and save juice. Place juice in a small saucepan. Add cornstarch and SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener. Stir well. Cook over medium heat until simmering and thick (approx. 2 minutes). Toss thawed raspberries with thickened juice. Chill until ready to use. Assemble Angel Bites: Just before serving, sandwich Angel Bites with filling. Place filling on the bottom of one Angel Bite and top with another so that the bottoms of the Angel Bites are facing each other and the filling is sandwiched between them. Repeat with remaining Angel Bites. Garnish Angel Bites with sliced peaches, a dollop of whipped cream and a sprig of fresh mint.
