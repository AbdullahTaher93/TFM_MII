On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 14-in. x 10-in. rectangle. Brush with butter. Combine the sugar, cinnamon and lemon peel; sprinkle evenly over butter. Sprinkle with raisins. Starting from along side, roll dough up tightly. Seal seams. Slice into 12 rolls; place in a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 10 minutes. Combine the glaze ingredients; brush over rolls.
