In a large pot over medium heat, heat the olive oil, and cook the turkey until no longer pink; sprinkle the turkey meat with paprika, salt, and black pepper. Stir in the jalapeno peppers, onion, garlic, celery, green pepper, and chipotle peppers, then cook, stirring often, until the turkey meat is broken into crumbles and the onion is translucent, about 15 minutes. Stir in the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, chili beans, dark beer, Worcestershire sauce, chili seasoning, and liquid smoke flavoring. Reduce heat and simmer for at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
