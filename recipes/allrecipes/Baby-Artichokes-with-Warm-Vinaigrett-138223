Fill a stockpot with water; add 2 teaspoons salt and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Halve lemon; squeeze juice into water. Add squeezed halves. Remove tough outer leaves from artichokes, and pare down stems using a vegetable peeler. Add artichokes to lemon water, cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer; cook until leaves are easily removed and heart is tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain in a colander; set aside. Place 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat; add minced shallot. Cook until translucent, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat; add mustard, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, the pepper, and vinegar. Slowly whisk in remaining olive oil. Serve the reserved artichokes with the warm vinaigrette on the side for dipping.
