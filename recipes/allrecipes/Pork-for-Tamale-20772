Trim fat from pork butt. Cut into chunks and place in a large saucepan. Add water, onion, garlic, bay leaf, salt, peppercorns and chile pepper. Bring to a boil; skim foam from surface. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 1 hour. Drain broth, let meat cool and shred with a fork. Refrigerate overnight if desired.
