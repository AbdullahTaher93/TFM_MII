Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook pasta one minute less than required. Drain and toss with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and place on sheet tray to cool down. In a bowl, season chicken with 1 tablespoon olive oil, oregano, salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil, sear the chicken pieces on both sides. When chicken is cooked through (no longer pink inside) remove from the skillet and cool down. In a large bowl combine all the ingredients and toss well, season with salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with slices of chicken.
