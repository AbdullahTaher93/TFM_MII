In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine molasses, water and vinegar; add to the creamed mixture and mix until blended. Combine remaining ingredients; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until easy to handle. On a heavily floured surface, roll out dough to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with a 2-1/2-in. cookie cutter dipped in flour. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until edges are browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.
