In a large skillet, heat the oil. Add the scallion whites and ginger and cook over moderate heat until starting to brown, about 3 minutes. Add the sake, rice vinegar, soy sauce and sugar and cook, stirring to dissolve the sugar, about 1 minute. Add the crabmeat and scallion green and toss lightly to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the salad to a platter and sprinkle with the granulated orange peel. Serve at room temperature or lightly chilled.
