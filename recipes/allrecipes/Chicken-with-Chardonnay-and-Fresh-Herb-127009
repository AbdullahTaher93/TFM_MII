Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F or heat a grill until hot. In a bowl, mix the goat cheese, half the herbs and white pepper to taste. Loosen the skin of the chicken breasts. Divide the cheese mixture, place some of it under the skin of each breast and pat gently to distribute evenly. Season the chicken lightly with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with olive oil. Roast in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes or cook on the hot grill for 10 to 12 minutes per side, until chicken is cooked right through. Combine the shallot and chardonnay in a saucepan, bring to a boil and reduce to a glaze, about 1/4 cup. Add the stock and reduce by half. Add the cream and continue to reduce until the sauce lightly coats the back of a spoon. Whisk in the butter in small pieces, making sure each piece is incorporated before adding the next. Season the sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Strain into a clean saucepan and add the remaining chopped herbs.
