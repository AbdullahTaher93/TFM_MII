Preheat a grill or broiler to high heat. Grill the sausages, turning occasionally, for about 4 minutes until the outside is crisp (the inside is precooked). Let cool. Boil the potatoes in lightly salted water for about 10 to 15 minutes, until tender but not falling apart. Drain and cool. Slice the cooked sausages into 1/2-inch rounds and then crosswise into quarters. Cut the potato halves into quarters. Whisk lemon juice, oil, mustard, tarragon, salt, and pepper in a large bowl and add sausages, potatoes, celery, and onion. Toss together and serve at room temperature.
