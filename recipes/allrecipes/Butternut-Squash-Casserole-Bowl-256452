Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Slice top and bottom off the squash; cut into 1 1/2-inch slices and scrape out seeds. Arrange on the lined baking sheet. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over each slice. Bake squash in the preheated oven until tender, about 25 minutes. Let cool, about 5 minutes. Season with pumpkin pie spice and salt.
