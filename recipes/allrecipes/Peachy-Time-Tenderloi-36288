In a small bowl, combine first 4 ingredients. Place tenderloin in a shallow glass dish. Pour half of marinade over meat. Reserve remaining half for later use. Turn meat to coat evenly. Cover; refrigerate 1 hour or longer for extra flavor. Remove meat from marinade. Grill or broil over indirect heat 30 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F. Discard leftover marinade. Heat reserved marinade to a boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Cut meat in thin slices, serve with sauce.
