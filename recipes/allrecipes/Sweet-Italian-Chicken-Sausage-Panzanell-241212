Spread bread onto baking sheet. Allow bread to dry slightly while preparing other ingredients. Place sausage on an oiled grill rack, set 4 to 5 inches over medium-low heat. Grill, with lid closed, using the direct grill method, turning with tongs, until cooked throughout, about 7 to 9 minutes. Cook until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees. Cool slightly and cut into bite-sized chunks. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, stir tomatoes, olives, green onions and vinaigrette together. Add bread and sausage. Toss to coat all surfaces. Add Parmesan and chopped basil. Arrange 1/2 cup romaine on each plate and spoon salad atop lettuce. Garnish with extra basil. Serve immediately.
