Make Frittata: Beat eggs, milk, mustard, salt and pepper in medium bowl with wire whisk until well blended. Set aside. Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add potatoes; cook 8 to 10 minutes, or until lightly browned on both sides, turning after 5 minutes. Add turkey and onions; mix well. Reduce heat to low; cover. Cook 3 minutes; stir. Pour egg mixture over potato mixture; cover. Cook 10 minutes, or until eggs are set, carefully lifting edge with spatula and tilting skillet as necessary to allow uncooked portion to flow underneath. Sprinkle with cheese; cover. Cook until cheese is melted. Make Salsa: Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Continue cooking until lightly browned, stirring frequently. Add tomatoes; stir. Reduce heat to low; simmer 5 minutes. Crush tomatoes with potato masher or slotted spatula. Cut frittata into wedges. Serve with the Salsa.
