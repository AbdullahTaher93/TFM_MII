Place flank steak in the freezer for 20 minutes. Whisk coriander, brown sugar, soy sauce, lime juice, garlic, and ground ginger together in a bowl until marinade is well combined. Remove steak from freezer and slice thinly across the grain. Place steak in a large bowl, pour marinade over steak, and toss to coat. Cover bowl and marinate at room temperature for 1 hour. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line bottom of a broiler pan with foil. Lay steak slices in a single layer on the rack of the prepared broiler pan. Cook in the preheated broiler, brushing occasionally with marinade, until steak reaches desired doneness, 1 to 2 minutes for medium rare.
