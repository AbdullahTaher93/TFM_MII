Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute chicken, garlic, salt, garlic powder, basil, and oregano in hot oil until chicken is no longer pink in the middle, 5 to 10 minutes. Add sun-dried tomatoes and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Pour pasta into pot and toss with chicken until combined. Top with Parmesan cheese.
