For dipping sauce: In a small bowl, mix sour cream and honey mustard until well blended. Place in a small bowl and set aside. Blanch Broccolini, pat dry with paper towels. Trim off ends of Broccolini stalks. Cut proscuitto or ham slices lengthwise into 1-inch strips. Tightly wrap 1 or 2 strips diagonally around each Broccolini stalk, leaving about 1-inch of stalk showing at the bottom. Arrange on a platter; adding dipping sauce. (This can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated up to 24 hours.) Serve chilled or at room temperature.
