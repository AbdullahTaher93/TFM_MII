Sift flour into a large bowl and mix in salt. Stir in coconut, chile peppers, and onion. Mix in water gradually until dough is soft and slightly sticky. Knead dough until it is smooth and leaves the side of the bowl, 3 to 5 minutes. Grease your palms and the top of the dough lightly with oil. Divide dough into 8 balls and place on a lightly greased work surface. Flatten each ball with your palm into a roti about 1/4-inch thick. Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Cook rotis, flipping often, until golden brown spots begin to appear on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes.
