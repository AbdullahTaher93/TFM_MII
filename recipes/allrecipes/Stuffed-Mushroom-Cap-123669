Remove stems from mushrooms and finely chop; set caps aside. In a skillet, saute chopped mushrooms in butter until tender, about 6-8 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in bread crumbs, soup mix and almonds. Stuff firmly into mushroom caps. Place in a greased 15-in. x 1-in. x 1-in. baking pan; sprinkle with cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until tender.
