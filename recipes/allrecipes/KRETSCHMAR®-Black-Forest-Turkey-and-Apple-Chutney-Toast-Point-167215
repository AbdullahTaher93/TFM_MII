Place apples, sugar, cinnamon, cider vinegar, and water in a sauce pot. Cook over medium heat until reduced to a thick consistency. Refrigerate. In intervals, toast the multi-grain bread in a home toaster. Once toasted, gently cut the crust off of the bread and quarter into triangles. Fold the turkey to fit the toast points and place on top of each one. Top the turkey with a slice of Brie cheese and reserved chutney. Finish with an apple slice and serve.
