Brown ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drain, remove from pan and set aside. Melt 2 tablespoons of margarine in the skillet. Add torn tortillas and brown lightly. Push the tortillas all the way to the outside edge of the pan. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of margarine to the center and melt. Pour in the beaten eggs and scramble until soft set. Push the eggs to the outside edge of the pan and add the browned ground beef to the center of the pan. Pour the enchilada sauce over and mix lightly. Reduce heat to a simmer. Sprinkle the black olives and green onions over the meat mixture; cover and simmer 10 minutes. Remove cover and spoon several dollops of sour cream over the dish, then sprinkle evenly with shredded cheese. Replace cover and simmer for an additional 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.
