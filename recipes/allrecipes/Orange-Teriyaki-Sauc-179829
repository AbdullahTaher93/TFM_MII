In a small saucepan, use a wire whisk to mix soy sauce, orange juice concentrate, marmalade, sugar, ginger, and mustard, if using, until sugar dissolves. Place pan over medium heat and cook, whisking occasionally, until sauce begins to boil, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk cornstarch with 2 tablespoon cold water. When sauce boils, whisk in cornstarch mixture. Return to boil, whisking constantly until lightly thickened (about 1 minute). Cover and set aside until ready to serve. If sauce becomes too cool, warm in pan over low heat. If it becomes too thick during reheating, add a few teaspoon of water.
