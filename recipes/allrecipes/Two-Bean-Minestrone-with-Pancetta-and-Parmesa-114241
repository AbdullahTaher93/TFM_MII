In a medium saucepan, cover the chickpeas with the water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Add the borlotti beans, cover and continue to simmer until the beans are tender, about 1 hour. Remove from the heat and set the beans aside. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large enameled cast-iron casserole. Add the pancetta and cook over low heat until golden, about 5 minutes. Add the onion, leek, garlic, celery and carrots and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Add the stock, thyme, bay leaves, sage and Parmesan rind and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the cabbage, kale, tomatoes and their juices and the cooked beans and their liquid. Cover and simmer for 45 minutes. Add the green beans, cover and continue to simmer for 1 hour. Discard the thyme sprigs, bay leaves, sage and Parmesan rind. Season with salt and pepper and remove from the heat. Serve in bowls. Pass the hot sauce.
