Mix coconut milk, coconut cream, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir until sugar is completely dissolved, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high and boil until coconut sauce is reduced by half, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Cool completely before using.
