In a large saucepan over medium-high heat combine tomato pulp and sugar; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and stir in the gelatin mix. Stir until the gelatin is completely dissolved. Pour into hot sterilized jars and seal. When jars are cool put them in the freezer.
