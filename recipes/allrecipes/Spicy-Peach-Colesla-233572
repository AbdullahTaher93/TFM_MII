Whisk mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, Asian chile sauce, lemon juice, rice vinegar, vegetable oil, and sugar in a bowl until dressing is smooth. Season with salt and cayenne pepper. Place cabbage into a large bowl; add peaches and 1 tablespoon chives. Lightly toss until combined. Pour dressing over coleslaw and stir until coated. Cover coleslaw with plastic wrap and chill until flavors have developed and cabbage is slightly softened, about 30 minutes. Adjust seasoning, mix again, and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon chives before serving.
