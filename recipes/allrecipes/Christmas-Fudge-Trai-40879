Arrange Fudge Sticks on a white or holiday platter to resemble train tracks, using a small amount of frosting on the bottoms to adhere. Place pound cakes onto tracks, spaced apart to resemble train cars, and frost with vanilla frosting. Place Grasshopper cookies along the bottom for wheels. Using a small amount of white frosting, pipe Deluxe Grahams to resemble windows and place onto top sides of frosted pound cake and use for front windows as well (eyes have been made using red candies and white frosting). Carefully slice one of the Sugar cones using a serrated knife for the smoke stack and cow catcher, place smoke stack into top and cow catcher in front. Slice Fudge Stripes in half and arrange along the top of the train cars and behind the front windows. Scatter shredded flake coconut around train to resemble snow. If desired, ice remaining cones with white frosting that has been colored with green food coloring as trees and place E.L. Fudge Sandwich cookies around train, adhering with additional white frosting. Use remaining candies to decorate train.
