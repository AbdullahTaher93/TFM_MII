Trim the brisket of most of the visible fat, and place in a slow cooker. Pour in beef broth, white wine and olive oil. Season with seasoning salt, allspice, peppercorns, garlic, onion flakes, red pepper flakes and the bay leaf. Cover, and cook on Low for 3 to 4 hours or until the roast is fork tender. Remove the roast to a serving platter. Stir together the cornstarch and cold water; mix into the juices in the slow cooker. Set to High, and cook for just a few minutes until thickened. Remove bay leaf, and serve as a gravy over the roast.
