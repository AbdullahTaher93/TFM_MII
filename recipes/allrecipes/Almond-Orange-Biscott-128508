Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt. In a large bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the butter and sugar for 3 minutes, or until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, orange extract, and orange peel. Beat in the flour mixture, a little at a time, until well-blended. Stir in the almonds. Divide the dough into two equal-size pieces. Refrigerate for 30 minutes, or until firm. Shape each piece into a 12 inch-long (30-cm) log and place both on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 45 minutes, or until golden. Remove to a rack to cool for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Cut each log, on a slight diagonal, into 12 1/2 inch-thick (31.25-cm) slices. Place, cut side down, on the baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes. Turn the slices over and bake for 10 minutes longer, or until dry. Cool on a rack for 2 minutes. Remove to the rack to cool completely.
