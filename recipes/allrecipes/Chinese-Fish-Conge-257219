Combine water and rice in a large pot over high heat. Bring to a boil; simmer for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until rice is tender, about 30 minutes. Combine fish, ginger, spring onion, chicken bouillon granules, and pepper in a bowl. Let marinate for 15 minutes. Stir fish mixture into the pot. Simmer gently until rice is very soft and fish is falling apart, about 20 minutes. Season with parsley and salt.
