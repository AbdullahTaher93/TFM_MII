In a medium saucepan bring water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. In a medium bowl, blend 1/2 the fruit cocktail and the whipped cream. Drain any remaining fluid from the rice and mix 1/2 into the bowl. Continue mixing in the remaining fruit cocktail and rice until the desired consistency has been attained.
