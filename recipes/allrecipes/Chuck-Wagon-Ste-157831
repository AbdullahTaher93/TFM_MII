Brown the ground beef with the onion in a large skillet over medium heat; drain the excess fat from the pan. Stir the potatoes, beef bouillon, and water into the beef. Drain the liquid from the canned green beans into the beef mixture; set the green beans aside. Cook the mixture until the potatoes are soft. Add the green beans and diced tomatoes and cook until hot. Season with salt and pepper before serving.
