In a small mixing bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Place the basil leaves and the olive oil in a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour with the salt. Add the yeast mixture, basil mixture and sun-dried tomatoes; beat together until well combined, about 3 minutes. Cover bowl with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2 quart casserole dish or 5x9 inch loaf pan. Gently remix the batter with about 20 strokes of a wooden spoon and pour into the prepared pan. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the bottom of the loaf sounds hallow when tapped. Remove loaf from pan, place on a wire rack to cool and brush with melted butter.
