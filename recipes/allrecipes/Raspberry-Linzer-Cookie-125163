In a large mixing bowl, cream butter. Gradually add 2/3 cup sugar, beating until light and fluffy. Add egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine flour and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well. Shape dough into a ball; cover and refrigerate for 30-45 minutes or until firm. On a surface dusted with confectioners' sugar, roll half of the dough to 1/8-in. thickness; cut with a floured 2-1/2-in. round cookie cutter. Repeat with remaining dough, using a floured 2-1/2-in. doughnut cutter so the center is cut out of each cookie. Beat egg whites until frothy. Combine almonds and remaining sugar. Brush each cookie with egg white and sprinkle with the almond mixture. Place on greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 6-8 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool completely. Spread 2 teaspoons of raspberry preserves over the plain side of solid cookies. Place cookies with centers cut out, almond side up, on top of the preserves, making a sandwich.
