Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble when cooled. Mix bacon, broccoli, onion, and mozzarella cheese in a bowl. Whisk mayonnaise, sugar, and vinegar in a small bowl until sugar dissolves and dressing is smooth; pour over broccoli mixture. Toss to coat.
