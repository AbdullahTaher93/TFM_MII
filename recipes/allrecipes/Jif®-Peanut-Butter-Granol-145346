Place oats in a large, shallow roasting pan or a 15 x 10 x 1-inch baking pan. Pour warm peanut butter mixture over oats and stir gently till oats are coated. Spread evenly in pan. Bake in a 300 degree F oven for 35 to 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn off oven. Meanwhile in a small bowl, cover raisins in boiling water. Let stand for 10 minutes; drain well. Stir raisins, nuts and figs into baked mixture. Return to oven and let dry 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Store in covered containers.
