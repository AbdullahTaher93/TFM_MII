Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease 2 muffin tins lightly with cooking spray. Mix flour, sugar, almond milk, 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, eggs, chia seeds, almond extract, vanilla extract, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Scoop batter into the prepared muffin tins. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and tops are light golden in color, about 40 minutes.
