Peel mango and cut fruit from pit into a blender. Add orange juice. Whirl until fruit is smoothly pureed. Taste, and if the flavor is a little flat, add lime or lemon juice to taste. If fruit is at room temperature, also whirl in ice cubes. In a large pitcher, combine puree and wine. Or fill each glass (about 1-cup-size) about 1/3 full with puree, then add wine. The fruit puree makes the wine fizz madly, so pour slowly and stir down some of the bubbles.
