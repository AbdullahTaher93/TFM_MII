You need to have a large non-stick skillet that can hold a tortilla easily. Heat the skillet to medium (or half way to medium high). Add the tortilla and let it get warm (about 1 minute) then flip it over. Place the chicken over 1/2 of the tortilla up to about 1/2 inch from the edge. Sprinkle the cheese over the chicken and then the salsa over the cheese. I like to press out a bit of the liquid from the salsa, especially if the quesadillas might sit for a little bit or might get reheated. Fold over the tortilla and flatten with a spatula. Once it starts to brown it is time to flip it. Slip a spatula under the curved, open edge and turn over the quesadilla. Let brown on that side too. Then slide it onto a plate. Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut into 3 or 4 wedges. It is best to serve them right away. But if you are going to make extra batches, they can sit in a warm oven for a few minutes. If you plan to do this, consider using pepper jack cheese and eliminate the salsa or serve it on the side.
