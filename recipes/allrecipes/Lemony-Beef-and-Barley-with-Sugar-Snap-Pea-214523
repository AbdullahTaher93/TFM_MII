Heat large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. Add ground beef, mushrooms, onion, carrot and garlic; cook 8 to 10 minutes, breaking into 3/4-inch crumbles and stirring occasionally. Pour off drippings. Stir in broth, barley, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low. Cover tightly and simmer 10 minutes. Add peas; continue cooking 2 to 5 minutes or until barley is tender. Stir in parsley and lemon peel.
