Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line cupcake pans with paper liners. Prepare the cake mix according to the package instructions. Chop 15 Snickers fun-size candy bars (about 2 cups) and fold them into the batter. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cupcake pans. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven and transfer to a wire rack. Cool completely. Cut the licorice laces into 2-inch pieces; set aside. Tint the icing with the orange food coloring and frost each cupcake. Set aside two cupcakes to use later for the creatures heads. Begin to completely cover the rest of the cupcakes with M&Ms. Press a 2-inch line of licorice laces on the opposite sides of every cupcake to form the creatures legs. Decorate the two reserved cupcakes. Make a big smile with a line of black M&Ms. Then cover the rest of the cupcake with orange M&Ms. Cut a Snickers fun-size candy bar in half for each of the creatures eyes, and use two M&Ms for the pupils. Add two licorice laces for the antennae. Line the cupcakes into the creature shape on a large platter or piece of strong cardboard.
