Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil grate. Place the lamb, egg, ginger, garlic, garam masala, and cilantro into a mixing bowl; mix well. Form the mixture into 4 patties. Cook on the preheated grill to your desired degree of doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium-well. Serve on toasted hamburger buns.
