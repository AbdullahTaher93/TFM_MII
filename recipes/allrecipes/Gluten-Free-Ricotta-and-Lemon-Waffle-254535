Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Coat heated waffle iron with cooking spray or butter. Whisk milk, ricotta cheese, and egg together in a large bowl until smooth; stir in pancake mix, coconut oil, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Mix batter until well combined. Combine blueberries, sugar, and 2 teaspoons lemon juice in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Stir and reduce the heat to low, allowing blueberry sauce to simmer. Pour 1/4 cup batter on the center of the waffle iron and close. Cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Pour blueberry sauce over the waffle. Repeat with remaining batter and sauce.
