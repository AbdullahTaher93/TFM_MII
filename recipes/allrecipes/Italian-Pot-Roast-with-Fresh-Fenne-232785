Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Trim fat from roast. Season roast with garlic powder. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a 6 quart pan with lid. Brown roast in hot oil on all sides. [Cleaning tip: Once the stove top is cool, wipe up any oil splatters with Clorox(R) Disinfecting Wipes*. Rinse hands once complete.] Combine broth, wine, garlic, and Italian seasoning in a medium bowl; pour over roast. Cover and bake for 1 1/4 hours. Add potatoes, carrots, fennel, and onion to pan. Return to oven and bake 60 to 70 minutes more or until desired doneness. Using tongs, remove roast and vegetables to a serving platter. For gravy, pour 1 1/2 cups pan juices into a bowl; skim off fat and return juices to pan. Combine water and flour in a small bowl. Whisk into juices in pan. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly; cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute more. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve gravy with roast and vegetables.
