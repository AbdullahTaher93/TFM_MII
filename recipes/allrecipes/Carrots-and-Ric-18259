In a large saucepan, combine carrots, onion, water, and salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in rice. Reduce heat to low, and cover pan. Allow to steam for 20 minutes. Stir sugar, half-and-half, and butter into rice mixture. Consistency should be creamy, not dry. Stir in some milk if necessary. Remove from heat, and serve immediately.
