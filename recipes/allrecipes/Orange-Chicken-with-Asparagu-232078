Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir chicken, garlic, and red pepper flakes until chicken is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Add asparagus and cook until bright green and starting to become tender, about 3 more minutes. Whisk soy sauce, honey, orange juice, and orange zest together in a small bowl; pour over chicken. Cook and stir until sauce coats chicken and asparagus, about 1 more minute. Serve over cooked brown rice.
