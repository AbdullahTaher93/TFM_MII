Place the potatoes in a medium saucepan. Rinse with cold water until the water rinses clear, drain, and then cover with 1 inch of water. Add a pinch of salt. Place the saucepan over high heat and bring the water to a rapid boil. Cover, reduce heat to a gentle boil, and cook until the potatoes are fork tender. Drain off the water, add the milk and butter, and place the pan back on low heat. When the milk is hot, remove the potatoes from the stove and, using a potato masher, mash them until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
