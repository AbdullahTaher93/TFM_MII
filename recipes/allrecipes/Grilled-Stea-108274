Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for direct heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is directly under the food). Rinse steaks and pat dry. In a small bowl, mix together oil and garlic. Rub or brush this mixture evenly over both sides of steaks, then sprinkle steaks to taste with pepper. Let meat stand at room temperature 15 minutes. Lay steaks on grill over a solid bed of medium coals or medium heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand just above grill level for only 4 to 5 seconds). Keep charcoal grill uncovered; close lid on gas grill. Cook steaks (see notes), turning once with tongs, until as done as desired, 10 to 12 minutes total for rare (red in center; cut to test), 12 to 14 minutes total for medium rare (cut to test), or 14 to 18 minutes total for medium (cut to test) or use instant meat sensors. Transfer meat to a clean platter. Sprinkle lightly with salt, then let rest about 5 minutes to let juices settle.
