Grind pineapple chunks in a food processor. Stir pineapple, reserved liquid, and brown sugar together in a saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until sugar dissolves and mixture thickens, about 20 minutes. Stir coconut into pineapple mixture, return to a simmer, and cook until flavors blend, about 5 minutes more. Store in a sealable jar or container.
