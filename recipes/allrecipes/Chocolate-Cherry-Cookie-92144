In a bowl, combine flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. In another bowl with a mixer on medium speed, beat to thoroughly blend 11/4 cups butter, the granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Add eggs and vanilla extract; beat to blend well. On lowest speed, stir in flour mixture, then beat on medium to blend well. With a spoon, stir in chocolate chips and cherries. Drop dough in 1-tablespoon lumps, about 2 1/2 inches apart, onto buttered or cooking parchment-lined 12- by 15-inch baking sheets. Bake cookies in a 350 degrees F oven until they puff, look dry, and are slightly cracked, about 8 to 9 minutes; if baking two sheets at once in one oven, switch their positions halfway through. Let cookies cool on sheets for 5 minutes, then use a spatula to transfer to racks to cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature up to 3 days; freeze to store longer.
