Combine water, seafood seasoning, and salt in a large pot; bring to a boil and stir potatoes and onion into water mixture. Cook at a boil until potatoes start to soften, about 8 minutes. Stir kielbasa pieces into potato mixture; continue boiling until sausage is hot, about 8 minutes more. Stir in corn halves; boil until tender, about 10 minutes. Mix shrimp into kielbasa mixture and cook until shrimp is heated through, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and drain before ladling into bowls.
