Flatten the chicken to 3/8-in. thickness; sprinkle with Cajun seasoning. In a skillet, cook chicken in oil for 5 minutes on each side or until juices run clear. Place cheese over chicken. Remove from the heat; cover and let stand for 1 minute or until cheese begins to melt. Spread dressing over both halves of rolls. Layer bottom halves with two slices of tomato, chicken and two strips of bacon; replace tops.
