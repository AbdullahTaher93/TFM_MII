Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and position rack in center of oven. Place pecans on a nonstick baking sheet. Toast in preheated oven for 5 to 10 minutes or until lightly browned and fragrant. Remove from oven and set aside. Meanwhile, trim and discard stems from sprouts. Slice sprouts in half. In a 2- to 4-quart pan over medium-high heat, bring olive oil to sizzling. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in sprouts and saute for 1 to 2 minutes to coat with oil and garlic. Pour in chicken broth, turn heat to high, cover, and bring to a rolling boil (about 5 minutes). Stir in couscous; cover and remove pan from heat. Let stand at least 5 minutes. Stir in toasted pecans and the light salt, if using (add more to taste, if desired). Cover immediately until ready to serve.
