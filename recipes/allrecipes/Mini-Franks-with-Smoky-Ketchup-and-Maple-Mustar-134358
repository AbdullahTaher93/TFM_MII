Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Separate the biscuits and cut each in half. Pull each half into an oblong shape to resemble a hot dog bun. Place the dough on 2 baking sheets lined with parchment paper and bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool, then split in half lengthwise, being careful not to slice all the way through. While the rolls bake, in a small bowl, combine the mustard and maple syrup. In a food processor, puree the chipotle chile with the reserved adobo sauce and ketchup; spoon into another small bowl. In a microwave, heat the cocktail franks; place one in each bun. Serve with the two dipping sauces.
