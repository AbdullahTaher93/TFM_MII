Cover potatoes with water in a large pot, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until tender, about 20 to 25 minutes, until the potatoes can be pierced through with a sharp knife. Drain. When cool enough to handle, remove the skins and mash the potatoes in a large bowl. Heat 2 tbs. butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the foam subsides. Add the onions, celery, salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Add the apples, apple cider and spices, and cook, stirring, until the apples are tender but still hold their shape, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir into the sweet potatoes, along with the bread crumbs. Adjust the seasonings and moisten, if needed, with the chicken or vegetable broth. Use as is as a stuffing, or turn into a buttered 9-by-9-inch baking dish and dot with the remaining 1/4 cup butter cut into small pieces. Bake at 350 for 20 minutes, until golden brown.
