In a 6- to 8-quart covered pan over high heat, bring 4 quarts water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook until barely tender to bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, combine mushrooms and 1/2 cup boiling water in a small bowl. Let stand until mushrooms are softened, about 15 minutes. While spaghetti cooks and mushrooms soak, combine onion, ham, and olive oil in a 12- to 14-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Stir often until onion is lightly browned, 7 to 8 minutes. When mushrooms are softened, remove from liquid with a fork. Pour liquid into a bowl or glass measure through a fine strainer to catch any debris; discard debris and reserve liquid. Finely chop mushrooms and add them to frying pan along with their liquid, the broth, red wine, and tomato paste; stir until well blended. Discard any solidified fat from pot roast and gravy. Scrape gravy from meat into frying pan. Cut beef across the grain into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Lay slices over the onion mixture. Cover pan and simmer over low heat until beef is hot, 7 to 8 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. When spaghetti is ready, drain well and pour onto a wide rimmed platter or into a wide shallow bowl. With a slotted spoon, arrange beef slices over pasta. Spoon sauce over meat and pasta. Sprinkle with parsley.
