Bring vegetable broth, hoisin, and sesame oil to a boil in a saucepan; add quinoa. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until quinoa is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat; cool slightly. Combine black beans, eggs, bread, water, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; mash thoroughly. Add 1 1/2 cup cooled quinoa and mix well. Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Form each burger patty using about 1/2 cup of the burger mixture; transfer to the skillet. Cook until golden brown; about 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towel-lined dish.
