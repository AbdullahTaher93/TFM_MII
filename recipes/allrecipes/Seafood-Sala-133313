Drain the seafood and let cool in a bowl set inside a larger bowl of ice. In a bowl, whisk together the olive oil, garlic, basil and parsley. Add salt and black pepper to taste. In a large bowl, combine the chopped celery, tomatoes, juice of 3 lemons and the crushed red pepper. Add the cooled seafood and the dressing and toss to coat; marinate for 1 hour.
