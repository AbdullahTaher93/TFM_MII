In a large resealable plastic bag, combine 2 tablespoons flour, ginger, salt and pepper. Add the pork; shake to coat. In a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat, stir-fry pork in oil for 5-7 minutes or until no longer pink. Drain pineapple, reserving juice; set pineapple aside. Place the remaining flour in a bowl; stir in reserved juice until smooth. Add sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce and chili sauce. Stir into pork. Add green pepper, water chestnuts, bean sprouts and pineapple. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Serve over rice.
