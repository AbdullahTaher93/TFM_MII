Cut off the peel and pith from the oranges and grapefruit. Working over a large bowl, cut out the sections of fruit from between the membranes, letting the sections fall into the bowl. Squeeze the juice from the membranes over the fruit; discard the membranes. Add the cranberries and stir to combine. Garnish with the mint, if using.
