Place roast, rib ends up, in a shallow roasting pan; sprinkle with seasoned salt. Cover rib ends with foil. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours. Meanwhile, saute mushrooms and celery in butter until tender. Stir in bread cubes, salt and pepper. Spoon into the center of the roast. Brush sides of roast with preserves. Bake 1 hour longer or until a meat thermometer inserted into meat between ribs reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C); remove foil. If desired, thread cranberries on a 20-in. piece of thin string or thread. Transfer roast to a serving platter. Loop the cranberry string in and out of the rib ends.
