Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Remove tops, core, ribs, and seeds from bell peppers. Cut them into quarters and flatten to facilitate cutting into small dice. Heat oil over medium-high heat and saute shallots to soften before adding in peppers. Cook, stirring often, until slightly softened but colors are still bright. Remove from heat and season to taste with salt and pepper. Lightly grease 4 cups of a muffin tin and insert one slice of Canadian bacon into each cup. Divide bell pepper mixture among the 4 cups and carefully crack one egg into each bacon cup on top of the peppers. Bake in center rack of oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until whites are set but yolks are still slightly runny (bake longer or shorter according to taste.) Season eggs to taste and carefully remove by gently scooping out bacon cups with spoons and rubber spatulas. Serve garnished with fresh herbs.
