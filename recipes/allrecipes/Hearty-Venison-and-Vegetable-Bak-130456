Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Toss the venison, mushrooms, green onion, fennel, and parsnips with olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Transfer to a glass baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until the vegetables and venison are browned and tender, about 50 minutes.
