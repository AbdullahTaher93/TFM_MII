Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orzo in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes; drain. Whisk olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and basil together in a small bowl for the dressing. Combine cooked orzo, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, olives, and Parmesan cheese in a large bowl. Stir dressing into the orzo mixture until all ingredients are well coated. Can be served warm or chilled.
