Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, cream together eggs, butter and sugar. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda and salt. Stir the flour mixture into the egg mixture. Fold in the pineapple and nuts. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan. Bake in preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean.
