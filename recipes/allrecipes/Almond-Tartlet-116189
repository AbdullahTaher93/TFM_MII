In a small bowl, combine the flour, sugar and lemon peel; cut in butter until crumbly. Add egg and toss with a fork until dough forms a ball. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. Place almond paste in a food processor or blender; cover and process until crumbly. Add the sugar, butter, extracts and eggs; cover and process until smooth. On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut into thirty 2-1/2-in. circles; press dough into miniature muffin cups coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes. Spoon 1 teaspoon filling into each shell; sprinkle with a few almonds. Bake 10 minutes longer or until filling is set and pastry is lightly browned. Brush jam over tarts. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely.
