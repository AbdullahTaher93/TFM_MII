Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid and return pasta to the pot. In a large skillet, over medium heat, bring 1/2 cup water, oil and sausages to a boil, cover and cook until the water evaporates, about 6-7 minutes. Remove lid and cook until sausages are well browned, 6-7 minutes longer. Remove sausage, cool slightly and slice into bite-size rounds. Add onions, peppers and squash to the hot skillet. Season lightly with salt and pepper; cook until tender and golden, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute longer. Add tomatoes, sausage and 1 cup basil; simmer to blend flavors, about 5 minutes longer. Pour tomato mixture into pot with pasta, and over low heat stir in Parmesan cheese. Add enough pasta cooking liquid to moisten thoroughly if necessary; toss to coat. Serve with extra cheese and basil passed separately.
