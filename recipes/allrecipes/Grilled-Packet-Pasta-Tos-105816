Heat grill. Mix tomatoes, onion, garlic and olive oil in a medium bowl. Transfer mixture to heavy-duty aluminum foil grill bag; seal bag. Place grill bag on grill over medium heat. Cover and cook 15 minutes or until onion is tender. While vegetables are grilling, cook and drain pasta as directed on package. To serve, place cooked pasta and grilled vegetables in large bowl with basil and prosciutto; toss. Season with plenty of black pepper and top with shredded Parmesan cheese, if you like.
