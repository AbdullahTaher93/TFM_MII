Toast cardamom pods in a small skillet, shaking pan, over low heat 3 minutes, until fragrant. (For ground cardamom, toast 1 minute.) Cool. Pinch pods to open slightly. Sprinkle the 1/2 teaspoon salt and the pepper over chicken. Combine yogurt, ginger, garlic, jalapeno, paprika and cardamom in a large bowl. Add chicken, turning pieces several times until well coated. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and marinate chicken in the refrigerator overnight. Make cucumber relish: Combine cucumber, fennel, onion, vinegar, 2 teaspoons oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, the sugar, and cumin in a bowl; set aside. Heat and oil grill over medium heat. Arrange chicken with any marinade on grill. Cover and grill chicken 20 minutes, turning every 5 minutes, until chicken is lightly charred and an instant-read meat thermometer registers 180 degrees F when inserted in thickest part. Serve with cucumber relish.
