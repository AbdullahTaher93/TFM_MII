In a 2-quart microwave-safe dish, mix the onion and oil until the onion is coated. Nuke for 4 to 6 minutes, or until the onion is soft and clear. Stir in the garlic, caponata, tomato sauce, and Italian seasoning and heat for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the sauce thickens. Slice the polenta into 1/2-inch-thick circles and place a single layer of them in the sauce. Spoon some sauce evenly over each circle. Microwave for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the polenta is hot. Top with the cheese.
