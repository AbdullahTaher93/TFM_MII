Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Put bread crumbs in a shallow dish. Press swai fish, skin-side down, in bread crumbs. Spread creamy salad dressing onto exposed side of each fillet. Arrange fillets in a baking dish and top with Asiago cheese; season with salt and pepper. Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 45 to 60 minutes.
