Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Toss apples with sugar and cinnamon in a 1-quart baking dish. Cover and bake 30 minutes. Uncover and mash coarsely with a fork. Mix granola with butter. Sprinkle over applesauce. Bake an additional 10 to 15 minutes or until granola is golden brown and apples are completely tender.
