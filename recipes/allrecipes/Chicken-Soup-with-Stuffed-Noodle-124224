Place chicken, water, salt and pepper in a large soup kettle. Cover and bring to a boil; skim fat. Reduce heat; cover and simmer 1-1/2 hours or until chicken is tender. Debone chicken and cut into chunks; return to broth. Meanwhile, for noodles, mix flour and salt in a medium bowl. Make a well in the center. Beat together the egg, water and oil; pour into well. Stir together, forming a dough. Turn dough onto a floured surface; knead 8-10 times. Roll into a 16-in. x 12-in. rectangle. Combine filling ingredients; mix well. Sprinkle over dough to within 1/2 in. of edge; pat down. Moisten edges with water. Roll up jelly-roll style from long end; cut into 1/2-in slices. Add noodles to gently boiling soup and cook for 6-8 minutes or until tender.
