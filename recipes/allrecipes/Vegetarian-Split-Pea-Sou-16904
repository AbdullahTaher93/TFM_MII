Bring a medium-size pot of salted water to a boil, add orzo and cook until al dente. Drain well. In a large skillet, saute onion, celery, garlic, and carrots in olive oil for 5 minutes. Place vegetables, vegetable broth, peas, thyme, chile pepper, salt and pepper in a pressure cooker. Cover. When pressure cooker reaches full pressure, cook for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the pressure cooker from the heat. Add cooked orzo and serve. Note: If you would like creamier soup, puree soup in a food processor or blender. Add additional broth to bring the soup to the consistency you desire.
