In a saucepan, combine jam, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic and pepper. Bring to a boil; boil for 1 minute. Cut chicken wings into three sections; discard wing tips. Place wings in a large bowl; add raspberry mixture and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours. Line a 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan with foil and heavily grease the foil. Using a slotted spoon and reserving the marinade, place wings in pan. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes, turning once. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, bring marinade to a rolling boil; boil for 1 minute. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered for 10-15 minutes or until thickened. Brush over wings. Bake 20-25 minutes longer, turning and basting once, or until chicken juices run clear.
