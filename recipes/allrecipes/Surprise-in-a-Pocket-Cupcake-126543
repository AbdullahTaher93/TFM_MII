Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line 36 muffin tins with paper baking cups. Separate 1 egg yolk from white. In large bowl, beat cream cheese until fluffy. Gradually beat in 1/3 cup of sweetened condensed milk and egg yolk. Set aside. In large bowl, combine cake mix, remaining sweetened condensed milk, water, 2 eggs and egg white. With mixer, beat on low speed until moistened; beat on high speed for 2 minutes. Divide batter among prepared muffin tins, filling each 2/3 full. Add a rounded teaspoonful of cream cheese mixture to center of each muffin tin. Bake 18 minutes or until tops spring back when lightly touched. (Filling will sink during baking). Cool on wire rack. Frost cupcakes with chocolate frosting (about 2 tablespoons). Decorate one at a time (do not wait until end to decorate, as top of frosting sets quickly). Store leftovers at room temperature. Chocolate Frosting: In heavy medium-sized saucepan, combine sweetened condensed milk, chocolate chips and salt. Cook and stir over medium heat until chips melt; cook and stir 3 minutes more. Remove from heat; cool 15 minutes. With mixer, beat in confectioners sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract until light and fluffy.
