Combine okra, tomato, and onion in a large bowl. Add the grits, eggs, salt, and pepper and blend together using your hands. Heat oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Form patties 2 1/2 inches in diameter, about 1/2 the size of a hamburger. Place the fritter in the pan and cook until golden brown, about five minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side, about five minutes more. Remove and drain on paper towels. Serve immediately.
