In a small bowl mash 2/3 cup of beans to a smooth paste. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the remaining beans with the water. When heated through, stir in garlic, pepper, salt and liquid smoke. Stir the bean paste into the whole beans and mix well. Stir in the onion and cook for 10 minutes, or until onions are slightly cooked.
