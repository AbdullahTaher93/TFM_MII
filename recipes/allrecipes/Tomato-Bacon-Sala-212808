If using bacon, crumble into bite size pieces. In a small bowl combine grape tomatoes, basil and parsley and toss well. Place salad greens on a platter; arrange the tomatoes and onions in concentric circles, alternating the colored tomatoes. Place the grape tomato mixture in the center. Sprinkle salad with crumbled bacon. Drizzle with either Marzetti Chunky Blue Cheese Salad Dressing and serve additional dressing on the side. Salad is best served right after it is completely assembled.
