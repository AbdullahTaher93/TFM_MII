Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix coconut oil, turmeric, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and ginger together in a small bowl. Place pumpkin seeds in a bowl; drizzle coconut oil mixture on top. Stir well to coat all seeds with the mixture. Spread evenly on the parchment paper; drizzle any remaining oil on top. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 15 minutes. Turn off oven. Stir seeds to flip over. Leave seeds inside the oven as it cools.
