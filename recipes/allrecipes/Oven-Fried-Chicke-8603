Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease one 13x9 inch baking dish. In a shallow dish, combine the biscuit mix, pecans, paprika, salt, poultry seasoning and sage. Dip the chicken pieces in the evaporated milk then coat generously with the pecan mixture. Place pieces in the prepared baking dish and drizzle with the melted butter or margarine. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour or until juices run clear.
