Mix oil, soy sauce, and peanut butter together in a bowl until blended and creamy. Stir in spring onion, sesame seeds, garlic, red chile powder, salt, and pepper. Add pork to marinade; turn to coat. Marinate pork in the refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Thread pork, onion, mushrooms, red bell pepper, and zucchini onto skewers. Transfer to the baking sheet. Pour marinade on top. Bake in the preheated oven until pork is tender and browned, about 30 minutes.
