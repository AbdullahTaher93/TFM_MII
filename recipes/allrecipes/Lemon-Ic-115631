In a saucepan, combine water, sugar and lemon juice. Bring to a boil, stirring. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Chill until cold, about 2 hours. Pour into a shallow metal pan; freeze for 30 minutes, or until icy around the edges. Stir and return to freezer; repeat every 20 minutes until firm, about 1 hour. To serve, scoop lemon ice into chilled bowls.
