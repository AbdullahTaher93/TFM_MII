Mix ground beef, onion, seasonings and Worcestershire sauce in medium bowl until well blended. Shape into 4 patties. Sprinkle patties with additional seasoned salt before grilling, if desired. Grill over medium heat 4 to 6 minutes per side or until burgers are cooked through (internal temperature of 160 degrees F). Toast rolls on the grill, open-side down, about 30 seconds or until golden. Serve burgers on toasted rolls. Garnish with desired toppings and condiments.
