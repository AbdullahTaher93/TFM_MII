In a bowl with a mixer, beat butter with sugar and molasses until very smooth. In another bowl, combine flour, baking soda, ginger, espresso powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Stir into butter mixture and beat until blended. Divide dough in half. Flatten each portion with your hands to make a 1-inch-thick round. Wrap each portion airtight and freeze until firm, about 1 hour. With a floured rolling pin on a board lightly coated with all-purpose flour, roll dough, a portion at a time, until 1/4 inch thick. Cut dough using floured people-shaped cookie cutters. If dough is too soft to handle, freeze briefly until firm. With a wide spatula or your fingers, transfer cut dough to 12- by 15-inch baking pans, spacing about 1 inch apart. Gather scraps, pat into a ball, and repeat rolling and cutting. Bake in a 300 degrees F oven until edges are brown, 15 to 20 minutes; if using more than 1 pan in 1 oven, switch pan positions halfway through baking. With a wide spatula, transfer cookies to racks to cool. If hot cookies start to break, slide a thin spatula under them to release, let stand on pan to firm, about 5 minutes, then transfer to racks. Leave plain or decorate with store-bought decorative icing. Serve cookies, store airtight up to one week, or freeze to store longer.
