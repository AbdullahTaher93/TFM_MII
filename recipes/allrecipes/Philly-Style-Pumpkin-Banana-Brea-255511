Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 7x3-inch loaf pans with 2 teaspoons butter. Mix flour, sugar, walnuts, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger together in a large bowl. Cube 2 tablespoons butter into the bowl. Whisk pumpkin puree, vegetable oil, eggs, banana, and honey together in a bowl until smooth. Fold in flour mixture just until blended. Pour into the prepared loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes; invert onto a wire rack to cool completely.
