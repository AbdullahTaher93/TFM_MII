Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread bread cubes over a baking sheet. Bake bread cubes in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Whisk olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice, parsley, and salt in a large bowl. Fold in toasted bread, tomatoes, onion, olives, basil, and Parmesan cheese until vinegar dressing is evenly distributed.
