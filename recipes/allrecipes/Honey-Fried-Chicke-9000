Season chicken pieces with salt and pepper, then coat each seasoned chicken piece with honey. In a shallow dish or bowl, mix together the garlic powder, chicken bouillon granules and flour. Dredge honey coated chicken pieces in flour mixture, coating completely. Fill a large, heavy skillet with oil to a depth of one inch. Heat over medium-high heat. Fry chicken for at least 5 minutes per side, until no longer pink and juices run clear.
