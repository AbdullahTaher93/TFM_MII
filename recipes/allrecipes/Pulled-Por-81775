In a small bowl, mix together the dry rub ingredients. Place the roast in a large bowl and sprinkle the mixed spices over the entire roast, then rub it in. If you wear those thin latex gloves then the rub will stick to the roast better. Cover and refrigerate for several hours but overnight is best so then you can start the roast in the morning. Preheat oven to 275 degrees F. Remove roast from the refrigerator. Pat the meat to be sure that the rub is still sticking. Place in a roasting pan and cook at 275 degrees F for about 8 hours or when the meat easily falls apart. Transfer the roast to a platter and let it rest for 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile, put the roasting pan over medium-high heat and add the water to the roasting pan to deglaze, being sure that you scrape up all those yummy brown bits. A wooden spoon is good for this step. Then add the barbecue sauce, stir and heat through. Then reduce heat to lowest setting. After the roast has rested, it is time to pull it. Stabilize the roast with a fork that has long tongs. Then with another fork start pulling the meat apart and place the meat in a shallow bowl. Pour in a little bit of the barbecue sauce at a time; just until the meat is very lightly coated (don't drown it). Serve with the extra sauce on the side.
