Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Brown chicken on both sides and transfer to prepared baking dish. Season with salt, pepper, and paprika to taste. Combine mushroom soup, onion soup mix, sour cream, lemon juice, and dill weed. Pour over chicken. Bake in preheated oven for one hour, or until chicken pieces are done and sauce is browned. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
