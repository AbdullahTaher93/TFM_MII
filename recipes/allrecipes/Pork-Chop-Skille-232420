Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook pork chops in the melted butter until cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove pork chops from skillet and cut into bite-sized pieces. Pour water and long grain and wild rice mix with herbs into the same skillet; stir well. Layer pork chop pieces over rice. Pour corn over pork chops layer; top with tomatoes. Cover skillet and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 30 to 40 minutes.
