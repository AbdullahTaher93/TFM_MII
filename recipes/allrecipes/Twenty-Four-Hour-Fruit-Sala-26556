In a medium saucepan, whisk together the egg, lemon juice, butter, sugar and 1 tablespoon of the reserved pineapple juice over low heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until mixture becomes thick. Whisk in poppy seeds. Remove from heat and chill. Once dressing is cold, fold in whipped cream, pineapple, orange segments, fruit cocktail and marshmallows. Cover and refrigerate 24 hours. Just before serving, mix in the banana.
