In a small bowl, beat egg whites with an electric mixer at high speed until foamy. Add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until whites hold stiff, glossy peaks. Add lemon juice and flour; fold in gently with a spatula until blended. Fold in coconut. Line 12 muffin cups (2 1/2 inch wide) with paper liners. Drop equal portions of the coconut mixture into each cup. Bake in a 300 degrees F oven until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool on racks.
