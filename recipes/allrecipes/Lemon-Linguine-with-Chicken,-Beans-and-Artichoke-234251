Cook pasta according to package directions, adding the artichoke hearts the last 5 minutes of cooking; drain. Cover and keep warm. Meanwhile, season both sides of the chicken breasts with lemon pepper seasoning. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Cook chicken in hot oil for 10 to 12 minutes or until no pink remains (165 degrees F), turning once (reduce heat to medium, if necessary, to prevent overbrowning). Remove chicken to a cutting board. Slice chicken. Cover and keep warm. Add water to skillet, stirring to scrape up browned bits. Add evaporated milk, cream cheese, 3 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese, the salt and pepper to the skillet. Whisk constantly over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes or until cheese is melted and sauce begins to thicken. Add cooked pasta mixture and canned seasoned green beans to the skillet. Cook for 2 minutes or until heated through. Divide pasta mixture among 4 shallow bowls. Top each serving with one chicken breast and the remaining Parmesan cheese. Serve with lemon wedges.
