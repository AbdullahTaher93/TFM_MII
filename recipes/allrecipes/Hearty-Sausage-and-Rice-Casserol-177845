Cook the sausage in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until the sausage is well browned, stirring often. Pour off any fat. Add the mushrooms, celery, pepper, onion, thyme, marjoram and seasoning packet from the rice blend to the skillet and cook until the vegetables are tender-crisp. Stir the sausage mixture, broth, soup, rice blend and 1/2 cup cheese in a 13x9x2-inch shallow baking dish. Cover the baking dish. Bake at 375 degrees F for 1 hour or until the rice is tender. Stir the rice mixture before serving. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese.
