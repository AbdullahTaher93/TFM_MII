Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Melt butter with olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add shallots, garlic and habanero pepper, and cook until lightly browned. Pour cream into a saucepan, and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Stir in the ingredients from the skillet, along with the tomato. Mix in the flour and black pepper, and simmer until thickened, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in Parmesan cheese, and remove from heat. Allow sauce to cool for a few minutes before serving over pasta.
