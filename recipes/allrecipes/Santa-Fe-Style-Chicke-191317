In a non-reactive bowl combine yogurt with the spices and 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro. Mix well. Add chicken and toss to coat. Cover and let stand 1 hour. Lightly oil grill and pre-heat 5 to 10 minutes (or pre-heat broiler). Place marinated chicken pieces on heated grill or broiler pan. Cook chicken 3 to 4 minutes per side basting occasionally with juices. Serve chicken sprinkled with remaining cilantro.
