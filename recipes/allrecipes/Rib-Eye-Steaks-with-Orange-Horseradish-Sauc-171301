Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above the cooking grate only 2 to 3 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). Sprinkle 4 teaspoons each salt and pepper all over steaks. Place steaks on oiled cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook, turning once with a wide spatula, until done to your liking (cut to test), 9 to 10 minutes total for rare (reddish-pink), 11 to 12 minutes for medium-rare (pink). While steaks are grilling, in a bowl, mix together sour cream, horseradish, and orange zest. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer steaks to a carving board, loosely tent with foil, let rest 10 minutes, then cut each in half and serve, accompanied by orange-horseradish sauce.
