Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Spray a 9 in x 13 in glass baking dish with non-stick cooking spray. Cut each biscuit into 6 pieces and place in a large mixing bowl. Toss together biscuit pieces with Ragu(R) Classic Alfredo sauce, onions, garlic, bacon, mozzarella cheese, and black pepper. Pour biscuit mixture evenly into the pan and top with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes or until biscuits are done. Make sure the biscuits in the middle are cooked through.
