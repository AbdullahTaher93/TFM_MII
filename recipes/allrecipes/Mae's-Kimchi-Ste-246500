Heat sesame oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add pork and cook until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir garlic into pork mixture and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir dashi stock and kimchi into the pork mixture; bring to a boil. Stir in gochujang and gochugaru; simmer until stew is thickened slightly, about 20 minutes. Stir tofu, zucchini, onion, and green chile peppers into the stew; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and garnish with green onion.
