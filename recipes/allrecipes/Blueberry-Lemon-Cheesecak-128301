Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch (23-cm) springform pan with nonstick spray. In a medium bowl, mix the crumbs, jelly, margarine, and sugar. Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Refrigerate while preparing the filling. In a large bowl, use an electric mixer set at medium speed to beat together the two types of cream cheeses until they are light and fluffy. Add the milk, egg, lemon juice, lemon juice, lemon peel, and vanilla, and beat until smooth. Spread the blueberries, if desired, over the bottom of the crust and top with the blueberry filling. Bake for 15 minutes. Pour the cheese mixture over the blueberry layer. Place the pan inside a larger one filled with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. Bake the cake until its edges are lightly browned and the center is nearly set, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool the cake on a wire rack for 30 minutes, then refrigerate it overnight.
