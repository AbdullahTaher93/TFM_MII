In a large bowl combine the whisked eggs, garlic powder and red pepper flakes. Add the ground pork and breadcrumbs and mix together until evenly combined. Form the ground pork mixture into small meatballs, each the size of a golf ball. Insert a mozzarella ball in the center of each meatball, taking care to re-form the meatball around the cheese once its been added. (The cheese should not be visible.) Place the tomato sauce in the bottom of a slow cooker and add the meatballs on top. Turn the slow cooker on and cook over high heat for 6 hours or low heat for 8 hours. Carefully rotate the meatballs after half the cooking time to make sure they cook evenly. To serve, place three meatballs plus sauce in a submarine bun.
