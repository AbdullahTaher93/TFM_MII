In a medium saucepan of boiling water, cook pasta according to package directions. Drain and return to pan. Meanwhile, in a large frying pan over medium-high heat, cook bell pepper, onion, and carrots with 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt, stirring often, until barely tender-crisp to the bite, about 3 minutes. Add onion mixture and peas to pasta mixture; stir gently to mix. In a bowl, stir remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon each hot sauce and pepper; pour over pasta mixture and stir until well coated. If you like, add more pepper and hot sauce to taste. Just before serving, stir in lime juice. Scrape into a serving bowl and serve warm or at room temperature.
