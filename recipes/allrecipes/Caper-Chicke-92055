Place chicken breast halves in a single layer in a 9- by 13-inch baking pan. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven until meat is no longer pink in center of thickest part; cut to test (25 to 30 minutes). When chicken is nearly done, in a 1 1/2- to 2-quart pan combine tomatoes and capers; stir over medium heat until hot (about 3 minutes). Transfer chicken to a platter and top with tomato mixture; season to taste with salt. Sprinkle with basil and cheese.
