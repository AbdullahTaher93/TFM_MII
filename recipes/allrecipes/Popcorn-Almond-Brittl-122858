In a greased 13-in.x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan, combine popcorn, almonds and cherries. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes. Turn oven off and keep mixture warm in the oven. Meanwhile, in a large heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, corn syrup, water and salt; cook and stir over low heat until sugar is dissolved. Cook over medium heat, without stirring, until a candy thermometer reads 305 degrees F-310 degrees F (hard-crack stage). Remove from the heat; stir in butter and vanilla. Immediately pour over popcorn mixture; toss gently. Spread onto a greased baking sheet. When cool, break into small pieces.
