Microwave the salmon, the bell pepper, and the pasta entree according to their package instructions. Heat the olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Toss the garlic and spinach into the heated skillet, turning frequently with tongs until the leaves are wilted (about 2 minutes). Drain any liquid from the bell pepper, then add it to the pasta along with the salmon, roughly chopped. Stir the spinach into the pasta mixture.
