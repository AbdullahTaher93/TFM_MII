Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together in a bowl until creamy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until smooth. Combine flour and baking powder in a bowl. Mix gradually into the butter mixture. Beat in vanilla extract until mixed. Fold in candy a little at a time. Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto 2 baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are golden, about 10 minutes.
