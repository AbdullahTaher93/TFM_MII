Cut cores out of Brussels sprouts using a paring knife. Peel layers apart to separate individual leaves; place leaves in a large bowl. Whisk maple syrup, olive oil, Dijon mustard, and apple cider vinegar together in a small bowl. Drizzle over Brussels sprout leaves; add cranberries and toss to coat. Add almonds and toss again before serving.
