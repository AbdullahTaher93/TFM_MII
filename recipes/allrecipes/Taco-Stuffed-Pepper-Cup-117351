Cut peppers in half lengthwise and remove seeds. Cook in boiling water for 5 minutes; drain and set aside. In a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Add the beans, tomato sauce and taco seasoning; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Place pepper halves in an ungreased 8-in. square baking dish. Fill with meat mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes or until peppers are tender. Top with sour cream, cheese and tomato.
