Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch glass baking dish with cooking spray. Stir together the soup, mayonnaise, sherry, and nutmeg. Layer half of the green beans into the prepared baking dish. Spread with half of the chicken, half of the sauce, and half of the Parmesan cheese; then repeat the layers. Sprinkle the top with a little paprika. Bake in preheated oven until the Parmesan cheese has turned golden brown, and the casserole is hot, 45 to 60 minutes.
