In a large bowl, beat butter, shortening, and sugar until creamy; beat in molasses and lemon peel. In another bowl, stir together flour, baking soda, ground ginger, cinnamon, and cloves; gradually add to butter mixture, blending thoroughly. Add almonds and candied ginger and mix until well combined. Divide dough into thirds. Shape each third into a roll about 1 1/2 inches in diameter; wrap rolls in waxed or parchment paper and refrigerate until firm (at least 4 hours) or for up to 1 week; freeze for longer storage. Unwrap dough. (If dough is frozen, let thaw in refrigerator.) Using a sharp knife, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices; place slices about 1 inch apart on lightly buttered baking sheets and gently press a slivered almond into the middle of each cookie, if desired. Bake in a 350 degree F oven for 7 to 10 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Transfer to racks and let cool. Store airtight.
