Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, mushrooms, garlic, salt, and black pepper with olive oil and balsamic vinegar until onion is translucent and mushrooms are lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Mix goat cheese and cream cheese together in a small bowl. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Warm a tortilla on the hot skillet for 1 minute; flip and repeat on other side. Spread 1/4 goat cheese mixture onto warmed tortilla; spoon 1/4 mushroom mixture on one half of tortilla. Sprinkle 1/4 mozzarella cheese over mushroom mixture. Cook quesadilla until mozzarella cheese begins to melt, about 5 minutes; fold tortilla over melted cheese and press to seal. Repeat with remaining tortillas and fillings.
