Heat 1-inch vegetable oil in a deep-sided skillet over medium heat. Whisk buttermilk, paprika, black pepper, and lemon zest together in a wide bowl. Pour flour into a separate wide bowl. Place a paper towel-lined plate near the stove top. Dip 1/3 of asparagus in buttermilk mixture. Transfer asparagus to flour and coat thoroughly. Repeat with a second layer of buttermilk mixture and flour. Fry coated asparagus in the hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer to the paper towel-lined plate. Repeat the battering and frying process until all the sticks are cooked. Serve immediately.
