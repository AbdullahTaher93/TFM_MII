Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring water to a boil in a pot. Stir rice into boiling water, cover pot with a lid, and remove pot from heat. Let rice steam until water is absorbed completely, about 5 minutes. Combine rice, chicken, mushrooms, green beans, cream of chicken soup, celery, sour cream, mayonnaise, onion, garlic, seasoning blend, salt, black pepper, monosodium glutamate, and red pepper flakes in a large bowl; stir until evenly mixed. Spread the mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish; top with mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle potato chips over the cheese. Bake in preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the potato chips are golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
