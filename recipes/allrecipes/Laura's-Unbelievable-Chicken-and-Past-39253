Bring large pot of water to a boil, and stir in penne pasta. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, cook chicken cubes in broth; simmering until done, about 10 minutes. Stir in cubed cream cheese and spinach. Return to simmer, and cook about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in cherry tomatoes, and cook about 3 minutes more. In a large bowl, mix together cooked, drained pasta and sauce. Let stand a few minutes before serving.
