Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. In a large bowl, cream together butter and brown sugar. Beat in maple syrup, egg, cream and vanilla. In a separate bowl, stir together flour, oats, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture just long enough to incorporate. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from pans and place on a wire rack to cool before serving.
