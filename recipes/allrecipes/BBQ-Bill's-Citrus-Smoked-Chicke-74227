Place the whole chicken into a large resealable plastic bag. Sprinkle in garlic powder, then pour in enough lemon-lime soda to cover the bird. Seal the bag, and place in the refrigerator overnight to marinate. Light charcoal in an outdoor smoker, and wait until the temperature is at 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Remove chicken from the bag, and place on the grill grate. Discard marinade. Cover, and cook for 10 hours. Occasionally toss a handful of soaked wood chips on the coals.
