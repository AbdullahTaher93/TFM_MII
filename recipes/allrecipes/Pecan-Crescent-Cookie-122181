In a large mixing bowl, cream butter, sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy. Gradually add flour. Stir in pecans. Shape rounded teaspoonfuls of dough into 2-1/2-in. logs and shape into crescents. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 325 degrees F for 20-22 minutes or until set and bottoms are lightly browned. Let stand for 2-3 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.
