In a bowl, combine the flour, 1 cup sugar, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In another bowl, beat the egg, egg whites, buttermilk, milk, ricotta cheese, oil and vanilla. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in apples. Coat muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray or use paper-liners; fill three-fourths full. Combine the remaining sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over batter. Bake at 400 degrees F for 18-22 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
