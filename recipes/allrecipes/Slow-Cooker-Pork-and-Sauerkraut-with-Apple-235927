Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown pork chops in hot skillet, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain. Arrange apples and onion in the bottom of a slow cooker; top with browned pork chops. Pour in enough water to cover bottom of the slow cooker crock. Cook on High for 3 hours (or on Low for 6 hours). Add sauerkraut and fennel seed to pork chop mixture. Cook for 1 more hour.
