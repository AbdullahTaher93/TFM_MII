In a small skillet over medium-low heat, cook sugar, without stirring for 12-14 minutes or until melted. Add almonds; stir quickly to coat. Remove from the heat; pour onto waxed paper to cool. In a large serving bowl, combine the ice berg lettuce, romaine, oranges, avocado, celery, onions and almonds. In a jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine the dressing ingredients; shake well. Drizzle over salad; toss gently to coat.
