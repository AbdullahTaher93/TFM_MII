Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch casserole dish. In a large bowl, whisk together the processed cheese, sour cream, mushroom soup, celery soup, water, 1/2 of the margarine and salt and pepper to taste. Place potatoes in prepared dish, add soup mixture and mix well. Mix crumbs with remaining melted margarine and sprinkle over top of potato casserole. Bake at 325 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 40 to 50 minutes or until crumbs are lightly browned and casserole is bubbling.
