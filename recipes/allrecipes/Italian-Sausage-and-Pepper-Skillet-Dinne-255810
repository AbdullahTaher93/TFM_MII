Melt buttery spread over medium heat in a non-stick skillet. Add onion, bell pepper, and sausage. Saute until sausage is lightly browned on the edges and vegetables are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer mixture to a bowl; keep warm. In the same pan, prepare Knorr(R) Rice Sides(TM) - Herb & Butter according to package directions. When rice is tender, transfer the meat and vegetable mixture back to the skillet. Increase heat to medium low. Stir in milk, garlic, and Parmesan cheese. Serve with additional cheese if desired.
