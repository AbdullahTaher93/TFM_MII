In a skillet, saute green pepper in butter until tender. Remove green pepper, reserving drippings. Combine green pepper, bread and ham; place in an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Add cheese to drippings; cook and stir over low heat until cheese melts. Pour over bread mixture. Beat eggs, milk and mustard; pour over cheese. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Bake, uncovered, at 300 degrees F for 1 hour.
