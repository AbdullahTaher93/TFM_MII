In a mixing bowl, combine the oil, sugars, egg and vanilla; mix well. Combine flour, baking soda and salt; gradually add to sugar mixture. Divide dough in half. On a greased baking sheet, shape each portion into a 15-in. x 3-in. rectangle about 3 in. apart. Sprinkle chocolate chips and nuts if desired over dough; press lightly. Bake at 375 degrees F for 6-7 minutes. (Bake for 8-9 minutes for crispier cookies.) Cool for 5 minutes. Cut with a serrated knife into 1-in. strips; remove to wire racks to cool.
