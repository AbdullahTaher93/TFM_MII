Sterilize jars and lids by immersing in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. In a saucepan, combine the raspberries, bell pepper, and jalapeno peppers with the sugar and cider vinegar. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and boil rapidly for 1 minute. Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in the liquid pectin, and run the mixture through a strainer to remove bits of peppers. Pour the strained liquid into sterilized jars, and seal. Store in a cool dark place. Refrigerate after opening.
