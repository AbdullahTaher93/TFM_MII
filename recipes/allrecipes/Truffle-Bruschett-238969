Heat 2 tablespoons truffle-infused oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add red bell pepper, parsley, and garlic to mushrooms; cook and stir until mushrooms are golden and lightly browned, about 5 minutes more. Remove skillet from heat. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Stir remaining truffle-infused oil and cream cheese into mushroom mixture until cheese melts from the heat of the skillet; season with salt and pepper. Spread mushroom-cheese mixture onto each baguette round. Arrange rounds on a baking sheet. Broil bruschetta until bread is warmed, 2 to 3 minutes.
