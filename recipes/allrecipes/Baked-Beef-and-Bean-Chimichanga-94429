Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brown the ground beef in a skillet over medium-high heat. Drain excess grease, and stir in the onion, bell pepper and corn. Cook for 5 more minutes or until vegetables are tender. Stir in the salsa and season with chili powder, garlic salt and cumin until blended. Cook until heated through, then remove from heat, and set aside. Open the can of beans, and spread a thin layer of beans onto each of the tortillas. Spoon the beef mixture 1 1/2 inches from the edge closest to you and then top with as much shredded cheese as you like. Fold the side edges in and roll the tortillas away from you into a package. Place seam-side down onto a non-stick baking sheet. Brush the tortillas with melted butter. Bake for 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Serve topped with shredded lettuce and tomato.
