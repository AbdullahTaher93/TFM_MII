Cook the bacon in a heavy, 5 quart pot over medium-high heat until the grease begins to render out, about 3 minutes. Stir in the ground beef and onions. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Pour in the wine, and season with salt, basil, oregano, garlic, and pepper. Simmer uncovered until most of the wine has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and hot pepper sauce. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes.
