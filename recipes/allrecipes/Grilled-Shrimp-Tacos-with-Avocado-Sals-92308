To make salsa, in a bowl combine avocado, tomato, onions, cilantro, olive oil, lime juice, chile, and garlic. Mix lightly. Season to taste with salt and set aside. In a shallow bowl, stir together lime juice, garlic, pepper, and olive oil. Lightly mix in shrimp to coat well. Stack tortillas, wrap in 2 foil packets of 6 tortillas each; set aside. Divide shrimp into 12 equal portions. Thread each portion onto a thin skewer (about 8 inches long). Brush shrimp lightly with oil mixture from bowl. Place skewers on oiled grill 4 to 6 inches above a solid bed of medium coals (you can hold your hand at grill level for 4 to 5 seconds) or over medium heat on a gas grill. Set foil-wrapped tortillas at edge of grill. Close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning once, until shrimp are pink and slightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes total. To assemble each taco, place a warm tortilla on a plate; top with shrimp removed from a skewer, and salsa and cabbage to taste. Roll tortillas to enclose filling and eat out of hand.
