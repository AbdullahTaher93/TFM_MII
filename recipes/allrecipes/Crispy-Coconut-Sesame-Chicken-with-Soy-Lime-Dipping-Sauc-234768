Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil. In food processor, combine cereal, 1/2 cup (125 mL) coconut, garlic powder, ginger and pepper - processing with pulse action to fine consistency. Drizzle in oil, using pulsing action to combine. Stir in 1 tablespoon (15 mL) sesame seeds. Place mixture into shallow dish or onto plate. In medium bowl, beat 1/4 cup (50 mL) mayonnaise and 2 tablespoons (25 mL) lime juice to combine well. Cut each chicken breast into 2 pieces of similar size and thickness (slant cut for equal thickness). Using tongs, dip chicken pieces into mayonnaise mixture, allowing excess to drip off. Coat with cereal mixture, pressing gently so that all of the coating is used. Place coated chicken in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons coconut. Discard remaining mayonnaise mixture. Bake coated chicken in preheated oven until food thermometer reads 170 degrees F (77 degrees C) at centre of chicken pieces - about 25 minutes. Serve with Soy Lime Dipping Sauce. For Soy Lime Dipping Sauce: In small bowl, combine the remaining mayonnaise, lime juice and sesame seeds with the soy sauce and sugar. Divide into 6 portions.
