Place the rice, water, and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 50 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes, cilantro, oil, lime juice or lemon juice, garlic, cumin, pepper, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cover and let stand at room temperature. Stir in the rice and chickpeas and top with the almonds.
