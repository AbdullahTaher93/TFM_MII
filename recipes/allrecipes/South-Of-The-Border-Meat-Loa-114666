In a bowl, combine the first 12 ingredients. Add beef and mix well. Press into a 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 1 hour or until meat is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan. Drizzle with salsa if desired.
