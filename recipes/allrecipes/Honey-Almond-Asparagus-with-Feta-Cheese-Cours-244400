Preheat grill to medium-high or oven to 450 degrees F. Center one-fourth of asparagus on each sheet of Reynolds Wrap(R) Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil. Place honey and garlic into a small heatproof bowl and stir to combine. Warm honey in microwave for 10 to 15 seconds to thin. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the honey over each asparagus packet. Season with salt and pepper then top with sliced almonds. Bring up foil sides. Double fold top and ends to seal packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside. Repeat to make four packets. Place packets on a cookie sheet. Grill until asparagus is fork tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle with feta cheese before serving.
