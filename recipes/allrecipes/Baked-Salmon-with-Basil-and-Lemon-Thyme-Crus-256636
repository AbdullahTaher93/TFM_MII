Drizzle 1 1/2 teaspoon olive oil over asparagus; season with salt and pepper. Mix well and arrange around salmon. Place garlic cloves in a food processor or blender; process until crushed. Add Parmesan cheese, basil, lemon juice, lemon thyme, lemon zest, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper; blend well. Add remaining 3 tablespoons oil and bread crumbs; pulse until well mixed. Top salmon with herb mixture, forming a crust. Set Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven to "Auto Cook".
