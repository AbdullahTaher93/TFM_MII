Heat the oil in a 10 inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the broccoli slaw and cook for 5 minutes or until it's tender. Stir 1/2 cup soup and 1/2 cup water in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes. Season with the black pepper. Stir the remaining soup, water and rice in an 11x8 inch shallow baking dish. Top with the spinach. Divide the broccoli slaw mixture among the fish fillets. Roll up the fillets and place seam-side down on the spinach in the baking dish. Drizzle with the lemon juice. Season with the black pepper. Cover the dish. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25 minutes or until the rice is tender and the fish flakes easily when tested with a fork.
