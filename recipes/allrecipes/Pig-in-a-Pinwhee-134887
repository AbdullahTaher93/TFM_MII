Mash the ham, onion, and oregano into the cream cheese. Unroll the dough, which is perforated into 16 triangles. Separate it into eight rectangles instead, then squish the central perforations to seal. Spread an equal amount of the ham-and-cheese mixture over each rectangle. Roll up each rectangle, starting at a short side. Cut each into four slices. Place on a cookie sheet and squash slightly. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden.
