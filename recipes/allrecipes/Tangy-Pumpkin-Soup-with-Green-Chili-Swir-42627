In a food processor or blender, puree the green chilies and sour cream until well blended. Set aside. In a medium saucepan, over medium-high heat, combine the pumpkin puree, chicken broth, and water. Season with chili powder, garlic powder and hot pepper sauce. Stir in 1/4 cup of the sour cream mixture. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Pour into serving bowls, and spoon a dollop of the sour cream mixture on top. Run a knife or the tip of a spoon through the dollop to swirl.
