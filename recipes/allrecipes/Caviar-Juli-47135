In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese, sour cream and mayonnaise. Stir in the onion and chopped egg. Spread the mixture in a shallow baking dish or glass pie plate. Spoon red and black caviar in a checkerboard pattern over the top. Slice green onions into long thin strips, and use the strips to outline the checkerboard pattern. Chill until serving.
