Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly brush both sides of baguette slices with oil and place slightly spaced on rimmed baking pans. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned and crisp. Top each slice with ham and Brie and bake for an additional 5-8 minutes or until Brie has just begun to melt. Top each crostini with fig jam and serve warm for best flavor.
