Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Melt the chocolate and butter in a small saucepan over low heat; stir until smooth. Set aside to cool slightly. Combine the sour cream, 2 tablespoons oil, egg, and sugar in large mixing bowl. Beat the mixture on medium speed until creamy. Add the chocolate mixture to the sour cream mixture and beat on low speed. Add the flour, baking powder and salt. Beat on low speed until mixed. Let the dough stand for 10 minutes - the mixture will set up slightly. Spoon rounded spoonfuls 2-inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 7 minutes or just until tops of the cookies start to set. DO NOT OVERBAKE. Immediately remove the cookies to a cooling rack. Cool for 10 minutes. *Optional Topping: Place the 3 tablespoons of chocolate chips and 1/4 teaspoon of oil in a small bowl. Microwave on High for 30 seconds; stir. Microwave for another 30 seconds or until the chocolate is completely melted. Drizzle over the cookies. Let the chocolate set on the cookies completely before covering to store.
