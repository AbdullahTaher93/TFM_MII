Combine the crushed pretzels and granulated sugar, then stir in the melted butter. Press the crumb mixture onto the bottom and sides of a 10-inch pie plate. Cover and chill. Beat together the peanut butter, cream cheese and powdered sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed. Fold in the whipped dessert topping. Spoon 1/2 cup of the Lucky Leaf Strawberry Pie Filling into the crust-lined pie plate. Carefully spread the peanut butter filling over top of the pie filling. Top with the remaining pie filling. Cover and chill for 2 hours before serving.
