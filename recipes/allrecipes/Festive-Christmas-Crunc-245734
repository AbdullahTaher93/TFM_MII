Line a large baking pan with parchment paper. Place popcorn in an extra-large bowl, being careful to remove any unpopped kernels. Add broken-up pretzels, Cheerios, peanuts, and candy-coated chocolates. Place candy melts in a microwave-safe container and microwave on LOW for 1 minute. Stir well. Continue to microwave at 30-second intervals until smooth and completely melted. Pour melted candy melts over popcorn mixture, mixing gently with a rubber spatula. Or mix with your hands if the mixture is not too hot. Pour popcorn mixture onto prepared baking sheet, spreading evenly. Lightly sprinkle with the colored sugar or sprinkles, if desired. Refrigerate, uncovered, until set, 5 to 10 minutes. Break into pieces and store in an airtight container at room temperature for 4 to 5 days.
