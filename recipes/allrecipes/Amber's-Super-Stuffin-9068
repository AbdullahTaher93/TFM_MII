Combine chicken stock and wild rice in a saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer until rice is tender, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat. Melt the butter in a large skillet. Add the mushrooms, celery, and onion. Cook and stir until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. In a large bowl, mix the crumbled cornbread and poultry seasoning. Add the rice with chicken broth and the vegetables and mix well. Use to stuff a turkey or bake on its own. More chicken stock can be added if stuffing is dry.
