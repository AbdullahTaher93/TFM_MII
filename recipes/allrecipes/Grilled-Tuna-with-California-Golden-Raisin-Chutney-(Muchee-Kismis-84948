In 1-quart nonreactive saucepan, bring sugar, water and vinegar to boil over medium-high heat. Add red pepper, turmeric, cloves, cinnamon stick, peppercorns and ginger. Reduce heat to low. Cover and cook 5 minutes to blend flavors. Add raisins and continue cooking on low 8 to 10 minutes or until most of the liquid evaporates. Remove from heat and set aside. Preheat grill or broiler. Grill or broil tuna fillets for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Transfer tuna to serving platter; spoon about 2 tablespoons chutney over each fillet. Serve immediately.
