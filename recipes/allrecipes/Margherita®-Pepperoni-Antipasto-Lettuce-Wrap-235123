Combine all ingredients except lettuce in a medium bowl; mix well. (Mixture may be prepared up to 4 hours before serving. Cover and refrigerate.) Just before serving, spoon antipasto mixture into lettuce leaves; roll up. Or, arrange lettuce leaves on a serving platter with the bowl of antipasto mixture and let guests make their own wraps.
