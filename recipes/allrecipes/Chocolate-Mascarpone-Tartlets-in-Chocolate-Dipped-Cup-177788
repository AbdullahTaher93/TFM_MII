Bake, cool and remove the 'tops' of the pastry shells according to the package directions. Stir the sugar, cocoa and coffee in a medium bowl until the cocoa is dissolved. Stir in the cheese. Fold in the whipped topping. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Dip the tops of the pastry shells in the melted chocolate and place chocolate-side up on a baking sheet. Let cool completely. Spoon the cocoa mixture into a pastry bag. Pipe the cocoa mixture into the chocolate-dipped pastry shells. Top each filled pastry shell with 1 raspberry.
