In the top of a double boiler, combine orange and lemon juices, sugar, and salt. Cook over direct heat until syrup simmers. Place over hot water and gradually add egg yolks, beating constantly. Continue to cook and stir over hot (not boiling) water until smooth and thick. Cool and refrigerate until chilled. While egg mixture chills in refrigerator, make watermelon shell. Place washed, whole watermelon on its flat side. Remove the top 1/3 of the shell. Scoop out the fruit from the top 1/3 and reserve, discarding the rind. Scoop out the fruit from the bottom of the watermelon, leaving a thin layer of pink flesh on the rind, to form a bowl for the salad. Turn the melon bowl upside down on paper towels and allow to drain thoroughly. Chill. Cut the reserved melon flesh into balls or bite-size pieces for the fruit salad mixture. At serving time, fill shell with combined fresh fruit. Complete the sauce by whipping the cream into soft peaks and folding it into the egg mixture. Transfer the sauce to a serving bowl; sprinkle with orange peel and offer the sauce on the side.
