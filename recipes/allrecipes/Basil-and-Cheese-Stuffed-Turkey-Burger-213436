Prepare grill. Combine first 6 ingredients in a medium bowl. Divide mixture into 8 equal portions, shaping each into a 12-inch-thick patty. Place 1 slice of cheese and 1 basil leaf in the center of 1 patty, tearing cheese slice to fit and leaving a 1/4-inch border around edges. Top with 1 patty and press edges to seal. Press patty to 1/2-inch-thickness. Repeat procedure with remaining patties, cheese, and basil. Place patties on grill rack coated with cooking spray. Grill 4 minutes on each side or until done. Top each bottom half of bun with 1 patty. Add ketchup and mustard, if desired. Top patties with remaining bun halves.
