In a large bowl, sift together all-purpose flour, baking powder and salt. Mix sugar, eggs and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a small bowl. Quickly stir into the flour mixture. Mix in approximately 1/2 the water. Knead into a soft, pliable dough, using more of the water as necessary. Cover dough with a tea towel and allow to sit at least 1 hour while desired filling is prepared. To use, divide into two parts, roll flat on a lightly floured surface and lightly brush with remaining vegetable oil. Fill and bake as desired.
