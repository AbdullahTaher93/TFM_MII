Place crushed garlic, pepper, and egg white in a small mixing bowl; whisk together until well mixed. Brush over entire surface of beef tenderloin. Cover baking dish with about 1/4 inch coarse salt. Roll tenderloin over the salt to coat thoroughly. Add more salt if needed to ensure the baking dish has an even layer of salt. Let roast sit out at room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Place baking dish in preheated oven. Roast to your desired doneness or until internal temperature reaches 116 degrees F, 20 to 25 minutes. Beef will continue cooking after removal from oven and needs to reach 125 to 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Let rest 15 minutes. Crack and remove the salt crust. Transfer roast to a cutting board; slice and serve.
