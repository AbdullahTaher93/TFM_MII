Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 inch square baking dish. In a bowl, mix the tofu, turkey, bread crumbs, soup mix, green pepper, and eggs. Place the mixture into the prepared pan, and mold into a loaf shape. In a saucepan over low heat, blend the brown sugar, soy sauce, and mustard. Bake the meatloaf 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Drizzle with the sauce mixture, and continue baking 15 minutes, or to an internal temperature of 180 degrees F (80 degrees C).
