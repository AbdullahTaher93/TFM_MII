Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir red bell pepper, jalapeno pepper, and garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. Mix eggs and balsamic vinegar into jalapeno pepper mixture until egg yolks break; return skillet to medium heat. Cook and stir until eggs are scrambled and set, about 5 minutes. Place cucumber in a large bowl; top with egg mixture, green onions, and oregano. Whisk chile-garlic sauce and liquid aminos together in a bowl; pour mixture over eggs. Toss to evenly coat.
