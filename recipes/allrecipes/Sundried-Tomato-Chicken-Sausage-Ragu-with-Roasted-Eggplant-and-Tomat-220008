Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray. Mix the eggplant, cherry tomatoes, peppers, and onions together on the pan. Blend the minced garlic with 2 tablespoon of the olive oil and black pepper. Pour over the vegetables, toss to coat. Roast for 20-25 minutes, or until nicely browned and the eggplant is tender. Set aside. Heat a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat and coat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Brown the sundried tomato chicken sausage slices. Add the red wine, cook 1 minute, add the pasta sauce, chicken broth, chopped basil and sundried tomatoes. Reduce heat and simmer 3-5 minutes. Serve immediately with the roasted vegetables, and garnish with fresh basil leaves.
