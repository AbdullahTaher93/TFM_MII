Preheat grill to medium-high. For the kabobs, spread the zucchini, red bell pepper and onion chunks on a baking sheet, coat well with the cooking spray, and roast for 10 minutes, cool for 5 minutes. Thread 5 skewers alternating the roasted vegetables and sliced chicken sausage, set aside. In a medium sauce pan, coated with the olive oil spray, saute the chopped onion over medium high heat for 2 minutes. Add mushrooms and saute for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the brown rice, chicken broth and raisins, bring to a boil, and then cover, and reduce heat for 6 - 8 minutes, (check package instructions for best results, rice should be fork tender). Add the parsley, grated carrot, seasonings and cooked orzo, over low heat to heat through. Fold in the baby spinach and toasted almonds. Grill skewers for 3 to 5 minutes per side and serve immediately over rice pilaf.
