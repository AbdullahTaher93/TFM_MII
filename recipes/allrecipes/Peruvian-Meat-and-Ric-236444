Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir pork, garlic, and cumin until pork is browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer pork mixture, including oil, to a pot. Mix potatoes, tomatoes, and onion into pork mixture; cook and stir over medium heat until potatoes are cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Add enough soy sauce to color and season pork and potato mixture. Stir parsley, oregano, and cilantro into pork and potato mixture; season with salt and pepper. Serve over cooked rice.
