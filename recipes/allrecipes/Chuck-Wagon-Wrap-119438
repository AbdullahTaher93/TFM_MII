In a large nonstick skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Stir in beans, corn and Worcestershire sauce; mix well. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 4-5 minutes or until heated through. Sprinkle with cheese; cook 1-2 minutes longer. Spoon about 1/2 cup off center on each tortilla; top with lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream. Roll up.
