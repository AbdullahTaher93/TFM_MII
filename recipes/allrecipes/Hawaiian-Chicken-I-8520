Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a bowl, combine sweet and sour sauce, brown sugar, orange juice, white wine, and melted butter or margarine. Mix well. Place chicken in a greased 9x13 inch baking dish, and pour sweet and sour sauce mixture over chicken. Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until the sauce has reduced to a thick glaze.
