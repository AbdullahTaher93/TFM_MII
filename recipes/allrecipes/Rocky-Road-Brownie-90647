Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. In a large microwave-safe bowl, heat chocolate and butter on full power (100%) for 1 to 2 minutes or until melted. Stir well. Stir in sugar and cool slightly. Whisk in eggs, one at a time. Stir in cake meal and salt. Stir in 1 cup chocolate chips, 2 cups marshmallows, and 1 cup walnuts (reserve the rest for the topping). Pour into buttered 9- by 13-inch baking pan. Bake for 30 minutes or until set. Sprinkle with remaining marshmallows. Return to oven for 3 to 4 minutes or until marshmallows are puffed, but not browned. Remove from oven. Place remaining chocolate chips in a small, heavy plastic bag. Microwave on full power (100%) for 60 to 90 seconds or until melted and smooth when squeezed. Squeeze chocolate into one corner of plastic sandwich bag. Cut a small tip off the corner and drizzle chocolate over brownies. Sprinkle with remaining nuts. Cool completely. Cut into 1 3/4- by 2 1/4-inch bars.
