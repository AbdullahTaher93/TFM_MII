Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat the Enova(TM) oil in a medium pan until hot, but not smoking. Coat the chicken breast in the flour and shake off any excess. Brown the chicken in the hot Enova oil for 3 minutes on each side. Remove to an oven-proof pan and bake for about 15 minutes, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads at least 165 degrees F. Meanwhile, saute the onions in the same pan the chicken was browned in for 2 minutes over medium-high heat. Add the bell peppers, saute for an additional 2 minutes, add the garlic and cook an additional 1 minute. Lower the heat to medium, add the diced tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes. Add the olives, as well as the chicken breasts from the oven. Cook over medium heat for an additional 2 minutes. Just before serving stir in the fresh oregano. Sprinkle the Feta cheese over the top. Serve over cooked pasta, couscous or rice.
