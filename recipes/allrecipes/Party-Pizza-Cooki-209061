Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, knead the cookie dough into a ball. Transfer the ball to the cookie sheet and roll into a 12-inch circle, flouring the rolling pin as needed. Score the dough into 'pizza' wedges, using the tip of a knife. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15 minutes. Remove from oven and top with M&M's Brand Chocolate Candies, SNICKERS Bars and marshmallows. Return to the oven and bake for another 7 minutes, to soften candies. To serve, cut cookie into wedges.
