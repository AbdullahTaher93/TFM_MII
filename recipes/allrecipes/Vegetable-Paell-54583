Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Set aside. Heat oil in wok or deep frying pan over medium high heat. Cook frozen corn, peas, and broccoli until thawed. Stir in sliced mushrooms and veggie ground beef, and continue cooking for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once vegetables are tender and vegetable protein is browned, stir in garlic salt and paprika. Reduce heat to low, and cook another 3 minutes. Serve warm over rice.
