Thinly slice 4 garlic cloves. Heat oil in wok or small saucepan over medium heat until hot. Add garlic; cook about 2 minutes, or until lightly browned, stirring occasionally. Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Mince remaining garlic clove. Remove and reserve 1 tablespoon garlic oil. (Pour remaining garlic oil in container. Cover and refrigerate; use within a few days.) Return reserved oil to same pan; heat over medium-high heat. Add green beans and minced garlic; stir-fry 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low; pour in stir-fry sauce. Cook, stirring, until beans are coated with sauce. Just before serving, sprinkle "garlic chips" over beans.
