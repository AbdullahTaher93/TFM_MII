Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with aluminum foil, then spray with cooking spray. Place plums and nectarines, cut side up, on prepared baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until tender, 18 to 20 minutes. Drizzle fruit with honey and continue baking until golden brown, 2 to 3 more minutes.
