In a small bowl, whisk together vinegar, garlic, oil, sugar, and mustard. Pour mixture into a large zip-lock plastic bag. Add steak and seal bag. Marinate steak in refrigerator, turning occasionally to coat meat evenly, for at least 2 hours or up to 1 day. Drain steak and season with salt and pepper to taste; discard marinade. Lay steak on grill rack above a solid bed of hot coals (you can hold your hand over coals only 2 to 3 seconds). Cover grill, open vents, and cook, turning once, until steak is done to your liking, 3 to 4 minutes per side for rare. Cut meat from bone and divide into two portions. Serve immediately.
