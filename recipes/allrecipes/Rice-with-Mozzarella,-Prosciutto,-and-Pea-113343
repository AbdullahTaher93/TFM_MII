Stir the rice into a medium pot of boiling, salted water and cook until almost done, about 15 minutes. Stir in the peas. Cook until the peas and rice are just done, about 2 minutes longer. Drain. Put the rice and peas back in the hot pot. Stir in the mozzarella, Parmesan, butter, prosciutto, salt, and parsley. Serve immediately.
