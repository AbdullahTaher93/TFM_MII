In a small bowl, combine the first six ingredients. Combine the egg, buttermilk, yogurt, oil, lemon juice, peel and vanilla; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Coat six 4-in. tube pans with nonstick cooking spray and dust with 1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar. Divide batter among pans. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. Dust with remaining confectioners' sugar.
