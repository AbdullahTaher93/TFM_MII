Before firing up the grill, coat the rack with cooking spray so the fish won't stick to it. Mix the spices together in a small bowl. Rub the mixture evenly over the salmon. Grill for 5 minutes per side, drizzling lightly with a squeeze from the honey bear (about 1 tsp per steak) just before they're done.
