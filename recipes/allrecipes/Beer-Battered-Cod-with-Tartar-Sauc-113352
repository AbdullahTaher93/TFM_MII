In a medium bowl, combine the mayonnaise, mustard, scallion, lemon juice, gherkins, capers, parsley, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Heat the oven to 200 degrees F. Cover a baking sheet with paper towels and top with a rack. In a medium pot, heat 3 inches of oil to approximately 365 degrees F. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the flour with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Whisk in the egg. Add the beer slowly, whisking. Dip the pieces of cod, a few at a time, in the batter, and then put them in the oil. Cook until the fish is done and the crust is light brown, about 4 minutes for 3/4-inch thick fillets. Remove the fish with tongs and put the pieces on the rack to drain. Sprinkle salt over the hot fish and put the baking sheet in the oven. Repeat in batches with the remaining fish. Serve with the tartar sauce.
