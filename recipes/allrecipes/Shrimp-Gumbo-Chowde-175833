To make roux, heat oil in a small frying pan over medium heat. Add flour and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned (4 to 5 minutes). Set aside. While roux is cooking, seed and dice bell pepper; also dice bacon. Place bell pepper and bacon in a 5- to 6-quart pan; add okra and garlic. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until bacon is translucent and vegetables begin to soften (4 to 5 minutes). Stir in roux and rice mix (rice and vermicelli plus seasoning packet). Add broth, tomatoes and their puree, water, and hot pepper seasoning. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally to break up tomatoes. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until rice is tender to bite (8 to 10 minutes). Add shrimp to soup and cook until heated through.
