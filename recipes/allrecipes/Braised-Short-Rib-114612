In a small bowl, combine water, 2 tablespoons oil, mustard, vinegar and seasonings; mix well. Place ribs in a large resealable plastic bag or shallow glass container. Set aside half of marinade. Pour remaining marinade over ribs; turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for several hours. Drain, discarding marinade. In a skillet, brown the ribs in remaining oil. Transfer ribs to a greased shallow 1-qt. baking dish. Combine tomato sauce and reserved marinade; pour over ribs. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours or until meat is tender.
