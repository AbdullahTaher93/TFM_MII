In a skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef until no pink shows; drain. In a large pot combine browned beef and spaghetti sauce over medium heat for 5 or 10 minutes. Add yellow peppers, red peppers, canned tomatoes and mushrooms. Lower heat and simmer covered for 30 minutes, stirring every once in a while.
