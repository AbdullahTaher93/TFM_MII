In a small bowl, combine the buttermilk or yogurt, mayonnaise, blue cheese, and chives or scallion greens. Coat a large nonstick skillet with nonstick spray. Set over medium-high heat until hot. Place the tomatoes and onion in the skillet. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until lightly charred. Layer the roast beef, onion, tomatoes, and lettuce on the bottoms of the buns. Drizzle with the blue cheese dressing. Cover with the bun tops.
