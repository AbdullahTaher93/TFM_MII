Preheat oven to 340 degrees F (171 degrees C). Lay bacon strips in a single layer on a baking sheet with raised edges. Bake in the preheated oven, turning occasionally, until browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels, reserving the bacon grease. Heat bacon grease in a large frying pan or skillet over medium-high heat; add sweet potato fries. Cook and stir fries in the hot bacon grease until browned and crispy, about 10 minutes. Transfer fries to a serving platter and sprinkle with paprika and salt; serve with ketchup.
