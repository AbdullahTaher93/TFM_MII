In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Stir in raisins, plums and walnuts; toss to coat evenly. In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites on high speed until stiff peaks form. Stir about a third of the egg whites and vanilla into flour mixture. Fold in remaining egg whites. Transfer to a 9-in. square baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 300 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool. Cut into squares.
