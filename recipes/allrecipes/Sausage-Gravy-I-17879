In a large skillet over medium high heat, combine the sausage and onion and saute for 5 to 10 minutes, or until sausage is browned. Season with garlic powder, parsley and salt and pepper to taste. Add enough flour to just make the meat somewhat sticky. Then stir in milk until mixture is to desired consistency. Allow to heat through and serve.
