Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange tortilla chips in a single layer on an ungreased baking sheet. Mix imitation crabmeat, sour cream, mayonnaise, onion, and dill together in a bowl. Drop 1 tablespoonful of mixture on each chip. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and paprika on top. Bake in the preheated oven until Cheddar cheese is melted, 6 to 8 minutes.
