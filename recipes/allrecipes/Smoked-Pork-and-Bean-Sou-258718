Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and scallion; cook and stir until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until aromatic, 3 to 5 minutes. Put chicken broth, diced tomatoes, cream-style corn, white beans, light red kidney beans, pork, and cumin into the saucepan; bring soup to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes. Blend black beans and lime juice in a blender. Add beans to soup, season with salt and pepper, and simmer for 20 minutes. Garnish servings with corn kernels.
