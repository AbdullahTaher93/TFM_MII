Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet. In a small saucepan, bring the 11/4 cup of water, raisins, shortening, cinnamon, and nutmeg to a boil. Remove from heat, beat in eggs, one at a time. Dissolve salt, soda, and liquid sweetener into the remaining 2 tablespoons of water; add alternately to the egg mixture, with the flour and baking powder. Drop cookies by teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheet. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool on wire racks.
