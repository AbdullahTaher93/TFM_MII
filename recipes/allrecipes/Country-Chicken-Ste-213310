Cook the bacon in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, stirring often. Remove the bacon from the skillet and drain on paper towels. Add the onion to the skillet and cook until tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in the soup, water, oregano, potatoes and carrots and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 15 minutes. Stir the beans in the skillet. Cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Stir in the chicken, parsley and bacon and cook until the mixture is hot and bubbling.
