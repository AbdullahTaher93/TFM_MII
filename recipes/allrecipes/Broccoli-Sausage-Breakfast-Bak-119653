In a skillet, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain and set aside. Add 1 in. of water and broccoli to a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 5-8 minutes or until crisp-tender; drain. In a greased 9-in. pie plate, layer the sausage, cheese and broccoli. In a bowl, combine the eggs, milk and biscuit mix. Pour over broccoli. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
