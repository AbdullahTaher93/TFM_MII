Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine bread crumbs, 1 cup Parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic salt, and onion powder in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal and shake to mix. Beat eggs together in a shallow bowl. Dip a pork chop into the egg mixture and place in the plastic bag; shake to coat thoroughly with bread crumb mixture. Repeat with remaining 5 pork chops. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add 3 pork chops; cook until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining 3 pork chops. Spread cornbread stuffing evenly in a glass baking dish. Place cooked pork chops on top. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese on top. Cover loosely with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until pork chops are no longer pink in the center, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and place baking dish under the broiler until cheese is browned, about 1 minute.
