Place dough in a large, lightly oiled bowl. Add minced rosemary and knead until rosemary is evenly incorporated into dough. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until dough has doubled, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Punch dough down to release air bubbles. Turn out onto a lightly floured board, then roll out into a 12-inch round. Transfer to a 12- by 15-inch baking sheet. With your fingers, make shallow indentations--about 1 inch apart--all over dough. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let stand until puffy, about 20 minutes. Mix together egg yolk and water. Brush over dough, then sprinkle evenly with salt. Lay rosemary sprigs decoratively in center of dough; press lightly into dough. Bake in a 375 degrees F oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on a rack. Cut into wedges to serve.
