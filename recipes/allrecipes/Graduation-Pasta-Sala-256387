Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini pasta at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and rinse; transfer to a large bowl. Whisk lemon juice and canola oil together in a small bowl. Stir in mayonnaise, seasoned salt, and flavor enhancer. Pour over pasta and toss to coat. Refrigerate pasta mixture, tossing occasionally, until flavors combine, 8 hours to overnight. Bring pasta mixture to room temperature, about 1 hour. Stir in cucumbers, tomatoes, green olives, black olives, green bell pepper, and green onions; toss to distribute evenly.
