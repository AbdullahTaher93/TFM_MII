Place pickle pieces in original pickle jar. Stir white sugar, cider vinegar, brown sugar, water, and pickling spice together in a saucepan. Bring to a boil; cook and stir to a syrup-like consistency, about 2 minutes. Pour hot syrup mixture over pickles into pickle jar. Cool to room temperature before covering; store in the refrigerator for 2 weeks before serving.
