In a small bowl, combine the mustard with the honey and hot sauce. Spread the mixture on both sides of the salmon chops, arrange them in a single layer on a large dish and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes and up to 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. On a large rimmed baking sheet, drizzle the asparagus with the olive oil, rolling the spears to coat. Season with salt and pepper and roast for 4 minutes, or until crisp-tender. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the miso paste with the lime juice. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and brush the asparagus generously with the paste. Return to the oven and roast for 3 minutes, or until tender and glazed. Keep warm. Preheat the broiler. Using a spatula, scrape most of the marinade off the salmon and arrange the chops in a layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Broil the salmon on 1 side only for 3 minutes, or until well browned; rotate the baking sheet for even cooking. Transfer the salmon and asparagus to plates and serve at once.
