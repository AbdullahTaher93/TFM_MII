Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Drizzle olive oil on a rimmed baking sheet. Spread spinach leaves in a thick layer covering the baking sheet. Arrange onions and artichokes over the spinach, and drizzle the marinade from the jar over the entire salad. Sprinkle with the cheese (and sausage, if you wish). Bake for about 10 minutes, or until the spinach is wilted but NOT crispy.
