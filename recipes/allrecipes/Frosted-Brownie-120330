In a large microwave-safe bowl, heat chocolate until melted. Stir in eggs and vanilla. Add flour and salt; mix well. Stir in the nuts. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out with moist crumbs (do not overbake). Cool on a wire rack. For frosting, melt butter and chocolate; stir until smooth. Cool to room temperature. In a mixing bowl, combine the chocolate mixture, sugar, milk and vanilla until smooth. Frost brownies.
