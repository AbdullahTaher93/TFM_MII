Pour the tomato soup, tomato sauce and tomato paste into a slow cooker, and stir to blend. Crumble in the sweet and hot Italian sausages. Cover, and cook on low for 4 to 6 hours, stirring occasionally until the meat is cooked through, and the sauce is flavorful. When the tomato sauce is almost done, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the mostaccoli pasta, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until tender. Drain and rinse. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat a 9x13 inch baking dish and an 8x8 inch baking dish with cooking spray. Layer the noodles and cheese in the two dishes to an even depth ending with cheese on the top, splash a little bit of the milk over each layer of cheese as you go except for the top layer. Bake for 15 minutes, or until cheese is melted and a little brown on the top. Cut into wedges, and spoon the sauce over them to serve.
