In a medium bowl, whisk 3/4 cup sugar and 3 eggs until thick; set aside. In a heavy saucepan, bring the milk to a simmer. Slowly whisk a few tablespoons warm milk into the egg mixture, then pour the mixture into the saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, over low heat until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of the spoon, about 6 minutes (do not boil or the eggs will scramble). Remove from the heat and quickly whisk in the creamy peanut butter until incorporated. Pour the mixture through a strainer into a clean bowl. Stir in 1 1/2 cups heavy cream, the peanuts, vanilla and salt and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. To freeze, scrape the chilled peanut butter mixture into an ice cream maker and prepare according to manufacturers directions. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Using an electric mixer, combine the crunchy peanut butter, the remaining 1 cup sugar and 1/4 cup chocolate chips on medium speed. In a small bowl, lightly beat together the remaining egg and the baking soda, then add to the peanut butter mixture; mix until just incorporated. Roll the dough into tablespoon-size balls and place on the prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart. Press each ball with the tines of a fork. Bake the cookies until golden brown, about 16 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheets. In a small saucepan, bring the remaining 1/2 cup heavy cream to a boil. Remove from the heat, add the remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips and stir until melted and smooth. Cover to keep warm. Place a scoop of ice cream on the flat side of a cookie, top with another cookie, flat side facing in, and set the sandwich on a plate. Drizzle with the chocolate sauce before serving.
