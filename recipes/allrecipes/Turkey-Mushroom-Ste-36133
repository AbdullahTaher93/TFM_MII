Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the turkey until evenly browned. Season with garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and pepper. Drain, and transfer turkey to a large pot. Mix the crushed tomatoes with liquid, whole tomatoes with liquid, kidney beans, and hot sauce into the pot. Stir in the green bell pepper, onion, and mushrooms. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, and season to taste with garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and pepper. Continue cooking 1 hour, stirring occasionally, or to desired consistency. If the stew is too thick, mix in some water.
