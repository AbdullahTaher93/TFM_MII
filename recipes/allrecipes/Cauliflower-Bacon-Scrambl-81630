Chop the cauliflower. Mince the scallion and bell pepper. In a bowl, beat the eggs, milk, garlic power and a pinch of salt and fresh ground pepper. Beat well. In a heavy skillet over medium-high heat, cook the bacon to a crisp. Remove to a paper towel to drain then crumble. Pour off all but 1 scant Tbsp of fat. Add the cauliflower and saute until it starts to take on some color (about 3 minutes). Then add the scallions and bell pepper and cook another minute. Add the beaten eggs to the skillet and scrape and flip frequently with a spatula. Just before the eggs are completely set add the cheese. Turn off the heat; letting the heat in the skillet finish off the cooking without over cooking the eggs. Divide between two plates and garnish with the crumbled bacon. Serve immediately.
