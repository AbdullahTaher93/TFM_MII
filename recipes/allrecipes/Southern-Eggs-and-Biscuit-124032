Place eggs in the bottom of a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. In a large skillet, cook bacon until crisp. Drain, discarding all but 1/4 cup drippings. Sprinkle bacon over eggs. Stir flour, salt and pepper into reserved drippings; cook until bubbly. Gradually add milk; cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Stir in cheese until melted; pour over eggs. For biscuits, cut shortening into flour until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in buttermilk; knead dough gently six to eight times. Roll out on a lightly floured surface to 1/2-in. thickness. Cut with a 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter and place on a greased baking sheet. Bake biscuits and eggs at 400 degrees F for 25 minutes or until biscuits are golden brown. Serve eggs over biscuits.
