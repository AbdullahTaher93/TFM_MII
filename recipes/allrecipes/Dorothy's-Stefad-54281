In a large soup pot, cook beef in oil until beef is browned. Remove beef, and set aside. Mix sugar into the drippings, add onions, and cook until golden. Remove onions from pan. Return beef to the pot, and place onions on top. Mix the tomato paste, wine, and wine vinegar together, and add to saucepan. Place the garlic, pickling spices, bay leaf, cinnamon, and rosemary in a spice bag; add to the pan. Season with salt and pepper. Cover, and simmer for 2 to 3 hours, adding more liquid if necessary.
