Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place tater tots in a single layer on a large baking sheet and cook for 30 minutes or until browned and very crisp, stirring once halfway through cooking. While tater tots are cooking, cook ground turkey in a large skillet over medium heat until cooked through. Stir in salsa and seasoning and cook for a few minutes more. Mound tater tots slightly on the baking sheet and sprinkle with half the cheese; top with turkey mixture. Sprinkle with remaining cheese then top with tomatoes, bell pepper and olives. Cook for 10 minutes more or until cheese is melted. Sprinkle with green onions and serve with any optional toppings desired.
