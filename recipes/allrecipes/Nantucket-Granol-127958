Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Combine the oats, coconut, sugar, almonds, and sunflower seeds in a large bowl. Stir well to combine. In a small bowl whisk the oil with the water and vanilla, and pour over the dry ingredients. Stir until well coated. Spread the mixture over the bottom of a large baking sheet with sides or a roasting pan and bake, stirring every 10 minutes, until golden brown, about 1 hour 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool. Transfer the granola to a large bowl and stir in the cherries, cranberries, and raisins. You can store the cereal in airtight containers for up to two weeks in the refrigerator. Or place it in resealable bags and keep it in the freezer for up to two months.
