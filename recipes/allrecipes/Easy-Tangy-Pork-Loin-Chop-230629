Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook pork tenderloin slices in hot skillet in batches until browned on each side, about 10 minutes per batch. Arrange chops in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour ketchup into a bowl. Slowly drizzle cola into ketchup, whisking until combined (mixture will foam). Pour ketchup mixture over pork and season with black pepper. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until the juices run clear and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the middle of a chop reads at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C), about 45 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
