Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute bell pepper and sweet onion in hot oil until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir mushrooms and garlic into the pepper mixture; cook until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir Worcestershire sauce, parsley, ketchup, basil, turmeric, red pepper flakes, cumin, and cayenne pepper into the pepper mixture. Place cover on the skillet, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until mixture thickens, 20 to 30 minutes. If mixture is too dry, add water and stir.
