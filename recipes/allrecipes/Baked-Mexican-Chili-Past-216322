Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 9" x 13" baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. In a large skillet, brown the ground beef with the onion over medium heat; drain if necessary. Add the Chili Magic and diced tomatoes; cover and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, cook the macaroni according to the package directions; drain. In a large bowl, combine the chili, macaroni, green chilies, and three cups cheese; mix well and spoon into the baking dish. Top with the remaining 1 cup cheese then bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until heated through and the cheese melted.
