Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly butter eight 3/4 cup custard cups or souffle dishes. In a heavy skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add shallots and poblano pepper; saute until pepper is tender, about 3 minutes. In a blender or food processor, puree corn. Add half-and-half, eggs, flour, salt, sugar, nutmeg and white pepper. Pulse until mixture is smooth; transfer to large bowl. Stir in crabmeat and poblano chile mixture. Divide custard among prepared cups. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon cheese over each. Place cups in large roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into pan to come halfway up sides. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 minutes or until custards are set in center and knife inserted into center comes out clean.
