Heat the oven to 350. Over medium heat, add the Melt(R) to a medium skillet. Cook the sausage along with the peppers and mushrooms until the pork is thoroughly cooked and the vegetables are softened. Add the pasta sauce to the meat and vegetable mixture and heat thoroughly. Combine the ricotta, beaten egg, parsley and salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Mix well. Using a 13 by 9 inch baking pan, use 2/3 cups of the meat mixture to spread over the bottom of the pan. Then, lay three lasagna pieces in the pan making sure they don't overlap or touch. Top the lasagna pieces with 1/4 cup of the ricotta mixture for each piece of pasta. Then, top the cheese mixture with the tomato, chard and basil. Use about 1/2 cup of the mozzarella cheese over the three lasagna sections. Top all of this with another 2/3 cup of meat sauce. Repeat this process three more times. The last layer of lasagna should be topped with the remains of the meat sauce, cheese and vegetables. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes at 350. Remove the foil and bake another 10 to 15 minutes.
