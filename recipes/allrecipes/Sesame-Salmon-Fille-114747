Place salmon in a shallow dish. Combine vinegar, soy sauce, honey, oil, mustard and ginger; pour over salmon. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour, turning once. Drain and discard marinade. Broil the salmon or grill, covered, over medium-high heat for 15-20 minutes or until the fish flakes easily with a fork. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and onions.
