Crumble the ground beef into a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until evenly browned. Drain grease, and set aside. Pour the tomato sauce, corn, peas, and carrots into a soup pot or saucepan. Add the ground beef, potatoes, and onion. Simmer over medium heat until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, and serve.
