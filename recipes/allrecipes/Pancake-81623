In a bowl, beat the egg with a pinch of salt. Add just 2 Tbsps of the yogurt. Mix well. Add the almond meal, whey and baking powder. Stir well. If it is too thick then add a tsp of water at a time. Prepare your griddle with butter or oil as desired. Pour 1/4 of the batter for each pancake. Allow to bubble on the surface some before you sneak a peak underneath. When they develop the color that you like, gently flip. Please resist the urge to press them down with the spatula (unless they are rising out of control) these are best when fluffy. Serve with the remaining yogurt spread on top of each (that's how the analysis is calculated). Or use a low carb syrup or jam.
