Prepare corn bread according to package directions. Cool, crumble, and set aside. Place bacon in a large deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside. Whisk together the dressing mix, sour cream, and mayonnaise. Crumble half the corn bread in the bottom of a large serving dish. Top with half the beans. Layer the beans with half of the tomatoes, green bell pepper, and green onions. Sprinkle with half the cheese, corn, bacon, and the salad dressing mixture. Repeat the layers. Cover, and chill at least 2 hours before serving.
