Coat a large baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. In a pie plate combine egg, egg white, milk, vanilla, and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon. Soak bread slices in egg mixture for about 1 minute per side. Place on prepared baking sheet. Bake in a 450 degree F oven about 6 minutes or until bread is lightly browned. Turn bread over and bake 5 to 8 minutes more or until golden brown. Meanwhile, for orange syrup, in a small saucepan stir together orange peel, orange juice, honey, cornstarch, and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir 2 minutes more. If desired, sift powdered sugar over toast. Serve with warm orange syrup.
