Stove top: In a sauce pan over medium-high heat, bring to a boil the water, milk and salt. Add the Splenda, cinnamon, and extract. Stir. Stir in the oats, flax and whey. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes stirring occasionally. If it gets to thick add more water. Microwave: Add all ingredients in a large bowl (big enough for handling the boiling bubbles without spilling over) stir well. Zap for 1 minute (or until it boils) and stir. Zap for another minute then stir. Let sit for 2 minutes then zap again for about 30 seconds. Let it cool a bit before eating.
