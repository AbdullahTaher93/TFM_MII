Whisk sherry, water, hoisin, cornstarch, brown sugar, lime and salt in a small bowl. Heat 3 teaspoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add seitan and cook, stirring occasionally, until crispy, 4 to 7 minutes. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon oil, peanuts and ginger and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add carrots and red pepper; cook, stirring, about 1 minute. Whisk the sauce again; add it to the pan and stir to coat. Reduce heat to medium, cover and cook until the vegetables are tender-crisp and the sauce is thickened, about 3 minutes. Stir in cilantro, if using.
