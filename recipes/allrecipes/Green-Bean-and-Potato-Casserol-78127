Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a small casserole dish. Mix the green beans, potatoes, cream of chicken soup, and cheese in the prepared dish. Cover, and bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove cover, and continue baking 15 minutes, or until bubbly and lightly browned.
