In a wide frying pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add sausages and cook, turning as needed, until browned (3 to 5 minutes). Lift out sausages and place in a shallow casserole. Keep warm in a 250 degree F oven while preparing cabbage. To same pan, add cabbage, apple, and onion; sprinkle with ginger and pour in wine. Cook, stirring often, until cabbage is crisp-tender and apples are tender when pierced with a fork (8 to 10 minutes). Stir in vinegar to coat all ingredients well. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon cabbage around sausages, then garnish with parsley.
