Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Remove pot roast from package, removing as much gravy as possible; reserve gravy for another use. Cut pot roast into fine shreds. Unroll crescent dough onto ungreased baking sheet. Separate into 4 rectangles; press diagonal seams to seal. Pull sides of rectangles slightly to enlarge. Combine beef, 3/4 cup cheese and onion in large bowl; mix well. Divide beef mixture into fourths; press mixture to compact and place lengthwise in center of rectangles. Fold the long sides of each rectangle over filling, pressing at top to seal. Press ends to seal. Sprinkle pockets evenly with 1/4 cup cheese. Bake in 375 degrees F oven 13 to 16 minutes or until golden brown. Serve with sour cream. Garnish with chives.
