Stir cold water, ketchup, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, salt, paprika, chili powder, and black pepper together in a large pot. Add ribs to the pot. Pour enough water into the pot to cover the ribs completely. Bring the water to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until ribs are tender, about 90 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Cook ribs on preheated grill, basting frequently with sauce, until browned, 12 to 15 minutes.
