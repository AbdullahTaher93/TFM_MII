Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine the flour, oats, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a medium bowl, combine the milk, egg whites, brown sugar, and oil. Add to the flour mixture and stir just until blended. Fold in 1 cup of the blueberries. Coat a nonstick waffle iron with cooking spray. Preheat the iron. Pour 1/2 cup of the batter onto the center of the iron. Cook for 5 minutes, or until steam no longer escapes from under the waffle-iron lid and the waffle is golden. Place the waffles on the prepared baking sheet and place in the oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter to make a total of 8 waffles. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the remaining 1 cup blueberries, the strawberries, and maple syrup. Cook for 5 minutes, or until the berries are softened and the mixture is hot. Serve with the waffles.
