Heat griddle or skillet over medium-high heat or electric griddle to 375 degrees F; grease with cooking spray, vegetable oil or shortening. (Surface is ready when a few drops of water sprinkled on it dance and disappear.) Stir all ingredients until blended. Pour by tablespoonfuls onto hot griddle to form dollar-size pancakes. Cook until edges are dry. Turn; cook until golden.
