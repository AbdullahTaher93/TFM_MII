In a bowl, combine the ham, cheddar cheese and olives; divide among 12 greased muffin cups. In a mixing bowl, combine the remaining ingredients just until blended. Pour over ham mixture. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
