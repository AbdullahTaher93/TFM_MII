Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine salt, rosemary, and pepper in a small bowl; rub onto all sides of the roast. Place rubbed roast onto a rimmed baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven, until it is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read to a minimum internal temperature of 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Move the roast to a cutting board and loosely cover with a sheet of aluminum foil; rest for 15 minutes before slicing.
