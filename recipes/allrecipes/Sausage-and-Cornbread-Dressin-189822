Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook sausage, stirring and breaking up pieces, until browned and cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Use slotted spoon to transfer to large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons butter to skillet and melt over medium heat. Add celery and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are very tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to bowl with sausage. Add stuffing mix, green onions and parsley. Add chicken broth to desired moistness. Add salt and pepper to taste. Spoon stuffing into a 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, cut into bits. Cover with foil. Bake until heated through, about 30 minutes. Uncover and bake until top is crisp and golden, about 15 minutes longer.
