Preheat a grill for high heat. In a medium bowl, lightly mix together the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke and garlic powder. Form into 3 patties, handling the meat minimally. Brush both sides of each patty with some oil, and season with seasoned salt. Place the patties on the grill grate, and cook for about 5 minutes per side, until well done.
