Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Split pita into 2 rounds by placing pita flat on work surface and carefully cutting around the edge. Separate the 2 rounds and place, cut side up, on a work surface. Spread each pita round with 1 1/2 teaspoons of pizza sauce. Top each pita with half of the cheese, chicken, pineapple, onion and parsley, if desired. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until cheese is melted and edges are browned.
