Place the dates in a bowl with the butter or margarine and baking soda. Pour the boiling water over the dates and stir until the butter has melted. Set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat an 8-inch round cake pan with cooking spray and line the bottom with baking parchment. Coat the parchment with cooking spray. Place the sugar and eggs in a large bowl and stir well with a whisk. Add the cooled date mixture, then sift in the flour, baking powder, spice mix, and salt. Fold in the walnuts. Turn the batter into the pan. Bake until the cake is nicely browned and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Turn out onto a wire rack and leave to cool. The cake can be wrapped in foil or stored in an airtight container for up to 5 days.
