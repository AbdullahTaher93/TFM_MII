Season the tuna with the herbes de Provence, lemon peel, salt and pepper. Wrap the ham around the tuna and secure with a wooden toothpick. In a nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons EVOO, 2 turns of the pan, over medium-high heat. Add the tuna and cook, turning once, until medium, 8 minutes. Transfer to a board to rest. Return the pan to the heat and add the remaining EVOO, 1 turn of the pan, the onion and garlic and cook until tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes, capers, olives and half the parsley; toss. Spoon one quarter of the sauce onto each plate, set the tuna on top and sprinkle with the lemon juice and remaining parsley.
