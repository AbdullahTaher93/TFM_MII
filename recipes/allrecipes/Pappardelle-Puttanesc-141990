Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in mushrooms and garlic. Cook until the mushrooms have begun to brown, about 4 minutes. Increase heat to high, and pour in wine. Bring to a boil, then stir in olives, capers, caper juice, crushed tomatoes, and pepper flakes. Return to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, and cook for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and toss with sauce to serve.
