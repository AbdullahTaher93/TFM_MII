Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a large bowl, mix the chicken with the apple butter, ketchup, cream of chicken soup, garlic, onion powder, chili powder, smoked paprika, hot sauce, salt, and pepper. Pour the mixture into a greased baking dish (8x8-inch or 1.5-quart). Sprinkle the cheese over the top of the chicken mixture. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes until the cheese is melted and starting to brown and the edges of the dip are bubbling. Serve warm with tortilla or barbecue chips.
