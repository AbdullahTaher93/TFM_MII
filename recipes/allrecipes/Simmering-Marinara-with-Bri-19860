In a large skillet over medium heat, heat olive oil. Saute garlic, but do not allow to brown. Stir in tomatoes and half the basil. Reduce heat and simmer 45 minutes. Stir in remaining basil. Remove the rind from the Brie and place in the pan. Allow the cheese to melt without stirring, then stir to combine and remove from heat. Serve sauce immediately.
