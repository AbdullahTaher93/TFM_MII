In a large stainless steel or glass mixing bowl, combine the oil, vinegar, hot sauce, celery seed and salt. Mix thoroughly. Place the chopped onions and shrimp into the oil mixture. Toss to coat evenly. DO NOT use an aluminum mixing bowl! The high acid content in the vinegar could cause a reaction with the aluminum and poison the food. Place the mixture in the refrigerator and chill over night.
