Place the oven rack 6 inches below heat source and preheat the broiler to high. Brush a baking sheet with oil and arrange 20 radicchio leaves on it. Place 1 tablespoon cheese and 1 tablespoon walnuts in center of each. Broil until cheese melts, approximately 3 minutes. Remove immediately, roll up leaves lengthwise, secure with toothpicks and serve with grapes.
