Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut 24-inch piece of heavy-duty foil; set aside. Cut bread lengthwise in half; hollow out bottom half of loaf. Spread 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan butter on each bread half. Toss together ham and cheese in small bowl. Fill bottom half of bread with ham mixture. Top with tomato slices and remaining bread half. Wrap loaf securely in foil. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until cheese is melted and filling is warm.
