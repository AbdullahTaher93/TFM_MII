Combine beans, chicken broth, chicken breast, salsa verde, rice mix, chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder in a large saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until rice is tender, about 7 minutes. Stir and remove from heat. Let stand before serving, about 2 minutes.
