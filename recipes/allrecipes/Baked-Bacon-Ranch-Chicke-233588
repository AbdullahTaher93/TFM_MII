Preheat the broiler and spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Sprinkle the chicken with half of the Hidden Valley(R) Original Ranch(R) Dressing and Seasoning Mix. Wrap two bacon slices around each piece of chicken. Reserve remaining Ranch(R) Dressing and Seasoning Mix for another use. Spray a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and set over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until the bacon is browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to the baking sheet. Top each chicken breast with 2 tomato slices and 1 slice of cheese. Broil 5 inches from the heat source until the chicken is cooked through (165 degrees F internal temperature) and the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 4 minutes longer. Serve atop lettuce for an all-in-one salad.
