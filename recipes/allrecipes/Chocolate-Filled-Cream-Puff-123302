In a saucepan over medium heat, bring water and butter to a boil. Add flour and salt all at once; stir until a smooth ball forms. Remove from the heat; let stand 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Beat until smooth. Cover a baking sheet with foil; grease foil. Drop batter into six mounds onto foil. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F; bake 30 minutes longer. Remove puffs to a wire rack. Immediately cut a slit in each for steam to escape. In a mixing bowl, beat cream until soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar and cocoa, beating until almost stiff. Split puffs and remove soft dough. Add filling; replace tops. Melt chocolate and butter; stir in sugar and water. Drizzle over puffs. Chill.
