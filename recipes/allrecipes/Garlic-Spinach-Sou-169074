Bring the chicken broth, garlic, and ginger to a boil in a large saucepan; reduce heat to medium and cook for 10 minutes. Add the zucchini and cook until the zucchini is tender, about 10 minutes more. Stir in the chicken and cellophane noodles; cook until the chicken is hot and the noodles are soft and transparent, about 3 minutes. Stir in the spinach until wilted.
