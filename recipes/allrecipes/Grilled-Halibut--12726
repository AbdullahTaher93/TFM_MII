Mix together grapefruit juice, olive oil, 2 teaspoons marjoram, salt, and pepper, in a shallow glass dish. Add fish, turn once to coat both sides, then cover dish. Refrigerate 1 to 2 hours, turning once or twice. Preheat barbecue or gas grill. Reserve marinade, and place fish in lightly oiled wire basket. Place fish 4 to 6 inches above hot coals. Grill for 10 to 12 minutes, turning once and brushing twice with reserved marinade, until steaks are barely opaque in thickest part. Arrange on a platter, scatter grapefruit sections around steaks, and garnish with sprigs of marjoram.
