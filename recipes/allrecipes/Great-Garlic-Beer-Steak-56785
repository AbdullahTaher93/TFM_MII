In a shallow glass dish, combine the beer, garlic, pepper, oyster sauce and lemon juice. Mix well. Rub steaks on both sides with steak seasoning, and place in the marinade. Be sure to coat the steaks well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Preheat grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate. Remove steaks from marinade, and discard marinade. Grill steaks for about 5 minutes on each side, or to desired doneness.
