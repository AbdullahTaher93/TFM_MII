Peel and section oranges over a large bowl, and squeeze membranes to extract juice. Set orange sections aside, and reserve 1 tablespoon juice. Discard orange membranes. Add the oil and the next 4 ingredients (oil through pepper) to reserved orange juice. Stir well; set aside. Steam the broccoli, covered, 11/2 minutes or until crisp-tender. Rinse broccoli under cold water; drain well. Add the broccoli, orange sections, onion, and watercress to the orange juice mixture, and toss well. Divide the salad evenly between 2 plates.
