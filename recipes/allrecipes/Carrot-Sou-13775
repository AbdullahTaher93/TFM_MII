In a medium sized stock pot, over high heat, combine the chicken stock, carrots, garlic, dill weed, salt and butter. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes or until carrots are soft. In a blender, puree the soup, return to stock pot and simmer for an additional 30 to 45 minutes. Season with additional dill or garlic if needed.
