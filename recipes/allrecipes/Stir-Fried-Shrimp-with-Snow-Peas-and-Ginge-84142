In a large bowl, stir salt into water until dissolved. Add shrimp, and set aside 5 minutes. Rinse shrimps, and dry on paper towels. In a small bowl, mix together broth, rice wine, soy sauce, cornstarch, sugar, and pepper. Set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Cook shrimp, turning constantly, until pink on all sides, about 1 minute. Stir in garlic, ginger, and 2 teaspoons oil. Stir in snow peas, chives, and 1/4 teaspoon salt; stir-fry 1 minute more. Stir broth mixture into skillet, and continue cooking until sauce thickens. Serve immediately.
