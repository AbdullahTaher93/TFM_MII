Combine the meat with the Worcestershire sauce, grill seasoning and cumin in a medium bowl. Form 6 thin 3-inch patties and drizzle each on 1 side with EVOO. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and cook the patties, olive oil side down, for 3 minutes per side for medium well. Serve the burgers on the dinner rolls with the topper of your choice.
