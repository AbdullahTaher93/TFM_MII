First, make the Shortcake: In a food processor, pulse together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the butter and pulse just until the mixture forms small gravel-like pieces. With the motor running, pour the cream through the feed tube, stopping just before the dough forms a ball. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead just until it forms a smooth ball, being careful not to overwork it. On a lightly floured board, roll out the dough to a 1/2-inch (12-mm) thickness. Using a 2 1/2-inch (6-cm) cookie or biscuit cutter, cut out 6 circles, gathering and re-rolling the scraps if necessary. Place them on a baking sheet, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until ready to assemble the cobbler. Combine the cherries and berries with the brown sugar, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, kirsch or Grand Marnier, and cinnamon. Fold gently until thoroughly mixed. Spoon the fruit mixture into ovenproof roast pan. Dot with softened butter. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Distribute the prepared shortcake circles on top. Lightly brush the shortcakes with heavy cream and sprinkle them with sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is bubbling and the shortcakes are golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove the cobbler from the oven. Let it sit for 10 minutes before serving with vanilla ice cream.
