Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Beat egg and 2 tablespoons water in a bowl. Measure flour into a separate bowl. Dip chicken cubes in egg mixture; remove. Roll chicken in flour until completely coated. Carefully place small batches of coated chicken into hot oil using a slotted spoon. Fry until chicken is golden brown and center is no longer pink, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon. Arrange cooked chicken on a baking sheet and place in preheated oven to keep warm while continuing to fry remaining chicken. Whisk 3 cups water, cornstarch, chicken bouillon cubes, oyster sauce, and white pepper together in a saucepan; simmer over medium heat until thickened, about 5 minutes. Pour sauce over cooked chicken to serve. Sprinkle cashews and green onions over each serving.
