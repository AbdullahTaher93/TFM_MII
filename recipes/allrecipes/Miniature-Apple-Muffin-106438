Beat SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, butter, and molasses at medium speed of an electric mixer 1 minute or until blended. Add eggs, one at a time, beating until blended after each addition; add apple juice concentrate and lemon peel, beating until blended. Combine flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, soda, and salt; add to SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener mixture, beating on low speed just until blended. Stir in apple, oats, and raisins. Spoon batter into prepared pans; filling three-fourths full. Bake until edges are lightly browned, 12 minutes. Remove to wire racks to cool.
