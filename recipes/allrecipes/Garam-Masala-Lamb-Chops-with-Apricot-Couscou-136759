Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Bring water and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a boil in a small saucepan. Mix garam masala, 1 teaspoon oil, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper in a small bowl. Rub into lamb. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large, ovenproof, nonstick skillet over high heat. Cook the lamb, skin-side down, until browned on one side, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn it over and transfer the skillet to the oven. Roast the lamb until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reaches 145 degrees F for medium-rare, 6 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes before slicing into chops. Meanwhile, stir couscous, apricots and raisins into the boiling water. Return to a boil, reduce heat to a low simmer, cover and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Stir in pine nuts, mint, lemon juice and the remaining 2 teaspoons oil. Serve the couscous with the lamb.
