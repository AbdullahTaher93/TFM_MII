If chicken pieces are large, remove tenders or slice thick pieces in half horizontally (butterflied), then cut into two pieces. Combine olive oil, curry powder, garam masala, onion powder, paprika and garlic salt in a self-closing plastic bag; add chicken and rotate bag to mix well. Marinate in refrigerator 30 minutes, or longer for stronger flavor. Mix together yogurt sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Refrigerate. Preheat grill. Remove chicken from marinade. Grill over medium heat, turning occasionally, about 10-12 minutes or until done. Serve with cucumber yogurt sauce.
