Melt the butter in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season the chicken pieces with a little salt and pepper, then place them in the pan. Cook, turning as necessary, until the skin is evenly browned. Pour the chicken broth and water into the pot, and bring to a boil. Stir in the bouillon cubes until dissolved. Simmer over low heat for 35 to 45 minutes, or until chicken is almost falling off of the bone. Remove the chicken pieces from the pot and set aside. Stir the sour cream into the broth. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Serve chicken with sauce over rice or noodles.
