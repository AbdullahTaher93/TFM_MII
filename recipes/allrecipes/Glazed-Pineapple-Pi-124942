Drain pineapple, reserving 1 tablespoon juice for glaze. In a medium bowl, combine pineapple, sugar, flour, lemon juice, butter and salt; mix well and set aside. Line a 9-in. pie pan with the bottom pastry. Sprinkle with coconut. Spread pineapple mixture over coconut. Top with remaining pastry; flute edges and cut slits in top. Bake at 400 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown. Cool 20 minutes on a wire rack. Meanwhile, for glaze, combine confectioners' sugar, vanilla and reserved pineapple juice until smooth. Spread over the top of warm pie. Serve warm or at room temperature.
