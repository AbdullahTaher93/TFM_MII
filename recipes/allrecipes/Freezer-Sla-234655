Combine cabbage, green bell pepper, onion, and carrots in a large bowl. Mix boiling water and salt together in a bowl and pour over cabbage mixture. Set aside for salt to draw out extra water from vegetables, about 1 hour. Drain well. Mix sugar, 1 cup water, cider vinegar, and celery seed in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Cook and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute. Remove saucepan from heat and cool completely. Pour cooled sugar-vinegar mixture over drained cabbage mixture in a large bowl and toss until slaw is well mixed. Spoon slaw into resealable plastic bags and freeze.
