In a bowl, combine buckwheat flour, cornmeal, all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda. Add egg yolks and buttermilk; stir just until batter is evenly moistened. Add blueberries. In a deep bowl, whip egg whites with a mixer on high speed just until whites hold stiff peaks. Gently fold whites into batter. Place a nonstick griddle or 11- to 12-in. nonstick frying pan over medium heat. When hot, pour batter, about 1/4 cup for each cake, onto griddle. Cook until tops of pancakes are bubbly and edges appear dry, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Turn over to brown other side. Serve hot with butter and syrup.
