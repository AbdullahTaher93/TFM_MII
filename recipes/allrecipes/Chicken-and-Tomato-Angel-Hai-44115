Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook for 5 to 6 minutes or until al dente. Remove from heat, drain, and return to pot. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and saute garlic 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in chicken, and cook until no longer pink and juices run clear. Drain, and set aside. Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan, and dissolve bouillon cubes. Place pot with pasta over low heat, and mix in chicken, water with dissolved bouillon cubes, and tomatoes. Cook and stir for about 5 minutes, until heated through. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese to serve.
