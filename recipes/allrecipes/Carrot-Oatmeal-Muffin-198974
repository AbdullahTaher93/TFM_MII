Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 12-cup non-stick muffin pan with non-stick cooking spray. Set aside. In a large bowl, combine flour, oats, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. In another large bowl, whisk egg, egg whites, and SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend until well combined. Whisk in applesauce, oil, orange peel, and vanilla. Stir in carrots and raisins. Add dry ingredients and mix just until moistened. (Batter will be lumpy.) Scrape batter into prepared cups, filling each cup about 2/3 full. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until a tester inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Cool in pan 10 minutes. Loosen sides with a knife, and remove to a wire rack. Serve warm or cool completely.
