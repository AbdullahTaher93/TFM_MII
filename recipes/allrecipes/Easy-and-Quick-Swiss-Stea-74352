Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. In a bowl, mix the flour, salt and pepper, and paprika. Dredge the steaks in the flour mixture, and place in the skillet. Brown steaks on both sides, and remove from heat. In a slow cooker, alternate layers of steak, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, onion, and tomatoes. Cover, and cook 6 to 8 hours on Low, until steaks are very tender.
