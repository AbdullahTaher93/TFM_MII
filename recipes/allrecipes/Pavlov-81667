Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. In a small bowl mix together the Splenda and the guar gum. Set aside. In a clean dry bowl, whip the egg whites with the cream of tartar until soft peaks. Add the vinegar and vanilla and beat until blended. While whipping, gradually add the Splenda. Whip until stiff peaks (the peaks on the beaters stay straight even when turned completely upright). Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Pour out the meringue in the center forming a small circle (about 10 inches in diameter). Use a spatula to form even sides and to smooth the top flat forming an even disk. Bake at 325 degrees F for 10-15 minutes. Reduce heat to 300 degrees F and bake another 40-50 minutes until the meringue just starts to pick up some color. Turn off heat and leave in the oven with the door ajar for 30-60 minutes until completely cooled. Transfer to a round platter or a very flat dinner plate. Meanwhile, prepare your fruit. Slice the kiwi as thin as you can with a serrated knife. Then put the point of the knife between the peel and flesh and turn the slice, removing the peel without losing any of the yummy flesh. Then cut each slice in halves or quarters. Trim and slice strawberries thinly. Leave the blackberries whole. Refrigerate until needed. Whipped cream: In a mixer add the cream, vanilla extract and the Splenda. Whip until soft peaks. Spread the whipped cream on top of the meringue almost to the edge. Along the edge of the whipped cream, alternately place a piece of kiwi and then a slice of strawberry until completing the circle. Sprinkle the remaining kiwi and strawberry evenly inside the circle. Then add the blackberries evenly within the circle. Bring to the table whole. Then using a serrated knife cut into 8 slices and serve.
