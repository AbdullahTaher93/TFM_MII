Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Form a sheet of aluminum foil into the shape of a baking sheet; spray with cooking spray. Mix kale, red onion, carrots, jalapeno peppers, garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Spread kale mixture onto the prepared aluminum foil. Place the aluminum foil 'baking sheet' onto the preheated grill; cook, tossing kale using tongs, until kale reduces in size and desired texture is reached, 6 to 8 minutes.
