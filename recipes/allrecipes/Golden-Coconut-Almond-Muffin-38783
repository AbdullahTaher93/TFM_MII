Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 12 cup muffin pan. In a large bowl, mix flour, shredded coconut, sugar, almonds, baking powder, orange zest, baking soda, and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together coconut milk, orange juice, olive oil, and vanilla extract. Pour into the flour mixture, and stir until just blended. Transfer to the prepared muffin pan. Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until a knife inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Turn onto a wire rack to cool before serving.
