For Chicken: Combine SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, salt, and hot water in 1-gallon zipper-lock plastic bag and shake to dissolve SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend and salt. Add cold water and chicken. Press air out of bag, seal, and refrigerate 1 1/2 to 2 hours. For Chutney: In medium steel saucepan, combine tart cherries, apples, onions, SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend, dried cherries, coffee, vinegar, lemon peel, and cayenne. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer gently 15 to 20 minutes, or until apples are soft and most of liquid evaporates. Remove from heat and stir in juice concentrate and mint. Set aside. Remove chicken from brine and discard brine. Refrigerate chicken until ready to serve (up to 1 day). Pat chicken dry with paper towels and sprinkle all over with pepper. Let rest at room temperature 20 minutes. Heat grill to medium-high. Brush grill grate and coat with oil. Put chicken on grill, cover, and cook 5 to 7 minutes per side, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear (about 170 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer). Brush with oil during last 5 minutes. Serve with chutney.
