Season chicken with salt and pepper. Melt butter in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken pieces, in batches if necessary, until browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Add 1/2 of the onion rings, wine, chicken bouillon, cinnamon, garlic, thyme, and bay leaves. Cook over low heat until chicken is tender, about 20 minutes. Stir remaining onion rings into the skillet. Cook until softened slightly, about 3 minutes. Transfer chicken to a serving platter. Stir crema Salvadorena into the onion mixture in the skillet until well blended. Spoon over chicken.
