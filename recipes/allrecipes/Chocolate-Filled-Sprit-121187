In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in the egg and extracts. Combine the dry ingredients; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Using a cookie press fitted with the disk of your choice, press dough 2 in. apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until set (do not brown). Remove to wire racks to cool. Melt the chocolate; spread over the bottom of half of the cookies; top with remaining cookies.
