Score the surface of each beef short rib in a diamond pattern. Combine beef, green onion, carrots, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and brown sugar in a large skillet. Pour enough water to cover the beef. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until beef is tender, about 1 hour. Skim off excess oil before serving.
