Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two miniature muffin pans. Lightly press the wonton wrappers into the prepared muffin pans. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Set aside. Cook the sausage in a skillet over medium heat until no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain and place the sausage in a mixing bowl. Stir the Colby cheese, peppers, onions, and salad dressing into the cooked sausage. Spoon the sausage filling into the wonton cups. Bake the filled wonton cups in the preheated oven until heated through, 6 to 7 minutes.
