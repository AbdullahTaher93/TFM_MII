Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, stir together the baked beans, onion, brown sugar, syrup, ketchup and mustard. Pour into a 9x13 inch baking dish, and lay strips of bacon across the top. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bacon is browned and the beans have thickened.
