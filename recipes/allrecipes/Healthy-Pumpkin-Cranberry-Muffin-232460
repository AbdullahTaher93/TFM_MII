Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners. Stir milk and vinegar together in a small bowl. Mix whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, oats, baking soda, ginger, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk pumpkin, brown sugar, white sugar, vegetable oil, and egg together in a separate bowl; beat in milk mixture until smooth. Stir flour mixture into pumpkin mixture until just combined. Fold in fresh and dried cranberries. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool muffins in the pan for 5 minutes before removing to wire rack to cool completely.
