Grease a 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan with butter; set aside. In a large heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, corn syrup and water. Cook over medium-high heat until a candy thermometer reads 300 degrees F (hard-crack stage), stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat; stir in maple flavoring. Immediately pour into prepared pan; cool. Break into pieces. Store in an airtight container.
