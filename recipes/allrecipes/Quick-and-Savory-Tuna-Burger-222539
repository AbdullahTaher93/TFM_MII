Mix tuna, eggs, bread crumbs, onion, celery, horseradish, lemon juice, garlic, and black pepper in a bowl until mixture holds together. Divide mixture into 4 portions and form each portion into a patty. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook patties in the hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.
