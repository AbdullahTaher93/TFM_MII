In a blender or food processor, combine 1 cucumber half, the yogurt, oil, vinegar, dill, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and the pepper. Blend or process until smooth. Chop the remaining cucumber and add to the blender or food processor along with the feta. Pulse once or twice just to combine. In a large glass or stainless-steel bowl, combine the spinach, turkey, tomatoes, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Toss the salad with the dressing.
