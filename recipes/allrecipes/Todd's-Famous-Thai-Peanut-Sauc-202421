Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour the peanuts onto a dry baking sheet in a single layer, and break the whole nuts apart into halves. Toast the peanuts until they are fragrant and slightly darker in color, 7 to 10 minutes, watching carefully so they don't burn. Remove peanuts from the oven, let cool, and place in the work bowl of a food processor. Pulse 2 or 3 times to chop them finely, then add the canola oil, toasted sesame oil, hot chili oil, soy sauce, lime juice, sugar, and chili garlic sauce. Process until the mixture is a fine paste with a little texture of chopped peanuts, not a totally smooth paste. The sauce should look a little grainy.
