Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly grease an 8-inch springform cake pan. Line the base and side with waxed paper. Put the butter and superfine sugar into a mixing bowl. Beat with a wooden spoon or electric beater until pale and fluffy. Gradually beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, with 1 teaspoon flour, beating well after each addition. Mix the vanilla extract with 1 tablespoon cold water and beat into the creamed mixture. Gradually fold in the remaining flour, baking powder, salt, and the grated chocolate until blended. Spoon half the batter into the pan and spread level. Drain the pears and dry on paper towels. Cut into slices and arrange on top of the batter in the pan. Spoon the remaining batter over the top and spread level. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Turn out onto a wire rack and let cool. Mix the confectioners' sugar with the lemon juice until smooth, then spread on top of the cake. Sprinkle the chocolate on top. Let frosting set about 2 hours, then serve.
