Bake the pastry shells according to package directions. While the pastry shells bake, in a large, deep skillet, heat the EVOO, 2 turns of the pan, over medium to medium-high heat. Stir in the celery, carrots, onion and bay leaf, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. Add the red bell pepper and cook for 2 minutes. Push the vegetables to the side of the pan, add the butter to the pan and melt. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Whisk in the chicken broth, add the chicken and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 8 minutes. Stir in the cream and bring just to a boil, then stir in the asparagus, peas and tarragon and cook for 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Place 2 hollow pastry shells in each bowl and fill with Chicken la Queen. Cover with pastry shell tops.
