Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray 2 (10-oz) custard cups or souffle dishes with cooking spray. If necessary, heat bacon in microwave on High 15 seconds or until warm and pliable. Line inner side of each custard cup (not bottom) with 2 bacon slices, overlapping as necessary. Gently place frozen biscuit in each cup to fit inside bacon collar. Spoon 1 heaping tablespoon green chiles onto each biscuit; place remaining green chiles in small bowl and set aside. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons cheese over chiles on each biscuit. Carefully crack 1 egg over cheese on each. Sprinkle each with 2 tablespoons remaining cheese to cover; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place custard cups on cookie sheet; bake 25 to 35 minutes or until biscuits are baked and egg whites are set. Cool in cups 5 minutes. Meanwhile, add tomato, cilantro, onion and lime juice to green chiles in bowl; mix well. Season to taste with salt. Carefully remove bacon-wrapped biscuits from custard cups; place on individual plates. Spoon green chile salsa over top and around sides. Serve with cantaloupe.
