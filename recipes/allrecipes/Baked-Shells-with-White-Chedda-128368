Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch-square (2.5-L) baking dish with nonstick spray. In a saucepan, whisk milk, cornstarch, mustard, pepper, and hot-pepper sauce until smooth. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly until sauce thickens and boils. Add 3/4 cup (175 mL) Cheddar and the cottage cheese. Cook and stir until Cheddar is melted. Combine cheese sauce with pasta, spinach, and scallions. Spoon into prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with remaining Cheddar and crumbs. Bake until hot and bubbly, about 20 minutes.
