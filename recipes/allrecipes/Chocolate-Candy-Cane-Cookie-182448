Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Beat cream cheese, butter, sugar and vanilla in large bowl with mixer until blended. Add flour and baking soda; mix well. Blend in semi-sweet chocolate. (Dough will be stiff.) Roll tablespoonfuls of dough into 52 balls; roll each into 3-inch-long rope. Place, 2 inches apart, on baking sheets, bending top of each slightly to resemble candy cane. Bake 10 to 12 min. or until puffed and set; cool 5 min. on baking sheets. Transfer to wire racks; cool completely. Melt white chocolate; drizzle over cookies. Sprinkle with crushed candies. Let stand until chocolate is firm.
