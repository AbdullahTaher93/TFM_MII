Melt margarine in a stockpot over medium heat. Cook and stir apples, celery, onion, carrot, and bell pepper in melted margarine until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir flour, curry powder, salt, and black pepper into the vegetable mixture. Pour chicken stock over the mixture; add tomatoes and cloves. Add the diced chicken and parsley; bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook at a simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes.
