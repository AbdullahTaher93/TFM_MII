To prepare salsa, remove 2 chipotle chiles from can, and finely chop chiles to measure 2 teaspoons. Remove 1 teaspoon adobo sauce from can, and set aside (reserve remaining chipotle chiles and adobo sauce for another use). Combine 2 teaspoons chiles, cilantro, tomatillos, red onion, and 1/4 cup lime juice in a bowl; cover and chill 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. To prepare chips, combine 2 1/2 teaspoons lime juice, canola oil, adobo sauce, paprika, and cumin in a small bowl, stirring with a whisk. Brush 1 tortilla with about 1/4 teaspoon juice mixture, spreading to edge. Top with another tortilla; repeat procedure with juice mixture. Repeat procedure 6 more times (you will have 1 stack of 8 tortillas). Using a sharp knife, cut tortilla stack into 6 wedges. Place wedges in a single layer on baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15 minutes; turn wedges. Bake an additional 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. To prepare cheese, combine cream cheese and goat cheese in a small bowl; stir until blended. Spread cheese mixture into a shallow 6-ounce ramekin or baking dish; cover with foil. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes or just until warm.
