Place all ingredients in the bowl of a food processor and mix until a sticky ball forms without over processing. With slightly wet hands, roll a tablespoon of mixture into a tight ball. Shape into 24 (about 1-inch diameter) balls. Refrigerate, covered, until chilled. Store leftovers in refrigerator, covered.
