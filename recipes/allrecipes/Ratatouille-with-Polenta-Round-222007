Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large baking dish. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir eggplant, zucchini, onion, green bell pepper, cherry tomatoes, kalamata olives, and garlic until vegetables start to become tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in wine, basil, thyme, and oregano; season with salt and black pepper. Bring ratatouille to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 3 minutes. Pour ratatouille into prepared baking dish and arrange polenta slices and mozzarella cheese rounds over the top. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is simmering and mozzarella cheese is melted and bubbling, about 20 minutes.
