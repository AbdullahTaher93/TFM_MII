Line a plate or small tray with wax paper. Place nuts in a shallow dish. Scoop a heaping 1/2 teaspoon goat cheese and press a piece of dried apricot (or fig) into the center. Wrap the cheese around the dried fruit to form a ball. Roll the ball in the chopped nuts to create a crust; set on the plate or tray. Repeat with remaining goat cheese, dried fruit and nuts.
