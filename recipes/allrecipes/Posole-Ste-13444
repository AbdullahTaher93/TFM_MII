Soak the posole in 6 cups of salted water overnight. Drain and rinse. In a large stock pot combine 2 quarts water, salt to taste, garlic and hot pepper sauce. Bring to a boil and boil for two hours, checking often to make sure posole is fully covered; add water as necessary. If adding meat, do so at this time. Cook one more hour. Add the ketchup, green chile peppers, onion flakes, carrots, eggplant, onion, squash and garlic. Stir together and reduce heat to low. Let simmer for 1/2 hour to 1 hour depending on altitude.
