Season steak with garlic salt and black pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak; cook until browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer steak to a cutting board and let rest, about 5 minutes. Slice into thin strips. Cut Mexican squash, carrot, and radishes into noodles using a spiralizer. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add carrot noodles; cook and stir until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add squash noodles; cook, stirring constantly, until tender, about 5 minutes. Divide carrot and squash noodle mixture between 2 serving plates. Top with sliced steak. Garnish with radish noodles, avocado, grape tomatoes, and cilantro. Whisk sour cream and sriracha sauce together in a small bowl. Drizzle over serving plates.
