Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Beat sugar, pumpkin, vegetable oil, eggs, and molasses together in a large bowl. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, and ground ginger together in another bowl. Add flour mixture to pumpkin mixture and stir until batter is well-combined. Stir 2/3 of the almonds and 3/4 of the chocolate chips into batter. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan; sprinkle remaining almonds and remaining chocolate chips over the top of the loaf. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
