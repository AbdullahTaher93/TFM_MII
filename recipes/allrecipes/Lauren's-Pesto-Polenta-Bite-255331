Place a grill pan in an oven and preheat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). (If using a countertop induction oven, preheat on the "Grill" setting.) Brush polenta slices with olive oil; season with garlic salt and Italian seasoning. Transfer to heated grill pan. Grill in the preheated oven until golden brown, flipping halfway through, about 12 minutes in the conventional oven and 6 minutes in the countertop induction oven. Combine basil, lemon juice, pine nuts, and garlic in a food processor; pulse a few times until chopped. Pour in 1/2 cup olive oil in a steady stream, with the processor running, until pesto is smooth. Add Parmesan cheese; pulse until incorporated. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange polenta slices on a platter. Divide prosciutto over slices; top each with 1 to 2 tablespoons pesto. Garnish with roasted red peppers.
