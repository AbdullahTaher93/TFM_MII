In a large resealable plastic bag, mix the orange juice, oil, honey, parsley, basil, orange zest, salt, and pepper. Place chicken in the bag, seal, and marinate in the refrigerator overnight. Preheat the grill for medium heat. Lightly oil the grill grate. Place the chicken on the grill, and discard marinade. Cook chicken 15 minutes, turning once, or until juices run clear.
