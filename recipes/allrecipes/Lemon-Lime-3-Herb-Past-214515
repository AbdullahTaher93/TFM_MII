Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the rotini in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Remove 1/3 cup of the water from the pot and set aside. Drain the pasta. Combine the pasta and reserved water in a large bowl; stir the lemon juice, lime juice, parsley, cilantro, and sage through the pasta until evenly mixed. Serve hot.
