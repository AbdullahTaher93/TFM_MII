Place walnuts, pine nuts, salt, pepper, garlic, butter, basil, and parsley in to a blender or food processor. Turn the blender on, and add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream. Continue processing until a soft paste has formed. Fold in Parmesan and Romano cheeses. Store in the refrigerator covered by 1/4 inch of olive oil to prevent the surface from turning brown.
