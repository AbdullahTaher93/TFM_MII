Rinse fennel. Cut off coarse stalks, reserving a few feathery leaves for garnish. Trim and discard base and any discolored or bruised parts from each fennel head. Cut bulbs in half lengthwise, then slice crosswise very thinly. In a salad bowl, combine oil, lemon juice, and vinegar. Add fennel, then mix lightly to coat well with dressing. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with cheese, if desired. Garnish with reserved leaves.
