In a large pot, combine turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, broth, and onion. Bring to a boil, and cook until onion is soft. Thicken with flour if needed. Warm tortillas in a dry frying pan over medium heat. Spoon turkey mixture onto a warm tortilla, sprinkle with cheese, and roll into a burrito. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Spread more cheese on top and add another spoonful of the turkey mixture over the cheese. Garnish with jalapeno slices, sprinkle with jalapeno juice, and season with salt, pepper, and parsley. Serve hot.
