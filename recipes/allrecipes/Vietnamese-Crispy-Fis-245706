Cut heads off each snapper and score skin on each side; sprinkle with sea salt. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add snapper and pan-fry until skin is brown and crispy and flesh flakes easily with a fork, 6 to 8 minutes per side. Place snapper on a serving platter and return skillet to stove top. Cook remaining oil, tomatoes, chiles, and garlic over high heat in a skillet until tomatoes soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add water, fish sauce, and palm sugar; simmer until mixture is reduced slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in green onions, cilantro, and cornstarch; simmer until mixture is reduced to a sticky-sauce consistency, about 1 minute more. Pour sauce over fish to serve.
