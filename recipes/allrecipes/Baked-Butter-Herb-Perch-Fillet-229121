Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour butter into a shallow dish. Combine cracker crumbs, Parmesan cheese, basil, oregano, salt, and garlic powder in a separate shallow bowl. Dip perch fillets into melted butter and press into the seasoned cracker crumbs to coat. Arrange coated fillets on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the coating is browned and fish flakes easily with a fork, 25 to 30 minutes.
