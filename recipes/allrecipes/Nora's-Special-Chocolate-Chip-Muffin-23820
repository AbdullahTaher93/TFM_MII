Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. In a large bowl, combine flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, salt and chocolate chips. Add egg, milk and oil; stir just until batter is moistened. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups, filling about 3/4 full. In a small bowl, stir together 3 tablespoons white sugar and 2 tablespoons brown sugar. Sprinkle sugar mixture over muffins. Bake in preheated for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown.
