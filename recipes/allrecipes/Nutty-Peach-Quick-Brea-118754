In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugars. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in honey and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with milk. Fold in peaches and pecans. Spoon into three greased 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Combine the oats and brown sugar; sprinkle over batter and gently press in. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 20 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely.
