Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the crushed garlic, ginger, and lemon grass; cook and stir until brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the fish sauce, oyster sauce, salt and pepper until blended. Add crab legs, cover, and cook over medium heat, tossing occasionally, until heated through, about 15 minutes.
