Press into ungreased 15 x 10-inch jelly-roll pan. BAKE for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown and set. Cool until just slightly warm. MICROWAVE remaining morsels in small, heavy-duty plastic bag on HIGH (100 percent) power for 30 to 45 seconds; knead. Microwave at additional 10- to 20-second intervals, kneading until smooth.
