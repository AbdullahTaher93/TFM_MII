Mix together the egg, mayonnaise, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and hot pepper sauce in a bowl. Place the crawfish tail meat and crushed crackers in a large bowl, and mix in the mayonnaise mixture until thoroughly combined. Refrigerate the crawfish mixture until it can hold a shape, about 1 hour. Form the chilled mixture into 8 patties. Heat the canola oil in a skillet over medium heat, and fry the patties until golden brown on each side, about 6 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
