Place ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order suggested by the manufacturer. Select the Dough setting, and Start. After the dough has risen once, remove it from the machine. Knead it a few times, and then shape into a loaf. Place in a greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pan. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 to 40 minutes, or until done. Alternatively, choose the Basic or White Bread setting, and Start.
