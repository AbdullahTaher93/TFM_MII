Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 10 inch pie plate. In a large bowl, combine baking mix, eggs, and milk. Mix until smooth. Stir in broccoli, onion, and 2 cups of the shredded cheese. Pour mixture into pie plate. Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown. Top with remaining cheese and return to oven just until cheese is melted. Serve hot.
