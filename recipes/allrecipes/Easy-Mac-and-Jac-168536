Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium saucepan, melt butter. Stir in flour and cook, stirring for 1 minute. Stir in the milk and bring to a gentle boil. Remove from heat and add shredded cheeses one cup at a time until completely melted. Add salt, pepper, mustard and red pepper flakes and stir until smooth. Stir in cooked pasta and coat evenly with cheese, then pour into shallow 2-quart baking dish. Sprinkle crushed croutons over top and bake for 30 minutes. Let stand 15 minutes before serving.
