Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add beans and water; mash until soft and heated through, about 5 minutes. Spread butter on baguette slices; arrange on a toaster oven tray. Bake in the toaster oven until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Spread beans on top. Cover with Oaxaca cheese. Bake in the toaster oven until cheese is melted and lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter. Garnish with pico de gallo.
