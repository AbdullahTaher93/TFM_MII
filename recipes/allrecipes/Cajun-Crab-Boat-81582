Remove the stem and seeds from the jalapeno and mince it as finely as you can. Toss it with the minced bell peppers, celery and scallions. Add the drained crab meat and toss. In a small bowl combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, lemon juice and Cajun seasoning. Mix well and then stir into the crab mixture. Separate the leaves from the endive. You should be able to get 8 or more nice leaves from each head. Spoon a generous portion of the crab mixture onto each leaf. Arrange on a platter and serve.
