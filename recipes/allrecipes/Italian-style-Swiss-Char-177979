Trim stem ends of chard. Thinly slice stems crosswise up to base of leaves; set slices aside. Reserve a few whole leaves to garnish serving dish; coarsely chop remaining leaves. In a 6- to 8-quart pan over medium-high heat, stir oil, garlic, and anchovies until garlic is slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add chard stems; stir until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in chopped leaves (part at a time if pan is full), cover, and cook until wilted, about 4 minutes. Mix in vinegar; season to taste with salt and pepper. Garnish a serving dish with reserved chard leaves; spoon greens alongside.
