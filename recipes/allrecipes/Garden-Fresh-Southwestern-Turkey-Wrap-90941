Place a 12-inch nonstick frying pan oven medium-high heat. Crumble in turkey, then add garlic, onion, chili powder, and cumin. Cook, stirring often, until meat is lightly browned (7 to 8 minutes). While meat is cooking, chop kale and chipotles; stir into turkey mixture along with tomato sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, until kale is wilted (about 10 minutes). Meanwhile, wrap tortillas in a cloth towel and heat in a microwave oven on high (100% power) for about 1 1/2 minutes or until heated through. Spoon turkey mixture into a serving bowl. To assemble wraps, spoon turkey mixture into hot tortillas; fold to enclose and eat out of hand.
