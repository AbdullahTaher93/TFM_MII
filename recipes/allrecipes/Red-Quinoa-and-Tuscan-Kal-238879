Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add quinoa and red bell pepper. Return water to a boil, place cover on the saucepan, reduce heat to low, and cook for about 10 minutes; add kale and continue cooking until quinoa is tender, about 5 minutes more. Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in hot oil until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes; transfer to a large bowl. Stir feta cheese, almonds, lemon juice, lemon zest, and olive oil with the onion mixture; add quinoa mixture and stir. Season mixture with sea salt and cracked black pepper.
