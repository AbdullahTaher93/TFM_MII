Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. In a small pan, over medium heat, melt butter, brown sugar, garlic, lemon juice, soy sauce and pepper. Stir until sugar has dissolved. Coat fish with sauce and place fish on hot grill. Cook, turning once and basting with any remaining sauce, until fish is just cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from grill and serve.
