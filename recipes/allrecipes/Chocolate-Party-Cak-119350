In a small saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over cold water; let stand for 1 minute. Cook and stir over low heat until gelatin is dissolved; set aside. In a heavy saucepan over low heat, cook and stir chocolate, sugar and hot water until chocolate is melted. Remove from the heat. Stir a small amount of hot chocolate mixture into egg yolks; return all to the pan, stirring constantly. Cook and stir over low heat until thermometer reads 160 degrees F. Remove from heat. Stir in gelatin mixture and vanilla until smooth. Cool to room temperature. Fold in whipped cream. Stir in almonds. Using a serrated knife, cut cake into cubes. Arrange a third of the cubes in a greased 10-in. tube pan with removable bottom. Spoon a third of the chocolate mixture over top. Repeat layers twice. Tap pan on work surface so chocolate mixture fills in spaces. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. For frosting, in a mixing bowl, beat cream until it begins to thicken. Add confectioners' sugar and vanilla; beat until stiff peaks form. Carefully run a knife around edge of pan to loosen. Invert cake onto serving plate; remove pan. Frost top and sides of cake. Sprinkle with almonds. Store in the refrigerator.
