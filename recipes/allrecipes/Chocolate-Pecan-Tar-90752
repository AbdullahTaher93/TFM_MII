Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. To make crust, in a food processor, blend pecans, brown sugar, and cinnamon until nuts are finely chopped. Add butter and process until well combined. Press mixture into bottom and sides of a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Bake at 325 degrees F for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Transfer to cooling rack and cool to room temperature. To make filling, in a medium pan over low heat, heat whipping cream until bubbles form around the edges. Add chocolate chips and whisk until melted and smooth. Pour into crust. Cover and refrigerate until firm, at least two hours. To make sauce, in a heavy, medium-size skillet over medium-high heat, melt butter. Add sugar and cook until deep golden brown, whisking frequently, about 10 minutes. (Mixture will be grainy.) As soon as the mixture is deep golden brown, add the cream and boil, whisking occasionally, until reduced to 2 1/2 cups, about 10 minutes. Cool. To serve, remove sides and bottom of tart pan and place tart on serving platter. Cut into wedges and serve with sauce.
