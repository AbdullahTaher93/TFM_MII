Place zucchini in a colander. Cover with cheesecloth or paper towels and squeeze out as much moisture as possible. Transfer zucchini to a large bowl; mix in onions, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and jalapeno pepper. Add eggs, cumin, coriander, and salt; mix well. Stir in feta cheese, chickpea flour, cilantro, and rice flour until batter is well blended and thick. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Drop pancake-sized scoops of batter into the skillet; cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a serving plate. Repeat with remaining oil and batter.
