Crumble sausage into a skillet; cook over medium heat until no longer pink. Drain. In a large bowl, combine biscuit mix and cheese. Add the sausage and stir until well blended. Stir in water just until mixed. Shape into 1-1/2-in. balls. Place on greased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for about 15 minutes or until golden.
