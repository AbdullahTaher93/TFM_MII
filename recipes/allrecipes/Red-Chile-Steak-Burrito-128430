Warm oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and garlic. Cook 10 minutes, or until tender. Toss beef with flour. Add beef to the saucepan and cook 5 minutes, or until no longer pink. Stir in chile peppers, tomatoes (with juice), and black pepper. Heat to boiling over high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 45 minutes, or until meat is very tender, breaking up tomatoes with the back of a spoon. Using a slotted spoon, remove about 3 tablespoons of meat and place it on a tortilla. Roll like an envelope to make an enclosed package. Repeat with remaining meat and tortillas. Top with sauce left in the pan.
