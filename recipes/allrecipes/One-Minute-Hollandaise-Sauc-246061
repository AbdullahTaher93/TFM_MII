Heat butter in a microwave-safe measuring cup in the microwave until melted, about 30 seconds. Whisk egg yolks, lemon juice, milk, salt, and black pepper together in a microwave-safe bowl. Whisk melted butter, a bit at a time, into egg yolk mixture until sauce is smooth. Cook sauce in the microwave on medium, whisking at 15-second intervals, until sauce is hot and thick, about 1 minute.
