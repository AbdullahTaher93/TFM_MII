In a 2-quart saucepan, heat butterscotch chips and chocolate chips over low heat, stirring constantly, until melted and smooth. Gently stir in cereal or pretzel sticks until well coated. Drop mixture by teaspoonfuls onto waxed paper to form 24 gremlins. Press 2 M&Ms onto each to resemble eyes. Refrigerate until set.
