Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Coat a 12-cup muffin pan with Spectrum Canola Oil Baking Spray or line with paper cups. In a large bowl, whisk the Arrowhead Mills Organic Whole Grain Pastry Flour, Arrowhead Mills Organic Soy Flour, Hain Pure Foods Gluten Free Featherweight Baking Powder, Hain Pure Foods Iodized Sea Salt, nutmeg, and pecans. In a small bowl, mix the Spectrum Naturals Canola Oil, fruit spread, eggs, vanilla extract, and Hain Pure Foods Organic Sugar. Add to the flour mixture, and stir just until moist. (Do not over mix or the product will be heavy and tough.) Spoon into the cups until three-quarters full. Bake until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean, 12 to 14 minutes.
