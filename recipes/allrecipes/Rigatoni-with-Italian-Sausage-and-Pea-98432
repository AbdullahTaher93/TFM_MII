In a 7 qt pot bring 4 quarts water to a boil and add 1 tablespoon salt. Use package directions as a guide to cook pasta until al dente; the last minute of cooking, add peas; drain and return to pot. Toss with olive oil and cover. Meanwhile, heat milk and broth in a microwave-safe measuring cup until steamy. Heat a medium skillet over medium heat then add sausage; cook until it loses its raw color, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; continue to cook another minute. Use slotted spoon to transfer sausage to a plate. Add enough butter to sausage drippings to equal 2 tablespoons. Whisk in flour, then hot milk mixture into the hot drippings; simmer till a sauce consistency, about 2 minutes. Stir in cheese. Return sausage to sauce and mix into sauce. Add to drained pasta and toss. Serve, additional cheese passed separately.
