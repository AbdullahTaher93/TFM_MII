In a 3- to 4-quart pan over medium-low heat, stir pecans often until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour into a small bowl. In the same pan, cook rice in water as directed on package, until tender to bite, about 25 minutes. If the mix came with seasoning packets, reserve for another use. Mix mango nectar and vinegar. Add to warm or cool rice and mix lightly. Add pecans, mango, chicken, and chopped mint; gently mix. Add salt and pepper to taste. Spoon into bowl and garnish with mint sprigs.
