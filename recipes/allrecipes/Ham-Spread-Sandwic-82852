Place the ham into a food processor, grind on pulse until very coarse. Add the onion and dill pickle relish close to the end of this stage. Put into mixing bowl and stir in the mustard and creamy salad dressing until well blended. Spoon about 1/2 cup of salad onto 8 slices of bread. Top with a lettuce leaf and remaining slices of bread.
