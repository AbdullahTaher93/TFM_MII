Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place shrimp in a bowl and sprinkle evenly with salt. Whisk mayonnaise, hot chili sauce, fish sauce, and sesame oil together in a bowl until evenly mixed. Whisk milk and eggs together in a bowl. Pour seafood breader into a shallow bowl. Dip shrimp in egg mixture. Transfer shrimp to seafood breader and coat well. Fry coated shrimp, working in batches, in the hot oil until coating is browned and shrimp are pink and fully cooked, about 5 minutes. Try to keep shrimp separate from each other while in the fryer. Remove cooked shrimp with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Pour mayonnaise mixture and cilantro into a large resealable plastic bag; add cooked shrimp. Seal bag and evenly coat shrimp with mayonnaise mixture.
