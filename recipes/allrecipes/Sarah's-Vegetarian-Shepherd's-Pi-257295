Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan. Remove from heat; pour in mashed potato mix. Stir thoroughly with a fork to moisten all potatoes. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion and carrots until onion is translucent and carrots are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in diced tomatoes, tomato paste, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Add kidney beans, peas, green beans, corn niblets, and mushrooms; stir until heated through, about 5 minutes. Pour tomato-bean mixture into a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese evenly on top. Spread mashed potatoes carefully over cheese until completely covered. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling on the sides, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle French-fried onions on top. Continue baking until top is golden brown, about 10 minutes more.
