Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix butternut squash, olive oil, thyme, black pepper, and salt in a large bowl until evenly coated. Spread mixture in a large baking dish in an even layer; cover with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes; remove foil and stir in half the Romano cheese. Sprinkle remaining cheese on top. Return to oven, uncovered, and continue to bake until tender and golden brown, about 20 minutes more.
