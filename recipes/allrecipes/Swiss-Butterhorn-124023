In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Cut in margarine and butter until crumbly. Stir in egg yolk and sour cream; shape into a ball. Chill several hours or overnight. Divide dough into thirds. On a well-floured surface, roll each portion into a 12-in. circle. Combine filling ingredients. Sprinkle a third of the filling over each circle. Cut each circle into 12 wedges. Roll each wedge, starting at the wide end. Place on greased baking sheets with points down. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until lightly browned. Make glaze if desired. Combine all ingredients and spread on warm rolls.
