Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease 2 large cookie sheets. Mix baking mix, pudding, egg and oil in a large bowl until dough forms. Roll dough into 1 inch balls. Place balls 2 inches apart on the cookie sheets. Dip flat-bottomed glass or cookie press into sugar. Press onto dough ball and flatten into 1/4 inch thick cookie. Bake until just golden brown on the edges, about 10 minutes. Transfer to racks and cool completely.
