Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter one side of each slice of Wonder Bread and press each slice butter-side down into the cups of a muffin tin. In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, egg, onion, cream of mushroom soup, salt and pepper until well blended. Fill each bread cup with the mixture. Sprinkle shredded Cheddar cheese over the tops. Bake for 30 minutes or until meat is cooked through.
