Mix all the ingredients together in a large pot, and bring the mixture to a boil. Then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. Stir occasionally until the sauce reaches the desired consistency. For a thinner sauce, add a little water or whiskey. After you've made a few sauces, substitute tomato paste for the ketchup and increase the amount of sweet and sour ingredients.
