Pour the water into a large saucepan. Add the bouillon cubes and whisk over high heat until the stock boils. Add the bell pepper strips and corn. Bring back to a boil, then add the chicken strips and immediately reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer 5 minutes. Uncover the pan and bring the soup back to a boil. Sprinkle the broccoli or mustard greens into the soup, but do not stir them in. Leave the broccoli or greens to cook on the surface of the soup, uncovered, until just tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Take the pan off the heat. Stir in the sherry, chives, tarragon, and seasoning to taste. Serve at once.
