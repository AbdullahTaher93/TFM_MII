Pulse dried red chile peppers in a spice grinder until coarsely ground. Combine ground chile peppers, apple cider vinegar, red chile powder, water, oregano, salt, garlic, cumin, sugar, and black pepper in a large bowl; mix well. Add turkey; mix until seasonings are well-incorporated. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add seasoned turkey; cook, stirring frequently to break up clumps, until no longer pink, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in lime juice and orange juice. Continue cooking until browned, about 5 minutes more.
