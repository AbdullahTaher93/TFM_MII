Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and transfer noodles to a large bowl. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir butter into noodles until evenly coated. Add cottage cheese, 1 1/2 cups sugar, applesauce, eggs, raisins, vanilla extract, and black pepper and mix well; fold in cake mix with candy bits. Pour noodle mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Sprinkle cinnamon and 1 teaspoon sugar over noodle mixture. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes more.
