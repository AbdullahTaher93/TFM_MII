Soak bread in milk in mixing bowl; stir in sour cream. Sprinkle salt, seasoned salt, oregano and pepper over ground beef; mix lightly but thoroughly. Add seasoned ground beef, celery leaves, parsley and onion to sour cream mixture and mix well. Using a 1/4 cup measure, divide beef mixture into 12 mounds. Place six mounds lightly on a greased rack of the broiler pan leaving space between each mound. Enclose each cube of cream cheese between 2 apricot halves. Place filled apricots over the beef mounds. Top each with a second beef mound and shape into a dome. Stud the 6 domes with slivered almonds in spiral pattern. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes.
