In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the flour, paprika, salt and cayenne. Add beef and shake to coat. In a Dutch oven over medium heat, brown beef in 2 tablespoons oil. Remove with a slotted spoon. In the same pan, saute onions in the remaining oil. Add water, tomato paste, sage and thyme; mix well. Return beef to pan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 1-1/4 hours, stirring occasionally. Add more water if needed. Stir in beans. Cover and simmer 15 minutes longer or until meat is tender.
