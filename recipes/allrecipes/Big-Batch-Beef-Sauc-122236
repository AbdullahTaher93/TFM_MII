In a Dutch oven over medium heat, cook beef, onions, celery and garlic until meat is no longer pink and vegetables are tender; drain. Stir in the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, for 1 to 1-1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Cool. Transfer to freezer bags or containers, about 2 cups in each. May be frozen for up to 3 months.
