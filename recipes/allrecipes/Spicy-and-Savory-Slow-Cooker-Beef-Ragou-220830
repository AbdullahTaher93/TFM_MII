Combine flour and Cajun seasoning in a resealable plastic bag. Pat stew meat pieces dry with paper towels; place meat, a few pieces at a time, into the bag. Seal the bag and shake several times to coat beef with seasoned flour. Set seasoned beef aside; repeat with remaining meat. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the meat in batches until browned on all sides, stirring often. Place stew vegetables, beef broth, morel mushrooms, diced tomatoes with green chiles, tomato sauce, basil, garlic, herbe de Provence, and bay leaves in a large slow cooker set on High setting. Stir the browned beef into the stew, cover, and cook until beef is tender, about 6 hours. Reduce slow cooker setting to Low and stir in Merlot wine. Cover cooker and cook until wine is slightly reduced and flavors have blended, about 30 more minutes. Season with sea salt and black pepper.
