Bring chicken broth and bulgur to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until bulgur is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; saute onion and celery until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir onion mixture, artichoke hearts, and sun-dried tomatoes into bulgur; season with salt and pepper.
