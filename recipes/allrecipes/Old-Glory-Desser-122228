Press cookie dough into a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar and lemon juice until smooth. Set aside 1/4 cup. Spread remaining cream cheese mixture over crust. Decorate with blueberries and strawberries to resemble a flag. Cut a small hole in a corner of a pastry or plastic bag. Insert star tip #16. Fill with reserved cream cheese mixture. Beginning in one corner, pipe stars in the spaces between the blueberries.
