Cook the bacon in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Drain on a paper towel. Crumble and set aside. Remove the turkey Italian sausage links from the casing and place in the Dutch oven along with the diced onion. Saute until the onion is soft and the sausage is cooked. Add the garlic, stirring frequently for 45 seconds. Add the chicken stock, milk, and potatoes. Add Swiss chard or kale along with the crushed red pepper, sea salt and fresh cracked black pepper to taste. Cook on medium low for 15 minutes or until hot. Ladle into soup bowls and garnish with crumbled bacon.
