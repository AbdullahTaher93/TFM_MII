Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Butter two cookie sheets. Sprinkle some sugar on a surface. Unfold or unroll the pastry to make a 10-inch square. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon superfine sugar. Fold in two opposite sides of the pastry to meet in the center. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon sugar and fold in the same sides again. Fold one half of the pastry over the other half. Slice the pastry crosswise into 1/2-inch thick slices. Dip the cut sides into sugar and place the cookies cut-sides down 2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets. Sprinkle with the remaining sugar. Bake, one sheet at a time, for about 12 minutes, or until just golden on the bottom. Remove from the oven and turn the pastries over. Bake for 5 to 7 minutes more, or until golden. Transfer to racks and let cool completely.
