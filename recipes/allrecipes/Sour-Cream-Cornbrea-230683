Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix cornmeal, flour, sugar, salt, and baking soda together in a large bowl. Add sour cream, butter, and eggs; stir until fully incorporated. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a tooth pick inserted in the center of the cornbread comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.
