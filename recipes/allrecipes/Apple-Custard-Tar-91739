Let refrigerated pie crust stand at room temperature according to package directions. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. On a floured surface, roll pie crust from the center to edge, forming a circle about 13 inches in diameter. Ease pastry into 11-inch tart pan with removable bottom. Trim pastry even with the rim of the pan. Place pan on baking sheet. Bake crust 15 minutes or until lightly golden. In small bowl, with mixer, beat sour cream, EAGLE BRAND(R), apple juice concentrate, egg, vanilla and cinnamon until smooth. Pour into prepared pie crust. Bake 25 minutes or until center appears set when shaken. Cool 1 hour on wire rack. In large skillet, cook apples in butter until tender-crisp. Arrange apples on top of pie; drizzle with Apple Cinnamon Glaze. Chill in refrigerator at least 4 hours. Store leftovers loosely covered in refrigerator. Apple Cinnamon Glaze: In small saucepan, combine 1/3 cup frozen apple juice concentrate, thawed; 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon; mix well. Cook and stir over low heat until thickened and bubbly.
