Brown Sugar Butter Tart Shell Steps: In a cake or pie pan, toast slivered almonds in a 350 degrees F oven until golden, shaking often, about 10 minutes. In a food processor or bowl, combine almonds, all-purpose flour, and 1/4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar. Add butter, cut into pieces; whirl or rub with your fingers until fine crumbs form. Add 1 egg yolk; whirl or mix with a fork until dough sticks together. Pat into a ball. Press dough over bottom and up sides, flush with rim, of a 9- or 10-inch fluted tart pan with removable rim. To assemble tart: Rinse apples and peel or leave skin on as desired. Core apples and cut into 1/4-inch thick slices. In a bowl, gently mix apple slices with 2 tablespoons of the brown sugar, orange juice, and tapioca. Let rest 10 minutes to soften tapioca, then overlap slices neatly in unbaked tart shell. In a glass-measuring cup, combine remaining brown sugar and marmalade. Heat in a microwave at full power in 30-second intervals, stirring each time, until marmalade is melted. Evenly spread over apple slices. Bake in a 350 degrees F oven until crust is well browned and apples are tender when pierced, about 45 minutes. Let tart cool on a rack at least 15 minutes. Serve warm or cool, cut into wedges, with ice cream if desired.
