In a saucepan over medium heat, mix the lemon juice, ketchup, steak sauce, balsamic vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, butter, brown sugar, Dijon mustard, black pepper, and red pepper. Blend until smooth, then mix in tomato paste. Stirring frequently, bring sauce to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 10 to 15 minutes, until slightly thickened.
