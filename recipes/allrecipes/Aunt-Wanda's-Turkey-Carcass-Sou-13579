Pick your Thanksgiving turkey nearly clean. (Turkey salad is great for a few days, or even turkey pot pies.) We are not real concerned about the choice meat here. Dump the turkey and all of its debris, including the juices, into a large pot. Add green beans, celery, spinach, cabbage, and white rice. Pour in enough water to cover everything. Bring soup to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for an hour or so. Add more water as needed. Remove all turkey bones and unwanted debris (i.e., skin, cartilage, etc.). There you have it. It's kind of a culinary scrapbook of your Turkey Day.
