Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute onions and garlic until onions are tender. Stir in red bell pepper and saute 2 minutes. Place ground beef in the skillet and cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Stir in beef broth, diced tomatoes, wine and tomato paste. Bring to a boil and add celery, bay leaves and Italian seasoning. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 hour, or until sauce thickens.
