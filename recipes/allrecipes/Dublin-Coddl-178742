Place a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat; cook the sausages and bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven until the bacon is crisp; drain fat from the pan, reserving 1 tablespoon of drippings. Crumble the bacon and halve the sausages. Heat the reserved drippings to the Dutch oven over low heat along with the crumbled bacon and sausages. Add the onions and carrots; cook and stir until the onions soften, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir in the stock and milk; bring to a simmer until the potatoes are fork tender 30 to 45 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to serve.
