Mix together 1/2 cup olive oil, wine mixed with salt, chopped leek, dill, rose petals, coriander, and black pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pan. Fry whole chicken over medium heat. Add about half of the seasoning mixture, and continue to fry until chicken just starts to change color. Place chicken in a baking dish large enough to hold it along with the seasoning mixture--both what was in the pan and what you didn't use. Rub the bird with the mixture for a minute or so. Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 1 hour, occasionally basting with the seasoning mixture. The chicken will look almost burnt when done. Moisten a plate with fig syrup, place chicken on it. Season with salt and pepper.
