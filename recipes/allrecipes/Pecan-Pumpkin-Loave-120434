In a mixing bowl, combine the first eight ingredients. Add pumpkin, eggs, oil, water and vanilla; mix well. Stir in pecans. Pour into three greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
