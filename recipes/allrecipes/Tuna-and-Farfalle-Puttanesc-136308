Bring saucepan of salted water to boil. Pour oil in large skillet; place over medium heat. Add garlic and onions; saute until onions are translucent, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, cook pasta until al dente, about 11 minutes. Add tomatoes, juice, capers, rosemary, and olives to onions; add salt and pepper to taste. Raise the heat to medium high, and cook until tomatoes are heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain pasta; transfer to large serving bowl. Add sauce, tuna, and parsley; toss gently to combine.
