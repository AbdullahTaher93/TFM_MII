Combine ketchup, soy sauce, sugar, strawberry jelly, horseradish, tomato paste, butter, oil, vinegar, salt, black pepper, and paprika together in a saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until marinade is smooth, about 5 minutes. Place pork chops in a bowl; add marinade. Marinate pork chops in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Remove pork chops from marinade, reserving the extra marinade. Light charcoals in the grill and add several bags of fall leaves throughout getting the coals ready for grilling. Place pork chops on the grill when the coals are about halfway ashed over. Baste pork chops with marinade and flip pork chops. Cover grill with lid so smoke from the leaves can permeate the pork chops. Cook until pork is slightly pink in the center, 20 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
