Mix chicken stock, fish sauce and sugar together. Cover and store in refrigerator. (Sauce can be made up to one month in advance). Have all ingredients ready. Cut chicken into 3/4-inch cubes. Rub with 1 tablespoon oil to coat meat and salt to taste; set aside. Soak dates and raisins in warm water for 10 minutes; drain. Boil fresh ginkgo nuts in water until tender; then peel off the outer skin or purchase already peeled. Heat a couple tablespoons of oil in pan or wok. Add walnuts and cashews; fry until golden brown. (If the walnuts taste bitter, make a new batch. You probably overcooked them). Set aside. Add 2 tablespoons oil to preheated wok. Heat to smoking. Add chicken cubes. Saute until lightly browned. Drain off any excess oil. Add dates, raisins and nuts. Stir in rice wine and 3 tablespoons stir-fry sauce. (You will have extra stir-fry sauce. Keep it for future use). Cook until heated through. Serve over steamed rice.
