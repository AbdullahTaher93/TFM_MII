Pour 1 can vegetable broth and water into a large pot. Place potatoes and cabbage into pot, and bring to a boil. Cook 10 minutes, or until potatoes are tender but firm. Place the beef in a skillet over medium heat, and cook until evenly brown. Drain grease and mix beef into the pot. Stir the onion, celery, green bell pepper, and garlic into the skillet. Cook until tender, then mix into the pot. Pour remaining broth and tomato-vegetable juice cocktail into the pot. Mix in tomatoes, frozen mixed vegetables, okra, lima beans, beef bouillon, Worcestershire sauce, celery seed, and bacon grease. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 2 hours.
