Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Stir fish sauce, chile paste, and garlic in the hot oil; cook and stir until the garlic softens, about 5 minutes. Add bell pepper, olives, capers, and oregano; continue cooking and stirring until the garlic browns, about 5 minutes more. Pour drained linguine into the sauce; toss to coat. Top with black pepper.
