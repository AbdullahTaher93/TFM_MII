Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 3-quart casserole dish. Stir chicken broth, rice, cream of chicken soup, and water together with a whisk in the prepared casserole dish until smooth; add Cheddar cheese, season with salt and pepper, and stir. Lie pork chops into the rice mixture in a single layer; season with more black pepper. Bake in preheated oven until rice in the middle of the dish is tender and pork chops are golden brown, about 80 minutes.
