Heat the oven to 450 degrees F. Heat the oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until well browned and cooked through, stirring occasionally. Add 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning and the garlic and cook and stir for 1 minute. Place the pizza crust onto a baking sheet. Spread the sauce on the crust to within 1/2-inch of the edge. Layer with the chicken mixture, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese and peppers. Sprinkle with the remaining Italian seasoning. Bake for 15 minutes or until the cheeses are melted. Sprinkle with the basil, if desired.
