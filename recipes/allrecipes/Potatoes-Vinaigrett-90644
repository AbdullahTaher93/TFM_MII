Scrub potatoes and place on a rack above 1 inch boiling water in a heavy 2- to 3-quart pan over medium high heat. Cover pan and cook, adding water once or twice if necessary to keep from boiling dry, until potatoes are tender when pierced (20 to 25 minutes). Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix mustard, salt, pepper, tarragon, garlic, and vinegar until blended. Beat in oil until mixture is well combined. Remove cooked potatoes from heat and let stand until cool enough to handle (5 to 10 minutes). Then remove peel, if desired, and cut potatoes into bite-size slices. In a large bowl, combine potatoes, parsley, onion, and dressing; mix lightly. Cover and let stand at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours or refrigerate up to 1 day.
