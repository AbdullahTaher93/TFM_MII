Whisk soy sauce, parsley, beer, poultry seasoning, achiote powder, ginger, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until marinade is well mixed; add chicken hearts. Cover bowl and marinate in the refrigerator for 4 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken hearts from marinade and discard marinade. Assemble chicken hearts on metal skewers. Cook on the grill, turning halfway through, until no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
