In a saucepan, saute the onion in the oil until it has lightly browned. Add the garlic, salt, pepper and turmeric. Add rice and broth, bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, cover and cook for 30 minutes. While the rice is cooking, peel and cut the eggplant into 1/4-inch slices. Sprinkle with salt and set aside for about 10 minutes. Rinse and pat dry. Lightly salt the eggplant and spray with oil. Brown both sides in a hot skillet, set aside. Once the rice is cooked, mix in yogurt and transfer mixture to a large shallow casserole dish. Spread the navy and garbanzo beans over the rice and then top with layer of eggplant and chopped tomatoes. Bake uncovered in a preheated 350 F oven for about 20 minutes.
