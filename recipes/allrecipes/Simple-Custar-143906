Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. In a medium sized bowl, whisk together the eggs and vanilla. Set aside. In a small saucepan over moderate heat, combine the LACTAID(R) Fat Free Milk and sugar. Bring just to a simmer. Slowly whisk the hot LACTAID(R) Fat Free Milk into the egg mixture. Strain the mixture into a 4-cup measure. Pour the mixture into 4 custard cups. Place the custard cups in a large baking dish. Pour enough hot water into the baking dish to reach halfway up the sides of the custard cups. Bake the custards 35-40 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Refrigerate until serving.
