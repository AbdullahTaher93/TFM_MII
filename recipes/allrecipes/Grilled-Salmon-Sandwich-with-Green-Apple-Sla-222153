Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Line the grate with perforated non-stick foil. Combine 57 sauce with butter, Worcestershire sauce and garlic. Brush half this mixture over salmon. Grill the salmon, basting with remaining sauce, for 4 to 5 minutes per side. Toss the apples, onion and dill with the lemon juice, oil, salt and pepper. Slice rolls in half and toast lightly on the grill. Place a leaf of lettuce on each halved roll, top with a piece of salmon and equal amounts of slaw.
