Bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Reduce heat; cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes. Transfer to an ungreased 2-qt. baking dish. Make six indentations. Sprinkle with pepper. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes or until eggs reach desired doneness. Sprinkle with cheese.
