Remove and discard the excess fat from the chicken parts, and rinse the chicken; transfer to a large stockpot. Add all remaining stock ingredients and 4 quarts of water. Cover, and bring to a boil. Skim stock of foam that rises as necessary. Reduce heat to medium. Simmer uncovered 2 hours; continue to skim as necessary. Pass through a fine sieve or cheesecloth-lined strainer into a large bowl. Discard solids. Skim the fat; season with salt. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the tortellini; cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain. Place a few tortellini in each soup bowl and top with the hot stock. Garnish with the chives, and serve hot.
