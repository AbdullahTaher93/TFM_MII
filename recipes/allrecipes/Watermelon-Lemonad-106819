Process watermelon cubes in a food processor, in batches if necessary, until smooth. Press mixture through a sieve into a pitcher; discard solids. (You should have about 3 cups watermelon juice.) Add the lemon juice and SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener or SPLENDA(R) Packets, stirring until SPLENDA(R) dissolves. Serve over ice.
