In a medium bowl, combine turkey, garlic, egg, breadcrumbs, 1/2 cup parsley, salt, and pepper, and mix well with your hands. Using a teaspoon, form 1-inch meatballs, and refrigerate until ready to use. In a large saucepan, heat 3 tablespoons of stock over medium heat. Add onion and saute until translucent, about 3 minutes. Raise heat to medium high, add carrots and remaining stock, and bring to a gentle boil. Add pasta; cook for 5 minutes. Lower heat to medium, add meatballs, and simmer gently until meatballs are cooked through, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in fennel and remaining parsley. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. Divide among four warmed bowls, and serve immediately.
