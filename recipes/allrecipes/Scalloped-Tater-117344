In a large bowl, combine the hash browns, soup, milk, cheese, 1/2 cup butter, onion, salt and pepper. Pour into a greased 5-qt. slow cooker. Cover and cook on low for 4-1/2 to 5 hours or until potatoes are tender. Just before serving, combine the cornflake crumbs and remaining butter in a pie plate. Bake at 350 degrees F for 4-6 minutes or until golden brown. Stir the potatoes; sprinkle with crumb topping.
