In a bowl, combine Alfredo sauce, milk and garlic powder; pour a fourth of the mixture into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Layer with a fourth of the potatoes; sprinkle with 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper. In a bowl, combine the turkey, broccoli and 1-1/2 cups Swiss cheese; spoon a third over potatoes. Repeat layers twice. Top with remaining potatoes. Cover with remaining Swiss and Parmesan cheeses. Spread with remaining Alfredo sauce mixture. Cover and bake at 400 degrees F for 45 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F. Bake, uncovered, 30 minutes longer or until potatoes are tender. Let stand for 15 minutes before serving.
