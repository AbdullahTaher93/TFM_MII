Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Brown ground beef, bacon, pork meat from hocks, and onions. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in sauerkraut and rice. Transfer contents to a casserole, and stir in chicken broth. Bake, uncovered, in a preheated oven until rice is cooked, about 30 to 45 minutes. Check liquid level periodically; add water if the casserole is drying out.
