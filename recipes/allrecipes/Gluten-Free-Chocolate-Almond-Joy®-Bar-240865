Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk coconut sugar, coconut milk, eggs, and almond extract together in a bowl. Combine almond flour, coconut flour, baking soda, and sea salt together in a separate bowl; beat into coconut milk mixture using an electric mixer on medium speed until batter is moist. Mix 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1/4 cup shredded coconut into batter. Pour batter into a 9-inch square baking dish. Top batter with remaining chocolate chips and shredded coconut. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 minutes.
