In a 12 inch skillet, heat olive oil and brown chicken on all sides. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Remove chicken and set aside. Add onion to skillet. Cook just until tender, but not brown. Stir in paprika. Return chicken to skillet, turning to coat with paprika/onion mixture. Add wine and broth. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover and simmer for 40 minutes or until chicken is fully cooked and tender. Remove chicken and keep warm. Boil skillet drippings until reduced to 1/2 cup liquid, about 3 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup sour cream. Heat through. Serve chicken atop pasta if desired, and pour sauce over all.
