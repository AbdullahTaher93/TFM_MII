POUR whole box of pasta into a large skillet (approximately 12 inches in diameter). POUR 3 cups of cold water into the pan, ensuring that the water covers the pasta. ADD mushrooms and turn the burner to high, then set your timer for 10 minutes (optional: add a bit of salt to taste). COOK on high, stirring occasionally, until almost all of the liquid has evaporated. When desired pasta texture is reached, REMOVE from heat and STIR in arugula and cheese. Serve immediately.
