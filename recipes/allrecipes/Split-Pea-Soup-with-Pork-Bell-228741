Cook and stir onion and pork belly in a large pot over medium heat until pork is browned and onion is translucent, 10 to 15 minutes. Add water, vegetable broth, white wine, split peas, thyme, celery seed, bay leaves, salt, and pepper; stir to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer until flavors have combined, about 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Remove bay leaves before serving.
