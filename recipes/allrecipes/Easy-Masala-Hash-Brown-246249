Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Combine oil, garam masala, and seasoned salt together in a large bowl. Add potato pieces and toss to coat. Spread on an ungreased baking sheet. Broil potatoes in the preheated oven until starting to brown, about 7 minutes. Remove from oven and flip potatoes over. Return to the oven and continue broiling until golden brown, about 5 minutes more.
