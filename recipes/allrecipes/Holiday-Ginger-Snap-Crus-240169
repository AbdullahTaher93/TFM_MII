Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix crushed gingersnap cookies, brown sugar, and butter together in a bowl until well-combined. Press gingersnap mixture into the bottom of a springform pan. Arrange whole gingersnap cookies upright around the border of the springform pan, pressing into the base so that they stand firmly. Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 7 minutes. Cool completely.
