Place chicken and water in a medium saucepan and simmer over medium low heat for about 15 minutes, until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside. When water is almost reduced, season chicken with salt and pepper to taste. In a small bowl, combine yogurt and curry powder and mix together. Stir this mixture into saucepan until all chicken pieces are coated, then simmer for another 5 minutes to heat through and marinate.
