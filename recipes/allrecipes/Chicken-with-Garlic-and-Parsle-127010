In a small saucepan, blanch the garlic cloves in boiling water for 1 minute. Drain and slice the garlic thinly. Toss them in a small bowl with the parsley and a little salt and pepper. Stuff a little of the garlic mixture into the pockets under the skin of the chicken breasts (about 2 teaspoons per chicken). Transfer the chicken to a plate, cover with plastic wrap and chill until ready to use. Heat a charcoal or gas grill until moderately hot. Grill the chicken 8 to 10 minutes per side until cooked through. Do not overcook. Heat the butter in a saute pan and gently saute the remaining garlic mixture. Add the lemon juice and chopped parsley, and season to taste with salt and pepper.
