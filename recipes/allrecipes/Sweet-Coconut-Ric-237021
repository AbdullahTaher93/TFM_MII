Stir rice, coconut milk, and water together in a saucepan. Dissolve sugar into the liquid. Bring the mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the saucepan, and simmer until the majority of the liquid has been absorbed by the rice, 15 to 20 minutes. Leaving saucepan on the burner, turn heat off and let rice steam until sticky, about 5 to 10 minutes more. Garnish with shredded coconut.
