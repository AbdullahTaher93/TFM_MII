In a large pot combine the chicken broth, potatoes, celery, carrots and onion. Mix together and bring to a boil over medium heat. Cook 15 to 20 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Add milk; reduce heat to medium low and let simmer. Add cheese slices; when cheese is melted, slowly stir in dry potato flakes until mixture is slightly thickened. Sprinkle bacon on top and serve hot.
