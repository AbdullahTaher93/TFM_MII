Start with cold water (straight from the tap is generally cold enough); this helps pull the juices out more efficiently as it is slowly heated. Place everything in a large stock pot over medium heat. Put the cover on but slightly to the side so that some steam can escape. Once it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to a very gentle boil for 3 hours or more (I try to get about 4 or 5 hours when I can). Stir occasionally breaking up the bones as you go. Add more water if the bones are not covered with liquid (unless it is just the last 15 minutes or so of cooking). Pour the liquids through a strainer into a large bowl. If you have more than 4 cups of liquids, it did not boil down enough. Taste to see if it needs salt or pepper. Ladle the stock into glass jars with tight fitting lids (I use mason jars, but old pickle or peanut butter jars work just as well). Do not use plastic containers. Be sure that there is at least 1/2 inch of fat on top of the liquid in each jar. The fat will keep the stock fresh for about 3-4 weeks in the refrigerator (or about 4 months if frozen).
