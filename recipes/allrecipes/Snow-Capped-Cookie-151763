Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine flour and pecans; set aside. Mix butter and sugar until well blended. Add water, vanilla and salt; mix well. Gradually add flour mixture, stirring until well blended after each addition. Shape into 1-inch balls; place on ungreased baking sheets. Bake 20 min. or until edges are golden brown. Cool on wire racks. Melt semi-sweet chocolate as directed on package. Dip each cookie halfway into melted chocolate, then press top lightly into grated white chocolate to create a snowy appearance. Let stand until set.
