In a medium saucepan, combine the ketchup, water, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, salt, paprika, chili powder and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Set aside half of the sauce. Preheat broiler. Brush both sides of the chops with sauce. Place chops on broiling pan rack. Broil about 4 inches from the heat for 4 minutes on each side. Brush with more sauce. Continue broiling, turning and basting every 3 to 4 minutes, until juices run clear. Serve with reserved sauce.
