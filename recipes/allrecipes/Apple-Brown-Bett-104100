Mix melted margarine with bread cubes. Combine the apples with sugar, cinnamon and salt. Place 1/3 of the bread cubes in the bottom of a greased 2-quart casserole. Cover with half the apples. Repeat, then top that layer with last third of bread cubes. Combine lemon juice and water and pour over all. Cover. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes. Uncover, bake 30 minutes more.
