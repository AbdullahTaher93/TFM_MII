Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8 inch round pan and line bottom with parchment paper. In a large bowl stir together flour, 1/2 cup SPLENDA(R), cocoa, instant coffee, baking soda and salt. Set aside. In a separate bowl, beat applesauce, yogurt, egg white and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Combine dry and wet ingredients, and beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes in pan, then turn out onto a wire rack. Gently peel off parchment paper. Cool completely. To make the Glaze: In a small saucepan combine milk, 2 tablespoons SPLENDA(R), 1 tablespoon margarine, corn syrup, and chocolate chips. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture boils. Continue to cook stirring constantly for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool 10 minutes. Stir in vanilla. Place cake on serving plate. Pour glaze evenly over cake, allowing some to run down sides. Refrigerate until glaze is firm, about 1 hour.
