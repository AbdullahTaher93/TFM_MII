Bring water, wine, and salt to a boil in a small frying pan over high heat. Add the salmon. Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer 10 to 15 minutes or until the salmon flakes and is no longer opaque inside. In a small bowl, microwave the preserves for 10 seconds or until melted. Stir in the pineapple and mustard, then top the salmon.
