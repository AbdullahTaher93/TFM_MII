In a bowl, combine corn syrup, brown sugar and egg; mix well. Combine dry ingredients; add to the egg mixture alternately with milk and mix well. Pour into a greased waxed paper-lined 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Bake at 325 degrees F for 80-90 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from the pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Wrap and let stand for 24 hours before slicing.
