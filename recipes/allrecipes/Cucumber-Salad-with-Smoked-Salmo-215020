In a large salad bowl, stir together the yogurt, sour cream, lemon juice, dill, capers, shallot, and white vinegar until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Lightly toss cucumbers and tomatoes in the dressing until coated, and very gently stir in the smoked salmon. Refrigerate until serving time.
