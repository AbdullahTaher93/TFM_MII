Coat a grill rack with nonstick spray. Place the rack over medium-hot coals. Cut the eggplant lengthwise into 1/8 inch (3 mm) slices. Mist each slice on both sides with the olive oil spray, and grill the slices until tender and browned, 5 to 6 minutes on each side. Finely chop the eggplant and place it in a large bowl. Stir in the tomatoes, peppers, olives, basil, tomato paste, vinegar, and garlic. Cover the bowl with wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.
