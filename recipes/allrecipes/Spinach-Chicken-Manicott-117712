In a small skillet, saute onion and garlic in oil until tender. In a large bowl, combine the onion mixture, chicken, spinach, ham, Parmesan cheese, egg whites, basil, pepper and nutmeg; set aside. Cook manicotti shells according to package directions. Meanwhile, for sauce, combine flour and broth in a large saucepan until smooth. Stir in the milk, salt, nutmeg, pepper and cayenne. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Spoon 1 cup into chicken mixture. Add Parmesan cheese to remaining sauce. Spread 1 cup sauce into a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Drain shells; stuff with chicken mixture. Arrange over sauce. Drizzle with remaining sauce. Cover and bake at 375 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until bubbly and heated through.
