Peel apples, core, and cut into quarters. In a 12-inch nonstick frying pan or a 5- to 6-quart nonstick pan over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add apples and cook, turning occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes total. Remove from pan. Turn heat to high. Add pork chops and lightly brown on each side, about 1 minute total. Meanwhile, mix together apple juice and ginger. Reduce heat to medium; to pan add apple juice mixture, apple slices, and dried apricots. Cover pan and simmer until pork chops are just barely pink in center (150 degrees F, cut to test), about 12 minutes. Meanwhile, with a sharp knife, cut and discard peels and white membranes from oranges. Over a bowl, cut between membranes and fruit to release orange segments into bowl. Squeeze juice from membranes into bowl. With a slotted spoon, transfer chops and apples to a rimmed platter; keep warm. Drain orange juice into pan and boil, uncovered, on high heat until sauce is reduced to 1/3 cup, 5 to 6 minutes. Pour mixture over meat. Garnish with orange segments. Add salt to taste.
