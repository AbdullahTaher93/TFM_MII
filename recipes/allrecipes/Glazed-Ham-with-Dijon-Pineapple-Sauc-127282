Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix sugar, syrup and mustard until well blended; set aside. Score ham with sharp knife; insert cloves into ham as desired. Arrange cherries, cut-sides down, on surface of ham. Place ham on rack in shallow baking pan. Bake 2 hours or until ham reaches internal temperature of 140 degrees F when tested in center with meat thermometer, brushing occasionally with 1/2 cup of the syrup mixture after 1-1/2 hours. Mix remaining syrup mixture with cornstarch and pineapple with its liquid in saucepan; cook on medium-high heat until mixture comes to boil and thickens, stirring constantly. Serve with the sliced ham.
