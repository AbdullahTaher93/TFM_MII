Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray cookie sheet with cooking spray. In medium bowl, mash beans with fork or pastry blender. Stir in egg, 3/4 cup of the bread crumbs and remaining bean cake ingredients. Shape mixture into 6 patties, 3 inches in diameter and 1/2 inch thick. Sprinkle both sides of bean patties with remaining 1/4 cup bread crumbs; place on cookie sheet. Bake 10 minutes. Turn bean cakes over; bake 10 to 13 minutes longer or until bread crumbs begin to turn golden brown. Meanwhile, in small bowl, mix all cilantro-lime sour cream ingredients; set aside. In large bowl, beat all salad ingredients except salad mix with wire whisk until well blended. Add salad mix; toss until coated. To serve, arrange salad evenly on individual plates. Top each with bean cake and dollop of cilantro-lime sour cream. Garnish with cilantro sprigs.
