Place the wrap onto a work surface. Spread the Pepperhouse Gourmaise onto the wrap, inching it close to the outer edges. Sprinkle the lettuce evenly over the top, followed by the turkey, overlapping the cold cuts if necessary to fit it all onto the wrap. Fold and wrap the sandwich. Slice the wrap evenly into 8 pieces and serve with additional Pepperhouse Gourmaise on the side.
