In a 9x13 inch dish, mix lemon flavored gelatin mix, lime flavored gelatin mix and boiling water. When the mixes are completely dissolved, pour in remaining water. Chill in the refrigerator 1 hour, or until the gelatin begins to set. Stir in the crushed pineapple, cottage cheese, horseradish, mayonnaise and pecans. Continue to chill 3 hours, or until completely gelled.
