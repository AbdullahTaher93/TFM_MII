Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups, or line with paper muffin liners. Combine the quinoa and water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. Chop the dried peaches and place them in a saucepan with the apple cider. Bring the liquid to a boil, remove the pan from the heat, and allow the mixture to sit for 10 minutes. Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Mix the milk, egg, and vanilla in a small bowl. Carefully add 2 cups of cooked quinoa to the flour mixture; stir in the warmed peaches and pecans and mix well. Stir in the milk mixture just until combined. Scoop the muffin batter into the prepared pan and bake until the tops spring back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted in a muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes.
