Combine chicken strips and fajita marinade in a large bowl. Let marinate in the refrigerator, 1 hour to overnight. Preheat Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven to High on the "Grill" setting. Combine oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Clean heads of romaine lettuce; cut in half from end to end. Brush halved romaine lettuce with oil-garlic mixture. Add sliced peppers and onions to the oil-garlic mixture. Toss to combine. Arrange the romaine cut-side down on the heated grill pan. Grill for 2 minutes. Remove and set aside to cool. Spread marinated chicken evenly in the hot grill pan; top with the peppers and onions. Cook for 5 minutes. Toss the chicken and vegetables and cook for 5 minutes more. Verify that the chicken is cooked to 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) by using an instant-read thermometer. Add more time if necessary. Slice grilled lettuce and place on serving plates. Divide chicken and vegetables evenly over the grilled romaine lettuce.
