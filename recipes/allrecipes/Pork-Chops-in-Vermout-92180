In a shallow pan, stir together flour, salt, cinnamon, and pepper. Coat chops lightly on both sides with flour mixture, patting to remove excess. Heat oil in a nonstick 12- to 14-inch frying pan over medium-high heat. Add floured chops to pan and cook, turning once, until well browned on both sides. Add onion around chops after you turn them. When chops are brown, sprinkle with cherries and pour in vermouth. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until chops are tender when pierced (about 25 minutes). Lift chops out onto a platter and keep warm. To mixture in pan, add vinegar, then increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring to loosen drippings, until liquid is thickened and syrupy, about 3 minutes. Spoon onion and cherry mixture over chops to serve.
