Slice the beef into 1x6 inch strips. Roll up one wedge of onion in a piece of bacon, then roll a slice of beef around the whole thing. Secure with a toothpick. Repeat with remaining beef, bacon and onion. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the meat rolls in the hot oil, just until browned on the outside. Transfer the rolls to a Dutch oven or slow cooker, and pour in just enough water to cover. Tie the pickling spice in a square of cheesecloth, and place in the water. Bring to a boil, then simmer over low heat for 1 hour. In a small jar with a tight fitting lid, combine the cornstarch and water. Shake until no lumps remain. Remove the spice bag from the simmering broth, and discard. Stir in the cornstarch slurry. Cover, and simmer for 2 more hours. To serve, spoon the Mock Duck onto a plate, and remove the toothpicks. Spoon the gravy over. Happy Eating!
