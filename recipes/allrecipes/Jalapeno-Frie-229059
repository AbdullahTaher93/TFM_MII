Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan over medium heat. Mix flour, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a shallow bowl. Beat eggs in a separate bowl. Dip jalapeno slices in beaten eggs, then coat generously with flour mixture. Fry coated jalapeno slices in the hot oil, working in batches, until peppers are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
