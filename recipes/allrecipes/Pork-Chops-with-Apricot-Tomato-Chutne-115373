Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Sprinkle pork chops with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the pork chops and cook until browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to an 8-inch-square glass baking dish. Add tomatoes, apricots, lemon juice and crushed red pepper to the skillet and increase heat to medium-high. Bring to a boil and cook, scraping up any browned bits, until the sauce thickens into chutney, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour the chutney over the pork chops. Bake the pork chops until just cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Divide the chops and chutney among 4 plates and sprinkle with thyme.
