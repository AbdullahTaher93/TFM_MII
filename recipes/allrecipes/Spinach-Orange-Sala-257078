Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Crumble into small pieces. Separate oranges into individual wedges. Cut each wedge into thirds. Combine bacon, oranges, spinach, red onion, and pine nuts in a large bowl; toss lightly. Whisk oil, orange juice, vinegar, and salt together in a small bowl to make dressing. Drizzle some dressing over the spinach mixture; toss to coat. Serve remaining dressing on the side.
