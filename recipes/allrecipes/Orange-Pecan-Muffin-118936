In a bowl, combine biscuit mix and sugar. In a small bowl, beat the egg, orange juice and oil; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in pecans and marmalade. Coat muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray or use paper liners; fill two-thirds full with batter. Combine the topping ingredients; sprinkle over batter. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool 5 minutes; remove to a wire rack.
