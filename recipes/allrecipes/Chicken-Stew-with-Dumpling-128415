To make the stew: Pat the chicken dry. Sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon (.5 ml) of the salt. Coat lightly on all sides with nonstick spray. Place the chicken in a Dutch oven set over medium-high heat. Cook, turning occasionally, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until lightly golden on all sides. Remove to a plate. Set aside. Coat the bottom of the pot with nonstick spray. Add the onions, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, over medium-high heat for 5 minutes, or until the onions start to soften. Add the broth, bay leaf, thyme, the remaining 1/8 teaspoon (.5 ml) salt, and the reserved chicken. Increase the heat to high. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer for 10 minutes. In a small bowl, combine the sour cream and flour. Whisk until smooth. Add to the chicken mixture. Stir until thickened. To make the dumplings: In a medium bowl, combine the flour and baking powder. Add the buttermilk and egg white. Stir until just mixed. The batter will be slightly lumpy. Evenly divide the batter into dollops and drop onto the chicken mixture. Cover the pot and cook at a gentle simmer over medium-low heat for 25 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted in the thickest portion of the chicken registers 170 degrees F (75 degrees C) and the juices run clear. Remove and discard the bay leaf before serving.
