Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Place chicken pieces, top sides down, on work surface; top with prosciutto and cheese. Roll up tightly, starting at one short end of each; spread with mustard. Place flour in shallow dish; whisk eggs in pie plate. Mix remaining ingredients in separate pie plate. Dip chicken in flour, then egg, then crumb mixture, turning to evenly coat each roll-up. Gently press crumb mixture into chicken. Place, seam sides down, on parchment-covered baking sheet. Bake 25 to 30 min. or until chicken is done (170 degrees F).
