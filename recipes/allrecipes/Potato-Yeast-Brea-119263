In a saucepan, cook potato in water until tender. Drain, reserving 3/4 cup water; cool to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Mash potato; measure 1/2 cup (discard any remaining potato). Add milk and 1 tablespoon butter to mashed potato (mixture will be soft). In a mixing bowl, combine 3 cups flour, sugar, yeast, salt, lemon peel and nutmeg. Melt remaining butter; cool to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add the cooled potato water and melted butter to flour mixture; beat until moistened. Add eggs and mashed potato mixture; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a firm dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down; turn onto a lightly floured surface. Shape into two loaves. Place in two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 325 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
