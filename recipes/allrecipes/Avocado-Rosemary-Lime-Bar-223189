Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix flour, 1/2 cup sugar, rosemary, and lime zest together in a bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture with a pastry cutter until clumps are small. Set aside 1 cup of the flour mixture for later use; press remaining flour mixture in an even layer into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until the crust sets, about 10 minutes. Mix 1/2 cup of the reserved flour mixture with 1 1/2 cup sugar, lime juice, eggs, and mashed avocado in a bowl until mostly smooth; spread over the baked crust. Top with the remaining 1/2 cup of the reserved flour mixture. Bake in oven until set, about 25 minutes more. Cool completely before cutting into 48 bars. Cover with plastic and refrigerate.
