Shrimp should be fresh cooked and plunged into cold water then shelled and deveined. Or thaw frozen cooked shrimp. Trim off and discard the stem end of the pea pods. If they are large, cut in half with a diagonal cut. Boil 1 or 2 quarts of water. Add the snow peas for 2 minutes (no longer, but 1 minute is okay). Immediately drain and plunge into a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Leave in there for a full minute. Drain. Remove and discard the stem, seeds and membrane from the red pepper. Slice into matchsticks. Trim the scallions and slice thinly on the diagonal. In a large non-metallic bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar, soy sauce, ginger, Splenda and Tabasco sauce. Add to the bowl the shrimp, pea pods, red peppers and scallions. Toss well. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Before serving, toss in the toasted sesame seeds.
