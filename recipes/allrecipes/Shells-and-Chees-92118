In a 6- to 8-quart pan over high heat, bring 4 to 6 quarts water to a boil. While water heats, place croutons in a heavy plastic food bag. Close bag and crush croutons with a rolling pin or your hands until coarse crumbs form. Set crumbs aside. Rinse kale; cut out and discard stems and tough centers of leaves. When water boils, add kale leaves and cook, stirring occasionally, until bright green and tender to bite, about 5 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer kale to a colander to drain. Add pasta to water and cook, stirring occasionally, until barely tender to bite, about 10 minutes. While pasta cooks, coarsely chop kale. In a 12-inch frying pan over high heat, heat garlic and chili flakes with olive oil just until fragrant but not brown, about 1 minute. Add lemon juice and kale and stir until liquid is evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes. When pasta is done, drain it well, then return it to the 6- to 8-quart pan. Add kale mixture, ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup broth, and 1/4 cup parmesan and mix well; if mixture seems dry, add a bit more broth. Divide mixture equally among 4 bowls and sprinkle equally with crouton crumbs. Add salt, pepper, and additional parmesan to taste.
