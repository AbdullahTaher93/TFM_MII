Toast bread slices; remove crusts and cut each slice into 4 squares. Spread peanut butter over 12 toast squares. Spread chocolate-hazelnut spread over the remaining 12 toast squares. Arrange squares in a grid pattern on a serving plate, alternating chocolate-hazelnut spread and peanut butter topped slices.
