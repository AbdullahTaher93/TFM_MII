In a saucepan, cover the sweet potatoes with water and boil over high heat until just tender, about 12 minutes. Drain the potatoes and let cool. Peel and slice them crosswise 1 inch thick. In a medium skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add half of the sweet potato slices and cook over moderately high heat until well browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the sweet potatoes to a plate and season with salt and pepper. Repeat with the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil and sweet potatoes. Add the onion to the skillet, cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until softened and browned, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, scatter over the sweet potatoes and serve.
