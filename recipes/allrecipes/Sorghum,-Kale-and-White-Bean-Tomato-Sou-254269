Bring 3 cups of broth to a boil, add 1/2 cup of sorghum and allow to boil gently for approximately 20-25 minutes (liquid will remain, that's fine). Meanwhile, heat a large saucepan with lid over medium to medium/high heat. Add olive oil and saute garlic, onion, salt and pepper until the onion softens (approximately 6-8 minutes). Add kale and sriracha, cook until wilted (about 4 minutes). Take 1/2 cup of white beans and either blend in a blender/small food processor or mash well with the back of a spoon or fork. Add blended beans, remaining whole beans, canned tomatoes, sorghum/broth mixture and additional 4 cups low sodium chicken broth to kale mixture. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce heat to simmer for approximately 20 minutes. Top with grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese (approximately 1 teaspoon per bowl) and serve.
