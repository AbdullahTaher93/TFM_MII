Beat in eggs until smooth. Gradually beat in flour mixture and mix just until fully incorporated. Fold in nuts. Chill dough for 30 minutes. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls onto cookie sheet. Bake 7-8 minutes (cookie will be soft and just barely done). Cool on cookie sheet for 1 minute then remove to wire cooling rack. Immediately top each cookie with chopped caramels by slightly pushing caramel pieces into the top of each cookie.
