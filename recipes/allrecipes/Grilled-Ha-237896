Preheat grill to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix brown sugar and mustard together in a bowl until a paste forms. Place ham on a large piece of aluminum foil. Spread brown sugar paste over entire ham. Wrap foil securely around ham, sealing all of the edges together. Place wrapped ham in a disposable pan. Grill ham on the preheated grill until heated through, about 2 1/2 hours. Remove ham from grill and let rest 30 minutes before slicing.
