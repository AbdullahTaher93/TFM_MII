In a large saucepan, combine sugar, corn syrup and water; bring to a boil, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved. Cook, without stirring, over medium heat until a candy thermometer reads 300 degrees F (hard-crack stage). Remove from the heat; stir in butter, vanilla and baking soda. Add cashews. Pour into a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Cool; break into pieces.
