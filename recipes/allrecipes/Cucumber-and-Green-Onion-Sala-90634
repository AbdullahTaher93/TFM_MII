In a bowl, lightly crush cucumbers and salt with your hands. Let stand 20 minutes. In a colander, squeeze cucumbers gently and let drain. Rinse with cool water, squeeze gently, and drain again. If prepared ahead, cover and chill up to a day. In a bowl, mix cucumbers with sliced onion, sugar, and vinegar. Serve in the bowl, or transfer with a slotted spoon to a platter. Serve refrigerated or at room temperature. Season with salt to taste.
