Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the honey and eggs. In a separate bowl, sift together the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, soda and salt. Add the flour mixture to the butter and egg mixture; mix until combined. Fold in the apple, cheese and walnuts. Spoon batter into prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Turn the loaf out onto a wire rack and let cool completely.
