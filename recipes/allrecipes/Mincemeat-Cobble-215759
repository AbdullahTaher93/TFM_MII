Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. In a bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg together until thoroughly combined. Mix in the melted butter and milk, and beat to a smooth batter. Spread the mincemeat out into the prepared baking dish, and pour the batter on top. Bake in the preheated oven until the cobbler is golden brown and bubbling, about 1 hour.
