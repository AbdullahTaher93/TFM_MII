Cut bread in half lengthwise. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the butter, onion and chili powder. Cover and microwave on high for 2-3 minutes or until the onion is tender, stirring once. Spread over cut side of bottom of bread. Sprinkle with cheeses. Replace bread top; wrap in heavy-duty foil. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35 minutes or until the cheese is melted. Slice and serve warm.
