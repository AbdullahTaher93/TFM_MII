Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat an 8 x 8-inch (2-L) baking dish with nonstick spray. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and 1/4 teaspoon of the cinnamon. In a large bowl, combine the sour cream, 2/3 cup (150 mL) of the sugar, the egg substitute, oil, and vanilla. Stir vigorously until well blended. Stir in the flour mixture until thoroughly combined. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. In a small cup, whisk the remaining 4 teaspoons (20 mL) of sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. Sprinkle the mixture evenly over the batter. Bake on the center oven rack until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 10 to 15 minutes. Cut into pieces and serve warm or at room temperature.
