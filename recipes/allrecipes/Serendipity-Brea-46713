Place the first set of ingredients into the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select DOUGH cycle; press START. Do not put in the olive oil, garlic powder or feta cheese. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. When the cycle has ended, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and divide into 2 halves. Roll each half out into a circle that is about 9 or 10 inches across. Brush the top of each circle with olive oil. Place the bread circles oil side down onto the grill. Brush the other side with olive oil, and watch carefully. When the bottom side is browned, turn over the bread, and grill the other side until golden. If desired, sprinkle with garlic powder and feta cheese.
