Stir boiling water into dry gelatin mix in medium bowl at least 2 min. until completely dissolved. Add whipped topping to hot gelatin; stir with wire whisk until whipped topping is completely melted and mixture is well blended. (Mixture will be thin.) Pour into 10 glasses, or a 6-cup mold, or a glass bowl sprayed with cooking spray. Refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. If using a large mold, unmold onto serving plate just before serving. Store leftover dessert in refrigerator.
