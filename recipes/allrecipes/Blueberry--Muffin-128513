Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin pan. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon. In a large bowl, stir together the milk, oil, egg, sugar, and vanilla extract until well-blended. Stir in the flour mixture until just combined. Do not overmix. Gently fold in the blueberries. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups, filling them about two-thirds full. Bake for 17 to 20 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Cool on a rack for 5 minutes. Remove to the rack to cool completely.
