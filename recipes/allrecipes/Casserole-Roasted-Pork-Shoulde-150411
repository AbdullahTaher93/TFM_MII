In a medium enameled cast-iron casserole, melt the butter in the oil. Add the pork butt and onion and brown well on all sides over moderate heat, about 20 minutes total. Tie the parsley stems, thyme and bay leaf in a bundle. Discard the fat in the casserole. Add the bundle to the casserole along with the water and tomato and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Season with salt and pepper, cover and cook over low heat, turning the meat every 20 minutes, until it is tender, about 2 hours. Transfer the meat to a cutting board, cover loosely with foil and let stand for 10 minutes. Strain the pan juices into a small saucepan and skim off the fat. Boil over high heat, stirring, until the juices are reduced to 1 1/4 cups, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Carve the meat into thin slices and serve with the pan juices.
