Place potatoes and chopped onion in a deep stock pan, and add water just to cover them. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender. Add butter or margarine, bacon bits and fat, and carrots. Stir in milk, parsley, and instant potatoes; bring to a light boil. Salt and pepper to taste. Cover, and simmer on low until you are ready to eat.
