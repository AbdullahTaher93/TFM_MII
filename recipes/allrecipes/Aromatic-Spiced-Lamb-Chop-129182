Heat the broiler to high. Place the lamb chops in a shallow dish. Grind the cumin and coriander seeds briefly with a mortar and pestle to crack them, then mix with the lemon juice, garlic, and oil; season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour the mixture over the lamb chops and turn them over to coat both sides; set aside to marinate while you make the sauce. Cut the cucumber in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds with a teaspoon. Grate the cucumber coarsely and drain off any excess water. Mix with the yogurt, garlic, mint sauce, and fresh mint; set aside. Place the lamb chops on the rack in the broiler pan and broil, turning once, 10 to 12 minutes. The chops will be medium-rare; if you prefer them medium to well done, broil 12 to 14 minutes. Meanwhile, put the couscous and apricots in a large heatproof bowl and pour the boiling stock over. Stir well, then cover with a plate and set aside to soak 5 minutes. Stir the almonds, chopped mint and cilantro, lemon juice, and oil into the couscous. Spoon the couscous onto plates, top each serving with 2 lamb chops, and put a spoonful of the sauce on the side. Garnish with sprigs of fresh mint and serve immediately.
