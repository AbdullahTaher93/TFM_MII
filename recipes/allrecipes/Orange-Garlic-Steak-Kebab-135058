Seal orange juice, wine, garlic, steak sauce, and pepper in a large zip-top plastic bag; shake to blend. Add steak and vegetables; seal. Marinate in refrigerator for 15 minutes, shaking once. Meanwhile, soak four 8-inch wooden skewers in water. Thread steak and vegetables onto skewers. Place kebabs on a grill rack coated with cooking spray, and grill about 5 minutes on each side.
