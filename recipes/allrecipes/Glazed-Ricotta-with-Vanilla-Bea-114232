Preheat the broiler. In a small saucepan, warm the maple syrup with the vanilla bean scrapings; let cool slightly. In a bowl, mix the ricotta with the syrup. Whisk in the egg yolks until blended. Spread the ricotta in 4 shallow 5-inch gratin dishes and broil 6 inches from the heat, rotating the dishes as necessary to glaze the ricotta evenly. Serve with fresh fruit.
