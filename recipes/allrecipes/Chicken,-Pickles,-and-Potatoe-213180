Place the flour in a shallow dish and season lightly with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper, and dredge in the flour. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.Cook the chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 3 minutes. Flip chicken and brown on the other side, 3 additional minutes. Pour in the chicken broth. Stir in the potatoes, pickles, carrots, black olives with juice, and pickle juice. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook until the potatoes are tender and the chicken thighs are no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
