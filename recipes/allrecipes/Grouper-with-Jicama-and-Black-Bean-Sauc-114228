MAKE THE SAUCE: In a food processor, combine the black beans, cilantro, olive oil and lime juice and process until pureed. Scrape the puree into a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper and remove from the heat. PREPARE THE FISH: In a large skillet, combine the olive oil with the wine, scallions, jicama, tomato and poblano and season with salt and pepper. Boil for 1 minute. Season the grouper fillets with salt and pepper and arrange them in the skillet, skinned side down. Cover and simmer over moderate heat until the fish is just cooked, 5 to 6 minutes. Reheat the black bean sauce. Transfer the grouper to a platter. Strain the cooking liquid into the sauce, reserving the vegetables. Spoon the sauce onto plates and top with the grouper and reserved vegetables. Garnish with the cilantro and serve.
