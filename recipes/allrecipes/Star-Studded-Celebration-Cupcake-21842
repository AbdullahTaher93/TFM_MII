To make Chocolate Cutouts: Melt chocolate over low heat, stirring frequently. Place waxed paper on cookie sheet. Spread melted chocolate in 8-inch square on waxed paper. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Before cutting, remove chocolate from refrigerator and let stand until room temperature. Cut with star-shaped cookie cutters of various sizes. Refrigerate until ready to place on cupcakes. If desired, dip half of each cutout into melted white chocolate; refrigerate until set. Carefully peel cutouts off waxed paper, handling as little as possible. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 36 medium muffin cups, 2 1/2x1 1/4 inches, with paper baking cups. Beat remaining ingredients except frosting in large bowl with electric mixer on low speed 30 seconds, scraping bowl constantly. Beat on high speed 3 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Pour batter into muffin cups, filling each half 1/2 full. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Remove from pan to wire rack. Cool completely, about 30 minutes. Spread with frosting. Garnish with Chocolate Cutouts.
