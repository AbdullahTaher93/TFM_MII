In a large microwave-safe bowl, heat the chips and butter on high for 1-1/2 to 2 minutes or until chips are melted, stirring every 30 seconds until smooth. Add the cracker crumbs; set aside 2/3 cup. Press the remaining crumb mixture into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. In a small mixing bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth. Add the milk, egg and vanilla; mix well. Stir in pecans. Pour over the crust. Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture. Bake at 325 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. Store in the refrigerator.
