Slice jackfruit into long triangles. Squeeze out excess moisture over a colander. Mix lemon juice, nutritional yeast, vegetable oil, garlic, sesame oil, 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon salt, cumin, paprika, allspice, turmeric, cinnamon, pepper, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Add jackfruit; mix and knead thoroughly to coat with lemon juice mixture. Melt vegan margarine in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook jackfruit in batches until heated through, about 5 minutes.
