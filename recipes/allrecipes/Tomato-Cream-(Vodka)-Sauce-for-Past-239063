Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic in hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute; add vodka, bring to a simmer, and cook until mostly evaporated, about 10 minutes. Stir tomatoes, basil, sugar, oregano, salt, and pepper with the garlic and vodka in the saucepan; bring to a boil and cook until most of the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Stir milk and butter together in a bowl until smooth; pour into tomato sauce and stir until the color is even. Place saucepan over medium-low heat, bring sauce to a simmer, and cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.
