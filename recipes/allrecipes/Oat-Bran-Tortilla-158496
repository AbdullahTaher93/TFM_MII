In a large bowl, stir together the flour, oat bran, baking powder and salt. Gradually stir in boiling water. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes, then cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Divide the dough into 32 golf ball sized portions, and roll each one into a ball. Flatten each ball using a rolling pin or tortilla press to about 4 inches in diameter and stack them up to keep from drying out. Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat until hot. Roll out one tortilla at a time until paper thin or as large as your skillet. Cook over medium heat until bubbles form on the top. Turn over and cook on the other side until starting to brown. Stack cooked tortillas while making the others, taking care not to over cook, or you will end up with crackers.
