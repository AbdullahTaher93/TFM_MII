Combine the lemon juice, vinegar, salt, and pepper in a salad bowl. Add the olive oil slowly while whisking with a fork. Add more vinegar, salt, pepper, or oil to taste. The dressing can be made several hours in advance. When ready to serve, combine the spinach and radishes and toss with the dressing to coat.
