Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Toss sweet potatoes, 1/2 cup honey, and olive oil together in a bowl until potatoes are completely coated. Spread potatoes out on a baking sheet and drizzle any remaining olive oil mixture over the top. Bake in the preheated oven until tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet, 5 to 10 minutes; dust potatoes with cinnamon. Transfer sweet potatoes to plates and drizzle with remaining honey.
