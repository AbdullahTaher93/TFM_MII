Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Season chicken pieces with salt and pepper. Heat a non-stick skillet or spray a skillet with non-stick cooking spray over medium-high heat; cook chicken until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate to cool enough to handle. Wrap each chicken piece with a tortilla strip, starting at 1 end and overlapping tortillas when starting a new strip and leaving a gap at the top for the 'face'. Place 'mummies' on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until until tortillas are crisp and chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Cool mummies for about 5 minutes; place 2 olive slices on each 'mummy' for the 'eyes.'
