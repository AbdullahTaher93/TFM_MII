Process brown sugar, bourbon, soy sauce, and garlic in a food processor or blender to mince garlic with other ingredients. Pour over ribs, and marinate for several hours in the refrigerator. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil grate. Place ribs on grate, and cover. Cook for 45 minutes to 1 hour depending on thickness of your ribs. When finished, the internal temperature of the ribs should be 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) when taken with a meat thermometer.
