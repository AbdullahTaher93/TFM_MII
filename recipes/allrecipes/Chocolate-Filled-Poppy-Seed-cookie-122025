In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in egg yolks and vanilla. Combine flour, poppy seeds and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Roll into 1-in. balls. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Using the end of a wooden spoon handle, make an indentation in the center of each. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Immediately make an indentation in the center again. Remove to wire racks to cool slightly; fill with melted chocolate.
