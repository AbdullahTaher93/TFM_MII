Bring a pot of water to boil. Meanwhile, in a skillet, saute the shallot in olive oil over medium heat until translucent - about 2 minutes. Turn the heat to high and add the asparagus and tomatoes. Saute for 2 minutes, then season with salt/pepper. Cook the pasta according to package directions, then drain and toss with veggies. Stir in the cheese and basil. Enjoy!
