Grind the nuts, raisins, currants and citron. Boil the molasses and the sugar. Let cool then add the ground mixture, the eggs, salt, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, anise oil, sour milk and baking soda. Add enough flour to stiffen dough. Refrigerate dough for several days. When ready to bake preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dough may be rolled out to 1/4 inch thick and cut with cookie cutters or you can shape dough into logs and slice. Place cookies on greased cookie sheets and bake for 10 to 12 minutes.
