Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Generously spray 8 jumbo muffin cups or 8 (6-oz) custard cups with CRISCO Original No-Stick Cooking Spray. In small bowl, beat powdered sugar, cream cheese, coffee and vanilla with electric mixer on medium speed about 1 minute or until smooth and creamy. Separate dough into 8 biscuits. Press or roll each biscuit into 5-inch round. Brush one side of each round with melted butter. Sprinkle with granulated sugar; press sugar into dough. Press rounds, sugared sides down, evenly in bottom and up sides of muffin cups. Spread about 1 tablespoon cream cheese mixture evenly over dough in bottom of each cup. Drizzle each with 1 tablespoon caramel topping; reserve remaining caramel topping. Top with remaining cream cheese mixture; sprinkle with peanuts. (If using custard cups, place on large cookie sheets with sides.) Bake 18 to 24 minutes or until edges of biscuit cups are deep golden brown. Cool 5 minutes. Remove from pan; cool 15 minutes. Meanwhile, pour remaining caramel topping into small bowl; stir in liqueur. Drizzle over warm biscuit cups. Serve topped with whipped topping. Store covered in refrigerator.
