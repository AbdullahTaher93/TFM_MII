Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry chicken, turning often, in the hot oil until all sides are browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove chicken from skillet. Add onions to skillet; cook and stir over medium heat until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir flour into onion mixture until blended and dissolved. Add wine, stirring constantly until evenly mixed. Mix carrots, mushrooms, chicken stock, bacon, parsley, tomato paste, thyme, orange peel, bay leaf, salt, and pepper into onion mixture; return chicken. Bring liquid to a boil. Transfer mixture to a baking dish; cover. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
