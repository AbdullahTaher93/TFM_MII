In a bowl, mix the sugar, flour, salt, pepper, and mustard. Stir in the water, soy sauce, and vinegar. Place the ribs in a pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, cook 10 minutes, and drain. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and brown the ribs on all sides. Mix in the sauce mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer 30 minutes. Mix in the garlic, and continue cooking 15 minutes, or to desired doneness.
