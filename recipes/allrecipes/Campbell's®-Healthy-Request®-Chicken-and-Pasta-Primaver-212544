Heat the soup, milk, cheese, garlic powder and vegetables in a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the vegetables are tender-crisp. Stir the chicken in the saucepan and cook until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Serve the chicken mixture over the spaghetti.
