Place the almonds and 1 tablespoon of sugar in a small skillet over medium-low heat, and cook and stir until the sugar melts and the almonds brown, watching carefully to avoid burning. Remove from heat and allow to cool. In a large salad bowl, mix the lettuce, green onions, apple, avocado, dried cranberries, blue cheese, and cooked almonds. Whisk together the vinegar, 2 teaspoons of sugar, and salt and pepper in a bowl, and stir in the vegetable oil. Pour the dressing over the salad, and gently toss to combine.
