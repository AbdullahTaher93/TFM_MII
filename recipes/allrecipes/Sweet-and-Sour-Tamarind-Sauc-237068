Heat water in a saucepan over low heat. Dissolve sugar and tamarind powder in warm water; add soy sauce, peanuts, and red onions. Increase heat to medium-high and cook until onions become slightly translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir cilantro into the sauce; continue cooking until thickened to your liking, 5 to 7 minutes more.
