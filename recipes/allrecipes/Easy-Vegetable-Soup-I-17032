In a large pot over high heat, boil the stew meat in enough water to cover the meat completely for 30 minutes, skimming the froth as necessary. Place the potatoes, carrots and onions into the pot, adding water if necessary. Boil for 30 minutes Drain the water but leave enough to cover the meat and vegetables in the pot. Then add the corn, peas, green beans, lima beans, butter beans and tomatoes. Reduce heat to low and let simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
