Melt butter in a heavy saucepan over low heat; stir in brown sugar, pecans, and nutmeg. Stir constantly and bring topping to a boil; allow to simmer until topping thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. To use as pie topping, spoon topping onto pie and broil until topping bubbles; watch carefully to avoid burning. Let pie cool before serving. To use as ice cream topping, just spoon warm or cooled topping over ice cream and serve.
