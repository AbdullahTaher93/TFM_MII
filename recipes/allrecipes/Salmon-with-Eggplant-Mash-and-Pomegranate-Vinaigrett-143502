Whisk marinade ingredients together. Pour over salmon in shallow baking dish and refrigerate for 4 hours. Char eggplants in skillet for 30 minutes until soft (outsides should be burned). Set aside to cool. Remove salmon and dry with paper towel. Spritz preheated grill with nonstick spray and grill salmon until medium, 4 minutes per side. Meanwhile, scoop out eggplant pulp, chop, and saute in stock with onion and lemon juice until chunky mash forms. Whisk vinaigrette ingredients together. Place salmon on mash, then top with vinaigrette.
