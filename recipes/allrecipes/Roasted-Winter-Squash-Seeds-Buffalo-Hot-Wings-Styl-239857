Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Stir seeds, butter, and cayenne pepper sauce together in a bowl to coat the seeds completely; spread onto prepared baking sheet. Roast seeds to desired crispness, 30 to 45 minutes; cool completely on baking sheet before serving.
