In a large frying pan, heat the oil over moderately high heat. Add the summer squash, minced garlic, salt, and the oregano and cook, stirring, until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the ricotta cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, salami, and the pepper. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the macaroni until just done, about 8 minutes. Drain and toss the pasta with the sauce. Top with the Parmesan.
