Butter bottom only of a 9- by 13-inch pan. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F if using a glass pan). In a large bowl, combine brownie mix, chili powder, and cinnamon. Add egg, 1/2 cup water, and oil, stirring just until combined. Spread batter in pan (it will be fairly thin). Bake until brownies begin to pull away from sides of pan, 28 to 30 minutes. Cool on a rack, then cut into 16 squares.
