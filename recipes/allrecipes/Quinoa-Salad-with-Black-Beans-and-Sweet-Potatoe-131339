Place quinoa in a small-mesh sieve and rinse thoroughly. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a medium skillet with a tight-fitting lid. Add sweet potato, scallion, and chile and saute until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add quinoa; toast for 2 minutes. Add water and salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium low, and cover. Simmer until quinoa and sweet potato are tender, about 10 to 12 minutes. If liquid remains unabsorbed in the pan, raise heat to high and cook for 2 minutes until it boils off. Stir in black beans and lime juice. Serve warm or chilled, sprinkled with cilantro.
