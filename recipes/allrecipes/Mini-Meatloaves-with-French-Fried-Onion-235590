Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spray 12 (2 1/2-inch) muffin-pan cups with the cooking spray. Thoroughly mix 3/4 cup soup, the beef, 1/2 can onions, bread crumbs, egg and Worcestershire in a large bowl. Press about 1/2 cup beef mixture into each muffin-pan cup. Spread the remaining soup over the meatloaves. Bake for 25 minutes or until the meatloaves are cooked through. Sprinkle with the remaining onions. Bake for 3 minutes or until the onions are golden brown. Let the meatloaves cool in the pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes.
