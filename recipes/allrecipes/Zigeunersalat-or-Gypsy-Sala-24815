Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and cut into quarters. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and dice. In a medium bowl, toss together the potatoes, peas, salami, cheese, gherkins and French dressing until evenly coated. Line a large, shallow bowl with salad greens and top with the salad mixture. Garnish with the hard boiled eggs and anchovies.
