Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray baking sheet with cooking spray or lightly grease with olive oil. Crumble crackers into a large bowl. Stir in onion powder, black pepper, garlic powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, stir together eggs and lime juice. Dip eggplant slices into egg mixture, then dredge in cracker mix, and place on baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Turn eggplant pieces, top with grated cheese, and cook an additional 15 minutes.
