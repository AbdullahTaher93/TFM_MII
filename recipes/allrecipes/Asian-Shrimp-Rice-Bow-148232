Whisk soy sauce, hoisin sauce, honey, chili paste, and orange marmalade together in a small bowl. Stir shrimp into the marinade; refrigerate for one hour. Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Heat oil in a large skillet or wok. Cook the orange pepper, red pepper, sugar snap peas, and onion in hot oil until they just begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Toss the marinated shrimp, garlic, ginger, and sesame oil into the vegetables; continue to cook until shrimp is heated through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Serve over hot jasmine rice, sprinkled with sesame seeds.
