Mix soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and chile oil together in a bowl until soy-ginger sauce is smooth. Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet or wok over medium heat; add squid. Cook and stir squid, adding soy-ginger sauce, until sauce is reduced and thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and stir in butter until well integrated. Squeeze lemon halves over squid to serve.
