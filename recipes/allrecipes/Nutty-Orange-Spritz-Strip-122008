In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in egg and orange peel. Combine flour, baking powder and salt; add to the creamed mixture alternately with orange juice. Using a cookie press fitted with a bar disk, form dough into long strips on ungreased baking sheets. Cut each strip into 3-in. pieces (there is no need to separate the pieces). Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until edges are golden. Cut into pieces again if necessary. Remove to wire racks to cool. Melt chocolate and shortening in microwave or double boiler; stir until smooth. Dip each end of cookies in chocolate mixture, then in walnuts. Place on waxed paper; let stand until hardened.
