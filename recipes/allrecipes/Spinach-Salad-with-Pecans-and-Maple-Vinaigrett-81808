Toss together the spinach and arugula and divide between two plates. Sprinkle on top the slivered onion and peppers. Then add the pecan halves (best to leave them whole). I prefer raw pecan but roasted is good too (as long as they are not too salty). In a small jar, add the walnut oil, vinegar and maple flavoring. Shake well and taste. The sweetness of the vinegar is generally enough to balance the maple flavoring. But some brands are more bitter than others. Add a touch of Splenda if needed. Drizzle dressing over the salad.
