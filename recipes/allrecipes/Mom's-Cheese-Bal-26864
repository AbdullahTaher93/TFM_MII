In a medium bowl, thoroughly mix cream cheese, blue cheese, black olives, butter and chives. Form into a ball shape. On a piece of plastic wrap large enough to wrap the ball, pour the chopped pecans. Roll the ball in the pecans to cover. Wrap with the plastic. Chill in the refrigerator at least 1 hour before serving.
