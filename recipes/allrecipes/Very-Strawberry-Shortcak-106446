Strawberry Filling Directions: Stir together strawberries, 2 tablespoons SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and balsamic vinegar; let stand 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Shortcake Directions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Combine biscuit mix and 1/3 cup SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener in a large bowl. Stir together yogurt and vanilla; add to dry ingredients, stirring just until moistened. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead 3 or 4 times. Pat dough to a 1/2-inch thickness. Cut with a 2 1/4-inch round cutter, reusing dough scraps, if necessary. Place shortcakes on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake 12 to 15 minutes. Serve warm with sliced strawberries. Garnish, if desired.
