Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil. Add pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, and set aside. Meanwhile, in a skillet over medium heat, brown steak strips, about 5 minutes. Pour chicken broth into a sauce pan and warm over medium heat. Divide cooked spaghetti into large bowls, top with cucumber and steak. Then pour chicken broth over the top to create a soup. Season to taste with red wine vinegar, salt, and pepper.
