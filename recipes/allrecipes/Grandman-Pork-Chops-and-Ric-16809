In a saucepan bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil. Stir in rice. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Season pork chops with the garlic powder, ground black pepper and seasoned salt to taste. In a large skillet over medium heat, saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil for 5 minutes. Add the chops, browning well on both sides. Add 3/4 cup water, reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes. Move chops to one side and add the tomato soup and remaining 1/2 cup water. Simmer for 5 to 7 more minutes, then add the cooked rice, stirring well. Allow to heat through, about 5 more minutes.
