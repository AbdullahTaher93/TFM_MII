Bring 2 quarts of water to boil. Add green beans and boil for 5 minutes or until beans are just tender. Plunge the beans in cold water to set their color, drain well. In a large bowl combine salt, mustard seed, dill weed, chiles, dill seed and garlic. Mix. Add cooled beans to the bowl and stir. In a small saucepan bring 2 cups water, vinegar, sugar and salt (to taste) to boil. Pour this mixture over the beans and spices. Mix well. Chill the beans in an airtight container at least overnight before eating. The beans are best if given a week to marinate refrigerated before eating.
