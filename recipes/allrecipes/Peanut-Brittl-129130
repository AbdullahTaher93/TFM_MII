Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, salt and 3/4 cup water and place over medium-high heat. Stir briefly with a wooden spoon, then attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan and bring the syrup to a boil. Continue boiling, without stirring, over medium-high heat until the mixture is light amber and the thermometer registers 340, 12 to 15 minutes. Working carefully and quickly, remove the thermometer and stir in the peanuts. Immediately pour the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Using a silicone spatula or wooden spoon, spread the mixture so the peanuts are in a single, even layer. Let cool completely, about 20 minutes. Using your hands, break the peanut brittle into pieces
