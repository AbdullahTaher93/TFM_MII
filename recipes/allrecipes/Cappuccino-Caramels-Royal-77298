Line 8-inch square baking pan with foil, extending foil over edges of pan. Coat bottom and sides of foil with no-stick cooking spray. Melt 1 cup butter and chocolate in heavy 3-quart saucepan. Stir in brown sugar, sweetened condensed milk, corn syrup and coffee crystals. Clip candy thermometer to side of pan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thermometer registers 248 degrees F (firm-ball stage*). Mixture should boil at moderate, steady rate over entire surface. Reaching firm-ball stage should take 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Remove thermometer. Immediately stir in nuts (optional). Quickly pour into prepared pan, spreading evenly with spoon. Cool. Use foil to lift candy out of pan when candy is firm. Use buttered knife to cut into squares. Wrap each square in plastic wrap or place in candy cups.
