In a small mixing bowl, combine the diced tomatoes, minced garlic, chopped herbs, lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, 2 tbs of olive oil, and chopped red onion. Season with salt, sugar and black pepper.* Brush the French bread slices lightly with the remaining 3 tbs of olive oil and lightly toast under the broiler (about 5 - 6" from broiler unit). Toast can burn quickly, so keep a watchful eye on this process. Meanwhile, spray a skillet with cooking spray and grill the al fresco Roasted Pepper & Asiago Chicken Sausages over medium high heat until nicely browned. Slice each link on the diagonal into 8 pieces. Top each toast point with a slice of the chicken sausage, followed with a spoonful of bruschetta, and garnish with fresh oregano and a small shaving of Asiago Cheese. Serve immediately.
