Rinse chicken and pat dry. Sprinkle with salt and pepper on all sides. Add 3 tablespoons flour to a shallow bowl. Turn chicken in flour a few pieces at a time to coat all sides; shake off excess. In a 12- to 14-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat, melt butter with oil. When pan is hot, add chicken. Cook, turning once, until chicken is well browned and no longer pink in center of thickest part (cut to test), 10 to 12 minutes; be careful as oil may splatter. To pan add wine, orange juice, orange peel, onion, sugar, garlic, and tarragon. Stir to scrape free any browned bits from pan bottom. Cover pan and simmer chicken and sauce 2 minutes. Transfer chicken with tongs or a slotted spoon to a platter; keep warm. Mix together sour cream and remaining 11/2 teaspoon flour, then whisk mixture into sauce in pan. Simmer sauce, whisking until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour sauce over chicken and garnish with orange wedges.
