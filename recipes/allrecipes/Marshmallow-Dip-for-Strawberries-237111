Combine marshmallows and water in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until marshmallows are melted and smooth, about 2 minutes. Beat cream cheese in a bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Stir about 3 tablespoons marshmallow mixture, adding more as needed, into whipped cream cheese until desired sweetness is reached.
