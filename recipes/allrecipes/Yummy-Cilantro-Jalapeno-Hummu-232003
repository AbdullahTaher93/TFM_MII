Puree the garbanzo beans, cilantro, lemon juice, tahini, jalapeno pepper, garlic, cumin, and salt in a blender or food processor using long pulses until the mixture is fairly smooth and slightly fluffy. Make sure to scrape the mixture off the sides of the food processor or blender in between pulses. Transfer hummus to a serving bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
