Spray a cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray. Wash apples by gently rubbing with an abrasive scrub sponge and a few drops of dish detergent. Rinse and dry well; remove stem. Push sticks into tops of apples; set aside. Microwave caramels and milk in a tall deep microwave-safe bowl or 2 cup glass measure on HIGH for 2 1/2 minutes or until melted, stirring after 1 1/2 minutes. Dip and swirl apples in melted caramel mixture, using a spoon to spread evenly. Place on prepared pan and refrigerate at least 15 minutes or until caramel sets.
