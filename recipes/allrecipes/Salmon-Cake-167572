Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Partially mash potatoes in a bowl with a fork until they begin to hold together. Add salmon, egg white, mayonnaise, capers, scallions, salt and pepper. Shape into 4 cakes, each about 1/2 inch thick. Heat oil in an ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the salmon cakes and cook until browned on the underside, 4 to 5 minutes. Carefully turn the cakes over with a spatula and transfer the pan to the oven. Bake until heated through and golden brown on the second side, 5 to 7 minutes.
