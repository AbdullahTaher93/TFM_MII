Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Wrap potatoes in aluminum foil and place on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until tender when pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Cool potatoes until easily handled; cut in half. Scoop the potato flesh into a large bowl, leaving the shells intact. Mix potato with tuna, mayonnaise, and green onions. Spoon mixture back into shells. Press shredded Cheddar cheese on top of each. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
