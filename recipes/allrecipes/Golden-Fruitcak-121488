Place raisins in a bowl; cover with boiling water and let stand for 5 minutes. Drain well and set aside. In a mixing bowl, cream shortening and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Combine dry ingredients; add to the creamed mixture alternately with milk. Stir in the walnuts, pineapple, cherries, coconut and raisins. Spoon into nine greased 5-3.4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 300 degrees F for 65-75 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
