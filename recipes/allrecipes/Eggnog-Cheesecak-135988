Preheat oven to 325 degrees F if using a silver springform pan (or 300 degrees F if using a dark nonstick springform pan.) Mix crumbs, butter and nutmeg; press onto bottom and 1-1/2 inches up side of 9-inch springform pan. Bake 10 min. Beat cream cheese, sugar, flour, rum and vanilla with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Add 2 whole eggs, 1 at a time, mixing on low speed after each addition just until blended. Blend in whipping cream and egg yolks; pour into crust. Bake 1 hour 10 min. to 1 hour 15 min. or until center is almost set.
