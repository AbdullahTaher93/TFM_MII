In a large skillet cook ground beef, ground pork, and onion until brown. In a large saucepan mix together the tomatoes, garlic, carrots, peas, water, bay leaves, olive oil, and salt. Add meat mixture. Bring to a boil. Cover partially, and reduce to a simmer. Cook for one hour, stirring occasionally.
