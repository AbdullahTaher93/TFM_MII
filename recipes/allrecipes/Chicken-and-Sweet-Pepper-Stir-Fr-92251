Stem and seed peppers. Cut in thin slivers 2 to 3 inches long. Place a wok or 10- to 12-inch frying pan over high heat; when pan is hot, add half the oil. When the oil is hot, add the chicken and stir-fry for 5 minutes until no longer pink in the center; cut to test. Remove chicken from pan. Add remaining oil to pan with ginger, garlic, and onion slivers; stir-fry for 1 minute. Add bell pepper slivers; stir-fry until tender-crisp, about 3 minutes. Add bean sprouts and the cooked chicken; stir-fry until the sprouts barely wilt, about 1 minute. Mix sesame oil into stir-fry mixture. Spoon onto plates; add soy sauce or salt to taste. Serve over hot cooked rice, if desired.
