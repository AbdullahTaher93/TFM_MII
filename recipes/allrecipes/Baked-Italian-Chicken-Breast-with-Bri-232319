Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Pour white wine and water into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix oregano, black pepper, and salt together in a bowl; massage oregano mixture onto both sides of chicken breasts. Arrange coated chicken breasts in the baking dish; sprinkle with red pepper flakes. Bake chicken in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Place tomatoes, mushrooms, and garlic around the chicken breasts; sprinkle 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese over chicken and vegetables. Continue baking until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese over chicken; top each chicken breast with 1 slice prosciutto and 2 to 3 slices Brie cheese diagonally atop prosciutto. Bake until Brie cheese is melted, 5 to 10 minutes.
