Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, crumble the ground beef into a large skillet. Cook and stir until no longer pink. Drain grease, and reduce heat to low. Sprinkle cheese over the top. Keep over low heat until cheese is melted. Mix in ketchup, mustard, garlic powder and sage. Cook until heated through. Drain spaghetti, and stir into beef mixture. Serve and enjoy!
