In large resealable plastic bag, pour 3/4 cup Lawry's(R) Tequila Lime Marinade With Lime Juice over chicken; turn to coat. Close bag and marinate in refrigerator 30 minutes. Soak 8 wooden skewers in water 15 minutes. Remove chicken from Marinade, discarding Marinade. On skewers, alternately thread chicken, green pepper, onion and tomatoes. Grill or broil, turning once and brushing frequently with remaining 1/4 cup Marinade, 15 minutes or until chicken is thoroughly cooked. Remove chicken and vegetables from wooden skewers. Serve on tortillas and, if desired, with sour cream and shredded Cheddar cheese.
