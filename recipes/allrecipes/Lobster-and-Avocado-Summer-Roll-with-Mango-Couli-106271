Prepare the sauce by pureeing the mango, mirin, lime juice, and olive oil until smooth in a blender. Season to taste with salt, and refrigerate until ready to serve. Soak a spring roll wrapper in a bowl of warm water until just pliable, about 30 seconds. Gently shake off excess water, and place onto work surface. Place some of the sliced lobster, avocado, mizuna, mint, sea vegetables, heart of palm, and mushrooms in a strip on the bottom edge of the spring roll. Fold once towards the center, then fold in the sides and continue rolling into a cylinder. Repeat with remaining ingredients. To serve, slice each roll diagonally, and serve two per person accompanied by mango sauce.
