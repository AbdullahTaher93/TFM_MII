In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, combine the tomatoes, sugar and lemon juice. Cook and stir over high heat until mixture comes to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 25 minutes. Remove from the heat. Skim off foam if necessary. Stir in gelatin until completely dissolved. Pour into jars or containers; cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Cover and let stand for 3 hours or until set, but not longer than 24 hours. Refrigerate for up to 3 weeks.
