In large bowl with electric mixer, beat margarine and cheese on medium speed until light and fluffy. Mix in flour, cayenne and 300 mL (1 1/4 cups) of the crushed cereal. In large plate or shallow pan, mix together remaining crushed cereal and sesame seeds. Using rounded teaspoonfuls, form cheese mixture into small balls; roll in sesame seed mixture to lightly coat. Place on ungreased baking sheet. Flatten with fork to 4 cm (1 1/2-inch) diameter, 5 mm (1/4-inch) thick. Bake at 180 degrees C (350 degrees F) about 12 minutes or until golden brown. Transfer to wire racks; let cool. Store in airtight container.
