Combine ground turkey, red onion, green bell pepper, and garlic in a Dutch oven. Cook and stir until turkey is browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Stir diced tomatoes, black beans, and corn niblets into the Dutch oven. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and stir in water and Spanish rice mix. Simmer until rice is fluffy and tender, about 7 minutes. Let stand before serving, about 2 minutes.
