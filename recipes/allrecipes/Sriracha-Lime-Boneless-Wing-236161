Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly oil a baking sheet. Combine flour, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper together in a resealable plastic bag. Place chicken in bag, seal bag, and shake well. Remove chicken from bag and spread out in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Whisk butter, Sriracha hot sauce, honey, lime juice, soy sauce, and ginger together in a saucepan over medium heat until sauce bubbles, about 5 minutes. Place cooked chicken pieces in a large bowl and pour sauce over chicken. Toss to coat.
