In a 10-inch skillet or saute pan, heat the oil. Add the onion and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Add the vinegar and cook 1 minute longer. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cool the onion and transfer to a covered container. Refrigerate and use as needed.
