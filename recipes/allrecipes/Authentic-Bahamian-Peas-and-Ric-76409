Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, and fry until transparent. Stir in the green pepper, ham, tomato paste, tomato, bacon, corned beef, and pigeon peas. Season with thyme, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer. Stir in the coconut milk, water and browning sauce, and bring to a boil. Stir in the rice. Return to a boil, then stir, cover, and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for about 45 minutes, until rice is tender. Stir occasionally.
