Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Wrap hot dog pieces in bacon pieces and secure with toothpicks. Arrange on a baking sheet. Broil the hot dog pieces until bacon is crisp, turning once or twice, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a serving platter. Melt butter in a saucepan and stir in brown sugar. Place over medium heat and bring to a boil, stirring until brown sugar has dissolved. Serve hot dog pieces with brown sugar sauce drizzled on top.
