Heat a skillet over medium heat. Spread peanut butter on one slice of bread, lay a slice of cheese over the peanut butter, and top with the remaining slice of bread. Spread butter on the outer sides of the sandwich, and place in the hot skillet. Fry on each side until golden brown and cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes.
