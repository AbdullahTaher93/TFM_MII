Preheat grill pan on medium-high (or preheat grill). Combine curry powder, onion powder, brown sugar. Season pork with salt and pepper; then coat with spice mixture. Coat pork with cooking spray (wash hands). Place pork in grill pan (or on grill); grill 2-3 minutes on each side. Reduce heat to medium (or move pork to coolest part of grill); cover and grill 8-10 more minutes, turning occasionally, or until 160 degrees F (for medium). (Sauce may be brushed on pork during last 5 minutes of grill time or used for dipping.) Let pork stand 5 minutes. Slice pork and serve.
