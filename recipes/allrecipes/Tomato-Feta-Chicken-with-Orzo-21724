Heat 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch skillet or 4-quart Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook chicken in oil about 15 minutes, turning occasionally, until brown on all sides. Remove chicken from skillet, using tongs. Add 1 tablespoon oil to drippings in skillet; heat over medium-low heat. Cook onions in oil mixture about 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden brown. Stir in garlic. Cook and stir about 30 seconds or until garlic is light golden brown. Stir in remaining ingredients except orzo and cheese; break up tomatoes. Add chicken. Heat to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer about 20 minutes or until juice of chicken is no longer pink when centers of thickest pieces are cut. Serve tomato mixture over chicken and orzo. Sprinkle with cheese and, if desired, additional chopped fresh cilantro.
