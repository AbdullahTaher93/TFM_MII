Spread mayonnaise on one side of each slice of bread. On two slices, layer the cheese, zucchini, tomato, carrot and sunflower kernels. Top with remaining bread, mayonnaise side down. Spread butter over the outside of bread. In a large skillet, cook over medium heat until bread is lightly toasted and cheese is melted.
