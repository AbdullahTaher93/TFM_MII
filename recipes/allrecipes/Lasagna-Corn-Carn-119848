In a large skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Add salsa, beans, vegetables and seasonings. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Spread a fourth of the meat sauce in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish; top with four noodles. Repeat once. Top with half of the remaining sauce and half of the cheeses. Layer with the remaining noodles, sauce and cheeses. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes. Uncover; bake 15-20 minutes longer or until heated through. Let stand for 15 minutes before cutting.
