In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt and nutmeg. In another bowl, combine the egg, sour cream, honey and vanilla until smooth. Stir into dry ingredients. Fold in the apples. Spoon into pastry shell. Combine the topping ingredients; sprinkle over filling. Bake at 425 degrees F for 25 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F; bake 25-30 minutes longer or until the apples are tender (cover pie edges loosely with foil if necessary to prevent overbrowning). Cool on a wire rack. Store in the refrigerator.
