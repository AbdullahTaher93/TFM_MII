Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Pour melted butter into the bottom of a 9-inch pie dish; swirl dish to evenly coat. Mix dill, celery seed, onion, and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese in a small bowl; sprinkle into the pie dish. Place 1 biscuit half in the center of the pie dish; place remaining biscuit halves around the center biscuit in a clockwise arrangement. Sprinkle biscuits with 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Flip dish upside-down onto a plate and pull apart to serve.
