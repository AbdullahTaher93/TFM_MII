Using a sharp knife, lightly score the skin of the sea bass fillets in a cross-hatch pattern. Season both sides of the sea bass fillets with salt and pepper, then dust very lightly with flour. In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil until almost smoking. Add the sea bass fillets, skin side down, and cook over moderately high heat until browned and crisp, about 3 minutes. Carefully turn the sea bass fillets with a spatula. Pour the white wine into the skillet and add the bay leaves. Cook the fillets over moderate heat until just cooked through, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer the fillets to a warmed platter and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Add the fish stock or clam juice to the skillet and simmer over moderately high heat until the sauce is slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and stir in the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Spoon the sauce over the fish and serve.
