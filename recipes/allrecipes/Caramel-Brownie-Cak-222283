Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat 13 x 9-inch baking pan with no-stick cooking spray. Combine brownie mix, water, oil and eggs in large bowl. Stir for 50 strokes. Spread in prepared pan. Bake 28 to 31 minutes. Cool 30 minutes. Poke holes, about 2-inches apart, in warm brownie with the handle of wooden spoon. Use 1/2 cup caramel topping to fill the holes, then spread remaining over top of brownies. Fold 1/4 cup caramel topping into whipped topping. Spread evenly over brownie. Sprinkle with peanuts. Chill 30 minutes. Top each piece with a maraschino cherry just before serving.
