Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly coat muffin pans with nonstick cooking spray, set aside. In a mixing bowl, stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Make a well in the center of flour mixture, set aside. In a separate bowl, stir together egg whites, orange juice, oil and vanilla. Add egg white mixture all at once to the flour mixture; stir just until moistened. Fold in blueberries. Spoon into prepared muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full. Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 18 minutes, or until golden and toothpick inserted into centers comes out clean. Cool slightly before removing from pans. Serve warm with butter.
