Cut ribs into serving size pieces and place inside large sauce pan (will require 4 -6 qt. size) filled with cold water to cover 1-inch above meat. Add salt, black peppercorn, bay leaves, garlic, and rosemary (optional) to water. Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer for 1 hour or until ribs are tender. Drain pan. Remove ribs, pat dry with paper towel, and place on a cookie sheet. Pour contents of bottle of Chef Walters Old Savannah Smoky BBQ Sauce over ribs and spread evenly with brush. Turn ribs to other side and repeat. Place ribs on grill and cook for 5 -7 minutes. Turn ribs and reduce heat on grill slightly. Continue cooking for approximately 10 minutes. Brush any sauce remaining on cookie sheet onto ribs while cooking. To guarantee extra tender ribs, cook on lower heat setting throughout grilling time and cook longer. Ribs must be cooked through (160 F) with some charred speckles on edge, but not dry for best flavor.
