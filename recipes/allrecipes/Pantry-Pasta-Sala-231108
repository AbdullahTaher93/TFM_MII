Combine garbanzo beans, artichoke hearts, frozen peas, black olives, and red onion in a large salad bowl. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Mix still-warm pasta into garbanzo bean mixture. Fold queso blanco cheese into salad; add Italian salad dressing and toss to coat. Season to taste with cracked black pepper. Set salad aside until peas thaw and flavors blend, about 5 minutes.
