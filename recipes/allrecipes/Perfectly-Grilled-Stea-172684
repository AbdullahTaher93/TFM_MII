Rinse meat and pat dry. If marinating, place meat in a resealable plastic food bag and add marinade; seal bag and turn to coat meat with marinade. Chill meat in bag at least 20 minutes or up to 1 day. If not marinating, season steak to taste with salt and pepper. Lay steak on a lightly oiled barbecue grill 4 to 6 inches above a single, solid layer of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. With tongs or a wide spatula, turn meat when browned on bottom. Continue to grill until done to your taste (cut to test), turning as needed for even color and cooking. Transfer meat to a carving board; let rest 3 to 5 minutes, then serve.
