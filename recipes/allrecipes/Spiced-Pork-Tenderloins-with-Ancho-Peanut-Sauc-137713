Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Soak the ancho chiles in warm water for 5 minutes; drain and set aside. In a shallow dish, combine 1 tablespoon cumin, the paprika, 1 tablespoon pepper and 2 teaspoons salt. Brush the tenderloins with 3 tablespoons oil and roll in the spice mixture to coat. In a large ovenproof skillet, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Using tongs, sear the pork until browned all over. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part reads 150 degrees F, 10 to 12 minutes. Meanwhile, place the chiles in a blender and add the coconut milk, peanut butter, vegetable broth, lime juice, 2 teaspoons salt, the coriander, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon cumin and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Process until the sauce is smooth, about 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from the oven and transfer the pork to a cutting board to rest for 5 minutes. Slice into 1/2-inch-thick medallions and arrange on a serving platter. Drizzle with the ancho-peanut sauce.
