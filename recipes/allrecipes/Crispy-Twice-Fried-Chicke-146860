Make the Spice Paste: In a mini food processor, combine all of the ingredients and process to a dry paste. Prepare the Chicken: In a large, deep skillet, heat the vegetable oil to 365 degrees F. Rub the spice paste all over the chicken pieces, massaging it in. When the oil is ready, carefully add the chicken and fry over moderately high heat until partially cooked, about 8 minutes for breast pieces and 15 minutes for thighs, drumsticks and wings. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to a rack to cool for 10 minutes. Reheat the vegetable oil to 365 degrees F. Add the chicken and fry until browned and cooked through, about 3 minutes for breast pieces and 5 to 6 minutes for the wings and dark meat. Drain the chicken on paper towels and serve.
