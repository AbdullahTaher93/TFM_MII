Fill a medium bowl with water and squeeze the lemon half into it. Peel the pears and add them to the lemon water. Using a small melon baller, scoop out balls from each pear; return the balls to the lemon water. You will need 16 pear balls. Using a toothpick, make a small hole in each pear ball and tuck a currant into each hole. Pour 1 tablespoon of the pear nectar into each of 8 Champagne flutes. Fill the flutes with Champagne. Spear 2 pear "eyeballs" on a toothpick, put in each flute and serve at once.
