Place a cheese cloth over a medium bowl and strain the yogurt 6 hours in the refrigerator, or over night. Drain as much excess liquid from the cucumber and garlic as possible. In a large bowl, mix together the yogurt, cucumber, garlic, vinegar, olive oil and salt. Stir until a thick mixture has formed.
