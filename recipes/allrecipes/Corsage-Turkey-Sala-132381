On a hot grill, cook each turkey tenderloin 12 minutes on each side or until no longer pink in the center. In a large bowl, toss salad greens, cucumber, carrot and radish slices with the vinaigrette. Arrange salad greens on four dinner plates. Slice turkey crosswise into 1/2 inch strips and divide among plates.
