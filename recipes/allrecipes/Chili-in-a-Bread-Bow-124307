In a saucepan, brown beef with onion; drain. Add next five ingredients; simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Grease a 9-in. heart-shaped or round baking pan; sprinkle with cornmeal and set aside. In a saucepan over medium heat, bring water and butter to a boil. Add flour, Parmesan and baking powder; stir until a smooth ball forms. Remove from heat; beat in eggs, one at a time. Continue beating until the mixture is smooth and shiny. Spread into prepared pan, building up edges slightly. Bake at 425 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until the center is firm and puffed and edges are golden brown. Make a shallow slit in the center to allow steam to escape. Cool for 5 minutes before removing to a serving plate. Fill with chili; serve immediately.
