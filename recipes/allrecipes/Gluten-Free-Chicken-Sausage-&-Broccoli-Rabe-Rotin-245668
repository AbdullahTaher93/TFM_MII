Bring two large pots of water to a boil. Season one pot of water with salt and cook the broccoli rabe for approximately 3-4 minutes. When the broccoli rabe is cooked, drain well and set aside. In a large skillet, saute the chicken sausage in 1 tablespoon of olive oil until slightly browned. Add the garlic and saute for 1 minute. Add the broccoli rabe and saute for an additional 2-3 minutes - then add the white wine and deglaze by using a spoon to gently scrape the flavor from the bottom of the pan. Cook the pasta according to the directions, add 1/2 cup of cooking water to the broccoli rabe and bring to a simmer. Drain the pasta and toss with the sauce, then stir to combine. Remove the skillet from the heat, add the remaining olive oil and fold in the cheese.
