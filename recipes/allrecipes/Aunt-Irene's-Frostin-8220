In a medium sized saucepan, stir the sugar, flour, cornstarch and gelatin together. Add the eggs and beat until smooth. Beat in the milk. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally until thickened, about 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the butter and the vanilla. Let cool and chill until cold. Once cold, beat until smooth and fluffy. Whip the cream into soft peaks and fold it into the frosting. Makes enough to frost one 8 or 9 inch layer cake.
