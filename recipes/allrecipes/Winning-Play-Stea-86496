Mix all ingredients, except steak, in small bowl until well blended. Place steak in large resealable plastic bag. Add marinade; turn to coat well. Refrigerate 1 hour or longer for extra flavor. Remove steak from marinade, reserving remaining marinade. Grill over medium heat 6 to 8 minutes per side or until desired doneness, brushing with reserved marinade halfway through cooking. Discard any remaining marinade.
