Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until the onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Sit tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, wine, tomato paste, chicken bouillon granules, basil, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper with the onion mixture. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer, stirring frequently, for 1 hour.
