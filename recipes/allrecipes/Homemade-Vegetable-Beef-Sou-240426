Mix beef broth and beef stew meat in a large pot over medium heat. Bring broth to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook beef at a simmer until tender, about 45 minutes. Stir corn, green beans, tomato sauce, and tomato paste with the beef. Pour tomato-vegetable juice cocktail into the pot; season with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook for 5 hours.
