Crumble beef into a microwave-safe 3-qt. dish; add onion. Loosely cover and microwave on high for 5-6 minutes or until meat is no longer pink, stirring twice; drain. Stir in rice and 1/2 cup water. Cover and cook for 3 minutes. Stir in soup, almonds and mushrooms. In a bowl, combine the stuffing mix, butter and remaining water; spoon over beef mixture. Microwave, uncovered, for 2-3 minutes or until heated through.
