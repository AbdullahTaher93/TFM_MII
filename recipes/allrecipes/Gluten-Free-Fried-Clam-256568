Place shucked clams in a small bowl. Pour in milk; toss clams gently with a fork to cover evenly. Let soak in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Combine flour, masa harina, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper in a plastic container with a lid. Seal container and shake to blend flour mixture. Remove clams one at a time from the milk and place in the flour mixture; shake gently to coat. Shake off excess flour and place on a plate. Heat 3/4 inch oil in a large saucepan or deep-fryer. Fry clams in small batches until golden brown and crispy, about 1 minute. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon.
