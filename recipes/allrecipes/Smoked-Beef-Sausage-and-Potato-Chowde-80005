Heat Dutch oven over medium-high heat until hot. Add sausage; cook and stir 5 minutes or until browned. Pour off drippings. Add potatoes from package, mixed vegetables, broth and water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; whisk in sauce mix until blended. Cover and simmer over low heat 12 minutes or until potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in milk; cook, uncovered, over medium heat 1 minute or just until heated through. (Do not boil.) Remove from heat; stir in chopped parsley and pepper. Garnish with parsley sprigs.
