Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix brown sugar, chopped pecans, dried cranberries, butter, orange zest, orange juice, egg, and brandy together in a bowl. Arrange tart shells on a baking sheet and spoon pecan-cranberry filling into each shell about 2/3 full. Add 1 pecan half and 1 fresh cranberry to each tart. Bake in the preheated oven until tart shells are lightly browned and filling is bubbling, 18 to 20 minutes.
