In an electric skillet or deep-fat fryer, heat oil to 375 degrees F. Fry biscuits, a few at a time, for 1-2 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Cut a small hole in the corner of a pastry or plastic bag; insert a very small tip. Fill bag with jam. Push the tip through the side of each doughnut to fill with jam. Dust with confectioners' sugar while warm. Serve immediately.
