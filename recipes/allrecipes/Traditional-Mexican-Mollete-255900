Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove some of the bread from the middle of bread halves to accommodate more toppings. Spread about 1 teaspoon butter on each half. Spread 2 to 3 tablespoons warmed refried beans on bread. Sprinkle about 1/4 cup Borden(R) Cheddar and Monterey Jack shredded cheese on the beans. Place bread halves on prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the bread is crispy, 15 to 20 minutes. Top molletes with Mexican salsa or pico de gallo.
