In a medium skillet, cook sausages over medium heat until juices run clear. Drain, and cut into bite sized pieces. Set aside. In large (13 quart) stock pot over medium heat, saute onion, garlic and crushed red pepper in olive oil until golden brown. Stir in sausage pieces, half the oregano and half the basil, and cook 10 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Stir in the remaining oregano and basil, reduce heat to low, and simmer 90 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour in the red wine, and with a handheld mixer, carefully blend the sauce in the pot until the tomatoes have been chopped into small pieces and the sauce is thick and chunky. Serve.
