Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners. Combine coconut flour, sweetener, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Mix with a fork to break up any clumps. Add eggs, almond milk, and butter; stir vigorously. Add vanilla extract; stir until batter is smooth and well combined. Fold in cranberries and minced jalapeno peppers. Scoop batter into the lined muffin cups. Place 1 jalapeno slice on top of each muffin. Bake in the preheated oven until tops are set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the muffin tin for 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 10 minutes more.
