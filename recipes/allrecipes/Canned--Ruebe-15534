Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain off most water, but not completely. Add the soup to the macaroni; mix well. Stir in cheese, sauerkraut and corned beef. Pour mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour.
