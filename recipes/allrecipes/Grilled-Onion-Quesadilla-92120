Place a nonstick 8- to 10-inch frying pan over high heat. Lay onion slices in pan; cook, turning occasionally, until browned (7 to 10 minutes). If onion begins to scorch or stick, add water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Lightly brush tortillas on both sides with water. Spread beans over half of each tortilla. Separate onion slices into rings; arrange over beans. Top with cheese. Fold each tortilla in half to cover filling. Place filled tortillas slightly apart on 2 large baking sheets. Bake in a 500 degrees F oven until tortillas are crisp and golden (6 to 8 minutes), switching positions of baking sheets halfway through baking. Meanwhile, in a medium serving bowl, mix 1 cup of the salsa with cabbage. Place remaining salsa in a small serving bowl. To serve, cut each quesadilla into 3 wedges; arrange wedges on a platter. Offer cabbage mixture and salsa to top individual servings.
