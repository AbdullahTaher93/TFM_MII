Whisk olive oil, vinegar, hot sauce, salt, and black pepper together in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl. Layer garlic, chopped onion, sliced onion, zucchini, olives, cabbage, jalapeno, and black beans, respectively, over hot sauce mixture. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and poke a few holes in the top. Microwave for 5 minutes; stir, recover with plastic wrap, and microwave until filling is hot throughout, about 5 minutes more. Spoon hot filling in a line across the middle of a tortilla. Fold opposing edges of the tortilla to overlap the filling. Roll 1 of the opposing edges around the filling into a burrito. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
