Heat a pot over medium heat. Cook and stir turkey sausage in the hot pot until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir carrots, onion, mushrooms, 1/4 cup parsley, and garlic into sausage. Cook and stir until onion is soft, 7 to 10 minutes. Pour water, garbanzo beans with liquid, beef bouillon cubes, and sage into sausage mixture. Bring to a boil, cover the pot, reduce heat to low, and simmer until carrots are tender, about 10 minutes. Skim and discard any accumulated fat. Season with salt and pepper; garnish with remaining 4 teaspoons parsley.
