Cook the carrot slices until tender but still crisp. Drain. In a large skillet, heat the honey until bubbling and foaming, stirring well. Add the butter and ginger and stir until the butter is melted and no lumps of ginger show. Toss the carrots in the glaze. Season with white pepper and salt to taste.
