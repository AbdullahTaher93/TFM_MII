Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in onion, green onions, red chile pepper, and pimentos. Cook and stir until onions are tender, about 5 minutes. Mix in curry powder, and continue to cook and stir 2 to 5 minutes. Blend cream into the onion mixture, and simmer until thickened. Mix in cod, cooking 3 to 5 minutes, until easily flaked with a fork. Season with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
