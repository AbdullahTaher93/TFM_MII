Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.) In a large saucepan or double boiler combine flour, cocoa powder, 1 cup of sugar, and salt. Mix well, then stir in milk and egg yolks. Whisk until all ingredients are thoroughly combined. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is thickened. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract. Pour mixture into baked pie shell. In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add 1/4 cup sugar and vanilla, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Spread meringue over pie, covering completely. Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until top is lightly browned. Remove and allow to cool before serving.
