Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Beat 1 egg in a large bowl until foamy. Add onion, ground beef, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and garlic; mix until combined. Mold mixture into a loaf on a baking sheet. Unroll crescent rolls and use to cover meatloaf completely, seaming seals and perforations so that no meat is visible. Whisk remaining egg and water in a small bowl to make egg wash. Brush egg wash over crust. Bake meatloaf in the preheated oven until crust is very dark and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 45 minutes.
