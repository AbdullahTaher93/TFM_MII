In a saucepan, bring brown sugar, butter and water to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish; top with peaches. Arrange bread over peaches. In a bowl, whisk the eggs, milk and vanilla; slowly pour over bread. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes. Uncover; bake 25-30 minutes longer or until the bread is golden brown. Serve with a spoon.
