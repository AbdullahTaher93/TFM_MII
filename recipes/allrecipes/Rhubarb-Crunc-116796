In a large bowl, combine the first four ingredients. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press half of the mixture into a greased 8-in. square baking dish. Set remaining crumb mixture aside for topping. Sprinkle rhubarb over crust; set aside. In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and cornstarch; gradually whisk in water until smooth. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat; whisk in vanilla. Pour over rhubarb. Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1 hour or until bubbly and lightly browned. Serve warm with ice cream if desired.
