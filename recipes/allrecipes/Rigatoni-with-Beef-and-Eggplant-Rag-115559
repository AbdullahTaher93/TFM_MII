Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook pasta according to package directions. Meanwhile, cook beef, garlic and fennel seeds in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, until the beef is browned, about 3 minutes. Add eggplant and oil; cook, stirring occasionally, until the eggplant browns, about 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce and wine; cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens, about 10 minutes. Stir in oregano, salt and pepper. Drain the pasta; serve topped with the sauce and sprinkled with pine nuts and feta, if using.
