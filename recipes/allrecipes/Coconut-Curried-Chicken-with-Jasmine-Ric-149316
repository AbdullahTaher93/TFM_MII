Combine rice and broth in a 2-quart microwavable bowl. Cover tightly with microwave-safe plastic wrap and cook on high for 5 minutes. Reduce to 50 percent power and cook for 18 to 20 minutes or until tender. Set aside. Generously coat a 2-quart microwavable dish with cooking spray. Mix in chicken, onion, pepper, garlic, ginger, and salt. Cover tightly and microwave on high for 3 to 5 minutes or until vegetables are soft. In a cup, mix coconut milk and curry paste. Pour over chicken and cook uncovered on high for 8 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink. Serve with rice garnished with basil.
