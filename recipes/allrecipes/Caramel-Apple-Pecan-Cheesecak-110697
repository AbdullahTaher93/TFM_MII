Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Reserve 3/4 cup of apple pie filling. Spoon remaining pie filling into crust. In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, and vanilla. Beat until smooth, then beat in eggs one at a time. Pour over apple filling in crust. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 minutes, or until center is set. Remove from oven, and cool to room temperature. In a small saucepan melt caramel with reserved apple filling. Arrange apple slices around outside edge of cheesecake. Spread caramel sauce evenly over the top. Sprinkle with chopped pecans. Chill until ready to serve.
