Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place 1 cup red wine, olive oil, beef neck bones, onion, celery, carrot, garlic, and black pepper in a roasting pan; stir to coat. Roast neck bones and vegetable mixture in the preheated oven until vegetables are tender, 1 hour. Stir in about 2 tablespoons red wine while scraping any browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan. Roast until vegetables are browned, about 30 more minutes. Pour vegetable mixture into a 16-quart soup pot over medium-low heat; simmer for 30 minutes. Add tomato paste, plum tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, basil, oregano, and parsley; stir well. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce reduces, 8 hours. Remove neck bones from sauce; scrape marrow out of bones. Add marrow to sauce and simmer until dissolved, 1 to 2 more hours. Transfer sauce to a blender in batches, filling blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree until smooth.
