Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; season with 1 package taco seasoning mix. Drain and discard grease. Let beef cool completely. Stir sour cream, cream cheese, and remaining taco seasoning mix together in a bowl until smooth. Spread sour cream mixture onto a baking sheet to cover. Sprinkle about half the Cheddar cheese over the sour cream layer; top evenly with the ground beef, lettuce, and remaining Cheddar cheese, respectively. Spoon salsa over the dip. Refrigerate at least 1 hour.
