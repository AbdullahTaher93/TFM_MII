Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Make custard. Split vanilla bean in half length-wise. Scrape out seeds and place them in a medium mixing bowl. Add cream cheese, ricotta and SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener. Mix on medium speed (or by hand) until smooth. Add eggs and egg white. Mix until smooth. Scrape sides of bowl and mix briefly. Add heavy cream. Mix on medium speed (or by hand) until the custard is well mixed and smooth. Pour custard into eight 4-oz ramekins or custard dishes. Pour about one inch of water into a 13X9 inch baking pan. Place ramekins or custard cups in the water. Bake in preheated 250 degrees F 40-45 minutes or until custard is set. Remove custard cups or ramekins from water. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Prepare raspberries. Place raspberries, honey and thyme in a bowl. Very gently stir together until the raspberries are coated. Evenly spoon raspberries over the custards. Serve.
