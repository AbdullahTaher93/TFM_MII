Make a Tomato Base: In a 12-inch skillet, over medium high heat, heat the olive oil. Saute the garlic and shallots just until they start to color. Add the 4 cups of tomato concasse, sugar, if necessary, and salt and cook over medium heat until reduced by half, stirring occasionally. Stir in the tomato paste and chopped thyme and set aside. Bring a large stockpot of salted water to a boil. Make the sauce: In a clean 12-inch skillet or saute pan over medium high heat, heat the olive oil. Saute the garlic, stirring often, until it is lightly golden in color, about 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the 2 cups of tomato concasse, the reserved 2 cups of Tomato Base, the 1/4 cup chopped basil, and the salt. Return the skillet to the heat and simmer over medium-high heat until some of the moisture from the tomatoes evaporates, 3 to 4 minutes. When ready to serve, add pasta to the pot of boiling water and cook until it is al dente, about 1 minute for fresh pasta (cook packaged pasta according to the directions on the box). Drain the pasta and add it to the sauce with the chopped fresh parsley. Gently stir to heat through and coat the pasta with sauce.
