Mix together turkey, onion, parsley, garlic, bread crumbs, Italian seasoning, egg white, salt and pepper. Form into 4 patties. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat, when wisps of smoke rise add the patties. Cook turkey patties until brown, about 4-6 minutes on each side or to an internal temperature of 180 degrees F (85 degrees C).
