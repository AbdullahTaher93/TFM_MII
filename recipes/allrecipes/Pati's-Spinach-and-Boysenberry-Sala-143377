Make the dressing by combining the olive oil, horseradish, rice vinegar, brown sugar, and boysenberry jam in a blender. Blend until smooth. Place the spinach in a large bowl. Drizzle the dressing over the spinach and toss until leaves are evenly coated. Sprinkle boysenberries and almonds over top of the salad; serve immediately.
