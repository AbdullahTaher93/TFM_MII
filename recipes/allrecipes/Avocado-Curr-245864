Blend coconut milk, 1/2 avocado, 1/2 cup water, seasoning sauce, curry paste, and lime juice in a blender until smooth, adding more water if curry is too thick. Pour curry into a large saucepan and bring to a boil. Stir green beans, tempeh, and carrot into curry; reduce heat to medium. Cover saucepan and cook until beans and carrots are soft, about 15 minutes. Remove cover and add remaining 1/2 avocado, zucchini, and basil; cook and stir until basil is wilted, about 2 minutes more.
