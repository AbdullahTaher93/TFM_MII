Fill small pot with water and bring to a boil. Add 1/4 cup of bow tie pasta and cook until it's al dente - firm, yet tender. Set aside to cool. Take one large refrigerated pre-cooked meatball and stick 2 toothpicks into its bottom. Affix one piece of bow tie pasta to each toothpick. Lightly push two pretzels sticks upwards into meatball. Using a basting brush, gently coat meatball with tomato sauce. Take broken pieces of raw angel hair pasta and place into meatball around where pretzels are affixed to the meat. Gently press two (2) peppercorns side-by-side into meatball above pretzel tusks. Enjoy your new Meatbalrus!
