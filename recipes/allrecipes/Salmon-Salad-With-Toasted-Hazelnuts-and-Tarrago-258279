Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread hazelnuts onto a baking sheet. Toast hazelnuts in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Rub hot hazelnuts using a clean dishtowel to remove skins. Cool for 5 minutes. Chop. Combine hazelnuts, salmon, mayonnaise, Greek yogurt, red bell pepper, carrot, celery, hard-boiled eggs, onion, parsley, Dijon mustard, tarragon leaves, lemon juice, garlic salt, salt, and habanero pepper in a large bowl.
