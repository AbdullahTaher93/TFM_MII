In a large pot over low heat combine the beef, tomato, potatoes, onion, carrots, cabbage, garlic, 5 teaspoons cilantro, salt and cumin. Add water to cover and stir well. Cover and simmer for 2 hours. Remove lid, stir, and simmer for another hour with lid off. Serve hot. Just before eating, squeeze in fresh lime juice to taste and sprinkle with remaining cilantro.
