Place the broccoli, carrots, cauliflower and turnip in a large saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 3-5 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender. Drain and rinse in cold water. Place vegetables in a large bowl; add onion. In a jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine the remaining ingredients; shake well. Pour over vegetables and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
