Cook linguine according to package directions; when done, drain and rinse with cold water until cool. Drain well. While pasta cooks, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Sprinkle steak to taste with salt and pepper. Add to pan and cook, turning once, until well browned on both sides and done to your liking (cut to test), about 7 minutes for rare. Transfer steak to a rimmed platter and set aside for a few minutes to let juices settle. In a small mixing bowl, blend remaining oil, vinegar, garlic, cayenne, basil, salt, and pepper to taste. Set aside. Cut steak into thin strips and put meat and any juices in a medium mixing bowl. Add the tomatoes and half the vinaigrette, and gently toss. In a large serving bowl, combine linguine, olives, arugula or spinach, and remaining vinaigrette; toss gently. Gently blend in meat and tomato mixture. Serve immediately.
