In a large pot cook with boiling salted water cook fettuccini pasta until al dente. Drain. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan over medium-high heat melt margarine; add garlic and saute for one minute. Add flour, stirring constantly. Gradually whisk in milk, continue to stir until sauce thickens, about 5 to7 minutes. Add the Neufchatel cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, and ground black pepper. Cook until the cheese has completely melted. Serve Alfredo sauce over cooked and drained fettuccini noodles. Sprinkle the top with fresh parsley.
