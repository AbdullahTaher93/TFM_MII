Wash and remove stems the stems of fresh strawberries. Dice the strawberries until they are approximately 1/2 - 1/4-inch large (doesn't have to be exact). Remove 1 teaspoon of lemon zest from the lemon, slice it in half and extract the juice. Toss the strawberries with the sugar, 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice (reserve the remaining juice for the balsamic reduction and the cream cheese layer), lemon zest, and the vanilla extract. Cover and refrigerate until ready to assemble the spring rolls. Make the Balsamic Reduction: (Note: In a pinch, substitute with store bought balsamic reduction.) Stir together vinegar, water and brown sugar in a small pan. Simmer at a medium low heat, stirring often until thickened and reduced to about 1/3 cup. This should take 10 - 15 minutes. Chefs note: never let the liquid come to a full boil or your vinegar will be bitter. Set reduction aside until spring rolls are assembled. If necessary, use a splash of lemon juice to loosen the reduction for drizzling. Assembling the Spring Rolls: Combine the cream cheese, coconut flakes and 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Stir the mixture vigorously with a fork until loosened and spread a thin layer over the tortillas with a spatula or spoon, being careful not to rip the tortilla and leaving a small border around the tortilla. Remove the strawberries from the fridge and drain off any extra liquid that has accumulated in a colander. With a slotted spoon, add the strawberries atop the cream with a few small leaves of mint and start rolling tightly (as you would roll a burrito) from one side to the other. Slice the spring roll in half on a bias for a dessert portion or continue to slice each of the halves into smaller pieces for hors d'oeuvre. Plate the spring rolls on a platter and drizzle with a thin zig zag of balsamic vinegar (using a fork or spoon). Garnish the platter with a few randomly placed sprigs of mint and serve.
