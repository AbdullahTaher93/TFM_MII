Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; add sweet potatoes. Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are softened, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool, about 5 minutes. Place sweet potato chunks, chickpeas, peanut butter, lime juice, olive oil, paprika, cayenne pepper, cumin, and salt into a blender; puree until smooth.
