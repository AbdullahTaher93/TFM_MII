To Make Ground Masala: In a small skillet saute the red chili peppers, coriander, chili powder, poppy seed, cumin, garlic, cardamom and anise. Let cool and transfer to a small bowl, then grind together with the green chile peppers, tamarind, ginger and cilantro to make a smooth paste. Set aside. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and saute onions until brown. Add ground masala paste and saute for about 7 to 10 minutes. Add chicken pieces, reduce heat to low and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Bring all to a boil, boil for 1 minute, then remove from heat. Garnish with shredded coconut and serve.
