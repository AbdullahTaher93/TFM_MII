Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat olive oil in a large skillet; cook and stir zucchini, onion, and bell pepper in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in green chiles, eggs, salt, cumin, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper; set aside. Mix sour cream and flour in a bowl. Layer half the corn tortillas in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread half the zucchini mixture and half the sour cream mixture on top; sprinkle with half the Cheddar cheese. Repeat the layers. Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 30 minutes.
