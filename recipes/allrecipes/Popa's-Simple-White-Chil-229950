Crumble ground turkey into a Dutch oven over medium heat; cook and stir until turkey is browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir chicken base and boiling water together in a bowl until base is dissolved; pour over cooked ground turkey. Add Great Northern beans, enchilada sauce, green chiles, chopped onion, granulated garlic, cumin, and oregano; stir well. Simmer until flavors have blended, about 1 hour. Spoon chili into bowls. Combine cilantro and diced onion in a bowl; sprinkle over chili for serving.
