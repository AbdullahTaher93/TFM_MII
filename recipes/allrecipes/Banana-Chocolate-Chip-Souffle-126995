First, make the Banana Base: In a medium saucepan over high heat, brown the butter. Add the sugars and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until they turn a caramel color, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped bananas and stir until well coated. Continue to cook, stirring continuously, for 2 minutes more. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the rum and lemon juice. Transfer the mixture to a food processor and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and leave the mixture to cool to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Brush the insides of 6 (6-ounce) souffle ramekins with softened butter and dust them with sugar. To make the Souffles: In the bowl of a mixer with the whip attachment, or in a large bowl with a hand-held mixer, beat the egg whites at medium speed until they are firm enough to form soft peaks when the whip or beaters are lifted out. Still beating at medium speed, add the sugar in a slow but steady stream. Continue to beat until the whites form moderately stiff peaks. With a large rubber spatula, fold half of this meringue into the Banana Base. Add the finely chopped chocolate and fold in the remaining meringue. Divide the souffle mixture among the prepared ramekins, mounding it higher than their tops. Bake the souffles until well risen and golden, 12 minutes. Serve immediately.
