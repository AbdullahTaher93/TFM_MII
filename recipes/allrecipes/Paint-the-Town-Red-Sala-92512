To prepare dressing: combine raspberry juice, canola oil, raspberry vinegar and sugar in a container with a tightly fitting lid. Shake until sugar dissolves. In a large bowl, tear leaf and radicchio lettuce into bite-sized pieces. Toss in raspberries and onion. Drizzle vinaigrette over salad and toss. Serve immediately.
