In a small nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray, saute mushrooms and onion until tender. Add egg substitute and tomato; cook and gently stir over medium heat until egg mixture is completely set. Place one tortilla in a large ungreased nonstick skillet; top with ham, egg mixture, cheeses and remaining tortilla. Cook over medium heat, carefully turning once, until lightly browned on both sides and cheese begins to melt. Cut into four wedges. Serve with salsa.
