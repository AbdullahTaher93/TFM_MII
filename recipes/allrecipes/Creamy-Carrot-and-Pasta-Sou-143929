In a large saucepan combine chicken broth, carrots, potato, onion, ginger, and Jamaican jerk seasoning. Bring to boiling. Reduce heat; simmer, covered, for 20 minutes or until vegetables are very tender. Cool slightly. Meanwhile, cook pasta according to package directions; drain. Place one-fourth of the vegetable mixture in a blender container. Cover and blend until smooth, scraping sides of container as necessary. Blend remaining vegetable mixture, one-fourth at a time. Return all of the mixture to the saucepan. Stir in cooked pasta and milk; heat through. Ladle soup into bowls. If desired, garnish with fresh chives.
