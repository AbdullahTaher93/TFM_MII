In a large mixing bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Fold in marshmallows. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, for frosting, combine cocoa and butter in a saucepan. Cook over low heat until butter is melted. Stir in cola until blended. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat; stir in confectioners' sugar until smooth. Fold in pecans. Spread over cake. Let stand for 20 minutes before cutting.
