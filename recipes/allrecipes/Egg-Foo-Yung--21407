Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute bell pepper and onion until tender, then stir in shrimp, bean sprouts, water chestnuts and 1 tablespoon soy sauce. Heat through, then remove skillet from heat and set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a second large skillet. In a medium bowl, beat eggs until thick and lemon colored, about 5 minutes. Stir in vegetable mixture, then pour mixture into heated skillet, forming patties about 5 inches in diameter. Fry until browned, then turn and fry on other side until browned. Drain, place on an oven-safe platter and keep warm in oven until read to serve. To Make Hot Soy Sauce: In a small bowl combine the cornstarch, water, bouillon and 2 tablespoons soy sauce and beat together. Serve with warm patties.
