Slice the squash, put in pan with chopped onion, and cover with water. Cook at medium heat until tender. Put squash with liquid in a 2 1/2 quart casserole. Stir in chicken soup, sour cream, and melted butter. The liquid from the cooked squash should be enough so that mixture is slightly soupy. Add bread crumbs (or use seasoned dry stuffing mix) on top. The bread will absorb some of the liquid. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until lightly browned and bubbly, approximately 30 to 45 minutes.
