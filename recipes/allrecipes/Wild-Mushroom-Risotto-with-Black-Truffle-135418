In a medium-size heavy saucepan, heat the peanut oil. Over medium-high heat, saute the onion and garlic just to soften, stirring all the while, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the rice and continue to stir, using a wooden spoon, coating the rice with the oil and onion. Deglaze with the white wine and cook until the liquid is absorbed, stirring often. Pour in enough mushroom and/or chicken stock to cover, about 3 cups, and cook, stirring often, until the liquid is absorbed. Meanwhile, in a medium skillet, heat the 3 tablespoons of olive oil. If the mushrooms are large, cut them into bite-size pieces and saute over medium-high heat just to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour 3 cups of stock into the rice, turn the flame to high, and stir in a large pinch of salt and the tomato. Stir until almost al dente. Stir in the mushrooms and the remaining 1 cup of stock, as necessary. Remember that the risotto should be creamy, not runny. Remove from the flame and vigorously beat in the chilled butter and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese until completely dissolved. Stir in the parsley, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Presentation: Divide among 4 heated plates and serve immediately. Pass the remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese. Top with shaved black truffles, if desired.
