Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the garlic and tomatoes in the hot oil until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the asparagus to the skillet and toss until coated with the oil mixture. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the beef broth over the asparagus mixture. Cover the skillet and cook until the asparagus is bright in color and slightly crunchy, 7 to 10 minutes.
