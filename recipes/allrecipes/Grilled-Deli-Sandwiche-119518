In a large skillet, saute the onion, mushrooms and peppers in oil until tender. Layer six slices of bread with ham, turkey, pastrami, bacon, vegetables and cheese; top with remaining bread. Wrap each sandwich in foil. Grill, uncovered, over medium heat for 4-5 minutes on each side or until heated through.
