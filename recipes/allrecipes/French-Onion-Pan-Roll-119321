Divide the bread dough into 20 portions; shape each into a ball. In a bowl, combine the Parmesan cheese and soup mix. Place butter in another bowl. Roll each ball in butter, then in the cheese mixture. Arrange in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm.
