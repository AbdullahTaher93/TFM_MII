In a standing mixer or working in batches in a food processor, blend the softened ice cream with the graham cracker crumbs. Transfer to a plastic container, press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the ice cream, cover and freeze until firm, at least 30 minutes. In a small saucepan, cook the butter over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Transfer the browned butter to a heatproof bowl and stir in the vinegar. Spoon the berries into bowls and drizzle with the warm brown-butter balsamic sauce. Scoop the ice cream over the berries and serve right away.
