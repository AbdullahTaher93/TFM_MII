Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Line cookie sheet with parchment paper or use ungreased cookie sheet. Unroll dough; separate into 12 breadsticks. With finger, firmly press dough to make indentation lengthwise down center of each breadstick. Spoon 1/4 teaspoon pesto into each indentation. Fold dough lengthwise over pesto; press edges to seal. Twist and stretch each breadstick to form 22-inch rope. Shape each rope into pretzel shape; tuck ends under and press to seal. Place on paper-lined cookie sheet. Beat egg white in small bowl until foamy. Brush over pretzels. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12 to 18 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
