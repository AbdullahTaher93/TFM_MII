Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Toss the sauerkraut with the mustard, mayonnaise, and caraway seeds (and the Splenda if you are using it). Sprinkle 1/2 of the mixture on the bottom of a casserole dish (8x8 would be about right). Slice the corned beef (and/or sausages) into bite size pieces. Distribute the meat evenly over the sauerkraut. Then add the remaining sauerkraut. Then top it off with the Swiss cheese. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes. You can serve this right away or let it sit in the oven on the lowest setting until ready to serve.
