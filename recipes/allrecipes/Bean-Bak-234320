Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Cook and stir ground beef chuck and onion in a large skillet over medium high heat until meat is crumbly and cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain fat. Stir lima beans, tomato soup, and brown sugar into beef mixture and mix well. Pour mixture into a baking dish and top with bacon strips. Bake in preheated oven until bacon is crisp, 20 to 30 minutes.
