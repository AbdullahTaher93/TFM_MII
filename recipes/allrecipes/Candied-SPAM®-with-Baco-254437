Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix dark brown sugar and pepper together in a shallow bowl. Coat both sides of luncheon meat slices with brown sugar mixture; arrange in a single layer on a nonstick baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven, turning halfway, until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving.
