Cut each pita half into four wedges to make 8 pieces. Brush pita wedges with olive or vegetable oil to coat completely. Place on a baking sheet in single layer. In small bowl, combine basil, Morton(R) Kosher Salt and garlic powder. Sprinkle wedges with Morton(R) Kosher Salt/spice mixture. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10 to 15 minutes or until light golden brown and crisp. Serve pita crisps with your favorite salad.
