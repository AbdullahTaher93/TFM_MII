Peel potatoes; shred using large hole of box grater. Place potatoes in colander and press out excess moisture, using hands. Place potatoes in large bowl. Mix in remaining ingredients except oil. Heat oil in medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. For each latke, carefully drop 1 tablespoonful potato mixture into skillet, cooking only 2 to 3 latkes at a time. Immediately spread each mound onto thin circle with back of spoon. Cook 3 to 4 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Remove latkes from skillet; drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining potato mixture. Pass sour cream and applesauce to serve with latkes, if you like.
