Lay tilapia fillets in a glass baking dish. Drizzle olive oil and lime juice evenly over the fish. Season with salt and pepper. Allow to sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Transfer tilapia to a non-stick skillet and pour the lime juice mixture over the fish. Scatter the tomatoes, jalapenos, and cilantro over the fillets. Cook over medium heat for about 4 minutes per side.
