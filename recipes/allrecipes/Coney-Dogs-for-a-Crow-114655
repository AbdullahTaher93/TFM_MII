In a large saucepan, cook beef, celery and onion until meat is no longer pink; drain. Combine the brown sugar, cornstarch, salt and pepper; stir into beef mixture. Add ketchup and tomato juice. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 15-20 minutes or until heated through. Cook hot dogs according to package directions; place on buns. Top each with about 1/4 cup beef mixture.
