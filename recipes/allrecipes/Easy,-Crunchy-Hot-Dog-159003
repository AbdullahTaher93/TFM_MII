Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a sheet of aluminum foil. Stir together ketchup and mustard on a plate until mixed. Place the cornflake crumbs in a shallow bowl. Roll each hot dog in the ketchup mixture, then roll in the cornflake crumbs to coat. Place onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until the hot dogs are hot on the inside, and crispy on the outside, 15 to 20 minutes.
