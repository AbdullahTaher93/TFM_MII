Cook and stir fennel seeds, cumin seeds, and coriander seeds in a skillet over medium-high heat until toasted and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a spice grinder or food processor; add coffee, ancho chile pepper, brown sugar, kosher salt, paprika, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Grind until spice rub is a medium-coarse texture. Break steak down into 4-ounce pieces. Lightly score steak 1/2-inch x 1/2-inch and season with salt. Rub steak with spice rub. Heat a cast iron skillet over medium high. Pack spice rub onto all sides of the steak and place in the hot cast iron skillet; drizzle about 1 teaspoon olive oil over steak. Cook steak in the cast iron skillet until well browned, about 4 minutes. Flip and scatter shallots, smashed garlic, thyme, and butter around steak. Cook steak until desired doneness is reached, 4 to 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Let steak rest for 5 minutes; cut into thin slices. Whisk juice of 1 lemon, lemon zest, olive oil, honey, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl until dressing is evenly mixed. Thinly shave fennel and toss with juice from 1/2 lemon (to preserve color) in a bowl. Add apple, mint, parsley, and cilantro. Drizzle dressing over salad and toss gently; season with salt and pepper. Arrange steak slices on top of salad and scatter roasted shallots, pomegranate seeds, and hazelnuts on top.
