Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer quinoa to a bowl and fluff with a fork. Stir mango salsa, green onions, cranberries, sunflower kernels, champagne vinegar, and French vinaigrette into the quinoa. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Refrigerate salad at least 4 hours before serving.
