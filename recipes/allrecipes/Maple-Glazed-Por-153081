Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Pulse celery, carrot, onion and garlic in a food processor until finely chopped. Combine maple syrup and mustard in a small bowl, Fold thin ends of pork under and secure with toothpicks; season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in an ovenproof skillet (not nonstick) over high heat. Sear the pork on all sides until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Reduce heat to medium and add the vegetable mixture. Cook, stirring often, until lightly browned and softened, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and place pork on top of vegetables. Brush pork with 2 tablespoons of the syrup mixture. Transfer to oven and roast until pork registers 155 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer the pork to a cutting board and tent with foil to keep warm. Place the pan over medium heat. Add wine and simmer, scraping up any browned bits. Combine broth and cornstarch in a small bowl; whisk into the pan and cook, whisking constantly, until sauce is slightly thickened, about 4 minutes. Add remaining 2 tablespoons maple mixture and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Remove toothpicks and cut the pork into 1/4-inch slices. Overlap slices on a platter; top with sauce.
