Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine the chopped olives with the oregano, garlic, oil, and parsley. Spread some of the olive mixture on the bottom half of each roll. Top the olive salad with the salami, ham, and provolone. Cover with the tops of the rolls and then wrap each sandwich in aluminum foil. Bake until the cheese melts, about 15 minutes.
