Heat a large, deep nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon oil and sausage to pan; cook until sausage is browned, stirring to break up pieces. Transfer sausage to paper towel-lined plate. Drain fat from skillet and return pan to stove. Add remaining oil, garlic and onion; saute 3 to 5 minutes or until onion is tender. Add bay leaf, sage and wine to pan. Cook until wine reduces by half, about 2 minutes. Add stock and pumpkin; cook, stirring, until sauce bubbles. Return sausage to pan, reduce heat and stir in cream. Season with cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Simmer 5 to 10 minutes to thicken sauce. Place drained pasta in large pot or saucepan. Remove bay leaf from sauce and pour sauce over pasta. Toss together over low heat for 1 minute. Garnish with grated cheese and sage leaves.
