In a skillet, over medium heat, cook beef until no longer pink; drain. Stir in chili sauce, soup mix and salt; set aside. In a bowl, combine flour, sesame seeds if desired and salt. Cut in shortening and cheese until crumbly. Combine milk and vinegar; gradually add to flour mixture, tossing with a fork until dough forms a ball. Divide dough in half; roll out to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut with a 2-1/2-in. round cutter. Place half of the circles 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Top each with about 1-1/2 tablespoons of beef mixture; cover with remaining circles. Moisten edges with water and press with a fork to seal. Cut a slit in the top of each. Bake at 425 degrees F for 12-16 minutes or until golden brown. Serve immediately; or cool, wrap and freeze for up to 3 months.
