Fill a large pot with lightly salted water; add lentils and bring to a rolling boil. Cook until slightly tender, about 10 minutes. Add grated carrots; cook until slightly softened, about 10 minutes. Drain lentils and carrots. Heat olive oil in the same pot over medium heat; add onions and garlic. Cook and stir until onions wilt and become transparent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in lentils and carrots and reduce heat to medium-low. Add enough water to the pot to keep the lentil mixture from drying out. Sprinkle cumin, cayenne, curry powder, salt, and pepper over lentils; stir until heated through and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Serve over rice.
