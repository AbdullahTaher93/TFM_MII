Cut each sausage into 3 sections; set aside. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add green pepper and onion; cook, stirring frequently for 3-4 minutes or until tender. Stir in beans, brown sugar, ketchup, mustard and sausage. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce heat to medium. Cook 10-12 minutes or until sausages are hot.
