Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until soft, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle the mustard over the mixture and stir it in. Reserve about a 1/2 cup of the cauliflower florets; set aside. Add the rest to the saucepan together with the milk, stock, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat. Cover and simmer until the cauliflower is tender, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a nonstick skillet. Break the reserved cauliflower into tiny florets and fry until lightly brown, stirring frequently, 4 to 5 minutes; set aside. Remove the bay leaf from the soup. Puree the soup in the pan with a hand-held blender, or in a blender or food processor. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then reheat until just bubbling. Remove from the heat, add the grated cheese, and stir until it melts. Ladle into 4 warmed soup bowls and sprinkle with the sauteed cauliflower florets and parsley.
