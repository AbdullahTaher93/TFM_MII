Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Stir chicken, cream of chicken soup, roasted red peppers, salsa, sour cream, green onions, and chili powder together in a 12x8-inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 15 minutes. Remove dish from oven and stir. Separate the breadsticks into 16 strips. Arrange the strips, lattice-style, over the chicken mixture, overlapping strips as necessary to fit the dish. Bake in the preheated oven until breadsticks are golden, about 15 minutes more.
