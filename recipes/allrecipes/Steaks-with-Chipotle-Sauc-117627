Chop one chipotle pepper; place in a bowl. Add 1 teaspoon of the adobo sauce. Stir in sour cream and cilantro; refrigerate. (Save remaining peppers and sauce for another use.) Grill steaks, uncovered, over medium-hot heat for 6-10 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F). Serve with sauce.
