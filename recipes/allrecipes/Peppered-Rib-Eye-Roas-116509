Combine the pepper and cardamom; rub over roasts. Place each in a shallow baking dish. In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, vinegar, tomato paste, garlic powder and paprika. Pour over the roasts; turn several times. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Place each roast in a roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 2 hours or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F).
