Combine garlic and chili powder; rub over both sides of steak. If grilling the steak, coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill. Grill steak, covered, over medium heat or broil 4 in. from the heat for 5-7 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done 170 degrees F). When cool enough to handle, slice meat across the grain into thin strips; place in a large bowl. Add the romaine, peas, red pepper, olives, chilies, onions and cilantro. In a small bowl, combine the remaining ingredients. Pour over salad and toss to coat.
