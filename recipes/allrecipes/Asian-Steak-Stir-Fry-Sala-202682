Whisk together the peanut oil, soy sauce, and pepper in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the steak, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours. Cook and stir the steak and the marinade in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the bell pepper, onion, green onion, ginger, and serrano pepper. Cook until the steak is evenly brown. Serve over a bed of spinach with the balsamic vinaigrette.
