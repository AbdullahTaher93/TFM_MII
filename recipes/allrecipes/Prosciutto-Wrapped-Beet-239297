Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk olive oil, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Toss beets in olive oil mixture. Wrap each beet in aluminum foil and place on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour. Remove from foil and cool to room temperature. Cut cooked beets into 16 rectangular chunks. Place 1 teaspoon goat cheese in the center of each slice of prosciutto; top cheese with 1 beet chunk. Roll prosciutto around beets.
