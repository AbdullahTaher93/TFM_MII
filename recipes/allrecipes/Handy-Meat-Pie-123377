In a large skillet, brown beef and sausage over medium heat; drain. Add onions and garlic; cook until tender. Stir in parsley, water, flour, baking powder, salt and pepper. Heat through. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. On a floured surface, pat 10 biscuits into 4-in. circles. Top each with about 1/3 cup of the meat mixture. Pat remaining biscuits into 5-in. circles and place over filling; seal edges with water. Press edges together with a fork dipped in flour; pierce the top. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until golden brown and filling is hot.
