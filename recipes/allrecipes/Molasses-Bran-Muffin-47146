Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 12 cup muffin pan. In a medium bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, and salt. In a separate medium bowl, mix skim milk, molasses, egg, and vegetable oil. Mix in the bran cereal. Thoroughly stir in the flour mixture. Transfer to the prepared muffin pan. Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until a knife inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.
