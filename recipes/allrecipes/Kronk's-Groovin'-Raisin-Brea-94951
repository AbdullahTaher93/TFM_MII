In a mixing bowl, dissolve brown sugar in warm water. Sprinkle yeast over the water. Set aside for 5 to 10 minutes. When the yeast mixture resembles a creamy foam, add 2 tablespoons oil. Use the bread hook attachment on your electric mixer to mix in bread flour to form a soft dough. Transfer dough to a well oiled bowl, and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a clean, damp cloth. Set aside for approximately one hour, or until doubled in size. Add raisins to bowl, and use your hands to mix the raisins into the dough. Divide dough into 4 roughly equal pieces. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead dough until raisins are thoroughly incorporated. Form dough into balls, place on a baking sheet, and flatten slightly. Brush with butter or oil, and use a butter knife to make three shallow, parallel cuts into the tops of the dough. Cover with a clean, damp cloth. Set aside for 45 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake raisin bread for 30 minutes, or until golden brown and baked through.
