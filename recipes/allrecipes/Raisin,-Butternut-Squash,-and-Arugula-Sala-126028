Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; set aside. In a medium bowl combine melted butter, brown sugar, and cayenne pepper. Toss butternut (if using frozen butternut follow package instructions for proper thawing) with butter, brown sugar and cayenne mixture. Transfer to prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes, until just tender. Remove and let cool. In a large bowl, slowly whisk walnut oil into lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Toss arugula or spinach in vinaigrette. To serve, divide dressed greens among serving plates. Top each with 1/2 cups roasted butternut squash, 1/4 cup Sun-Maid(R) Natural Raisins, and 1 tablespoon crumbled blue cheese. Serve immediately.
