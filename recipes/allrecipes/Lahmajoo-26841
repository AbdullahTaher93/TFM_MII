In a small bowl, mix active dry yeast, 1 tablespoon sugar and 1/2 cup warm water. Allow to stand approximately 5 minutes. In a large bowl, mix flour, salt, 3 tablespoons shortening, remaining sugar, remaining water and the yeast preparation. Knead until smooth. Use the remaining shortening to remove any dough sticking to the sides of the bowl, and to remove dough from fingers. Cover with a towel and place in a warm location until doubled in size, about 2 to 3 hours. In a medium bowl, mix ground beef, tomatoes, onions, parsley, green bell pepper, salt, cayenne pepper and black pepper. Chill in the refrigerator until ready to use. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly flour a large baking sheet. On a lightly floured surface, form dough into 12 balls. Separate each ball in half. Roll halves into balls. Place balls on the prepared baking sheet. Allow to stand approximately 10 minutes. Roll balls into 7 inch diameter circles. Spread approximately 1 1/2 tablespoons meat mixture over each circle. Bake in the preheated oven 15 to 20 minutes, or until beef is no longer pink and dough is lightly browned.
