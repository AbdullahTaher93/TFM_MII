Combine water and buckwheat in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover the saucepan, and simmer until the buckwheat is firm yet tender to the bite, about 8 minutes. Rinse buckwheat under cold water and drain. Stir avocado, cherry tomatoes, lime juice, red onion, olive oil, parsley, fennel seed, cayenne pepper, and mixed pepper together in a large bowl until evenly combined. Add buckwheat groats and stir gently; top with goat cheese.
