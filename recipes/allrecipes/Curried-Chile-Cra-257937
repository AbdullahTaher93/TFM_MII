Place crabs in a bowl and drizzle rice wine on top. Let marinate for 5 minutes. Heat oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Cook and stir crabs until coated with oil, 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and ginger; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in red bell pepper and red chile peppers; cook until slightly softened, about 1 minute. Pour coconut milk into the wok; add curry powder. Bring to a simmer. Mix water and cornstarch in a small bowl until cornstarch is dissolved; stir into the wok. Cook and stir until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.
