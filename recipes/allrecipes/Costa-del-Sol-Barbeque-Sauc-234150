Combine ketchup, brown sugar, red onion, honey, vinegar, butter, red chile pepper, garlic, cayenne pepper, paprika, salt, and black pepper in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is slightly thickened, about 20 minutes. Blend with a hand blender until smooth.
