Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour a 9-inch round cake pan. Line with waxed paper. Butter the paper. Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl. Beat the butter, sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until creamy. Add the eggs, one at a time, until just blended after each addition. With mixer at low speed, gradually beat in the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 45-55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes. Turn out onto a rack. Carefully remove the waxed paper and let cool completely.
