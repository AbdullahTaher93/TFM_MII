Two days before frying, set up a large deep fryer with burner base and propane tank, meant for frying turkey, according to manufacturer's instructions. Measure the amount of oil needed by placing the wrapped turkey in the pot and filling the pot with water to cover the turkey by 1 inch. Remove the turkey and mark the water level on the side of the pot. Combine all ingredients, except turkey and oil, in a large saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes. Cool. Following package instructions, fill the injector that comes with turkey fry kit with butter mixture; inject butter mixture in turkey all over. Refrigerate turkey for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours before frying. Fill the fryer with oil up to the marked line, attach a deep fry thermometer to the pot, and heat oil to 350 degrees F. Put the turkey on the fry stand, attach to the metal hanger that comes with kit, and slowly lower into the hot oil. Cook turkey 4 minutes per pound; when done, turkey will float to the surface. Meat should register 180 degrees F on meat thermometer. Let turkey rest for at least 20 minutes before carving. You can also use the butter mixture to baste a turkey in a 325 degrees F oven every 20 minutes until an internal temperature of 180 degrees F is reached.
