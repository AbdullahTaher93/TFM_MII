In a 4-quart pot, bring the water and broth to a boil; reduce heat to keep simmering. In a heavy 6-quart pot, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over high heat without burning butter; add prawns, vinegar, lemon zest, and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Cook and stir until prawns turn pink and translucent, 1 to 2 minutes; use a slotted spoon to transfer to a bowl. Pour cooking liquid into a separate bowl; set aside prawns and liquid. In the same 6-quart pot, melt remaining butter over medium-low heat. Add onion, garlic, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt; stir frequently until very tender, about 5 minutes. Add rice; cook and stir 3 minutes without browning. Stir in liquid from prawns and 3 cups of the hot broth/water. Start timing now (20 to 22 minutes for Arborio; 16 to 17 minutes for medium grain). Cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently and adding 1/2 to 1 cup broth/water when liquid is almost gone (do not let rice get dry); repeat until rice is al dente (slightly chewy, not chalky). Taste rice near end of cooking to avoid overcooking. Stir in prawns and cheese. Add more broth/water, as needed, until rice is creamy and slightly soupy; adjust salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
