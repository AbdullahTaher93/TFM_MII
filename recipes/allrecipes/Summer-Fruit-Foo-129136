Reserve about 2 ounces of the mixed fruit for decoration. Put the remaining mixed fruit in a saucepan with 2 tablespoons water. Bring just to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until soft and very juicy, about 5 minutes. Stir in the sugar. Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly. Pour into a food processor or blender and puree. Press the puree through a fine nylon strainer to remove all the seeds. Alternatively, just press the fruit through a fine nylon strainer to puree it; set aside to cool completely. Whip the cream with the grated orange zest until thick. Add the yogurt and lightly whip into the cream, then stir in the cooled fruit puree. Spoon into 4 dessert dishes or goblets. Chill well before serving, decorated with the reserved berries and orange zest, if you like.
