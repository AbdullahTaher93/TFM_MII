Melt butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir leeks into the butter and season with salt and black pepper; cook and stir until the leeks are tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir flour into the leek mixture until dissolved completely and the mixture begins to thicken; add half-and-half, potatoes, and clam juice. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer for 10 minutes. Stir shrimp and corn into the potato mixture; continue cooking until the potatoes are completely tender, about 10 minutes more. Remove pot from heat, add lemon juice and chives, and stir.
