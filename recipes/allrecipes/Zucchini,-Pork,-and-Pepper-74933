In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground pork until evenly browned. Mix the zucchini, Hungarian hot peppers, and green bell peppers into the skillet. Season with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Stir in the spaghetti sauce, and simmer 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve on Italian bread slices.
