Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. In medium bowl mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and spices. Add cold butter and mix until well combined. In large bowl whisk together 1/4 cup of heavy cream, yogurt, egg and extract. Slowly add to dry ingredients and mix until well combined. Add coconut and stir in diced peaches and combine. Transfer dough to well-floured surface and pat into small disk (about 1/2-inch thick). Cut into 6 to 8 pieces and transfer to baking sheet. Brush scones with additional heavy cream. Bake for 16 to 18 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool. In small bowl add powdered sugar and reserved peach juice. Stir until it forms a liquid and drizzle over scones.
