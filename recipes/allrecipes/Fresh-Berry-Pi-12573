In a large saucepan combine gelatin power, cornstarch, sugar and boiling water. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until mixture boils and thickens. Let cool to room temperature while you prepare the berries. Add berries to the cooled gelatin mixture. Stir gently to coat, then pour all into crust. Chill uncovered for 1 hour, then cover and store in refrigerator.
