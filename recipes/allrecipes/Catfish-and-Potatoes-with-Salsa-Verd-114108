Put the parsley, capers, garlic, lemon juice, anchovy paste, mustard, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a blender. Pulse to chop. With the machine running, add 7 tablespoons of the oil in a thin stream to make a smooth puree. Put the potatoes in a medium saucepan of salted water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain. Light the grill or heat the broiler. Coat the fish with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Grill or broil the fish for 3 minutes. Turn and cook until just done, 3 to 4 minutes longer. To serve, drizzle some of the salsa verde over the fish and potatoes. Serve the remaining salsa verde alongside.
