In a saucepan, combine the reserved cherry juice with the cola. Bring to a boil, and stir in the gelatin until dissolved. Remove from the heat, and mix in the drained cherries, drained pineapple, and chopped pecans. Pour mixture into a mold sprayed with non-stick cooking spray, and refrigerate for at least 24 hours before serving.
