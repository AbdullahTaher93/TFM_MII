Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with nonstick spray; set aside. Whisk together sugar, milk, cream, eggs, and cinnamon until completely combined. Place bread in a large bowl. Pour milk mixture over bread, stirring gently. Set aside 20 to 30 minutes, occasionally pressing bread into milk mixture to soak completely. Gently stir white chocolate chips and cranberries into mixture. Pour mixture into prepared baking dish, spreading evenly. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake 30 minutes, then uncover and bake 10 to 15 minutes longer, or until bread pudding is firm and top is golden brown. Serve with whipped cream.
