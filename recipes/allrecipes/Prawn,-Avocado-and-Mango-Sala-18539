Prepare the dressing in a medium bowl by whisking together the oil, vinegar, ginger, honey, mustard seed, lemon juice, chives and dill. Cover and refrigerate until chilled. Place a mound of shredded lettuce in the center of each plate. Arrange the avocado, mango and prawns around the rim of the plate. Sprinkle mushrooms over all. Pour enough dressing over all to coat; serve with fresh bread and butter if desired.
