Coat a large skillet with nonstick spray. Warm over medium-high heat. Add onion, zucchini, yellow squash, and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, 7 minutes, or until vegetables are tender. Spread beans evenly onto each tortilla. Spoon vegetables evenly onto 4 of the bean-covered tortillas. Sprinkle cheese over vegetables. Top with remaining bean-covered tortillas. Place a quesadilla in the skillet. Cover and cook over low heat for 5 minutes, turning once, or until heated through. Repeat with remaining quesadillas. Cut into wedges. Serve with salsa.
