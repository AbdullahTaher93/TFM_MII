Bring the rice and water to a boil together in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 35 to 40 minutes. When the rice is nearly done cooking, heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Cook the onion in the hot oil until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chicken, garlic, and ginger to the skillet and continue cooking and stirring until the chicken is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Fold the mushrooms, asparagus, bell peppers, and fish sauce into the chicken mixture; continue cooking just until hot, about 5 minutes. Crack the egg, and scramble it into the mixture. Add the basil leaves to the mixture; cook until the leaves wilt slightly, about 30 seconds. Remove pan from heat immediately. Serve over the basmati rice; garnish with the cilantro and sesame seeds and a drizzle of the tamari soy sauce.
