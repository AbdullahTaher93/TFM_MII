Heat oven to 375 degrees F. On 15x10-inch baking pan with sides, toss sweet potatoes and apples with oil, salt and pepper. Spread into single layer. Roast 30 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Meanwhile, stir together brown sugar, butter and pumpkin pie spice. Spoon over potato mixture and toss, using two forks, to coat. Continue roasting an additional 10 minutes or until sugar has melted.
