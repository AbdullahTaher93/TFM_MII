Find a decorative bottle with a pourer and a lid. Carefully slide the bay leaves into the top of the bottle. Try not to break the leaves. Pour the remaining dry ingredients in to the bottle. Fill with olive oil. Let rest for a couple days to allow the ingredients to come together. Serve as dip for bread, use as salad dressing, or toss on chicken for a great marinade.
