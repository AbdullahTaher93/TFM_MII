Make a strong infusion by pouring the boiling water over the parsley. Let stand for 15 minutes. Strain out bits of parsley, and reserve liquid in a glass or stainless steel saucepan. Stir the honey and vinegar into the parsley water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the pectin, and continue to boil, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Remove from heat, and skim off any foam from the top. Transfer to sterile jars, and seal in a hot water bath.
