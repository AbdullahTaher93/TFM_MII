Beat together the white sugar and butter. Add the eggs and 1 teaspoon vanilla. In a separate bowl, combine the flour and baking powder. Add the flour mixture alternately with the milk. Pour into greased and floured 9 x 13 pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes or until tests done. To Make Frosting: Beat together with an electric mixer the brown sugar, egg whites, water and salt. Place in a double boiler over rapidly boiling water, stirring constantly. Cook 10 minutes or until frosting will stand in peaks. Remove from heat and add 1 teaspoon vanilla. Beat until thick. Spread on cake. Decorating: Place one large raisin in each corner. Then place toasted almonds, toasted pecans, red and green cherries all over the cake.
