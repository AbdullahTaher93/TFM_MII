Place romaine hearts on large rimmed tray and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with Garlic Salt. Turn romaine on tray to coat evenly with oil and Garlic Salt. Heat grill to medium high. Place romaine on grill and grill for 3 to 4 minutes, turning several times to get some color on the romaine. Serve romaine hearts whole (or roughly chop across the heads every two inches, discarding cores). Squeeze fresh lemon juice over salad and toss with shaved Parmesan and croutons.
