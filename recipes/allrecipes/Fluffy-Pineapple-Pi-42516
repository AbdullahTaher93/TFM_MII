Drain pineapple, reserving 1/2 cup juice (discard the remaining juice or save for another use). Set the pineapple aside. In a large microwave-safe bowl, combine juice and marshmallows. Microwave on high for 1 minute; stir. Microwave 1 minute longer or until mixture is smooth. Refrigerate for 30 minutes or until slightly thickened and cooled, stirring occasionally. Fold in whipped topping and pineapple. Pour into the crust. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until firm. Garnish with cherries if desired.
