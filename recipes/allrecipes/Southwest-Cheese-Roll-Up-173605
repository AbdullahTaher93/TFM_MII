In a medium bowl, combine cheese, corn, red pepper, onion, seasoning and hot sauce if used. Mix. Set aside. Spread each tortilla with half the refried beans, leaving a 1-inch edge without beans. Top each tortilla with lettuce, chicken (if used), and cheese-corn mixture, dividing equally. Fold each tortilla about 1 inch on two opposite sides toward the inside, then roll. Wrap well in plastic wrap, and pack to carry.
