Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cook two boxes of Horizon ClassicMac Pasta Shells & White Cheddar Cheese according to the instructions on the side of the box. Cook pasta to the al dente (firm) stage. Do not add the cheese at this time. On stovetop, heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Place olive oil in skillet then add parsnips, carrots and onions. Stirring occasionally, saute for 3 minutes until vegetables have softened. Add pancetta to skillet and stir. Cook for 1 minute. Add cheese to skillet. Cook until cheese has melted. Fold vegetables, pancetta and cheese mixture into the pasta. Spoon into a large ovenproof casserole dish or into four large souffle ramekins. (Ramekins can be placed on a cookie sheet.) Bake 10 minutes. Remove and serve.
