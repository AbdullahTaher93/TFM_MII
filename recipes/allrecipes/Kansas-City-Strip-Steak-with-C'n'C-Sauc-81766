Sliver the onions and peppers as you would for fajitas. Gather your ingredients and have them ready before starting the steak. It takes about the same time to make the sauce as it does to cook the steaks. Dust the steaks with the steak seasoning and salt on both sides. The steaks can be grilled, broiled or pan fried. In any case, sear the steaks on both sides for several minutes and then let them finish in a 300 degree F oven or with indirect heat on the grill. Meanwhile; in a saute pan over medium-high heat, melt 1 Tbsp of the butter and add the onions and peppers. Saute for 2 or 3 minutes. Add the vermouth and let the alcohol boil off for a minute. Then add the remaining butter, Worcestershire sauce, balsamic vinegar and Kitchen Bouquet. If you did not pan fry then also add a pinch of salt and a pinch of the steak seasoning mix. Reduce heat to a simmer until the steaks are ready. Serve the steaks whole or sliced. Smother steaks with the sauce!
