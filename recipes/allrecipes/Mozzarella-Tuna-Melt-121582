In a small bowl, combine the tuna, celery, onion and mayonnaise. Spread on bottom of buns; set bun tops aside. Top tuna mixture with a slice of cheese and tomato. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until heated through and cheese is melted. Top each with a lettuce leaf; replace bun tops.
