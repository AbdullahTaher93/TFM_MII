Heat grill. Cut unpeeled bananas in half crosswise. Cut the halves lengthwise, so each piece has one side with skin still on. Brush cut sides with butter. Place bananas on grill, cut side down, over medium heat. Cook 1 to 3 minutes or until bananas have grill marks. Use tongs to turn bananas and cook an additional 3 to 4 minutes or until bananas are tender and beginning to pull away from skin. Place cake slices on serving plates. Scoop bananas onto cake and drizzle with caramel sauce.
