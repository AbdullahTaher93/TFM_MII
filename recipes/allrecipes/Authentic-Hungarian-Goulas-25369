Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium high heat. Saute onions until soft, then add beef and brown. Stir in caraway seed, marjoram, garlic and paprika. Pour water over all, lower heat to low and simmer for 2 1/2 hours. Add potatoes and cook until tender, another 45 minutes to 1 hour. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve.
