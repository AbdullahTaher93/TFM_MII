Stir corn starch, brown sugar and crushed red pepper together in a small saucepan OR 1-quart microwaveable dish. Add remaining ingredients; stir well. Cook over medium heat (OR microwave on HIGH (100%) for 2 minutes) stirring occasionally. Heat until mixture boils for 1 full minute. Cook and stir an additional 1 to 2 minutes, or until thickened to a syrup-like consistency. Drizzle over your favorite stir-fry just before serving. Also delicious as a glaze for grilled meats.
