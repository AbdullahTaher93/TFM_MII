Sift self-rising flour into a bowl; stir in milk. Squeeze excess moisture from the grated potatoes and mix in. Season with salt and pepper. Melt 1 1/2 teaspoon butter with 1 teaspoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Spread a quarter of the potato mixture in the skillet; cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Repeat 3 times with remaining butter, oil, and potato mixture. Stack potato pancakes on a plate and keep warm. Mix all-purpose flour, mixed herbs, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Roll liver strips in the flour mixture until evenly coated. Heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil in the skillet. Cook and stir liver strips in the hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Cook bacon slices in the same skillet, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add cabbage; cook until wilted, about 3 minutes. Drain. Serve warm potatoes pancakes topped with liver, bacon, and cabbage. Season with black pepper.
