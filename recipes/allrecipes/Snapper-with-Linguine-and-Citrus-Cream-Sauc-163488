Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the shallot and garlic, and cook for 30 seconds. Pour in the vodka, and simmer for 1 minute. Add the lemon juice, lime juice, fish sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, fennel seeds, basil, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 teaspoon orange zest, and cream. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium-low, and continue to simmer until the sauce has reduced by half, 10 to 15 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the linguine, and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain. Meanwhile, season the snapper fillets with salt and pepper, then dredge in the flour. Shake off the excess, and set aside. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the snapper fillets on both sides in the hot oil until nicely browned, and no longer transparent in the center, about 4 minutes per side. To serve, toss the drained linguine with half of the sauce, and divide onto 4 plates. Place a snapper fillet onto each plate, and ladle on the remaining sauce. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon orange zest to garnish.
