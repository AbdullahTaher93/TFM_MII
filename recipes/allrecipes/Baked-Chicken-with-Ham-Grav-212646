Place the chicken into a 3-quart shallow baking dish. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes. Pour off any fat. Arrange the ham around the chicken in the baking dish. Stir the soup, sour cream, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika and black pepper in a small bowl. Spoon the soup mixture over all. Bake for 30 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Remove the chicken to a serving platter. Stir the sauce and serve with the chicken and potatoes.
