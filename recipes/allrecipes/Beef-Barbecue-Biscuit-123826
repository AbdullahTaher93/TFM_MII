In a skillet, brown beef; drain. Add barbecue sauce, onion and brown sugar; set aside. Separate dough into 10 biscuits; flatten into 5-in. circles. Press firmly into the bottom and up the sides of greased muffin cups. Spoon 2 tablespoons of beef mixture into each cup; sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or until biscuits are golden and cheese is melted.
