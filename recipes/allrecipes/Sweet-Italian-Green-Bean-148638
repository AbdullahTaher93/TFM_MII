Cook bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crisp. Remove from the pan to drain on paper towels. Reserve the grease in the skillet and add the onions; cook and stir over medium heat until softened. Add garlic and cook for about 30 seconds more. Remove from the heat. In a saucepan, combine the green beans, tomatoes, basil, oregano and brown sugar. Crumble in the bacon and add the onion and garlic from the skillet. Warm over medium heat until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.
