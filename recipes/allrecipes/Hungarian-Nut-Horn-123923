Dissolve yeast in water; set aside. In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Cut in butter with pastry blender or hands. Add egg yolks, sour cream and vanilla and yeast mixture. Mix well with hands (dough will not be sticky). For filling, beat egg whites until very stiff but not dry. Gradually add sugar and continue beating until stiff. Fold in walnuts and vanilla. Divide dough into eight parts. On a pastry cloth heavily covered with confectioners' sugar, roll one part into a 12-in.-diameter circle. Cut into 12 wedges. Spread 1 teaspoon filling on each wedge; tuck in edges of wide end and roll up toward narrow point. Repeat with remaining dough and filling, replenishing confectioners' sugar on pastry cloth to prevent sticking. Place on parchment paper-line baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until very light brown.
