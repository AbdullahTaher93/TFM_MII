Place frozen potatoes in a large self-sealing plastic bag. Combine oil, garlic, paprika and Morton(R) Kosher Salt. Drizzle over potato wedges. Seal bag and shake to coat potatoes. Lightly grease a 15x10x1-inch baking pan with non-stick cooking spray. Arrange potatoes in single layer in prepared pan. Bake potatoes according to package directions, turning once. In a separate bowl combine cheese and croutons. Sprinkle over potatoes, continue to bake an additional 10 to 15 minutes to crisp topping. To maintain crisp texture, serve potatoes in a single layer.
