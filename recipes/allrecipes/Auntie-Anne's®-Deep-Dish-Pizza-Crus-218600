In a large bowl, dissolve contents of 1 yeast packet in 1 1/4 cups lukewarm tap water (105 degrees F). Add dough mix to yeast/water mixture. Using a rubber spatula (or your hands), mix until dough ball forms.* Turn dough ball onto lightly floured surface and knead until soft, slightly tacky dough is formed (approximately 5-7 minutes). Add a small amount of flour if dough is too sticky. Place dough ball into a large bowl that has been coated with nonstick spray. Coat a sheet of plastic wrap with nonstick spray and place on top of dough ball, tucking sides down around dough (to prevent dough from drying out). Place bowl in a warm spot (85-95 degrees F) for 30 minutes so the dough can rest (i.e., place bowl by a sunny window, on top of or near a warm oven, or on top of a refrigerator). Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray pizza pan with nonstick spray and dust with flour so the dough won't stick. Place dough ball in center of pan and gently stretch the dough out to the edge. Press edges up the side of the pan to contain sauce. Pour pizza sauce in center of stretched dough and spread evenly, leaving an inch of uncovered dough around the edge. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella over the sauce. *Optional: add your favorite seasonings, meats, or vegetable toppings. Place pizza on bottom rack of oven and bake 20-25 minutes or until the cheese starts to bubble and the bottom crust is crisp. Let baked pizza cool for 5 minutes before serving.
