Spread butter over the bottom of an 8-in. square baking dish. Sprinkle with gingersnap crumbs; press down gently. Set aside. Cut each apple into 16 wedges. In a large skillet, saute apples in butter until crisp-tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat; cool for 10 minutes. Combine the sugar, cinnamon and ginger; sprinkle over apples and mix well. Place blueberries in a bowl. Sprinkle with lemon juice and orange peel; toss gently to mix well. For topping, combine flour and brown sugar in a bowl; cut in butter until crumbly. Spoon apple mixture into prepared baking dish. Top with blueberry mixture and topping (dish will be full). Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until bubbly.
