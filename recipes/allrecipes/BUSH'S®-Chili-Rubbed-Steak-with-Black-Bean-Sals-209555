Heat the oil in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add the corn and onion, raise the heat to medium-high, and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the corn is caramelized and golden and the onions are soft, about 7 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, stir together the beans, kiwi, cilantro, half of the lime zest, lime juice, honey, chili powder, salt, and pepper to taste. Add the cooked vegetables and stir to combine. Place in the refrigerator and chill. For the steak, prepare the rub in a small bowl by stirring together the brown sugar, chili powder, salt, pepper, garlic powder, cinnamon and the rest of the lime zest. Mix in the canola oil. Use a spoon to press the paste evenly onto each side of the steak. Preheat the grill to high. Reduce the heat to medium. Place the meat on the grill and cook, uncovered, until cooked to medium-rare to medium doneness, turning occasionally, 19 to 21 minutes. Carve the meat across the grain into thin slices and serve with the bean salsa.
