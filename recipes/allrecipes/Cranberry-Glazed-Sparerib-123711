Place ribs on a rack in a foil-lined shallow roasting pan. Broil 6 in. from the heat for 12-20 minutes per side or until browned. Remove ribs from rack; drain drippings. Return ribs to pan. Combine brown sugar, flour, salt, mustard and cloves in a saucepan; gradually add cranberry juice, stirring until smooth. Add water, vinegar and lemon juice. Bring to a boil; boil and stir for 2 minutes. Pour over ribs. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake 20-30 minutes longer or until ribs are tender.
