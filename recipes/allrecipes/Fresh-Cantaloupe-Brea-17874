Place 1 1/2 cups cantaloupe cubes in a blender or food processor and puree. Reserve remaining 3/4 cup cantaloupe cubes. Place yeast, flour, gluten, milk powder, sugar, salt, paprika, egg, butter, orange zest, cantaloupe cubes and cantaloupe puree in the pan of the bread machine. Select White Bread cycle; press Start. This is a soft, sticky dough. If any of it clings to the sides of the pan at the end of the first kneading, you can push it down with a rubber spatula. Let cool, cut into thin slices and serve toasted with cream cheese.
