Drizzle some EVOO over the steaks and season with salt and pepper. Get a large nonstick skillet screaming hot and add the meat. Cook the meat over high heat for 3 minutes on each side for medium rare, 4 for medium to medium-well. Remove the meat from the skillet and pull the pan off the heat to cool. Drizzle some EVOO over the scallops and season them with salt and pepper. Get another large skillet screaming hot and cook the scallops over high heat for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until caramelized. Bring 2 inches of water to a boil in a medium skillet. Return the meat pan to medium heat and add the EVOO, 1 turn of the pan. Add the shallot and garlic and cook for 2 minutes. Add the vermouth and reduce by half, about 30 seconds. Add the butter to the pan to finish the Manhattan sauce. Add the asparagus to the boiling water and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the asparagus and dress with the lemon juice and a drizzle of EVOO; season with salt and pepper. Place 2 steaks on each plate and drizzle with the Manhattan sauce. Place 2 scallops on top of each of the steaks and garnish with the chives. Serve the asparagus alongside.
