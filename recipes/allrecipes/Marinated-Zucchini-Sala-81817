Slice or cube the zucchini. Slice or quarter the mushrooms. Add both to a non-metallic mixing bowl. Drain off the liquids from the olives and artichoke hearts (or bottoms). Cut the artichoke into slices. Add the slice olives, artichoke and minced scallions to the bowl. Pour in the dressing and toss. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours - overnight is better.
