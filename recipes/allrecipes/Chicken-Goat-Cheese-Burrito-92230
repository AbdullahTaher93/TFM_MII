Cut chicken into 1/2- by 3-inch strips. Put chicken pieces in a bowl and coat evenly with cumin, salt, and pepper. Seal tortillas in foil and warm in a 350 degrees oven until hot, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, place beans and their liquid in a 1-quart pan and cook over medium-high heat until bubbling, about 5 minutes. In a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat, stir chicken and oil frequently until meat is no longer pink in center, about 6 minutes. Lay tortillas flat. Toward 1 edge, fill each with 1/4 of the chicken, beans (including most of liquid), and cheese, and 2 tablespoons of the salsa. Fold over sides and roll up tightly to enclose. Add more salsa to taste.
