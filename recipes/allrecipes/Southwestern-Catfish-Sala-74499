To prepare the catfish, mix lime juice, cilantro, jalapeno, garlic, salt, and olive oil in a non-corrosive, small bowl. Mix using a wire whisk until well blended. Place catfish strips in a shallow dish. Pour half of the lime juice mixture over catfish. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes to marinate. Reserve the other half of marinade to use for salad dressing. Preheat the broiler. Place marinated catfish strips on broiler pan rack and broil for 4 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. To assemble the salads, line 4 salad plates with salad greens. Arrange catfish strips, tomato wedges, and avocado slices over greens and top with corn. Drizzle reserved marinade over each plate and serve.
