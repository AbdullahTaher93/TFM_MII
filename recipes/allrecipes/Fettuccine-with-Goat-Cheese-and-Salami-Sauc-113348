In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the fettuccine until just done, about 12 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large pot, melt the butter over low heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Raise the heat to moderately low. Add the broth; bring to a simmer. Stir in the cream and bring just back to a simmer. Add the goat cheese and whisk until smooth. Stir in the salami, basil, and the pepper. Drain the fettuccine and add to the sauce. Heat, stirring, over very low heat for 1 to 2 minutes, to allow the pasta to absorb some of the sauce.
