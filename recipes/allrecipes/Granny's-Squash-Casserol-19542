Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add squash and onion; cook until tender but still firm. Drain. In a large bowl, mix the squash, onion, cream of chicken soup, sour cream, butter, grated carrots, Cheddar cheese, pimento peppers, salt and pepper. Pour mixture into a medium baking dish and sprinkle the top with the Italian-style salad dressing mix. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes.
