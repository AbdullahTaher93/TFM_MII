Blend yogurt and almonds together in a food processor or blender until a smooth, creamy paste forms. Heat a large, wide-bottomed pan over medium heat; add ghee and allow to melt. Cook and stir yellow onions in the hot ghee until evenly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Add lamb; cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly browned, about 6 minutes. Mix cayenne pepper and salt into lamb mixture; cook for 2 minutes. Stir yogurt-almond paste into lamb mixture; add water. Bring mixture to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until meat is very tender, 2 to 3 hours. Stir garam masala, cardamom, and mace into lamb korma and simmer for 10 minutes more. Mix red onions and cilantro together in a bowl; add lemon juice and salt and mix well. Serve salad alongside lamb korma.
