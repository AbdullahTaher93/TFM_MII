In a medium bowl, combine cabbage, 1/4 cup salsa and sour cream; mix well and set aside. Cut fish fillets crosswise into 1/2-inch thick strips. Sprinkle chili powder over fish. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. Add fish (cook in 2 batches if necessary); cook 2 to 3 minutes per side or until fish is opaque in center. Fill warm tortillas with fish, half the cheese, remaining 1/2 cup salsa, cabbage mixture and remaining cheese. Serve with lime wedges if desired.
