Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8x3 inch loaf pans. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and baking soda; set aside. Mash the bananas, eggs, sugar, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and cloves together in a large bowl with a fork until well combined. Stir in the melted butter and vanilla extract, then fold in the flour mixture until a batter forms and no dry lumps remain. Pour into the prepared loaf pans. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove from the pan, and allow to cool completely on a wire rack.
