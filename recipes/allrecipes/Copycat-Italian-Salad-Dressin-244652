Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and add red bell pepper. Roast red bell pepper under the broiler until slightly blackened, about 12 minutes. Transfer bell pepper to a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap for about 10 minutes. Carefully remove plastic wrap and peel skin from bell pepper. Blend roasted red pepper, oil, water, vinegar, sugar, basil, lemon juice, minced onion, and salt in a blender until smooth.
