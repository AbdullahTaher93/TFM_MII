In a small frying pan, toast the pine nuts over moderately low heat, stirring frequently, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Or toast them in a 350 degrees F oven for 5 to 10 minutes. In a large frying pan, heat the oil over moderately low heat. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, stirring, about 30 seconds. Increase the heat to moderate. Add the cauliflower, tomatoes, raisins, water, and salt and bring the sauce to a simmer. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the cauliflower is very tender, about 10 minutes. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the rigatoni until just done, about 14 minutes. Drain the rigatoni and toss with the pine nuts, cauliflower sauce, basil, Parmesan, and pepper. Serve with additional Parmesan.
