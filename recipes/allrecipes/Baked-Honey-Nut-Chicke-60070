Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a bowl, beat eggs and honey together until thoroughly blended. In a separate bowl, toss together pecans, bread crumbs, salt, and pepper. Dip chicken pieces in egg and honey mixture, then dredge in pecan mixture, coating thoroughly. Arrange chicken side by side in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Drizzle melted butter evenly over chicken. Bake approximately 40 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink, and juices run clear.
