Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Peel the potatoes and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Cut asparagus into 2-inch lengths. Add asparagus to boiling water and cook until bright green, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer asparagus to a colander and rinse under cold running water until cool; drain. Add sliced potatoes to boiling water and cook until barely tender when pierced, about 10 minutes. Drain. Butter a 9- by 13-inch rectangular baking dish or a large oval gratin dish. Layer 1/3 of the potato slices in the dish and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add half the asparagus and 1/3 of the cheese. Top with another 1/3 of the potatoes, salt and pepper, the remaining asparagus, and another 1/3 of the cheese. Top with remaining potatoes. (You should still have 1/3 of the cheese.) In small bowl, stir together cream, thyme, and nutmeg. Pour mixture over potatoes and sprinkle with remaining cheese. If making ahead, cover with aluminum foil and refrigerate up to one day. At least two hours before baking, remove dish from the refrigerator and let food warm to room temperature. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake until top browns and potatoes are tender when pierced, about 30 minutes more. Let stand for 15 minutes to firm up slightly before serving.
