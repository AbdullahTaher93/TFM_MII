Combine pineapple, bell pepper, cilantro, green onions, and lime juice in medium bowl; set aside. In another bowl, coat scallops with oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat a heavy non-stick skillet over high heat until very hot. Add scallops to the hot skillet; cook, turning once, until scallops are well seared on both sides and cooked through, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer scallops to a plate; set aside. Pour salsa into the hot skillet; cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Serve scallops with warm salsa alongside.
