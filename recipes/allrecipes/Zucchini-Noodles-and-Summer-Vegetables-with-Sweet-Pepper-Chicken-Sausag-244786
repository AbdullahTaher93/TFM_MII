Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook zucchini noodles (zoodles) in the boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, about 3 minutes; drain. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir green bell pepper, onion, seasoned salt, and sea salt for 3 minutes. Add chicken sausage and cook until sausage is lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Add spinach, basil, garlic paste, and seasoned salt to taste; cook until spinach is wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Place zoodles on a serving plate and toss with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and sea salt. Add sausage mixture and tomatoes and top with Parmesan cheese; season with salt and pepper.
