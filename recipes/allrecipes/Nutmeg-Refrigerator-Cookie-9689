In a large bowl, cream together the butter, white sugar and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Combine the flour, cream of tartar, salt and nutmeg; stir into the creamed mixture until well blended. Divide dough and shape into rolls 2 inches in diameter. Wrap in aluminum foil and store in refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to one week. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Slice the logs into rounds about 1/4-inch thick. Arrange the slices on a baking sheet. Bake the cookies until the edges are light brown, about 8 minutes.
