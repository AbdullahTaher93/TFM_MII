Place eggs in a single layer in a pot; add water to cover eggs plus one inch. Bring to a boil; cover and remove from heat. Let stand 15 minutes. Transfer eggs immediately to cold water to speed cooling. Tap eggs on a flat surface to break the shell and peel. Slice eggs in half lengthwise; place yolks in a small bowl and set whites aside. Mash yolks and mayonnaise together with a fork; stir in SPAM(R) with bacon, pickle, mustard, and salt. Spoon yolk mixture into egg whites. Garnish, if desired, with paprika.
