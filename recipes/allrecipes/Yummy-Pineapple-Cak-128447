Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C) or according to cake mix package directions. Coat a 13 inch x 9 inch (32.5 x 23-cm) baking dish with cooking spray. Prepare the cake mix according to package directions using egg substitute or eggs and water. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake according to package directions. Remove from the oven and cool in the pan on a rack. Poke holes all over cake with the handle of a small wooden spoon. Pour pineapple (with juice) over cake. In a large bowl, with an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add the milk, pudding mix, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Beat for 3 minutes. Pour over the pineapple. Top with the whipped topping. Decorate with the oranges, if using. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.
