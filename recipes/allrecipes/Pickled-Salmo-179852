In a large bowl, combine vinegar, lemon juice, 2 cups water, sugar, dried chilies, cardamom, garlic, mustard seeds, peppercorns, fennel, and coriander. Add the salmon and mix. Cover and chill at least 2 or up to 5 hours. Place white and red onions in a 6- to 8-quart pan. Drain marinade from fish into pan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Lay salmon on onions; cover and simmer until fish is opaque but still moist-looking in center (cut to test), about 1 minute. Transfer fish and onion mixture to a large bowl. Let cool, then cover and chill at least 2 hours or up to 5 days. To serve, lift salmon and onion slices from pickling liquid to a platter with a slotted spoon.
