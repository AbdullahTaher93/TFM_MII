Combine peach preserves, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl. Mix ginger, cinnamon, salt, and pepper; sprinkle on both sides of the chops. Heat oil in a large (12-inch) skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chops until browned, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove from the pan, and set aside. Pour vermouth into the pan, and stir with a wooden spoon to scrape the bottom of the pan. Stir in the peach preserve mixture. Return the chops to the pan, and flip to coat with the sauce. Reduce heat to medium low, and cook the pork chops for about 8 minutes on each side, or until done.
