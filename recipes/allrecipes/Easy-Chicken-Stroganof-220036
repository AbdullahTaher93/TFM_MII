Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook until it's browned, stirring often. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside. Heat the remaining butter in the skillet. Add the mushrooms and onion and cook until they're tender, stirring occasionally. Add the soup and sour cream and heat to a boil. Return the chicken tote skillet and cook until the chicken is cooked through. Serve the chicken mixture over the noodles. Garnish with parsley, if desired.
