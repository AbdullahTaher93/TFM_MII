In a large pot over medium heat, cook the onion in the butter until soft. Stir in the water and parsley. Cover the pot and bring to a boil. Add the clams. Cover and steam them until the shells open, 5 to 8 minutes. Discard any unopened clams. With a slotted spoon, transfer the clams to serving bowls. Strain the broth from the pot through an unbleached coffee filter into 6 individual bowls. Serve the broth for dipping the clams.
