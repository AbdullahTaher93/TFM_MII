For hummus, in a blender container or food-processor bowl, combine garbanzo beans, cilantro, lemon or lime juice, water, garlic, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and hot pepper sauce. Cover; blend or process until smooth. Refrigerate. (Serve any leftovers with crackers.) Combine oil, lemon juice, paprika, dash salt, and pepper. Place chicken on an unheated rack of a broiler pan. Brush both sides of chicken with the oil mixture. Broil 4 to 5 inches from heat for 7 minutes. Turn; broil 5 to 8 minutes more or until chicken is tender and no longer pink. Cool; cut into strips. To serve, spread hummus over toasted pita; top with the chicken, tomatoes, cucumber, and yogurt.
