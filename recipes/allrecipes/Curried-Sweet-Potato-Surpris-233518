Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan. Place drained pears, peaches, pineapple, and cubed sweet potatoes in a large bowl. Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Whisk in brown sugar and curry powder until well blended. Pour over the sweet potato mixture and toss to coat. Spread mixture into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until sweet potatoes are tender, about 50 minutes.
