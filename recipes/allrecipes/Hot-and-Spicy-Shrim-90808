In a 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat, melt butter. Add onion, garlic, and mushrooms and stir often until lightly browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, chili paste, and wine. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium and simmer 5 minutes. Add shrimp and broth; stir often just until shrimp turn pink and are no longer translucent in center (cut to test), about 2 minutes. Stir in green onions. Ladle into 4 soup bowls, sprinkle equally with parsley, and serve immediately.
