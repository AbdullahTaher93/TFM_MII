Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onions, scallions, garlic, and potatoes. Cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes, or until soft. Add the clam juice, tomatoes (with juice), and wine. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Add the cod, scallops, and shrimp. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until the fish, scallops, and shrimp are opaque. Add the dill and basil. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange the bread on a large baking sheet. Brush each slice with the oil. Sprinkle the marjoram, garlic powder, and cheese over each slice. Bake for 15 minutes, or until crisp and golden brown. Serve with the stew.
