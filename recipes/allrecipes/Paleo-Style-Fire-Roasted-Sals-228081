Fill a small bowl with water and submerge chipotle chile pepper in the water until softened and rehydrated, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove chipotle pepper and set aside. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place tomatoes on the prepared baking sheet, and broil until the skins are charred, 13 to 15 minutes. Flip and char the other side for an additional 5 minutes. Combine charred tomatoes, garlic, cilantro, white onion, jalapeno pepper, chipotle pepper, and lime juice in a food processor; puree until evenly blended.
