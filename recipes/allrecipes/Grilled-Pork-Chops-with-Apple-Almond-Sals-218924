In a medium-sized bowl, combine apples, onion, almonds, vinegar, rosemary, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Set aside. Sprinkle pork chops with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large, nonstick pan over medium high. Add pork and cook without moving for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until browned. Remove from the pan and top with reserved Apple-Almond Salsa. Serve.
