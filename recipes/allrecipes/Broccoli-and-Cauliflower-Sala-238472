Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels. Whisk mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, sugar, and basil together in a large bowl until smooth. Add broccoli, cauliflower, and red onion to mayonnaise mixture; toss to coat. Refrigerate salad until chilled and flavors have blended, 3 hours to overnight. Crumble bacon. Mix bacon, lettuce, croutons, and water chestnuts into salad.
