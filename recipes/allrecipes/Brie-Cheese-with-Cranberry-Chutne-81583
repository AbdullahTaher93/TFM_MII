Prepare the Cranberry Chutney. You'll only need half of it for this recipe so you decide if you want left-overs or would like to cut the ingredient portions in half. If making a half batch I recommend keeping the whole jalapeno and using 2 tablespoons of Splenda (just 1 tsp more than half of 1/3 cup). Rinse and pat dry the lettuce leaves. Remove the base of the rib. Tear or cut into squares which will be the base of each appetizer. You want them big enough so people can grab onto it easily but not so big that it looks weird. Butter lettuce leaves are good for this too, as is radicchio or Belgian endive. But the green leaf is especially appropriate for the holidays. Place 1/2 oz slices on each lettuce square and then top with about 1/2 tablespoon of the chutney.
