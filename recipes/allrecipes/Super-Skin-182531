Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Cut potatoes in half lengthwise; scoop out centers, leaving 1/4-inch-thick shells. (Reserve centers for another use.) Cut shells in half crosswise. Place shells, skin sides down, on baking sheet; brush insides of shells lightly with oil. Bake 15 min. or until golden brown. Top evenly with CHEEZ WHIZ, bacon bits, sour cream and onions.
