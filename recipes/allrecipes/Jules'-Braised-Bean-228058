Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir bacon in hot oil until browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until the onion is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir vinegar, sugar, and garlic into the bacon and onion mixture; season with salt and pepper. Pour chicken stock over the mixture and stir; bring to a simmer and cook until hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the green beans and toss to coat. Cover the pot and let the green beans simmer until tender, about 10 minutes more.
