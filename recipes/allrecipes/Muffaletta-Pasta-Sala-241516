Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and run under cold water to cool. Mix tapenade into pasta and season with pepper. Add artichoke hearts, salami, ham, olives, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, red bell pepper, and parsley to pasta mixture and toss to coat. Transfer salad to a serving bowl and top with sesame seeds.
