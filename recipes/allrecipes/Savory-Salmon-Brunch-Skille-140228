Blend sour cream, lemon juice, and 1 1/2 tablespoons of the dill in small bowl. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside. Coat large nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Add oil and heat over medium heat. Spread potatoes evenly over bottom of pan, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes or until heated through. Remove cover, raise heat to medium-high, and press potatoes with large spatula. Cook 5 minutes or until potatoes brown and begin to crisp, turning occasionally. Combine salmon, scallions, mustard, and the remaining 1 tablespoon dill in medium bowl while potatoes cook. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add salmon mixture, combining with potatoes by turning sections with spatula (try not to break up potatoes). Cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Serve with dill cream.
