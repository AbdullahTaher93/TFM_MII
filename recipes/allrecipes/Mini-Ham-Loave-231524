Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Combine ground ham and pork in a bowl; stir in cracker crumbs, milk, and eggs. Shape mixture into 14 small oval loaves. Place loaves into prepared baking dish. Mix brown sugar, cider vinegar, water, and dry mustard in a bowl, stirring until brown sugar has dissolved. Pour mixture over ham loaves. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour; flip and bake until juices run clear and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a loaf reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 30 more minutes.
