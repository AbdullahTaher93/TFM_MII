Unroll crescent dough and separate into triangles; cut each lengthwise into three triangles. Place a sausage on the long end and roll up tightly; set aside. Combine the remaining ingredients in an 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Arrange sausage rolls, seam side down, in butter mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.
