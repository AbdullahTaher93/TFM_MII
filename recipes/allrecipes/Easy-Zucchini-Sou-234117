Melt butter in a pot over medium heat. Add zucchini, chicken broth, salt, and curry powder to the pot; cook until the zucchini is soft, about 15 minutes. Pour soup into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid in place; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth.
