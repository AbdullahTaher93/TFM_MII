In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup of sugar and cocoa. Blend in 1/2 cup milk. Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture comes to a boil. Cook and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes. Pour into unbaked pastry shells, tipping to coat the pastry halfway up the sides; set aside. In a mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt and remaining sugar. Add egg, shortening, vanilla and remaining milk; beat until smooth. Starting at the edge, spoon batter into the pastry shells, completely covering the chocolate. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Serve warm or chilled with whipped cream if desired.
