In a large skillet, bring asparagus and broth to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 3 minutes or until crisp-tender. Drain; immediately place asparagus in ice water. Drain and pat dry. In a large bowl, combine the peas, corn, oranges, water chestnuts, celery, onions and asparagus. In a small bowl, whisk the lemon juice, oil, soy sauce, honey, mustard, garlic, pepper and salt. Pour over vegetables. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.
