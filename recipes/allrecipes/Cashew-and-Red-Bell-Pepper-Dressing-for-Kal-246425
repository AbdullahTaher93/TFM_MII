Rinse cashews and soak in a jar with enough water to cover for at least 6 hours. Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute. Place soaked cashews, red bell pepper, lemon juice, sriracha hot sauce, 1 tablespoon water, nutritional yeast, and salt in a blender. Scrape cooked garlic and olive oil mixture into blender. Blend until smooth and creamy dressing forms, 1 to 2 minutes. Toss kale together with dressing in a large bowl until evenly coated.
