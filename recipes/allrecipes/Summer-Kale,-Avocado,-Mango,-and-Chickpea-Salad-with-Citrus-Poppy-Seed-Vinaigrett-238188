Place kale in a large bowl and gently massage it with your hands until slightly tender, 2 to 4 minutes. Let kale rest to tenderize further, about 10 minutes. Stir avocado, mango, chickpeas, and cucumber into kale. Combine olive oil, vinegar, orange juice, sunflower seed kernels, mustard, poppy seeds, and marmalade in a jar with a tight-fitting lid; put on the lid and shake until dressing is well combined. Pour dressing over kale mixture and toss to coat.
