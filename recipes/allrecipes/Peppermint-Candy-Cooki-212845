Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Tint the cookie dough with the green food coloring and flavor it with the peppermint extract. Roll it to 1/4-inch thickness, and then press out 24 circles using a 3-inch round cookie cutter. Bake for 10-12 minutes. When the cookies are cool, spread with frosting. Before the frosting dries, arrange red and green M&M'S(R) over the frosting. When the frosting is firm, gently wrap the cookies in cellophane and tie the ends with ribbon.
