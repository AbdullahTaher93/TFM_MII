Tenderloin: Take tenderloin and slice lengthwise, cutting to, but not through, other side. Open halves, laying tenderloin flat. Place tenderloin between 2 sheets of plastic wrap; pound to 1/2-inch thickness using a meat mallet or heavy skillet. In a saute pan over med-high heat, crumble and brown the sweet Italian sausage. In boiling salted water, cook broccoli rabe for 6 minutes then blanch in ice water to stop cooking process. After broccoli rabe is cool, chop into 1/2 inch pieces. Combine ricotta cheese, broccoli rabe, and sausage in mixing bowl for tenderloin stuffing. Spread out the sausage mixture on the tenderloin and roll up, starting with long side; secure pork at 1-inch intervals with twine. Season with salt, pepper, and Italian herb blend. In a preheated 375-degree oven, bake for 20-25 minutes (looking for an internal temperature of 155 degrees). Risotto: On a low heat, slowly melt the butter and add the chopped shallots and cook till translucent. Add in the Arborio rice, make sure to stir constantly to prevent from sticking to pan. Allow the rice to become glazed and cook without any liquid for 3-4 minutes. Next add in the white wine and deglaze. Boil up the chicken stock and add some of this into the rice at a medium heat. (Add the stock little by little and never adding the next ladle until the previous one has evaporated. It is vitally important not to rush this process but continue to add all of the liquid until the rice is plump and tender.) Season this mixture with salt and white pepper. At this time add in the Italian herb blend and if you wish to obtain a nice creamy risotto you can add the Parmesan cheese. To serve, slice the cooked tenderloin into medallions and shingle around risotto. Garnish with shaved parmesan cheese and a sprig of thyme.
