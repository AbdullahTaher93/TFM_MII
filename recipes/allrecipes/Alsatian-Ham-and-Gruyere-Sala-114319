Put the onion in a small bowl of cold water and let stand for 10 minutes. Drain the onion, rinse, and then pat dry with paper towels. Meanwhile, in a large glass or stainless-steel bowl, whisk together the mustard, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Add the oil slowly, whisking. Add the ham, cheese, onion, and parsley to the vinaigrette and toss.
