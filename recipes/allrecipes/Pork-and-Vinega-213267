Place the carrots and potatoes into the bottom of a slow cooker, and place the pork roast on top. Add the onion, garlic, bay leaf, and red pepper flakes, and pour the tomato sauce and vinegar over everything. Set the cooker to Low, and cook for 8 hours. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Slice the pork, and serve with carrots, potatoes, and some of the sauce spooned over each portion.
