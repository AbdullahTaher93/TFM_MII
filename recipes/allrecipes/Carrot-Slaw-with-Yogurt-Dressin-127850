In a food processor fitted with the shredding disk (or on the large holes of a box grater), grate carrots. In a large bowl, whisk together yogurt, vinegar, mustard, sugar, and onion; season with salt and pepper. Add carrots, cabbage, and dill to bowl; toss well. Top mixture with a plate that fits inside the bowl; weight with a heavy object. Let sit at room temperature 20 minutes before serving.
