Preheat oven to 200 degrees F. Slice meat across grain into 1/8-inch-thick bite-size pieces. In a bowl, combine meat, minced parsley, dried tomatoes, chili flakes, and Marsala. Set aside while preparing beans. Place a wide nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add beans and tomatoes and cook, stirring often, just until hot (about 3 minutes). Season to taste with salt and pepper, then spoon bean mixture onto an ovenproof platter. Keep warm in oven. In same pan, heat oil; add half the meat mixture and stir-fry until tinged with brown and barely pink when cut (about 3 minutes). Spoon meat mixture over beans; return to oven. Then cook remaining meat mixture, adding more oil, if needed. Add to platter with beans. To cooking pan add vinegar and broth, stirring to release pan drippings. Boil until reduced by about half (about 30 seconds). Spoon over meat and beans. Garnish with parsley sprigs, if desired.
