Arrange chicken in an 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Whisk together the oil, onion, garlic, thyme, salt, rosemary, pepper, sage, marjoram and hot pepper sauce. Pour over chicken. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 30-40 minutes or until juices run clear and a meat thermometer reads 170 degrees F, basting occasionally. Remove and discard skin from chicken. Sprinkle with parsley. Drizzle with juice.
