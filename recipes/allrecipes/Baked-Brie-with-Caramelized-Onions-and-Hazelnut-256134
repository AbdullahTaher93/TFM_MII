Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. In a small covered saucepan, cook onion in hot butter over low heat for 10 to 15 minutes or until tender and golden, stirring occasionally. Place Brie on an ovenproof plate or baking sheet. Spread the apricot preserves on top. Top with the onions and sprinkle with nuts. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until cheese is softened. If baked on a baking sheet, carefully transfer warm Brie to a serving platter. Serve with French bread slices and/or sliced fruit.
