Place bread in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish; set aside. In a skillet, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Stir in mustard. Sprinkle sausage and cheese evenly over bread. In a bowl, beat eggs, milk, cream and pepper. Pour over cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Cut into squares; serve immediately.
