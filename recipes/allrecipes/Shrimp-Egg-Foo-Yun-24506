In a mixing bowl, combine the bean sprouts, shrimp, eggs, mushrooms, scallions and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Mix thoroughly. Heat a deep skillet over high heat until 1 or 2 drops of water bubble when sprinkled in. Add oil and turn heat back to Medium-High. Pour in 1/2 cup of egg mixture into pan. Push cooked egg up over shrimp with a spatula to form a patty. Fry until golden brown, turning once, about 4 minutes. Repeat with remaining egg mixture. If you need to, add more oil. Keep patties warm. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine chicken broth, soy sauce, 1/4 teaspoon salt and white pepper to taste. Bring to a boil. Mix cornstarch and water; stir into broth mix. Cook and stir until thickened (about 10 seconds). Pour over patties.
