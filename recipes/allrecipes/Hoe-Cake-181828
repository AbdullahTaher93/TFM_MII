Whisk together the cornmeal, baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl and set aside. Whisk the eggs and milk in a separate bowl until smooth. Stir the cornmeal mixture into the milk mixture until no lumps remain. Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
