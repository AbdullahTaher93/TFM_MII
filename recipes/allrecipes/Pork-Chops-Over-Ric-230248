Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove the bacon slices to a plate lined with paper towels to cool, retaining bacon drippings in the skillet. Crumble the cooled bacon. Lay pork chops into the reserved bacon drippings in the skillet; season with salt and black pepper. Cook pork chops until completely browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove pork chops to the paper towel-lined plate. Stir rice, onion, and garlic into the drippings remaining in the skillet. Cook and stir until the onions are tender and the rice is slightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour chicken broth over the rice mixture; add crumbled bacon and cayenne pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil. Return the pork chops to the skillet. Sprinkle rosemary and thyme over the pork chops. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook at a simmer until the broth is absorbed into the rice and the pork chops are no longer pink in the middle, about 20 minutes.
