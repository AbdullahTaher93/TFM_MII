Trim crusts from bread slices and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Beat the eggs in a large mixing bowl. Add milk, cheese and Worcestershire sauce. Mix together, then stir in the bread. Let stand for 15 minutes. Put 1/3 cup of the souffle mixture into buttered muffin cups. Place the muffin tin into a jelly roll pan filled with 1/2 inch of water. Bake in a 375 degree oven until set, about 25-30 minutes. Remove when they have puffed up and are slightly brown on top. Sprinkle chives on each souffle, for garnish.
