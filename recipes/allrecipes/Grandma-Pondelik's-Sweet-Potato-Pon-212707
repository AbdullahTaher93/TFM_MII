Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Beat the butter, sugar, molasses, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt together in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in the sweet potatoes, vanilla extract, eggs, and evaporated milk until evenly blended. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the sweet potatoes are tender, and the top of the pone is golden brown, about 1 hour.
