In a 4- to 5-quart pan, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion and thyme and cook, stirring often, until onion is soft, about 10 minutes. To pan, add broth, vegetable juice, and Worcestershire. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring often; reduce heat, cover, and simmer 5 minutes. Spoon into bowls or mugs to serve.
