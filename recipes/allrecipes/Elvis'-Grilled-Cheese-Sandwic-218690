Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Spread peanut butter on a slice of white bread, and cover with cheese slice and bacon. Top with the other piece of bread. Spread butter on both sides of the sandwich, and pan-fry in a skillet over medium heat until the bread is golden brown and the cheese has melted, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve hot.
