Melt chocolate as directed on package. Dip marshmallows, one at a time, in chocolate, turning to evenly coat each marshmallow. Gently shake off excess chocolate. Place marshmallows, in single layer, on sheets of wax paper. Sprinkle each with about 1 tsp. of the pecans. Let stand at room temperature 1-1/2 to 2 hours or until chocolate is set. Store in airtight container at room temperature.
