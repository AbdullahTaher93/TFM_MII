Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir asparagus in melted butter until bright green, but still firm, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir 1 tablespoon butter and onion into asparagus; sprinkle with onion salt. Cook and stir until onion is slightly browned and asparagus are tender, 3 to 5 minutes.
