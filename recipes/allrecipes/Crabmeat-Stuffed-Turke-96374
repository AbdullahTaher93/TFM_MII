Cut turkey tenderloins in half crosswise. Butterfly each piece by slicing horizontally along 1 long end of meat right up to other edge. Pound tenderloin pieces between 2 pieces of plastic wrap to 1/4-inch thickness using flat side of meat mallet or rolling pin. Combine 1/2 cup cracker crumbs, crabmeat, mayonnaise, cheese, green onions, lemon juice and pepper sauce in medium bowl. Divide filling among tenderloin pieces. Roll up each tenderloin piece from short side, tucking in ends; secure with toothpick. Combine remaining 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons cracker crumbs, parsley flakes, paprika and black pepper in medium bowl. Dip turkey in milk; roll in cracker crumb mixture. Reserve remaining milk. Place turkey in microwavable round or square baking dish. Cover with waxed paper. Microwave at HIGH 10 minutes or until turkey is no longer pink in center. Remove turkey from dish. Add reserved milk to pan juices; microwave at HIGH until sauce boils for at least 1 minute. Slice turkey into 1-inch pieces. Serve sauce over turkey.
