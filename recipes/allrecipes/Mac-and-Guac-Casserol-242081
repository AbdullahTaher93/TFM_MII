Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add macaroni and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and transfer to an 8x15-inch baking dish. Mix avocados, Cheddar cheese, and black pepper together in a bowl until smooth; stir into pasta. Top pasta with bacon and bread crumbs. Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes.
