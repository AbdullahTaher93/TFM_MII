Combine water, shrimp shells, fish, celery, onion, bay leaf, and salt and pepper in a large saucepan. Bring to rolling boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for approximately 1/2 hour or until fish falls apart. Strain broth thoroughly, and discard solids. Be especially careful to remove all bones. Use as directed in any recipe that calls for fish stock.
