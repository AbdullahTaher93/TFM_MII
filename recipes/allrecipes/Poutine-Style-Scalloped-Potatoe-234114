Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 16x16-inch baking dish. Spread 1/3 of sliced potatoes in the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle potatoes with 1/3 of seasoning mix; top with 1/3 the mozzarella cheese. Continue layering with remaining potatoes, seasoning, and cheese. Pour gravy evenly over potato mixture to cover. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbly and potatoes are tender, about 45 minutes.
