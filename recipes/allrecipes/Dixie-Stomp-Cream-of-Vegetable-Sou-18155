In a large saucepan over medium high heat, combine the carrots, onions, potato, soups, asparagus, broth, bouillon cubes, bay leaf, thyme, ground black pepper and margarine. Stir all together, bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium low and let simmer until all vegetables are tender. Transfer to a blender or food processor in small batches and puree until smooth. (Note: This soup is meant to be totally smooth, so puree until there is no sign of visible vegetable pieces.) Next, combine with the cream and mix all together until smooth and well blended. Return all to the saucepan and warm soup over medium low heat. (Note: Do not boil.)
