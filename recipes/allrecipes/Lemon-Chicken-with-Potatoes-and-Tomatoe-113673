In a small glass baking dish, combine the lemon juice with the water, mustard and 2 tablespoons of the parsley. Add the chicken and turn to coat. Cover and let stand at room temperature for 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a medium baking dish, toss the potatoes with the diced lemon, tomatoes, onion, garlic, chives, thyme, 1 1/2 tablespoons of the olive oil and the remaining 2 tablespoons of parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Bake the potatoes for about 40 minutes, or until tender. Preheat the broiler. Transfer the chicken breasts to a small baking sheet and brush with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and broil 8 to 10 inches from the heat, turning once, until golden and cooked through, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. Broil the potatoes for about 2 minutes, or just until golden. Thinly slice the chicken. Spread the potatoes on plates, top with the chicken and serve.
