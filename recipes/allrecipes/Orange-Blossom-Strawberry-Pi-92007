Rinse berries and drain dry on absorbent towels; hull fruit. In a 1- to 11/2-quart pan, combine sugar, cornstarch, and peel. In a blender or food processor, whirl 2 cups of the least perfect strawberries with 6 tablespoons water until pureed; pour puree into pan, mixing well. Cook, stirring often, over medium-high heat until mixture comes to a full boil, about 5 minutes. Stir in orange liqueur to taste. Arrange remaining strawberries, tips up, in pastry shell; evenly spoon the hot cooked berry glaze mixture over whole fruit, covering completely. Chill until glaze is cool and set, at least 1 hour or, covered, up until next day. Cut into wedges.
