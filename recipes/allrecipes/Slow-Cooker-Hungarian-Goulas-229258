Combine steak and onion in a slow cooker. Mix flour, paprika, garlic salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; pour over steak and onion. Stir the mixture to coat beef with flour mixture. Add tomatoes and bay leaf. Cook on Low until steak is completely tender, 8 to 10 hours. Remove and discard bay leaf. Stir sour cream through the mixture. Switch slow cooker to High and cook until hot, about 15 minutes.
