Place chicken in large resealable plastic bag or glass dish. Add 1/2 cup of the marinade; turn to coat well. Reserve remaining marinade for brushing. Refrigerate 30 minutes or longer for extra flavor. Remove chicken from marinade. Discard any remaining marinade. Alternately thread chicken, vegetables and pineapple onto 8 skewers. Grill kabobs over medium heat 10 to 15 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and vegetables are tender, turning occasionally and brushing with reserved marinade.
