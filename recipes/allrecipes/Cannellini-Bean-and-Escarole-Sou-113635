In a medium saucepan, cover the beans with 2 inches of water and bring to a boil. Simmer over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 2 hours. Keep adding water as necessary so the beans are always submerged in 1 inch of water. Remove them from the heat and season with salt. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan of boiling salted water, cook the escarole for 3 minutes. Drain and coarsely chop. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan. Add the celery and bay leaf and cook over low heat until the celery is softened, about 5 minutes. Add the beans, their cooking liquid, tomatoes and their juices and simmer over moderate heat for 3 minutes. Add the escarole and simmer for 5 minutes. Discard the bay leaf. Season with salt and stir in the parsley, garlic, marjoram and crushed red pepper. Add a piece of grilled bread to each bowl, ladle in the soup and serve.
