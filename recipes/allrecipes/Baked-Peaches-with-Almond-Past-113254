Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put a rack on a baking sheet and then put the peaches on the rack, skin-side down. In a food processor, puree the almond paste, water, and lemon juice. Spoon the almond mixture into the centers of the peaches. Top each mound of almond paste with a piece of the butter. Bake in the lower third of the oven until the peaches are tender and the almond paste is golden brown, about 25 minutes. Serve warm.
