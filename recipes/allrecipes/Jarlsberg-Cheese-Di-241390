Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onions in hot butter until soft and translucent, 7 to 12 minutes. Cool. Stir onions, Jarlsberg cheese, and mayonnaise together in a large bowl. Spread cheese mixture into 2 pie dishes. Sprinkle the tops with paprika. Bake in the preheated oven until dip puffs slightly and cheese is melted, 25 to 30 minutes.
