Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread sauerkraut into bottom of a 9-inch square glass baking dish. Stir reserved liquid from sauerkraut, brown mustard, brown sugar, celery seed, and black pepper together in a bowl; drizzle over sauerkraut. Arrange sausage slices in a layer over the sauerkraut and sauce. Loosely pile frozen french fries atop the sausage. Bake in preheated oven until the french fries are lightly browned, 20 to 30 minutes.
