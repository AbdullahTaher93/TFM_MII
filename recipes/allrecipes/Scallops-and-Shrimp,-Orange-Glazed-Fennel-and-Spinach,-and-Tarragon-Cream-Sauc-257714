Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir shallots until translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in white wine; simmer until reduced by almost half.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir fennel until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Pour in orange juice; simmer until slightly reduced, about 3 minutes. Stir in spinach. Reduce heat, cover skillet, and cook spinach until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir well. Remove from heat and keep covered. Season shrimp and scallops with salt and pepper. Melt 2 1/2 tablespoons of butter in a cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add scallops; cook until browned, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook on the second side for 1 minute.
