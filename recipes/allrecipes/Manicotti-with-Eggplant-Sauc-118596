In a large skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, cook and stir the eggplant, onion, garlic, tarragon and thyme until vegetables are tender. Add tomatoes and tomato sauce; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 3-4 minutes. Set aside. In a large bowl, combine the spinach, ricotta, 1/2 cup mozzarella, egg substitute, Parmesan and parsley; mix well. Stuff into manicotti shells. Place in an 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Spoon eggplant sauce over manicotti; sprinkle with remaining mozzarella. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until heated through.
