To Marinate: In a small bowl, whisk together the lemonade concentrate, soy sauce and olive oil. Place turkey cubes in a large, resealable plastic bag and pour all but 1/4 cup of the marinade over the turkey. Seal bag and refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight. Preheat grill to medium high heat and lightly oil grate. Place mango and melon in reserved 1/4 cup of marinade. Drain turkey of its marinade and thread onto 10 or 12 inch skewers. On seperate skewers thread mango and melon chunks, alternating fruits. Grill turkey kabobs for 10 to 12 minutes, or until turkey is no longer pink in the center, turning once. Add fruit kabobs to grill when turkey kabobs are turned; grill both turkey and fruit kabobs for another 5 to 6 minutes, turning once, and brush with 1/4 cup reserved marinade.
