Stir water and baking powder together in a bowl (mixture should foam). Mix turkey, flour, egg, salt, and black pepper into water and baking powder. Form mixture into bite-size nuggets. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry the nuggets in the hot vegetable oil until golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes per side.
