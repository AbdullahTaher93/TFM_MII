In a medium skillet, heat the 3 cups of oil to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). In a food processor, combine the shrimp, ginger, garlic and water chestnuts; grind to a paste. Add salt, pepper, sherry, egg white and baking soda. Process until smooth. Cut each slice of trimmed bread into quarters, forming 4 triangles each. Divide the shrimp mixture over each piece of bread; sprinkle with sesame seeds. Deep fry shrimp toast until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
