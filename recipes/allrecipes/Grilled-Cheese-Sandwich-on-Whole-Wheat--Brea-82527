Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Spread 2 teaspoons butter onto one side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side-down in the skillet, and layer with 1 slice of cheese. Top with 1 slice of onion and 1 slice of tomato. Butter a second slice of bread on one side, spread 1 teaspoon mustard on the opposite side, and place butter-side-up on top of sandwich. Grill until lightly browned. Turn over, and continue grilling until cheese is melted and bread is golden brown. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make second sandwich.
