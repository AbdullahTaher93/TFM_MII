Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly spray large cookie sheet with cooking spray. On prepared cookie sheet, place dough pieces about 1/2-inch apart - roughly forming a heart shape. Press dough to form 11x9-inch heart. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Cool completely. Decorate with colored decorator icing as desired. Surprise your Valentine!
