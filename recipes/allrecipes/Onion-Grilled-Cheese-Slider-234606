Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and saute, until caramelized. Stir in thyme, a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper, and the apple butter. Cook to heat through. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees F. Set bun bottoms on a sheet pan and top each with a portion of cheese. Top cheese with a portion of flavored onions. Spread each bun top with a portion of mustard and cap each sandwich. Bake sliders until cheese melts, 5-7 minutes. Serve.
