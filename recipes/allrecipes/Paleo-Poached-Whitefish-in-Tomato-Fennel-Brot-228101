Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in fennel bulbs and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add whitefish, saffron, fennel seeds, tomatoes, and water. Bring to a boil, cover, and remove from heat. Let sit covered until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes.
