Heat a stock pot over medium heat. Crumble sausage into the pot; cook and stir until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour chicken broth into the pot; add tomatoes, coleslaw mix, celery, potatoes, carrots, onion, garlic, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium low, and simmer until vegetables are tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Stir cream into individual servings.
