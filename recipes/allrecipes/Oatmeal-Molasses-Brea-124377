In a bowl, pour boiling water over oats; let stand 30 minutes or until mixture has cooled to warm (110 degrees F-115 degrees F). In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water; let stand 5 minutes. Stir in oat mixture, molasses, butter, anise seed if desired, salt and 2 cups of flour; beat until smooth. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down; divide in half. Shape into two loaves and place in greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 375 degrees F for 40 minutes or until bread sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from pans to cool on wire racks.
