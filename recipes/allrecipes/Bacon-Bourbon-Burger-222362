Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Mix ground beef, bourbon, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, steak seasoning, and garlic salt in a bowl; divide and shape into 2 patties. Cook on the preheated grill for about 5 minutes; turn, top each burger with bacon and Cheddar cheese, and continue cooking until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 5 minutes more for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Serve on split buns topped with tomato and lettuce.
