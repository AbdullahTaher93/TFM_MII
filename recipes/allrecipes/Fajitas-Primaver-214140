Mix 1 tablespoon olive oil, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, chili powder, oregano, cumin, pepper, lime zest and lime juice in a medium mixing bowl. Add corn, kidney beans, mushrooms and green beans. Toss gently until all vegetables are coated. Set aside for 10 minutes. Heat the remaining one tablespoon oil in a large, well seasoned skillet over high heat until smoking. Add onion and bell pepper and saute until browned and tender, about 5 minutes. Add marinated corn-bean mixture with the marinade and tomatoes; cook until steaming hot, about 4 minutes, stirring often. Gently fold in asparagus and cilantro, if used, and heat through, about 1 minute. To assemble fajitas; spoon 3/4 cup vegetable filling into the center of each warm tortilla. Top with 2 tablespoons shredded cheese, fold in one side and roll up. Serve with sour cream and/or guacamole, if desired.
