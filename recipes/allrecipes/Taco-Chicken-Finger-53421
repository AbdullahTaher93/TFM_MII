Place milk in small bowl. Set aside. In a shallow dish or plastic bag, blend taco seasoning, flour and cornmeal. In a large skillet, heat oil to 350 degrees F. Dip chicken pieces in milk and coat with flour mixture. Add chicken fingers, a few pieces at a time, to hot oil. Fry 4-5 minutes or until done. Drain on paper towel. Serve with salsa as a dipping sauce.
