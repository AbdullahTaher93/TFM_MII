In a large mixing bowl, combine the first five ingredients. Combine the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, cloves and salt; gradually add to pear mixture and mix well. Pour into four 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
