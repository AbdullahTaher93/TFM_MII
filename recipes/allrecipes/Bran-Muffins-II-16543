Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease muffin pans or line with paper cups. In a large bowl, combine all purpose flour, whole wheat flour, wheat bran, salt and baking soda. Add molasses, buttermilk, egg and butter; stir just to moisten. Scoop batter into prepared muffin pans. Cups should be 2/3 to 3/4 full. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
