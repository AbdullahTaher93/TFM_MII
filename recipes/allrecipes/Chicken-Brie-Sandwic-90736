Spread one side of 4 slices of bread with half the butter. Place bread, buttered side down, on cutting board. Combine mayonnaise and pesto in a small bowl. Spread onto unbuttered side of 4 slices of buttered bread, about 1 1/2 tablespoons on each. Layer brie, spinach, chicken, and tomatoes on bread. Preheat a lightly oiled two-sided grill for 5 to 6 minutes until hot, or place a griddle pan or a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Meanwhile, butter remaining bread slices; place slices buttered side up on top of sandwich filling. Place sandwiches on grill and close lid. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes until sandwiches are golden brown. Or if cooking in griddle or frying pan, place sandwiches in pan, buttered side down. Cook, pressing down occasionally with spatula, until golden brown on bottom, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn sandwiches over and continue to cook until golden on other side, about 3 to 5 more minutes. Cut sandwiches into halves to serve.
