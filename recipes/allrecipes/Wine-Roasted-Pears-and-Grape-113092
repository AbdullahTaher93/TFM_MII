Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F . In a baking dish large enough to hold the pears comfortably, arrange the pear quarters, cut side down, and scatter the grapes around them. In a bowl, combine the wine, honey, apricot preserves, vanilla and thyme, and pour over the pears. Transfer the dish to the oven and roast the fruit until tender, about 40 minutes, basting several times. Remove the thyme sprigs and spoon the pears and grapes into serving dishes. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whip the creme fraiche and granulated sugar until firm peaks form. Serve the pears and grapes topped with the whipped creme fraiche and sprinkled with turbinado sugar.
