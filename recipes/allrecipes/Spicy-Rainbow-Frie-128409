Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil and coat with nonstick spray. In a medium bowl, combine the oil, chili powder, and garlic powder. Add the russet potatoes, sweet potatoes, and beets. Toss to coat. Arrange the vegetables on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer, being careful not to let the pieces touch. Bake for 15 minutes. Turn the pieces and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until crispy on the outside and tender inside.
