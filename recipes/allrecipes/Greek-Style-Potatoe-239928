Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir water, olive oil, lemon juice, dill, chicken bouillon, garlic, thyme, rosemary, oregano, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until smooth. Spread potato wedges into a baking dish. Drizzle the seasoning mixture over the potatoes. Cover the dish with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven, turning occasionally, until the potato wedges are soft in the center, 90 minutes to 2 hours.
