Beat flour, water, and egg together in a bowl to make batter. Stir in soy sauce and salt. Heat oil to a depth of 1/2 inch in a deep-fryer or large saucepan. Dip cauliflower in batter and fry in hot oil until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Combine pineapple chunks and juice with tomato sauce in a small pot to make sauce; bring to a boil. Mix water and cornstarch in a small bowl until dissolved. Pour into sauce; stir until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve sauce alongside fried cauliflower.
