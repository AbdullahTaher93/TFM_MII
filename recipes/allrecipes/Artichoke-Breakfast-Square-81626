Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Drain and chop the artichoke into small bite sized pieces. Place in a mixing bowl with the mushrooms, scallions, Jack cheese and oregano. Toss together. Put the artichoke mixture in a well buttered 8x8 casserole dish. In the original mixing bowl, beat the eggs thoroughly. Add the cream and salt & pepper. Mix again. Pour this mixture over the artichokes. Sprinkle the top with the Parmesan cheese. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35 minutes. Let cool for about 5 minutes before cutting into 6 servings.
