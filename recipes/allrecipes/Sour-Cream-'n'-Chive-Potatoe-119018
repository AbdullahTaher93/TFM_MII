Place potatoes in a Dutch oven; cover with water. Add 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and cook for 20-25 minutes or until potatoes are very tender. Drain well. In a large mixing bowl, mash the potatoes, sour cream, milk and butter. Add the chives, pepper and remaining salt; mix well.
