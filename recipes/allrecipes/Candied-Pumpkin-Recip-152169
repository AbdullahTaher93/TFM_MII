Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook the pumpkin in the butter until tender, about 20 minutes. Add the sugar and stir until dissolved. Stir in the syrup, ginger, and cinnamon; remove from heat and allow to cool. Transfer to a bowl and cover. Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.
