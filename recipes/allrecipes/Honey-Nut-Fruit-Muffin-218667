Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 18 muffin cups, or line with papers. Mix the water, honey, dates, and baking soda together in a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the dates are soft, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat, and allow to cool. When cool, pour the mixture into a mixing bowl, and combine with orange juice and zest, shredded apples, grapes, cinnamon, and walnuts; stir to combine. Mix in the flour, and spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups. Bake until set and golden brown on top, 25 to 30 minutes.
