Cut ribs into 4-bone sections and put in gallon-size plastic freezer bag and pour in cola (reserve 1/2 cup). Seal bag tight; chill 1 hour, flip bag, then marinate at least 1 or up to 24 hours. Prepare gas or charcoal grill for indirect, medium heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above cooking grate only 4 to 5 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). If using charcoal, set foil drip pan on fire grate surrounded by coals. Mix brown sugar, garlic powder, and pepper. Drain ribs; pat dry. Pat meat side of ribs with sugar mixture. Cut two 24-inch long sheets of heavy-duty foil (18 inches wide). Place half the ribs, meat side up, on half of 1 foil sheet, loosely fold foil over meat; seal on two sides. Tilt packet and pour in reserved cola; fold to seal. Repeat with remaining ribs. Lay packets, folded side up, on center of grate (not over direct heat). If using charcoal, add 5 briquettes to each mound of coals at start; repeat every 30 minutes. Cover charcoal grill and open vents; close lid on gas grill. Cook until meat shrinks from bone ends, about 45 minutes. Mix preserves and barbecue sauce; set aside half. Lift packets off grill to platter. Remove ribs from packets and return to center of grill (not direct heat); cover grill (keep vents open for charcoal). Cook, brushing with jam, until meat is no longer pink in center, about 15 minutes. Transfer ribs to platter; cut to separate. Serve with reserved preserves.
