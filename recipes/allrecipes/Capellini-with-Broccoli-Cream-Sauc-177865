Trim and discard tough ends of broccoli stalks; peel stalks, if desired. Reserve a few whole florets for garnish; finely chop remaining broccoli. Set aside. In a 5- to 6-quart pan, bring about 3 quarts water to a boil over high heat; stir in pasta and cook, uncovered, until just tender to bite (about 3 minutes). Or cook pasta according to package directions. Drain well; keep warm. While water is heating, melt butter in a wide frying pan over medium-high heat; add broccoli (including reserved florets) and 1/3 cup water. Cover and cook until broccoli is tender when pierced (3 to 5 minutes). Remove florets from pan and set aside. Add cream and nutmeg to remaining broccoli in pan. Bring to a boil; add drained pasta. Cook, stirring, until mixture is heated through and cream clings to pasta. Remove from heat. Sprinkle with 1 1/4 cups of the cheese; mix gently, using 2 forks. Pour pasta onto individual plates; top with reserved florets and sprinkle evenly with 3 to 4 tablespoons more cheese. Serve at once; offer remaining cheese to add to taste.
