Heat the oven to 450 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, garlic, 2 tablespoons of the oil, the lemon juice, cayenne, and a pinch of salt. Mix well and refrigerate until ready to use. Put the potatoes and carrots on a large baking sheet and toss them with 2 tablespoons of the oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Spread the vegetables out in a single layer and roast them in the oven for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, put the bell-pepper strips on a second large baking sheet and toss them with 1 teaspoon of the oil and 1/8 teaspoon salt. After 15 minutes, take the first pan out of the oven and turn the vegetables with a spatula. Put both pans in the oven and roast for 5 minutes. Toss the asparagus with the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Put the asparagus on the pan with the peppers. Roast until all the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes longer. Serve the roasted vegetables and hard-cooked eggs with the aioli.
