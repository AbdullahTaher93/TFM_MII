Heat the sesame oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Cook the garlic and ginger until fragrant and light brown, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add the mango and cook for another minute to soften slightly. Stir in the curry powder and cilantro; cook for another minute to release the flavor of the curry. Pour in the coconut milk and bring to a simmer. Stir in the tofu and season to taste with salt and pepper. Simmer until the liquid is reduced by half, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.
