Combine flour, salt, and pepper in a bowl, then add beef, tossing to coat. Shake off excess flour. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onions and beef until browned. Stir in beef stock, bay leaves, and curry powder. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Stir in carrots, rice vinegar, molasses, and potatoes and simmer for an additional hour until tender.
