Cut squash into chunks and remove rind. Shred squash and onion in a food processor. Place in a colander and press with a potato masher to drain any excess liquid. Transfer to a bowl and mix with flour and egg. Season with cumin, salt, pepper, and red pepper. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place walnut-sized scoops of the squash mixture into the hot oil. Press flat with a spatula. Cook 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
