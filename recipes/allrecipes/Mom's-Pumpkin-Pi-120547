In a bowl, combine 1-1/2 cups flour, sugar and salt; cut in shortening until crumbly. In another bowl, whisk water and remaining flour until smooth; add to crumb mixture and toss until moistened. Divide pastry in half. Roll out each portion between two pieces of plastic wrap into an 11-in. circle. Freeze for 10 minutes. Remove one sheet of plastic wrap from one pastry; transfer to a 9-in. pie plate coated with nonstick cooking spray. Remove the remaining plastic wrap. Trim edges of pastry and flute. Repeat with remaining pastry. In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg substitute, egg, sugars, salt and spices until smooth. Mix in pumpkin. Gradually beat in milk. Pour into crusts. Bake at 375 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Garnish with whipped topping.
