In a small saucepan, bring the sugar and 1/4 cup water to a boil. Cook, stirring often, until the sugar completely dissolves, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the lime peel and let cool. Pour the syrup over the mixed berries and toss to coat. Divide the berries among 4 martini glasses and fill each glass with Prosecco.
