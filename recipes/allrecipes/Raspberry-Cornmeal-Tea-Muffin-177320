In a large bowl, mix flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, soda, and salt. In another bowl, beat to blend eggs, yogurt, and oil; add to flour mixture. Stir to moisten evenly. Gently fold in berries. Divide batter equally among 10 oiled or paper-lined muffin cups (2 1/2-inch size). Bake in a 375 degrees F oven until golden and tops spring back when touched in center, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool muffins on a rack; serve warm with Lucerne Sweet Cream Butter and O Organics(TM) Raspberry Preserves.
