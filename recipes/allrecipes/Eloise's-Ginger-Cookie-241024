Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat 1 cup white sugar and shortening together in a large bowl until light and creamy. Add molasses and egg; beat until smooth. Whisk flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Gradually stir flour mixture into shortening mixture until dough is just-combined. Pour 1/2 cup white sugar into a shallow bowl. Roll dough into 1-inch balls and roll each ball in sugar to coat; place 2-inches apart on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until set and lightly golden, 10 to 15 minutes.
