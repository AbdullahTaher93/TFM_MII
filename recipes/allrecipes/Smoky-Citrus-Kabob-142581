Thread tenderloin cubes onto skewers (if using bamboo skewers, soak in water for 30 minutes before using to prevent burning). Stir together remaining ingredients for basting sauce. Place kabobs over medium-hot coals, brushing generously with basting sauce. Grill and turn to brown evenly, brushing frequently with sauce, just until done, about 10-12 minutes.
