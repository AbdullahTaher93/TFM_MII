Rinse peppers and discard stems, seeds, and veins. Cut peppers into 1/4- by 2-inch pieces. Peel onions and cut into 1/4- by 2-inch pieces. Rinse pork, pat dry, and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices not more than 2 inches long. Set a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over high heat; add meat and stir just until no longer pink, about 2 minutes. Pour from pan into a bowl. When cool enough to handle, in about 5 minutes, tear meat into strips about 1/2 inch wide. Meanwhile, add peppers, onions, broth, cumin, and garlic to frying pan. Stir often over high heat until liquid has evaporated and vegetables are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Pour mixture into bowl with pork; add cilantro. Pour enchilada sauce into frying pan and add juices from meat mixture. In another bowl, blend milk with cornstarch until smooth, and add to enchilada sauce. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring often. Remove from heat. Stack tortillas and enclose loosely in microwave-safe plastic wrap. Heat in a microwave oven at full power (100%) just until hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour about 2 cups enchilada sauce mixture into each of 2 shallow casseroles (each 3 qt., about 9 by 13 in.). Turn 8 tortillas, 1 at a time, in sauce in 1 casserole and stack at 1 end. Distribute 1/16 of the pork mixture and 1 tablespoon cheese down center of each tortilla, 1 at a time. Roll to enclose filling; set tortillas, seam down and side by side, in sauce. Repeat to fill tortillas in remaining casserole. Pour remaining enchilada sauce over tortillas, coating them evenly. Bake, covered, in a 375 degree oven until enchiladas are hot (140 degrees to 150 degrees) in the center, 40 to 45 minutes. Uncover, sprinkle remaining cheese evenly over enchiladas, and bake until melted, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Serve with a wide spatula. Add salsa and salt to taste.
