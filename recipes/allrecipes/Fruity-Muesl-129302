Place the oats and raisins in a large bowl and add the milk. Stir well, cover, and place in the refrigerator. Soak overnight. The next day, just before serving, grate the apple, discarding the core. Toss the apple with the lemon juice to prevent browning. Stir the hazelnuts, pumpkin seeds, and sesame seeds into the oat mixture, then stir in the grated apple and chopped strawberries. Divide the muesli among 4 cereal bowls, and top each with the yogurt and honey.
