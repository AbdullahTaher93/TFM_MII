Melt the margarine in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir in the oats and wheat germ; toast, stirring frequently, until the oats are golden brown. Remove the saucepan from the heat; stir in the sugar. Spoon 1/4 cup (50 mL) of the yogurt into each of 4 parfait glasses or 8-ounce (250 mL) wine goblets; top with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of the granola mixture and another 1/4 cup (50 mL) of yogurt. Add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of granola and 2 tablespoons (25 mL) of blueberries. Spoon another 1/4 cup (50 mL) of yogurt over the blueberries. Add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) granola and 2 tablespoons (25 mL) blueberries. Garnish each with a strawberry.
