Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix artichoke hearts, mayonnaise, mozzarella cheese, white onion, Parmesan cheese, jalapeno peppers, salt, and black pepper in a bowl; spread into a baking dish. Sprinkle paprika over the artichoke mixture. Bake in preheated oven until hot and beginning to set, about 25 minutes. Cool at least 15 minutes before serving.
