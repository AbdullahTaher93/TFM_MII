Heat olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat; cook and stir onions and carrots until onions are slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Melt butter with onions and carrots; cook and stir zucchini and garlic in the melted butter until onions are translucent, about 7 more minutes. Stir beer, seafood seasoning, parsley, garlic powder, chile-garlic sauce, sea salt, oregano, and black pepper into the vegetable mixture and gently lay catfish fillets over top of vegetables. Pour tomatoes with their juice over the vegetables and catfish. Cover pot and bring to a simmer; cook until catfish are cooked through, about 10 minutes. Break the catfish fillets apart into bite-size chunks. Pour in a tomato can of water and stir in corn; simmer the chowder covered until vegetables are tender and flavors have blended, at least 30 more minutes.
