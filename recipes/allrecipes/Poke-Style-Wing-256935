Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Pat wings with paper towels until completely dry. Fry wings in the hot oil until very crisp and no longer pink in the center, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer wings to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon. Mix soy sauce and sesame oil together in a large bowl; add wings and toss until completely covered. Sprinkle salt, macadamia nuts, and red pepper flakes over wings and toss to coat.
