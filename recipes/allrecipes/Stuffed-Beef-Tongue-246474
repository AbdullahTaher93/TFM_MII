Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add beef tongue; cook until slightly softened, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and cool until easily handled, about 5 minutes. Peel off skin. Mix smoked ham, olives, garlic, adobo, oregano, and salt together in a small bowl. Make slits in the tongue using a sharp knife; fill slits with ham mixture. Heat oil in the same pot over medium heat. Add tongue; cook, turning often, until browned on all sides, about 20 minutes. Remove from the pot and cut into smaller pieces. Pour tomato sauce into the pot; stir to scrape up browned bits from the bottom. Stir tongue pieces into the sauce and simmer until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.
