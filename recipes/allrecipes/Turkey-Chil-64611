Brown and crumble ground turkey in a large nonstick pan coated with vegetable spray. Add vegetables to the pan and cook for about 5 minutes or until the onions are tender. Place the turkey and vegetables in a slow cooker along with water, beef granules, diced tomatoes, salsa and beans. Cover and heat the mixture on low heat setting for 4 hours.
