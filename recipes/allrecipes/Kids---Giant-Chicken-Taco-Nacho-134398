Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the tortillas with a little EVOO and place on a baking sheet. Transfer to the oven to crisp up, 5 minutes. Have a GH (Grown-Up Helper) heat the EVOO, one turn of the pan, in a skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and taco sauce and cook for about 5 minutes. Have the GH remove the hot baking sheet from the oven. Top each tortilla with 1/2 cup saucy chicken and lots of the cheese. Return to the oven and bake until the cheese melts, 3 to 4 minutes. Place each Giant Chicken Taco Nacho on a plate and top with the lettuce, scallions and olives.
