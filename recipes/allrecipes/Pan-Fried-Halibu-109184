Preheat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven, over medium heat, to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, salt and pepper. In a small cup, whisk together milk and egg. Pour milk mixture into flour mixture; whisk until smooth. Dredge the pieces of fish in the batter, one piece at a time, and place them in the hot oil, 3 or 4 pieces at a time. Fry, turning once, until the fish is golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer fried fish to a wire rack set over a lipped cookie sheet; set in warm oven while frying remaining fish. Serve 2 pieces of fish per person.
