Soak wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes. Preheat grill to medium-high. Fold sheet of Reynolds Wrap Foil in half; set aside. Thread fruit chunks onto skewers, alternating so there are about 2 pieces each fruit on each skewer. Combine sugar, melted butter and lime juice in small bowl. Brush on all sides of fruit. Place skewers on grill. Slice folded sheet of Reynolds Wrap Foil under the exposed end of the skewers. Grill for about 8 minutes in covered grill, turning once, until lightly browned and slightly softened. Drizzle remaining butter mixture on fruit. Sprinkle with chopped mint.
