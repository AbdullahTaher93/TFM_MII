Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and Italian sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes; drain and discard grease. Chop carrots and onion in the food processor. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir carrots, onion, and garlic in the hot oil until onion is transparent, about 5 minutes. Stir ground beef-sausage mixture, crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, oregano, brown sugar, basil, black pepper, and cinnamon into onion mixture; simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors have blended, about 30 minutes. Season with salt.
