Place the salmon in an 11x8-inch (2-quart) shallow baking dish. Sprinkle with black pepper and drizzle with oil. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15 minutes or until the fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Stir the cornstarch, broth, vinegar, brown sugar, orange juice and orange peel in a 2-quart saucepan over high heat to a boil. Cook and stir until the mixture boils and thickens. Place the salmon on a serving platter and serve with the sauce. Garnish with the orange slices.
