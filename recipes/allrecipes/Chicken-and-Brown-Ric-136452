Heat oil in a large straight-sided skillet over medium heat. Season chicken with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cook, turning, until golden on all sides, about 10 minutes; transfer to a plate. Add onion, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper to skillet. Cook, stirring frequently, until onion is softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in rice, tomatoes, peppers, and 1 1/4 cups water; nestle chicken pieces in rice mixture. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Cover, and simmer over medium-low heat until rice is tender, 55 to 60 minutes. If any liquid remains in skillet, remove lid and simmer until evaporated. Sprinkle peas over contents of skillet; cover, and remove from heat. Set aside until peas are heated through, about 10 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges, if desired.
