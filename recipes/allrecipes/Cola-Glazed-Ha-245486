Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with aluminum foil. Place brown sugar in a bowl; whisk in just enough cola to dissolve sugar and form a thick glaze. Place ham in baking dish and pour glaze over ham. Add remaining cola to bottom of baking dish. Bake ham in the preheated oven, basting with the glaze occasionally, for 2 hours. Transfer ham to a serving platter; tent with foil for up to 30 minutes before serving.
