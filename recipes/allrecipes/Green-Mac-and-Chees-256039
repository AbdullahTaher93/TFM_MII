Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place Anaheim peppers in a blender and blend, adding olive oil as needed to create a smooth paste. Heat cream in a pot over medium heat; stir in butter. Add Anaheim pepper paste, pepper Jack cheese, Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, Mexican cheese blend; cook, stirring constantly, until cheeses are melted and sauce is smooth, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and white pepper. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain. Stir cheese sauce into elbow macaroni; transfer to a casserole dish and top with crushed crackers. Bake in the preheated oven until topping is browned and cheese is bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes.
