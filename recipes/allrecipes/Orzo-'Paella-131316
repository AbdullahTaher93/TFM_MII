In a skillet, heat 1 teaspoon oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken and saute until golden brown on all sides, about 4 minutes. Remove to a plate. Add 1 teaspoon oil to skillet and saute shrimp, turning once, until opaque, about 2 minutes. Remove to plate. Add remaining oil to skillet and saute scallion whites and garlic until soft. Add saffron, paprika, turmeric, and orzo. Toast until orzo is golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, partially covered, until orzo is al dente, about 8 minutes. Return chicken and shrimp to skillet, add tomatoes, and cook until liquid is absorbed and chicken is cooked through, about 2 minutes. Top with scallions and serve.
