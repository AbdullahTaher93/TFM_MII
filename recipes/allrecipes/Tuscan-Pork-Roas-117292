In a small bowl, combine the first six ingredients; rub over pork roast. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Place roast on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), basting occasionally with pan juices. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
