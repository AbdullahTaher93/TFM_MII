Place the liver on a plate, pat dry with paper towels, and snip off any gristly pieces with scissors. Mix the flour with some salt and pepper on another plate. Dip the liver in the seasoned flour until coated on both sides; shake off the excess flour. Cook the pasta in boiling water until al dente, 10 to 12 minutes, or according to the package directions. Meanwhile, heat the oil and butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the liver, and saute, turning once, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the liver to a plate and keep warm. Add the sherry to the pan and leave to bubble until reduced to half the quantity, about 1 minute. Stir in the stock, cranberry sauce, tomato paste, thyme, and add salt and pepper to taste. Reduce the heat and simmer 4 to 5 minutes. Return the liver to the pan and heat through, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain the pasta and mix with the watercress. Serve with the liver.
