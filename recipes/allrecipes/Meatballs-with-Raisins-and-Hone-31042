In a medium bowl, mix together the meat, one onion, eggs, and bread. Season with salt and pepper. Form into small balls. Heat 1/4 cup of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the meatballs until browned. Remove from heat, and set aside. In a large saucepan, heat remaining 1/2 cup of oil. Fry the remaining 4 onions until golden. Carefully add the meatballs. Mix in the raisins, cinnamon, honey, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about an hour. Season with salt and pepper before serving.
