Heat coconut oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add yams; stir to coat with oil. Cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side. Add carrot; cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in leek and garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add cumin and coriander; stir until evenly distributed. Pour lemon juice, vegetable broth, and coconut milk into the pot; stir to combine. Bring soup to a gentle boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, until carrots are tender, about 15 minutes. Season with salt. Ladle soup into serving bowls and garnish with fresh spinach.
