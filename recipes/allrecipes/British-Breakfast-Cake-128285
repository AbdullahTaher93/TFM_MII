Heat 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of the oil in a nonstick skillet; saute the onion until slightly browned. Transfer the onion to a medium bowl and mix in the potatoes, oats, and caraway seed. Divide the dough into eight balls and form each ball into a thin pancake. Cook the pancakes in a medium nonstick skillet in the remaining oil, adding the oil a little at a time. Flatten the pancakes gently with a spatula while cooking; cook until browned on both sides and heated through. Serve with applesauce.
