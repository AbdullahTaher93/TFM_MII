Arrange halibut fillets in deep-sided microwave safe container. Add 1 cup vegetable stock. Cover with plastic wrap, leaving one corner open to vent. Set aside while starting couscous. In deep skillet or saucepan, heat remaining 11/2 cups stock to boiling. Stir in frozen vegetables. When broth resumes boiling, stir in couscous, reduce heat, cover pan and simmer for 2 minutes or until liquid is mostly absorbed. Remove pan from heat. Combine tomatoes, celery, snipped basil and vinaigrette (may be prepared ahead and refrigerated). Set microwave at 50 percent power (MEDIUM) and poach halibut for 2 minutes. Stop the microwave, rotate dish, and restart after pausing about a minute which allows temperature to equalize throughout the fish. Resume cooking at 50 percent power an additional 2 minutes. Let stand for 1 minute then test for doneness. Fish should just begin to flake at the nudge of a fork. If it is necessary to cook longer (microwaves wattage varies), add time in 30 second increments to avoid overcooking.
