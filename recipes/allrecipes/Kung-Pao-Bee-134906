Mix the meat, black bean-garlic sauce, and cooking wine in a small bowl. Wash the mushrooms and soak them in hot water until soft; discard the stems and squeeze out the water. Combine the sauce ingredients in another bowl. Coat a pan with cooking spray and saute the beef over medium heat until it's no longer pink. Remove from the pan and set aside. Recoat the pan and stir-fry the water chestnuts, corn, mushrooms, and peppers for about 1 minute. Return the beef to the pan and stir in the sauce. Mix and cook just enough to heat through (about a minute); don't cook off all the sauce. Sprinkle with sesame oil; garnish with scallions and peanuts. Serve over steamed white rice.
