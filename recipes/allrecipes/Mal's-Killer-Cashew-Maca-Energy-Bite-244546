Put cashews and salt in a food processor fitted with the S-blade; pulse until cashews are finely chopped but not a paste. Add dates, maca powder, cardamom, and olive oil; blend until mixture is evenly combined and holds together. Shape mixture into 10 to 12 balls and refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes.
