In a large bowl, combine the first five ingredients. In another bowl, beat the eggs, milk and butter; stir into the dry ingredients just until moistened. Pour into a greased 9-in. square baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 15 minutes before cutting. Serve warm.
