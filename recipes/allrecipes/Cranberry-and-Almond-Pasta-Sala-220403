Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil until cooked through yet tender, about 12 minutes; drain. Rinse the pasta in cold water until completely chilled; drain. Transfer cool pasta to a large mixing bowl. Toss the ham, celery, dried cranberries, and sliced almonds with the bow-tie pasta to mix evenly. Stir the mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar, and sugar together in a bowl. Pour the mayonnaise dressing over the pasta mixture; toss to coat evenly.
