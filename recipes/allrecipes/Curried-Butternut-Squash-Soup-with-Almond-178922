Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Roast squash for 15 minutes; remove from oven and cut in half, scooping out seeds. Place cut side down on oiled baking sheet and return to oven for 30-35 minutes, until very soft. Remove from oven and let cool. Meanwhile, turn heat down to 350 degrees F. Place almonds on the baking sheet and roast until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large pot. Add onion and garlic; saute on medium heat until onion is translucent. Add curry powder and stir for 2-3 minutes, until fragrant. Cut away peel from squash, and cut into bite-sized pieces. Place curried onion and garlic mixture in a blender or food processor; add enough squash and broth to fill. Add 3/4 cup almonds, reserving the remaining 1/4 for garnish, and process until smooth. Transfer to pot. Puree remaining squash and broth, and transfer to pot. Stir mixture and bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Season with salt. Ladle soup into bowls, swirl 1/4 teaspoon of olive oil on each bowl and top with a dollop of yogurt. Sprinkle remaining almonds on top of yogurt.
