Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until edges start to brown and cheese is bubbling, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and cool to room temperature. Cut melted cheese into squares and form into cones. Freeze cones for 5 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and return pasta to pot. Mix milk, butter, pepperoni, salt, and cheese packet into pasta until evenly combined. Fill cheese cones with macaroni and cheese.
