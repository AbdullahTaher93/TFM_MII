Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix ground turkey, 2/3 of the cranberry sauce, stuffing mix, and eggs together in a bowl until well-combined. Press turkey mixture into a loaf pan. Spoon remaining cranberry sauce over the top. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 170 degrees F (75 degrees C).
