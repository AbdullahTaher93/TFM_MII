Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease muffin pans or line with paper muffin liners. In a large bowl, stir together the brown sugar, white sugar, flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. Make a well in the center, and add the melted butter, milk and eggs, mix until smooth. Stir in the cranberries, apple, figs, and hazelnuts. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin pans. Cups should be at least 3/4 full. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven or until a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean.
