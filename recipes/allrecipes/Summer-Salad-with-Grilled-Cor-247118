Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add corn; cook until almost tender, about 6 minutes. Drain. Preheat grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill corn until charred, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Allow to cool until easily handled, about 10 minutes. Cut kernels off the corn cobs into a large bowl. Stir in white beans, red bell pepper, tomato, spinach, cilantro, Gorgonzola cheese, and chives. Mix olive oil, white vinegar, lemon juice, minced garlic, salt, and black pepper together in a small bowl. Pour over corn mixture and stir to combine. Cover with plastic wrap and chill, at least 1 hour. Top with chopped avocado before serving.
