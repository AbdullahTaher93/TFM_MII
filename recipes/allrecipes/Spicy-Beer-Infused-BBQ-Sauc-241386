Stir beer and jalapenos together in a glass of ceramic bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight. Stir beer mixture, ketchup, vinegar, honey, onion, carrots, lemon juice, black pepper, and mustard together in a saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until flavors combine, about 1 1/2 hours. Blend ketchup mixture with an immersion blender until smooth. Sauce will thicken as it cools.
