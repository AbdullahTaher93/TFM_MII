Mix olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, garlic, dill, salt, and pepper together in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir tilapia in the oil mixture until opaque, about 10 minutes. Transfer tilapia to a bowl and refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes. Reserve liquid in skillet. Combine chilled tilapia, celery, avocado, tomato, olives, jalapeno peppers, and capers in a bowl. Drizzle reserved olive oil-lemon mixture over tilapia mixture; toss to coat. Allow salad to marinate in the refrigerator, at least 30 minutes.
