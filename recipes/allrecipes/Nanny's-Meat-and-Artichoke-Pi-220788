Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place a pie crust into a 10-inch pie pan. Stir eggs, artichoke hearts, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, ham, salami, and black pepper together in a bowl. Pour mixture into prepared pie crust. Top the pie with remaining pie crust and crimp the edges together. Cover the edges of the crust with a liner or pieces of aluminum foil to prevent burning. Slit the top center of crust for ventilation while baking. Bake pie in the preheated oven until crust is brown, about 45 minutes. Cool completely before cutting.
