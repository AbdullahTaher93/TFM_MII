Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray two giant muffin pans (6 cup volume each) with vegetable cooking spray. Set aside. Combine flour, SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend for Baking, baking powder, and salt, in a mixing bowl, stirring until blended. Add milk, butter, peanut butter, vanilla, and molasses; beat at low speed with an electric mixer until well combined. Add eggs and beat at medium speed until lightly blended, 1 to 2 minutes. Spoon batter into prepared pans, filling each cup half full. Place one piece chocolate in center of each cup of batter; top evenly with remaining batter. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes or until muffins are lightly browned and a wooden pick inserted in centers comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack 10 minutes; remove from pan and cool completely before frosting. Combine egg whites, cream of tarter and SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend for Baking in the top of a double boiler; stirring until blended. Cook over simmering water 3-5 minutes, whisking constantly, until SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend for Baking is dissolved. Remove from heat. Beat egg white mixture at low speed with an electric mixer for 5 minutes; increase speed to high and beat 5 minutes, or until stiff peaks form. Spread icing over cupcakes. Place cupcakes in a baking pan. Broil 5 inches from heat (with electric oven door partially open) until icing is lightly browned. Optionally, decorate frosted caps with garnishes when cooled.
