Rinse and drain freekeh. Place freekeh in a bowl with enough water to cover; soak for 10 minutes. Drain. Stir vegetable broth, water, and olive oil together in a large pot; bring to a boil. Stir freekeh, tomato paste, paprika, cumin, turmeric, salt, and black pepper into vegetable broth mixture; bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer freekeh mixture, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is absorbed, about 1 hour. Remove freekeh from heat and let rest for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.
