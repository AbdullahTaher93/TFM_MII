In a bowl, combine soup, 2/3 cup milk and vegetables. Transfer to a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. In a bowl, combine corn bread mix, egg and remaining milk just until blended. Carefully spread over vegetable mixture. Sprinkle with onions (pan will be full). Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until lightly browned and a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.
