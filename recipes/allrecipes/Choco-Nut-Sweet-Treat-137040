Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut cookie dough into 1/2-inch slices. Arrange slices in bottom of ungreased 15x10x1-inch baking pan. Using floured fingers, press dough evenly in pan to form crust. Bake at 350 degrees F for 8 to 12 minutes or until light golden brown. Cool 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in large bowl, beat eggs until foamy. Add all remaining filling ingredients; beat 1 minute at medium speed or until well blended. Spoon and spread filling evenly over partially baked crust. Bake an additional 20 to 25 minutes or until top is deep golden brown and center is set. Cool 5 minutes. In small saucepan, combine chocolate chips and oil. Cook over medium heat until chips are melted, stirring constantly. Carefully pour over filling; gently spread to cover. Sprinkle with pecans. Refrigerate 1 1/2 hours or until chocolate is set. Cut into bars. Store in refrigerator.
