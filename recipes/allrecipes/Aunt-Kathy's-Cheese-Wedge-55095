Gently stir together the Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, butter, olives, seasoned salt, and curry powder in a bowl. Preheat oven broiler. Lightly toast the English muffins in a toaster. Spread each muffin with a portion of the cheese mixture. Arrange muffins on a large baking sheet. Broil topped muffins under the broiler until the cheese bubbles, 3 to 5 minutes. Cut into halves to serve.
