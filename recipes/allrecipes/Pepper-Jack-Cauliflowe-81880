In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter and add the cauliflower. Stir occasionally until the cauliflower starts to take on some color (about 5 minutes). Then add the scallions, chili peppers, cumin and a dash of salt. Cook another 2 minutes, stir frequently. Remove from heat, toss in the pepper jack cheese and transfer the cauliflower to a serving dish or individual plates.
