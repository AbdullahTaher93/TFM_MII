In a bowl, thoroughly mix together the turkey, coriander, salt, brown sugar, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Cover the bowl, and refrigerate the sausage overnight. The next day, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Form the sausage into thin patties, and fry until browned and no longer pink inside, 2 to 5 minutes per side.
