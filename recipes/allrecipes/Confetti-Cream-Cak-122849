In a mixing bowl, beat eggs and vanilla on high until foamy. Add sugar; beat until thick and lemon-colored. Combine flour, baking powder and salt; fold into egg mixture, a third at a time. Pour into two greased and floured 9-in. round baking pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Cool for 5 minutes; remove from pans to wire racks to cool completely. In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, 2/3 cup sugar, vanilla and cinnamon until smooth. Stir in sour cream, nuts, coconut and cherries. Fold in chocolate. Beat cream and remaining sugar; set half aside. Fold remaining whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture. Split each cake into two horizontal layers; spread a fourth of the cream cheese mixture on one layer. Repeat layers. Frost sides with reserved whipped cream. Refrigerate until serving.
