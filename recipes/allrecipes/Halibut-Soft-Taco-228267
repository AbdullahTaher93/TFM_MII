Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Mix mango, avocado, onion, tomatoes, jalapeno pepper, parsley, 2 teaspoons olive oil, lemon juice, and honey in a small bowl. Brush halibut steaks with 1 teaspoon olive oil; season with salt, black pepper, and garlic salt. Place halibut on grill and close lid; cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Place a Bibb lettuce leave atop each tortilla. Divide halibut into 4 portions and nestle into the lettuce leaves. Top with mango mixture and drizzle with taco sauce to serve.
