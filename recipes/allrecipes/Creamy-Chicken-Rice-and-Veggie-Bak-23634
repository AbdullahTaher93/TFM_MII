Preheat oven to broil. Place chicken in a 9 x 13 inch baking dish. In a small bowl combine 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon onion powder, 1 teaspoon black pepper, poultry seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon dried minced onion and oregano. Sprinkle over chicken, coating both sides. Place chicken under broiler for 10 minutes, or until browned and crispy. In a medium bowl combine rice mix, chicken soup and milk; mix well until lumps are gone. Stir in 1 teaspoon garlic, 1 teaspoon onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 2 tablespoons dried minced onion. Take chicken out of oven and remove chicken from pan. Spoon rice mixture into the pan and place chicken on top; cover. Reduce oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Bake for 30 minutes, or until rice and chicken are cooked through.
