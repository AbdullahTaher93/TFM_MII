Place the chicken and coconut milk in a bowl, and marinate in the refrigerator 1 hour. In a pot, bring the rice and water to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 20 minutes. In a small bowl, mix the flour, curry powder, and garlic salt. Drain the chicken, and discard marinade. Dredge chicken in the flour mixture to coat. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the coated chicken strips 5 minutes per side, or until golden brown and juices run clear. Squeeze lime juice over chicken, and discard limes. On each tortilla, place equal amounts of rice, chicken, coconut, and green onions. Wrap burrito style.
