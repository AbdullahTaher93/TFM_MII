Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Poke eggplant with a fork and place on a baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven until skin is charred and eggplant is soft, about 45 minutes. Cool until easily handled, 5 to 10 minutes. Peel eggplant and drain in a colander for 30 minutes. Chop eggplant very finely. Place eggplant in a bowl and blend using an electric mixer. Gradually add oil and keep mixing until incorporated, about 2 minutes. Add yogurt and salt; mix well. Stir in chopped onion.
