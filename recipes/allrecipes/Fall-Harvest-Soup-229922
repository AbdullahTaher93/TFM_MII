Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium heat; cook onions in butter, stirring frequently, until lightly golden brown, about 15 minutes. Pour chicken broth into onions and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, stir sweet potato and carrots into broth mixture; simmer until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir apple, pear, and red pepper into the mixture; simmer until softened, about 5 more minutes. Use an immersion blender to blend the mixture into a smooth puree. Stir pumpkin puree, evaporated milk, honey, allspice, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, salt, and black pepper into soup; puree again with the immersion blender. Ladle into bowls; garnish each serving with a basil leaf.
