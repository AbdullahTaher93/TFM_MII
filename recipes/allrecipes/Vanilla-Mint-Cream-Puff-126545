Prepare Cream Puffs in advance. Cream Puff Filling: In large bowl, combine EAGLE BRAND(r), liqueur and water. Add pudding mix; beat well. Chill 5 minutes. Fold in whipped cream. Chill. Just before serving, fill cream puffs; sprinkle with confectioners sugar. Serve with Hot Fudge Sauce (optional). Store leftovers covered in refrigerator. Cream Puffs: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In medium saucepan, heat water and butter to a rolling boil. Stir in flour. Reduce heat to low; stir rapidly until mixture forms a ball, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Add eggs; beat until smooth. Using about 1/4 cup dough for each, drop 3 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until puffed and golden. Cool. To serve, split and remove any dough from centers of puffs. Hot Fudge Sauce: In heavy saucepan, over medium heat, melt chocolate chips and butter with EAGLE BRAND(r) and water. Cook and stir constantly until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add vanilla. Serve warm over cream puffs. Store leftovers covered in refrigerator.
