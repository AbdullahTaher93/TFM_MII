Cut shiitake caps into 1/4-inch-thick slices. In a 12- to 14-inch nonstick frying pan with a lid, combine shiitake and regular mushrooms with olive oil and ginger over medium-high heat. Cover and cook, stirring often, until mushrooms are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add broth and garlic to pan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then stir in cornstarch mixture until sauce is thickened. Preheat oven broiler. While mushrooms cook, mix together hoisin sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil. Place flank steak on a broiler pan; brush top of steak with about half of the hoisin mixture. Broil steak about 6 inches away from heat until well browned on top, 6 to 7 minutes. Turn steak over and brush with all but 1 tablespoon of the remaining hoisin mixture. Broil until meat is done to your liking (cut to test), 6 to 7 more minutes for rare. Transfer steak to a carving board. Stir remaining 1 tablespoon of the hoisin mixture into mushroom sauce, then transfer sauce to a serving container. Cut steak into thin slices; top servings with spoonfuls of mushroom sauce. Sprinkle with green onions if desired.
