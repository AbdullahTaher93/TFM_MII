Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook 1 minute until fragrant. Add the cut asparagus, and continue cooking until tender, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle in the pistachios, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Cook 1 minute longer. Place the asparagus mixture into a blender or food processor. Add the Parmesan cheese and capers. Process until pureed. Cool before serving.
