In a large mixing bowl, cream butter, shortening and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Sift together flour and baking powder; add alternately with milk and extracts to creamed mixture, beating on low speed just until combined. Fold in nuts. Pour into a greased and floured 10-in. tube pan. Bake at 325 degrees F for about 1 hour and 25 minutes or until cake tests done. Cool 10 minutes on a wire rack before removing from pan. Cool thoroughly. For frosting, beat cream cheese and butter in a medium mixing bowl. Add sugar and mix well. Add vanilla; beat until smooth. Spread on cooled cake. Cake can be made with or without frosting.
