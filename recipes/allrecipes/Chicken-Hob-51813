In a skillet over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until evenly brown. Drain, chop coarsely, and set aside. On 4 large squares of heavy duty aluminum foil, evenly distribute the potatoes, carrots, and onion. Arrange the chicken breasts over the vegetables, and sprinkle with the chopped bacon. Top each with 2 tablespoons butter, and season with garlic salt. Fold the foil over the ingredients, and tightly seal. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Place foil packets on the grill, and cook for 20 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
