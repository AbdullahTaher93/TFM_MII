Place a large skillet or wok over high heat. Heat the oil and butter until smoking. Stir fry the onion, carrot, and garlic until the onion begins to soften, about 1 minute. Add the cabbage, coconut, and curry powder; stir fry for 2 more minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; pour in the coconut milk, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover, and cook to desired doneness. To serve, sprinkle with tomato, green onions, and cilantro.
