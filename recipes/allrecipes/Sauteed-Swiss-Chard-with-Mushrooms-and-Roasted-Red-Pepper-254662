Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until onion is translucent and mushrooms soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in Swiss chard, red pepper, oregano, basil, salt, and black pepper. Cook until Swiss chard is wilted, about 3 minutes. Stir in white wine; cook until Swiss chard is tender, 3 to 4 minutes more.
