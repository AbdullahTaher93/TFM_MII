Break noodles into small pieces (save seasoning envelope for another use). In a skillet over medium heat, saute noodles and walnuts in butter for 5-6 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool. In a large salad bowl, combine the romaine, broccoli, tomatoes and onions. Place dressing ingredients in a blender or food processor; cover and process until sugar is dissolved. Add dressing and noodle mixture to salad; toss to coat. Serve with a slotted spoon.
