Break noodles; set aside. In a jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine the oil, vinegar, sugar, oregano, salt, pepper and half of the contents from the noodle seasoning packet; shake well. (Discard remaining seasoning or save for another use.) In a large bowl, combine the remaining ingredients. Add noodles and dressing; toss to coat. Serve immediately.
