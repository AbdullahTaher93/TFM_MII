Microwave 1/2 cup water in a glass bowl at HIGH 1 minute. Cut lemon grass into 1-inch pieces; add to water, cover and let stand 5 minutes. Process lemon grass mixture, lime juice, sugar, Szechwan seasoning and salt in a food processor or blender 30 seconds or until blended. Place chicken in a shallow dish or self-closing plastic bag; add lemon grass mixture. Cover and let stand 15 minutes. Remove chicken from marinade, reserving marinade. Cook chicken in hot oil in a large skillet over medium heat 7-9 minutes on each side or until done. (Be careful not to over-brown chicken). Remove from skillet; set aside. Add reserved marinade to skillet and cook, stirring constantly, 3 minutes. Mix remaining 1/2 cup water and cornstarch; stir into marinade and cook, stirring constantly, 2 minutes or until slightly thickened. Pour glaze through a fine wire-mesh strainer into a bowl, discarding solids. Serve chicken over rice; pour glaze over chicken.
