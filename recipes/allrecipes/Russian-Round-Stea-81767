Mince the scallions and reserve about 1/2 of the green portion for a garnish at the end. Cut the steak into strips against the grain (or in cubes if you prefer). Heat the butter and oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the meat. You might want to do this in several batches. If the meat is over crowded then it will not brown sufficiently. Add the scallions (less the reserved green portion) at the end of the last batch. Add the wine and return all the meat to the skillet. Add the mushrooms with their liquid, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, paprika, salt and pepper. Blend all together and reduce heat to a simmer. Cover and cook at your lowest heat for 1 hour or more. Check on it, and stir occasionally and to be sure it is not boiling. Five minutes before serving, add the sour cream and stir to incorporate. Taste test and add salt or pepper as needed.
