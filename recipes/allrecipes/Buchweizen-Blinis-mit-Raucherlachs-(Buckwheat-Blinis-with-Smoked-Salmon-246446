Dissolve yeast in warm milk in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. Stir in buckwheat flour and sugar; cover with a towel. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Whisk all-purpose flour, eggs, heavy whipping cream, sour cream, and salt into buckwheat mixture until smooth batter forms. Cover with a towel and let stand until batter is frothy and doubled in volume again, about 2 hours. Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a non-stick skillet over high heat. Drop batter by tablespoonfuls onto skillet; cook until small bubbles rise to the top and edges are dry, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until evenly browned on other side, about 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter. Top each blini with 1 salmon strip, a teaspoon-sized dollop of sour cream, and a sprinkle of dill.
