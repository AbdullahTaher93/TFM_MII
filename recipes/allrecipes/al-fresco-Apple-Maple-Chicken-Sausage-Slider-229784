In a small non-stick frying pan, gently brown the chicken sausage. Remove and keep warm. Crack the eggs in a small bowl, whisk with the milk and black pepper. Place a medium skillet that has been prepared with the cooking spray over medium heat. Scramble the eggs until done but still a bit soft (about 2 - 3 minutes.) While the sausage and eggs are cooking, prepare the mini bagels by toasting, and spread the top and bottom with the apple jelly. Divide the scrambled eggs and the cooked sausage on top of the jellied bottoms of the mini bagels. Top each egg portion with a sprinkle of the shredded cheddar cheese, then put the top of the bagel on the cheese to make the slider.
