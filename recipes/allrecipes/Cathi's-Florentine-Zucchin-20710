Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Meanwhile, heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Saute onion and garlic until onions begin to soften. Stir in zucchini and season with salt and pepper. Increase the heat to medium-high and add the wine. Allow it to reduce by half, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in ricotta and cinnamon. Heat through and season with salt and pepper. Add drained pasta to skillet and toss. Serve immediately.
