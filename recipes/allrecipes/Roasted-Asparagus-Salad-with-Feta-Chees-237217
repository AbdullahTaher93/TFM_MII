Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place asparagus in a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil over asparagus and season with garlic powder; toss well. Transfer asparagus to a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until asparagus are tender, about 20 minutes. Place lettuce in the same bowl used for asparagus; top with tomatoes, feta cheese, and asparagus.
