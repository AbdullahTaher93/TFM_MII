Cut shallots into three horizontal slices. In a large skillet, cook shallots in butter over low heat for 2-3 minutes or just until softened. Add the scallops, wine, salt and pepper. Bring just to a boil and poach for 1-2 minutes over low heat. Using a slotted spoon, remove scallops and drain on paper towels. Boil poaching liquid, uncovered, over high heat for about 10-15 minutes or until reduced to 5-6 tablespoons. Add cream; return to a boil. Combine cornstarch and water until smooth. Stir into sauce; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until slightly thickened. Reduce heat to low; adjust seasonings if desired. Return scallops to skillet and heat through. Add lemon juice and sprinkle with parsley.
