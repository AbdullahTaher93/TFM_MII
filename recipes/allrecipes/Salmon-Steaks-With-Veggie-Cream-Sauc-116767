Place the salmon steaks in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with lemon juice and salt. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, combine the onions, peas, cream cheese, milk and dill. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce is heated through. In a small skillet, saute bread crumbs in butter until lightly browned. Spoon the sauce over salmon steaks; sprinkle with toasted crumbs.
