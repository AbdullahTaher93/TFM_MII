Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the limeade concentrate, white wine, garlic, salt, pepper, and thyme. Cook, stirring, until the butter is melted. Remove from heat. Place leg of lamb onto the preheated grill, and cook basting frequently for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the internal temperature has reached at least 145 degrees F (62 degrees C).
