Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Grease a 10-inch tube (or bundt) pan with CRISCO(R) Shortening. Dust lightly with flour; set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine all ingredients low speed. Beat for 3 minutes at medium speed. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake 50 to 60 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. In a small bowl, combine lemon juice and confectioners' sugar until smooth. Brush over warm cake. (The glaze will be thin and absorbed into cake.)
