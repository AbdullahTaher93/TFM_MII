Combine wine, olive oil and seasonings in a large self-closing plastic bag. Place steak in bag and seal. Turn bag gently to distribute marinade. Refrigerate 30 minutes or up to 3 hours for a stronger flavor. Turn bag occasionally. Lightly grease grill rack. Preheat grill to medium heat. Remove steak from marinade; reserving marinade. Grill 8-10 minutes per side or until desired doneness. Brush with reserved marinade after turning. Discard leftover marinade. Cut into thin slices across the grain.
