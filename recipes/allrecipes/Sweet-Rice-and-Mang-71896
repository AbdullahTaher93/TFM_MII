Combine the rice and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, until water is absorbed. Mix the desired amount of sugar into the hot rice. Portion the rice into 4 bowls. Top with mango slices, and pour some cream of coconut over the top of each bowl.
