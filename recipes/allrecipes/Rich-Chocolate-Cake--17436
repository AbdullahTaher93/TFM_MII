Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9 inch pan. In a medium bowl, mix together the egg, milk and oil. Stir in the sugar, cocoa and flour, mix until smooth. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
