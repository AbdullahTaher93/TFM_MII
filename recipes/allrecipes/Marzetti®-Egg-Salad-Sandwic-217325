To make salad, combine all ingredients for salad in a large bowl and mix well. Cover and refrigerate until ready to assemble sandwiches. To assemble sandwiches, spread Marzetti Slaw Dressing on 6 to 8 pieces of toast or bread; divide and spread egg salad atop. Layer with lettuce, tomato and onion; cover with remaining toast or bread. Serve sandwiches with Marzetti Apple Cabbage Slaw.
