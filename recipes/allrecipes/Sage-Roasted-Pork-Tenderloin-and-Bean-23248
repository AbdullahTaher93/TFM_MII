Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Combine beans, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, lemon rind, and 1 teaspoon sage; place in 13x9 inch baking pan. Cut slits in tenderloins with sharp paring knife and insert slivers of garlic; sprinkle pork lightly with pepper and remaining 1 teaspoon sage. Place on top of bean mixture; drizzle with oil. Roast at 425 F. until pork is done and juices run clear, 35 to 40 minutes. Spoon bean mixture onto rimmed serving platter; slice pork and arrange on beans.
