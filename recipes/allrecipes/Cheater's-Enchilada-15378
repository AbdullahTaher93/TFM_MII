Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, combine the sour cream and 3/4 of the cheese. Into a 9x13 inch pan, pour a small amount of enchilada sauce to coat bottom of pan. Layer 6 tortillas on bottom of pan. Layer half of the cheese-sour cream mixture and 1/3 of the olives over the tortillas. Repeat this layer once more. Pour the remaining enchilada sauce over the final layer of tortillas. Bake for 20 minutes. Cut into squares and serve.
