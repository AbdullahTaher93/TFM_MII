Bring chicken broth and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and broth has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Mix venison, onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, egg, garlic, paprika, cumin, sea salt, blackened seasoning, and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir venison mixture until browned, about 15 minutes. Add quinoa; cook and stir until heated through, about 2 minutes.
