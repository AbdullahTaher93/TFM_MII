In a bowl, combine bran, flour, and soda. In a large bowl, beat sugar and butter until smooth. Add buttermilk, coffee, corn syrup, and egg; beat to blend. Stir in flour mixture and raisins just until evenly moistened. Equally fill 12 greased or paper-lined muffin cups (2 1/2-inch in diameter); cups will be full. Bake in a 375 degrees F oven until tops spring back when firmly pressed, about 25 minutes.
