In a blender, whirl blueberries, simple syrup, and lemon juice with just enough limoncello to make a smooth slush. (For a firmer slush, pour into a small bowl and freeze for up to 2 hours. To store up to 2 weeks, put slush in a resealable freezer bag, seal, and freeze. To use, let stand at room temperature a few minutes to soften slightly.) Divide berry slush among 4 tall glasses (8- to 12-ounce size), add equal portions limoncello; fill with club soda. Garnish with fresh berries on skewers; swizzle as you sip.
