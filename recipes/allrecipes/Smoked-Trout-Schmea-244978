Place crumbled trout and softened cream cheese in a bowl. Add lemon juice, dill, chives, capers, horseradish, black pepper, salt, and cayenne pepper. Mix together with a fork until mixture achieves the chunkiness or creaminess you prefer. Transfer to a ramekin; wrap with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 2 or 3 hours before serving to let flavors develop.
