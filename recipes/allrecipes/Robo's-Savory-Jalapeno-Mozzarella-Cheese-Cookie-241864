Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Flatten dough portions into rounds. Separate minced jalapeno pepper into 8 portions; press each dough round into 1 portion jalapeno pepper so that peppers are imbedded in one side of the dough. Place dough, pepper-side up, on a baking sheet. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over the top of each dough round and top with salt. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and cheese is melted, 12 to 15 minutes.
