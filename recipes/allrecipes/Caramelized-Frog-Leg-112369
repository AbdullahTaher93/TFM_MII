Stir together the soy sauce, honey, garlic, and ginger. Toss frog legs in marinade to coat evenly, then set aside to marinate for 1 hour. Drain the frog legs well, reserving marinade. Season with salt and pepper, and toss with cornstarch to coat. Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the legs until golden brown and crispy, about 2 minutes per side. While the legs are cooking, bring the marinade to a simmer in a small saucepan, and simmer for 3 minutes. To serve, pour sauce over the frog legs and sprinkle with sliced green onion.
