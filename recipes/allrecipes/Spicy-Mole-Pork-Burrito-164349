Cook rice in water as directed on package. Meanwhile, in small bowl, mix onion, garlic, chili powder, cumin, cinnamon and salt; set aside. In another small bowl, mix chipotle chile, preserves, green chiles, raisins, cocoa and almonds; set aside. In 12-inch skillet, cook pork over medium-high heat 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until no longer pink; drain. Stir onion mixture into pork; cook over medium heat 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in preserves mixture, broth and enchilada sauce; heat to boiling. Reduce heat to low. Simmer uncovered 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in beans and rice; cook 2 to 3 minutes or until hot and bubbly. To serve, place burritos, folded sides down, on plates. Garnish each serving with about 1 tablespoon sour cream and cilantro sprigs. Serve with tortilla chips. Meanwhile, heat tortillas as directed on package. To assemble, spoon slightly less than 1/2 cup pork filling down center of each tortilla. Sprinkle about 1 tablespoon cheese over filling on each. Fold in ends of each tortilla; fold sides toward center, overlapping edges.
