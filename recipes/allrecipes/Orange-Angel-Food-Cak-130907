Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. In a small bowl, stir together the sugar and orange peel. Set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the flour and salt. Set aside. In a large bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until foamy. Add the cream of tartar, vanilla, and 1 tablespoon of the orange juice. Beat on high speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar mixture, beating until the peaks are stiff and glossy. Gently fold in the flour mixture. Pour the batter into an ungreased tube pan with a removable bottom. Using a knife, cut through the batter several times to release any air bubbles. Bake for 45 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and springy to the touch. Invert the cake onto the neck of a wine bottle and cool completely. Run a knife along the inside edges of the pan to loosen the cake and transfer to a cake plate. In a small bowl, combine the confectioners sugar and the remaining 3 tablespoons orange juice. Drizzle the glaze over the top of the cake, allowing it to drip slightly down the sides.
