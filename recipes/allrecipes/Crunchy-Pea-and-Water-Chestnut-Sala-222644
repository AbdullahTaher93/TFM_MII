Place frozen peas in a colander; rinse under hot water to thaw. Drain. Mix peas, carrots, water chestnuts, and green onions together in a bowl. Whisk vegetable oil, red wine vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, sugar, paprika, and dry mustard together in a separate bowl; pour over pea mixture. Marinate salad for at least 1 hour. Stir mayonnaise into salad just before serving.
