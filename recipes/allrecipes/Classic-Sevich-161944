Place seafood in an even layer in a shallow 1-1/2 quart casserole dish. Combine remaining ingredients; pour over seafood. Cover and refrigerate at least 24 hours or until seafood is opaque. Rice vinegar and lime juice 'cook' the seafood as it marinates overnight. Transfer seafood with a slotted spoon to a serving dish; discard marinade. Serve as an appetizer in endive leaves, or with crusty French bread.
