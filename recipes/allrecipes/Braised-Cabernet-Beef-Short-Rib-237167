Season ribs with salt, garlic powder, and black pepper. Sprinkle flour over both sides of the ribs. Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook about half the garlic in the hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes; add short ribs and cook until completely browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Pour beef broth and wine into the pot; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Transfer ribs and liquid to the crock of your slow cooker; put remaining garlic and sliced onion atop the ribs. Cook on Low for 5 hours. Remove ribs to a wide and shallow serving bowl. Ladle liquid from crock into a large skillet. Bring the liquid in a skillet to a boil and cook until reduced in volume by half, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour sauce over the ribs and turn ribs to coat.
