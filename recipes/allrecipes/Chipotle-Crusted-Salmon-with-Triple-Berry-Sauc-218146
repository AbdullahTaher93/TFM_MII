Spray cool grill grates with no-stick cooking spray. Heat grill to medium. Blend brown sugar, chipotle powder, cumin and salt. Coat the skin side of the fish with no-stick cooking spray. Spread rub mixture onto top of fish (not skin side). Cook fillets skin side down on grate. Grill fish 12 to 15 minutes or until opaque throughout. Combine preserves with lime juice in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave 15-20 seconds on HIGH. Drizzle over salmon. Garnish generously with grated lime peel.
