Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Unroll dough; separate into four rectangles. Press onto bottom and up sides of 15x10x3/4-inch baking pan to form crust, firmly pressing seams and perforations together to seal. Bake 11 to 13 min. or until golden brown; cool. Mix cream cheese spread, dressing, dill weed and onion salt until well blended. Spread onto crust; top with remaining ingredients. Refrigerate at least 2 hours before cutting to serve.
