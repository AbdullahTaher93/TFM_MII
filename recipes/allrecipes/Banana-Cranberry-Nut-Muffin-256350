Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 muffin tins with paper liners. Sift flour, oat bran, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together into a large bowl. Beat brown sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth. Beat in bananas, almond milk, and cranberries. Fold in flour mixture. Stir walnuts into the batter. Fill each muffin liner with 1 tablespoon batter. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
