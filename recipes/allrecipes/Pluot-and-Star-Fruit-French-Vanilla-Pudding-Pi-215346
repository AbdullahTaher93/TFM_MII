Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Place the pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish. Bake the prepared pie crust in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. Whisk together the milk and instant pudding in a large bowl; set aside. Slice 5 thin, attractive star-shaped slices from the middle of the star fruit, and reserve. Finely chop the rest of the star fruit. Cut and reserve 10 thin, attractive half moon-shaped slices of a pluot, and reserve; finely chop the rest of the pluots. Stir chopped fruit into the prepared pudding. Pour the pudding mixture into the baked pie crust; refrigerate until set, about 10 minutes. Arrange the reserved slices of star fruit and pluot over the pie, and serve.
