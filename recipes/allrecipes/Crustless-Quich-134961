Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; add the onions and cook until soft. Boil the asparagus in water for 1 minute, then drain. Cover a 10-inch pie plate with nonstick spray; spread the onions, asparagus, potatoes, and cheese on the bottom. Sprinkle with the flour and stir. Beat the eggs with the milk and add salt and pepper to taste; pour over the asparagus-potato filling. Bake at 325 degrees F for 40 to 45 minutes. Brown the top under the broiler.
