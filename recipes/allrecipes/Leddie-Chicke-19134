Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish and season with salt and pepper to taste. Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat; add green onion and saute for 1 minute, then stir in soup and water. Mix well and pour mixture over chicken. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 60 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside.
