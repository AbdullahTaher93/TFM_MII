Bring stock to a simmer in a small saucepan. Reduce heat to low and keep stock warm until ready to use. Heat olive oil in a deep skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in the hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Add rice; cook and stir until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour wine into the risotto and stir to combine. Pour about 1 cup of the warm stock into the risotto; cook and stir until nearly all the liquid is absorbed. Repeat with remaining stock until the risotto is thick, and the rice is still firm to the bite, 20 to 25 minutes. Test the risotto after 15 minutes. If you run out of stock before the rice is cooked, you can add warm water, 1 cup at a time, and cook, stirring continuously, until it is absorbed. Remove risotto from the stove. Add butter and Parmesan cheese; stir until melted. Season with salt and white pepper.
