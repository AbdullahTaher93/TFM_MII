PREP: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. CLEAN: Wash hands. Generously coat hens inside and out with mixture of melted butter and wine. Place on individual Cornish roasting racks; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place in roasting pan with 1 1/4 cups water. CLEAN: Wash hands. COOK: Roast at 450 degrees F for 15 minutes; reduce temperature to 375 degrees F and roast 30 minutes longer or until internal juices of chicken run clear. (Or insert instant-read meat thermometer in thickest part of hen. Temperature should read 180 degrees F.) Meanwhile, combine glaze sauce ingredients and heat until jelly melts. The last 10 minutes of cooking, brush hens with glaze sauce. Brush with glaze again after cooking. SERVE: Serve with hot buttered rolls and vegetables, if desired.
