Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add beef; cook and stir until browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in onions, celery, and garlic. Cook and stir until onions are translucent, about 10 minutes. Bring 5-quarts of water to a boil in a 10-quart soup pot. Stir in bouillon cubes; cook until dissolved. Add salt, ground black pepper, basil, thyme, oregano, and bay leaves; simmer until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Stir in beef mixture; simmer until meat is tender, about 1 hour and 30 minutes. Stir potatoes, carrots, Swiss chard, and parsley into the soup pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer until potatoes are soft, about 20 minutes.
