To make burgers: Mash sweet potatoes and tomato paste in mixing bowl with a fork. Mix in the ground turkey or beef until thoroughly blended. Portion in 1/4-cup portions and form into 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick burgers, about 3-inches across. Heat a heavy skillet over medium-high heat and spray with oil. Cook burgers covered until no longer pink inside, about 4 minutes per side. The internal temperature of the patties should be 165 degrees F.
