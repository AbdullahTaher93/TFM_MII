Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above the cooking grate only 2 to 3 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). While grill heats, arrange chicken, onions, and asparagus in 2 large, shallow pans. Brush all over with oil and sprinkle all over with tarragon, then salt and pepper to taste. Lay onions on cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Turn onions over with a wide spatula, then add chicken to grill. Brown chicken on underside, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn onions and chicken over, then add asparagus. Cook, turning foods often with spatula and tongs, until chicken is no longer pink in thickest part (cut to test) and vegetables are tender-crisp, 5 to 10 minutes more. As ingredients are done, lift to a platter. Arrange chicken, onions, and asparagus on platter. Sprinkle blue cheese on top.
