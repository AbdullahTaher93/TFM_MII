Transfer broccoli to strainer and run under cold water to stop cooking. Dry cauliflower and broccoli with paper towels and place in prepared baking dish. Melt 1/2 cup butter in saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour to form a thick paste. Continue whisking constantly until flour begins to brown, about 4 minutes.
