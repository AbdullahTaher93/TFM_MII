In a 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat, bring 3 quarts water to a boil. Add corn; cook just until tender when pierced, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain well and let cool. Meanwhile, make vinaigrette: In a small bowl, whisk together lime peel, lime juice, grapefruit juice, garlic, honey, mustard, and chili flakes. Cut corn from cobs and place kernels in a large bowl. Add beans, bell pepper, onion, and cilantro. Pour vinaigrette over bean mixture; mix well. Garnish with cilantro sprigs.
