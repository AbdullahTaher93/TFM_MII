Melt the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute, or until soft. Add the zucchini, yellow squash, broth or water, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 6 minutes, or until the squash are tender. Remove from the heat. Sprinkle with the walnuts and cheese.
