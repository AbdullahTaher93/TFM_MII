Cut sausage on an angle into 1/2-inch slices. Heat a large skillet over medium heat for 2 minutes; add sausage, onions and peppers. Cook, stirring frequently 5-6 minutes or until sausage is lightly browned and vegetables are tender. Add peas and cook 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally until peas are hot. Gently stir in cooked rice, soup, milk and mushrooms if desired; heat through.
