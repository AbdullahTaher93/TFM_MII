Combine bone-in beef shanks, boneless beef shanks, oxtail, and onion in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until beef is browned, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Stir beef broth, tomatoes, salt, and pepper into the pot. Simmer gently over medium heat, partially covered, until tomatoes break down, about 1 hour. Stir potatoes, yuca, corn, and carrot into the pot carefully with a wooden spoon. Add cilantro. Pour in enough water to cover vegetables; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring carefully to avoiding mashing the vegetables, until potatoes are tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Stir cabbage and zucchini into the pot. Simmer until zucchini is soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Discard bones before serving.
