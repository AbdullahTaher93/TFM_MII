Heat 2 tablespoons chicken fat in a large skillet over medium-low heat and cook onions, stirring often, until browned, about 20 minutes. Transfer onions to a food processor, leaving fat in the skillet. Cook chicken livers in hot skillet until firm, lighter in color, and no longer red in the centers, about 10 minutes. Place livers into food processor with onions and add 2 more tablespoons chicken fat, egg yolks, salt, and black pepper. Process until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.
