Cut the potatoes lengthwise into 1/2 inch-thick slices. Dump the slices and remaining ingredients into a large resealable bag and shake until the slices are well coated. Drain the excess oil from the bag and spread the chips in a single layer on a cookie sheet. Broil for approximately 5 minutes, flip your chips, and continue broiling until golden brown.
