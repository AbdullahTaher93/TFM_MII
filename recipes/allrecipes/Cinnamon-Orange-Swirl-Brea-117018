In a small mixing bowl, cream shortening and 1/2 cup sugar. Add the egg, sour cream and vanilla; mix well. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; stir into creamed mixture just until moistened. Pour half of the batter into a 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Combine the cinnamon, orange peel and remaining sugar; set aside 1-1/2 teaspoons for topping. Sprinkle remaining cinnamon mixture over batter. Carefully top with remaining batter; cut through batter with a knife to swirl. Sprinkle with reserved cinnamon mixture. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
