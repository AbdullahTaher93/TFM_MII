Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add rotelle pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. Cook the frozen vegetables in the microwave approximately 4 to 6 minutes, making sure they stay crisp; drain. In a large bowl mix together Italian dressing, mustard, seasoning salt, and pepper. Add pasta, mixed vegetables, bell pepper, turkey, 1/2 of the bacon and 1/2 of the cheese; mix well. Sprinkle remainder of cheese and bacon on the top. Cover and chill thoroughly before serving.
