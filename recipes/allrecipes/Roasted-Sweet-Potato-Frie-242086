Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet and place in the oven. Place sweet potatoes in a large bowl. Add olive oil, salt, and pepper; toss to coat. Spread sweet potatoes onto the baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Turn the fries and continue baking until brown and crispy, about 15 minutes more.
