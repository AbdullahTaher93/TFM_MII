Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring water to a boil in a saucepan. Stir stuffing mix into the water, place a lid on the saucepan, and remove pan from heat. Let sit until the stuffing is thickened, about 5 minutes. Fluff stuffing with a fork. Mix sauerkraut, chicken, Swiss cheese, and Cheddar cheese together in a large bowl. Stir enough French dressing into the sauerkraut mixture to moisten to your liking; spread into a casserole dish. Spread stuffing over the sauerkraut mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until browned along the edges, about 25 minutes.
