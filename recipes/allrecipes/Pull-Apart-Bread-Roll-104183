Thoroughly combine Morton(R) Nature's Seasons(R) seasoning blend with herbs. Arrange 10 to 12 frozen rolls in bottom of greased 10x4 inch tube pan. Brush rolls with butter, sprinkle with 1/3 of Nature's Seasons/herb blend, then cheese. Repeat layers of rolls, butter, herb blend and cheese an additional two times. Use complete package of rolls.

(If pan has removable sides, release sides first, then invert pan to remove loaf.)
