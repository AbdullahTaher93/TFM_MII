To make any of the sandwich fillings break the canned chicken, turkey, tuna or ham into flakes in a mixing bowl. Add the seasoning and mayonnaise and mix to combine. Note: The amount of each sandwich filling is enough to make 12 sandwiches. Trim the bread slices into tombstone shapes. Toast in a toaster oven until the bread has browned. Divide the filling between half of the toasted bread slices and spread evenly. Assemble into sandwiches with the remaining toasted bread slices. Decorate each sandwich with R.I.P. or skull and crossbones with ketchup or mustard in squirt bottles. To serve: Arrange shredded lettuce on a large tray and set the sandwiches on the end in the field of lettuce-like tombstones in a graveyard.
