Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Cut lengthwise slit in each pork tenderloin, cutting to but not through the other side. Set pork aside. Melt butter in large saucepan over medium heat. Add mushrooms and green onions; cook until tender. Remove from heat. Stir in cooked long grain and wild rice mix, pecans and parsley. Set aside 3/4 cup of the rice mixture. Spoon remaining rice mixture into 1 1/2-quart casserole; cover and set aside. Divide 3/4 cup rice mixture between slits in pork tenderloins, spreading evenly in slits. Close slits; secure with toothpicks. Stir together Italian seasoning and salt in small bowl. Sprinkle evenly over top of pork tenderloins. Place pork tenderloins on rack in shallow roasting pan. Roast tenderloins, uncovered, for 25-30 minutes until internal temperature is 160 degrees F. Bake casserole of rice mixture alongside tenderloins. Meanwhile, for sauce, combine Alfredo sauce and Chardonnay in medium saucepan. Cook and stir over low heat until bubbly. To serve, spoon rice mixture onto serving platter. Remove toothpicks from tenderloins. Cut pork tenderloins into 1-inch-thick pieces; arrange on rice mixture on platter. Serve sauce with pork and rice mixture.
