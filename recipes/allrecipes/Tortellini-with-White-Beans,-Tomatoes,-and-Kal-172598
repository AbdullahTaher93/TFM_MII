Heat oil in a wide frying pan over high heat. Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds. Add kale and the 1/3 cup water; cover and simmer until kale is wilted (about 30 minutes). Add beans, then tomatoes and their liquid; bring to a boil. Then reduce heat and simmer until flavors are blended (7 to 8 minutes). Meanwhile, cook tortellini according to package directions. Drain well and pour into a large bowl. Season kale mixture to taste with salt and chilies; add to pasta and toss to mix. Spoon onto individual plates or into shallow bowls. Offer cheese to add to taste.
