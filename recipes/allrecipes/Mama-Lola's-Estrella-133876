Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add pasta and onion; cook, stirring constantly, until pasta is lightly browned and onions are translucent. Dissolve chicken bouillon into hot water. Pour into the pot with pasta. Stir in tomatoes, cilantro, cumin, garlic salt, and pepper. Cover and set heat to low. Simmer the pasta for 20 minutes until the water is almost gone. It will remain a little soupy.
