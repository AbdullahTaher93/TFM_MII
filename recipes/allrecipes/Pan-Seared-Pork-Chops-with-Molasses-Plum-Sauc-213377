Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion; cook 3 minutes or until tender, stirring frequently. Stir in chicken broth, blueberries, vinegar, molasses, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, coriander, and plums; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes or until plums are tender and mixture is thick. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Coat pan with cooking spray. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper over chops. Add chops to pan; cook 2 minutes on each side or until browned. Reduce heat to medium; cook 4 minutes or until done. Remove chops from pan; cover and keep warm. Add plum mixture to pan, and bring to a simmer. Cook 2 minutes, scraping pan to loosen browned bits. Spoon plum mixture over pork. Garnish with parsley, if desired.
