Melt the butter in a deep pan over medium heat. Add the green onions, and cook until soft. Stir in the cucumbers, vinegar, chicken broth, water, chile peppers, parsley, cilantro, lemon grass, garlic, fish sauce, soy sauce, and ginger. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Simmer over medium heat until the cucumbers are soft, about 20 minutes. Stir in the sour cream until evenly blended, and simmer 10 minutes more.
