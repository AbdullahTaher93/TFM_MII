In a cup, combine the cumin, coriander, and cinnamon. Reserve 1/2 teaspoon for the chutney. Stir the salt and pepper into the spice mixture in the cup. Rub over both sides of the chops. Place the chops on a plate, cover, and let stand at room temperature. Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 minutes, or until soft. Add the apples, apricots, prunes, water, apple juice concentrate, and the reserved 1/2 teaspoon spice mixture. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, or until the fruit is very tender and the juices have thickened into a glaze. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm. Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chops and cook for 6 minutes, turning once, or until a thermometer inserted in the center of a chop registers 160 degrees F and the juices run clear. Serve the pork with the chutney.
