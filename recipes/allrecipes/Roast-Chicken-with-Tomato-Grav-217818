Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Brush the chicken all over with vegetable oil; place in a large roasting pan. Scatter the potatoes, carrots, parsnips and onion, rosemary and garlic evenly around the chicken. Season chicken and vegetables with salt and pepper. Drizzle vegetables evenly with tomato juice. Roast, covered, for 45 minutes. Stir the vegetables. Roast, uncovered, for 30 minutes or until vegetables are tender and an instant-read thermometer reads 180F (82C) when inserted into the chicken breast and thigh. Rest the chicken for 10 minutes before carving. Use a slotted spoon to transfer vegetables to a serving dish. Pour pan juices into a gravy boat (discard any fat on top). Serve chicken and roasted vegetables with juices on the side.
