Mix water, yeast, and sugar together in the bowl of a stand mixer until sugar is dissolved. Add bread flour, olive oil, and salt. Knead using the dough hook attachment until dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Cover dough and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight. Punch dough gently to deflate. Divide into 2 pieces on a lightly floured surface. Shape into balls; cover with a damp cloth and let rest, 2 to 3 hours. Flatten or stretch out dough to desired thickness.
