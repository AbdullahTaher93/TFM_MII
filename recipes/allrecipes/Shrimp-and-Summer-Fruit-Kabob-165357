Heat oil in a small skillet until very hot. Add garlic and cook briefly until aromatic; do not allow the garlic to brown. Remove from heat immediately and stir in herbs; set aside. Cut peach, plum and nectarine into 1-inch chunks and thread onto skewers alternately with shrimp and lemon slices. Brush lightly with garlic-herb oil. Grill over medium-high heat for 3 to 5 minutes per side or until shrimp is pink and cooked through. Remove from grill and drizzle with remaining oil.
