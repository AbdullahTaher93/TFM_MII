Halve cucumbers lengthwise. With a spoon, scoop out and discard seeds. Slice crosswise into 1/8-inch thick pieces. Place in a colander set over a bowl, and toss with 2 teaspoons salt; let stand 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine yogurt, dill, vinegar, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Remove cucumbers from colander, and pat dry with paper towels. Add to bowl with yogurt dressing; toss to combine. Garnish with dill sprigs, if desired, and serve.
