In a medium bowl, mix salmon, crushed cornflakes, and onion. Blend in the eggs. Season with basil, oregano, and thyme. Form the mixture into 1 inch balls. Roll in flour to lightly coat. Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet or deep fryer to approximately 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In batches, fry the salmon balls for about 15 minutes, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
