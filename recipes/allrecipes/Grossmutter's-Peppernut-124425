In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs and sugar at medium speed for 15 minutes. Reduce speed and slowly add flour and anise. Mix until well combined. On a lightly floured surface, shape dough into ropes about 1/2 in. in diameter. Chill 1 hour. Slice ropes into 1/2-in. lengths. Place on greased bookie sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 6-8 minutes or until set. Cookies will harden upon standing. When cool, store in airtight containers; they are best if allowed to age before serving.
