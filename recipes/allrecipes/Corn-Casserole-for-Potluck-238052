Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 5x7-inch casserole dishes. Stir cream-style corn, whole kernel corn, Cheddar cheese, eggs, butter, flour, bell pepper, sugar, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl; divide between prepared casserole dishes. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of either casserole comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
