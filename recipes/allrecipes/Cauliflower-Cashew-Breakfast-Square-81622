Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 8x8 casserole dish (you can lightly dust it with whey powder if you have some handy). Chop the cauliflower and cashews. Mince the bell pepper and scallions. In a large bowl, gently toss the cauliflower, cashews, bell pepper, scallions, oregano and about 1/2 of the cheese. Press this into the casserole dish. No need to clean that bowl yet, add the eggs, milk, and the salt & pepper. Beat the eggs well. Pour over the cauliflower mixture. Sprinkle the remaining cheese and dust with the paprika. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40 minutes. Let cool for about 5 or 10 minutes before cutting into 6 pieces.
