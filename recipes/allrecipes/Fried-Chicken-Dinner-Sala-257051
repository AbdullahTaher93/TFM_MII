Beat egg in a shallow dish. Mix bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese together in a shallow dish. Season chicken with Cajun seasoning. Dip chicken into beaten egg and dredge in bread crumb mixture, pressing lightly to coat evenly. Heat olive oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook breaded chicken in the hot oil until golden brown, about 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drain chicken on paper towels. Slice into strips. Divide lettuce, tomato, carrots, and hard-boiled eggs between 2 large pasta bowls. Top with sliced chicken; drizzle salad dressing on top.
