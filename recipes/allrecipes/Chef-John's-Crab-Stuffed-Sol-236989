Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly oil a baking dish. Combine crab, poblano pepper, panko bread crumbs, green onion, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Stir mayonnaise, lemon zest, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Place sole fillets, flat-side up, on a work surface. Season fillets with salt. Divide crab mixture between fillets and roll filets up around filling. Place rolled sole in the prepared baking dish. Spread 1/2 the mayonnaise mixture over the sides and tops of each sole roll to coat. Place remaining 1/2 the mayonnaise mixture in a piping bag. Pipe mayonnaise mixture in a zigzag pattern over the top of each roll and sprinkle paprika over the top. Bake in the preheated oven until browned on top and fish flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes.
