In a blender, combine the ginger, lemon zest, lemon juice, vinegar, scallions, soy sauce, and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Pulse to chop. Add the oil and puree until smooth. In a large glass or stainless-steel bowl, combine the watercress, romaine, avocados, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Toss the salad with all but 3 tablespoons of the vinaigrette and mound the salad on plates. Toss the crabmeat with the remaining vinaigrette. Spoon the dressed crabmeat over the salads.
