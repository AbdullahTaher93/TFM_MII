Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place ham in a roasting pan. In a small bowl, stir together 1/2 cup brown sugar and 2 tablespoons sherry cooking wine. Brush half the glaze over the ham. Roast ham uncovered approximately 20 minutes per pound or until internal temperature is 160 degrees F. See ham wrapper for precise cooking time and temperature; directions may vary. Brush remaining glaze over ham halfway through cooking time. For Sherry-Orange Dijon Sauce, combine 1/2 cup brown sugar, cornstarch, cloves and nutmeg in a 1-quart saucepan. Stir to remove lumps. Stir in mustard until mixture is a smooth paste. Gradually stir in sherry cooking wine and orange juice. Add raisins. Cook sauce over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until mixture boils. Reduce heat and boil gently 3 to 5 minutes. Serve sauce with sliced ham.
