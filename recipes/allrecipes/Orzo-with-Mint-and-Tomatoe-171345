Combine onions and oil in a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat. Stir often until onions are browned and taste sweet, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the orzo in 2 quarts boiling water until tender to bite, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold water until the pasta is cool, then drain again. In a large bowl, mix together cool cooked orzo, cooked chopped onions, cup broth, lemon juice, and minced parsley. (If making ahead, chill mixture airtight up to 1 day.) Add tomatoes and mint just before serving. Garnish with mint sprigs, and season to taste with salt and pepper.
