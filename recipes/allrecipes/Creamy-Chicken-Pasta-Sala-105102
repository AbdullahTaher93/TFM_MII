Brush chicken with steak sauce and marinate for 10-15 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and set aside to cool. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Place chicken on hot grill. Cover and cook until grill marks form, about 6-8 minutes per side or until internal temperature reaches 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Set aside to cool, then cut into bite-size pieces. When ready to serve, mix pasta, chicken, onion, avocados, tomatoes and dressing in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
