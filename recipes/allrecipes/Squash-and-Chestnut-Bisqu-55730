Peel and seed squash; cut squash into 3/4-inch chunks. Peel onion and chop. In a 5- to 6-quart nonstick pan over medium-high heat, stir onion, celery, and butter until onion is limp, about 6 minutes. Add 1/2 cup chestnuts and stir until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Add squash and broth. Cover pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until squash mashes easily when pressed, 20 to 25 minutes. Add milk. In a blender, whirl soup, a portion at a time, until smooth. Return soup to pan, add salt to taste, and, if needed, stir over medium heat until steaming. Ladle into soup bowls and garnish with more chopped chestnuts, if desired.
