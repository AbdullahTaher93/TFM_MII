In a large saucepan over medium heat, bring water, sugar and candies to a boil, stirring constantly until sugar and candies are dissolved. Reduce heat; carefully add apples. Cook, uncovered, until apples are tender, about 8 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer apples to a serving dish; pour syrup over apples. Serve warm or chilled. Garnish with mint if desired.
