In a large pot over medium-low heat, mix the pasta sauce, picante sauce, tomatoes, tomato paste, and Parmesan cheese. Season with oregano, thyme, parsley, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Place the chicken in a separate pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer 25 minutes, until chicken juices run clear. Transfer chicken to the pot with the sauce mixture. Cover, and cook on low 1 hour. In a separate pot, bring the rice and water to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. Serve the chicken and sauce over the cooked rice.
