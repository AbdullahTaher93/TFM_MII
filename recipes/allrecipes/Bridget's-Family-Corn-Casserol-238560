Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray. Combine whole kernel corn, creamed corn, Cheddar cheese, onion, red bell pepper, eggs, milk, olives, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl; pour into the prepared casserole dish. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, sprinkle corn chips over corn mixture, and bake until casserole is bubbling, about 20 minutes more. Let casserole stand until set, 15 to 20 minutes.
