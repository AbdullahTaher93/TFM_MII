Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion and garlic; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the turkey, and stir until crumbly and no longer pink. Season with chili powder, cumin, oregano, cayenne pepper, kidney beans, and salsa. Cook over medium-high heat until the mixture is simmering and the beans are hot, about 5 minutes. Divide the lettuce, carrots, and red bell peppers among 4 serving plates. Spoon the turkey mixture overtop to serve.
