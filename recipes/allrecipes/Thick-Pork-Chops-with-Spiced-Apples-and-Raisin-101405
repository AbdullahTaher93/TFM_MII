Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the apples and thyme and coat in the butter; cook and stir for 6 minutes to give them some color. Toss in raisins and add apple juice. Stir in the brown sugar, cinnamon, and cloves. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add lemon juice and simmer until apples are tender but still hold their shape, about 10 minutes. Set aside and keep warm. Rub chops on both sides with a little olive oil and season well with salt and pepper. Place a large ovenproof skillet, preferably cast-iron, over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil and swirl to coat the pan. Brown chops for 2 minutes on each side. Place skillet in oven and roast chops until center is still slightly pink in the center and internal temperature reads 160 degrees F. when tested with an instant-read thermometer. Serve pork accompanied by the warm spiced apples, drizzling a bit of the sauce over the chops.
