Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish with vegetable oil cooking spray. In a medium bowl, mix together the cubed ham, corn, cream of asparagus soup (undiluted), eggs and mustard. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions, celery and garlic salt; cook, stirring until tender. Stir the onion mixture into the egg mixture. Transfer to the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle a layer of bread crumbs over the top, then cover with a layer of Parmesan cheese. Cover the dish, and bake for 40 minutes in the preheated oven. Uncover, sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the top and return to the oven for an additional 20 minutes, or until cheese is melted and the top is golden brown. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
