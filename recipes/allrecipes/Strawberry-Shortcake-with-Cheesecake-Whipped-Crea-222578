Mix 1 1/2 quarts strawberries and white sugar in a large bowl; gently mash strawberries with a potato masher. Cover and refrigerate. Beat cream cheese in a bowl until light and fluffy; set aside. Beat heavy cream in another bowl until soft peaks form; add whipped cream cheese and continue to beat until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the cream should form a sharp peak that holds its shape. Beat confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract into cream cheese mixture. Layer about half the angel food cake in a large bowl or trifle. Spread a third of the cream cheese mixture over the cake and top with a layer of mashed strawberries. Repeat the layers, finishing with a final layer of the cream cheese mixture. Arrange the remaining 1/2 quart strawberry slices decoratively. Chill until ready to serve.
