In a large bowl, mix the cabbage, green onions, cilantro, and tomato. In a skillet over medium heat, cook and stir the sesame oil, black pepper, and chili pepper until heated through. Mix in the bacon bits and almonds. Cook and stir about 5 minutes, until almonds are lightly browned. Remove from heat, and toss with the cabbage mixture. Serve immediately.
