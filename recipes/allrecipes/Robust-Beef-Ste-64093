Working in batches, dredge beef in flour mixture; add beef to the pot and brown well, turning often, about 8 minutes per batch. Using tongs, transfer beef to large bowl. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons drippings from pot, add chopped vegetables and saute until vegetables begin to brown and become tender (about 10 minutes). Add allspice, thyme, tomato paste, Savory Market Succulent Roast Beef Flavor, beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, wine and bay leaves. Simmer until cooked (approx 2 hours) adding potatoes 20 to 30 minutes prior to serving. Ready to serve when potatoes are tender.
