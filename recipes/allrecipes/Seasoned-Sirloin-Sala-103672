Preheat grill for high heat. Lightly season both sides of the steak with garlic powder, and salt and pepper. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, lime juice, garlic, salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce. Mix in the cheese. Cover and place dressing in refrigerator. Lightly oil grate. Place steak on grill and cook for 3 to 5 minutes per side or until desired doneness is reached. Remove from heat and let sit until cool enough to handle. Slice steak into bite-size pieces. Combine the lettuce, watercress, tomatoes, pepper, red onion, cucumber and olives. Toss with dressing. Place salad onto chilled plates and top with steak.
