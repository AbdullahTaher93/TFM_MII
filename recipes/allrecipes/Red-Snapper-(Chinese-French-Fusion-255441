Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat red snapper fillets with paprika, salt, and pepper. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add red snapper; cook until browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a large baking dish; top with lemon slices. Combine tomato, shallots, garlic, lemon zest, and ginger in the skillet; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in white wine. Season with salt and pepper. Add butter; reduce heat and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour mixture over red snapper. Bake in the preheated oven until red snapper flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes.
