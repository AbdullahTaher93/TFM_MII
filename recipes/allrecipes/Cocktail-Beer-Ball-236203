Stir ketchup, beer, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper together in a pot over medium-low heat. Bring to a simmer. Mix ground beef, ground pork, bread crumbs, egg, Parmesan cheese, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder together in a bowl. Roll mixture into cocktail-sized meatballs.
