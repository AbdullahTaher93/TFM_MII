In small bowl, add milk, chia seeds, SunButter(R) and maple syrup. Stir well, or if you prefer, stir just enough to leave swirls of SunButter. Add oats and stir a few more times. Pour mixture into two 8-ounce mason jars or one 16-ounce mason jar. Press down with spoon to ensure all oats have been moistened and are immersed in mixture. Screw on lid(s) and set in refrigerator overnight, or for at least six hours. After refrigerating, open and enjoy as is, or garnish with fresh fruit.
