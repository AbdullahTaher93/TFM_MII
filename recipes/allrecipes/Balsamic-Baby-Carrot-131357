In a small frying pan over high heat, bring water to a boil. Add the carrots, reduce heat to low, and cover. Cook approximately 7 minutes or until carrots are crisp-tender. In a small microwave-safe bowl, cook the butter with the balsamic so that the mixture boils for 1 minute. Stir in the sugar substitute. Drain the carrots and toss in the balsamic mixture. Sprinkle the onions, then season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
