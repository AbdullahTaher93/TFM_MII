Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Beat egg whites with an electric mixer in a bowl until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Soak cranberries in water in a separate bowl for 10 to 15 minutes. Pulse almonds in a food processor until coarsely chopped; add coconut flour. Pulse until blended. Transfer almond mixture to a bowl. Blend cranberry mixture and coconut milk in the food processor until evenly combined. Stir mashed banana into almond mixture using a rubber spatula. Mix cranberry mixture and applesauce into almond-banana mixture until mixture is dense and pliable. Stir in vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Fold egg whites into mixture until just combined. Spread mixture into the prepared baking pan; tap pan gently on the counter to evenly spread mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, about 45 minutes. Cool for 20 minutes before cutting into squares.
