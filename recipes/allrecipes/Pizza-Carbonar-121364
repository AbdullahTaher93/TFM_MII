Unroll pizza crust. Press onto a greased 12-in. pizza pan; build up edges slightly. Prick dough thoroughly with a fork. Bake at 425 degrees F for 7-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, saute onion and garlic in butter until tender. Stir in flour and pepper until blended. Gradually add milk and bouillon. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Reduce heat; stir in Parmesan cheese. Spread over hot crust. Sprinkle with bacon, Monterey Jack cheese and green onions. Bake at 425 degrees F for 8-12 minutes or until cheese is melted. Let stand for 5 minutes before cutting.
