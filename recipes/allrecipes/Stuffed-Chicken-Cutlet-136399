In a medium bowl, combine feta, peppers, olives, scallions, and oregano. Line a small baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside. Place cutlets on a flat surface, smooth side down. Spoon 2 tablespoons of feta mixture in center of each cutlet; fold up short sides over cheese, then long sides, making a packet. On baking sheet, arrange stuffed cutlets, seam side down (they should not touch); freeze until firm, about 1 hour. Wrap each in plastic; place in a resealable freezer bag; label, and date. Freeze up to 2 months. To bake: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line two large baking sheets with parchment. Unwrap frozen cutlets, and arrange, seam side down, on baking sheets; season with salt and pepper. Bake until chicken is opaque throughout, about 30 minutes. Serve 2 cutlets per person, topped, if desired, with tomato sauce. To bake without freezing: Decrease baking time by about 10 minutes.
