In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and mustard. Combine egg, milk and butter; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in ham and cheese. Fill greased or paper-lined muffins cups about two-thirds full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until muffins test done. Cool in pan 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack.
