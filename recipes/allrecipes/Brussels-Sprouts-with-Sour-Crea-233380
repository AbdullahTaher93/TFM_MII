Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until translucent and tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer onion to a large bowl. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add Brussels sprouts, cover, and steam until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer Brussels sprouts to the same bowl with the onion. Stir sour cream, bacon bits, butter, and hot sauce into vegetable mixture until evenly coated; season with salt.
