Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat muffin cups with cooking spray or line with paper muffin liners. In a medium bowl, beat together oil, applesauce, milk, yogurt, egg, strawberry jam, and vanilla extract. In a food processor, grind bran flake cereal to a fine powder; this should make about 1 1/4 cups flour. Transfer to a large bowl, and stir together with whole wheat flour, wheat bran, buckwheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, brown sugar, ground ginger, pumpkin pie spice, allspice, and ground nutmeg. Pour in applesauce mixture, and mix thoroughly. Spoon mixture into prepared muffin cups, filling until level with the top of the muffin cups. Bake in preheated oven 26 to 30 minutes, or until muffins test done with a toothpick. Remove muffins from pan, and cool on wire racks.
