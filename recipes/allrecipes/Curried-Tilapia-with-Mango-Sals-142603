For the mango salsa, combine the mango, red onion, serrano chile, cilantro, lime juice and salt in a glass bowl. Set aside. For the tilapia rub, mix together 1 tablespoon of olive oil, curry powder and garlic pepper in a small bowl. Rub this mixture onto both sides of the fish fillets. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the fish for about 3 minutes on each side or until it flakes easily with a fork. Serve with the mango salsa.
