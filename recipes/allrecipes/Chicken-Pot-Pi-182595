Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Mix vegetables, chicken and soup; spoon evenly into 4 (2-cup) ovenproof bowls. Top with cheese. Mix flour and baking powder in medium bowl. Cut in cream cheese spread until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in milk with fork just until dry ingredients are moistened. Divide dough into 4 balls. Pat dough into 5-inch circles on lightly floured surface. Prick tops several times with fork to allow steam to escape. Place each biscuit on top of chicken mixture. Bake 25 to 30 min. or until crust is golden brown.
