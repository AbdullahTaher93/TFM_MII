Bring farro, chicken bouillon, and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until farro is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain any excess water. Cook and stir sun-dried tomatoes and mushrooms with basil in a skillet over medium heat until mushrooms are slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add squash and cook until tender, about 10 more minutes. Cook and stir farro with squash mixture until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle farro pilaf with Parmesan cheese.
