In medium bowl, combine zucchini, leeks, eggs, panko, and salt and pepper. Heat 1/2 inch oil in large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Form small patties from the zucchini mixture using a spoon; add to hot oil in batches. Cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove from pan and drain on paper towels. Arrange Pretzel Crisps(R) on a serving tray. Top each crisp with a mini zucchini fritter. Add a drop of ranch dressing, if desired. Serve.
