Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F for glass pan). In a large bowl, blend brownie mix as package directs. Stir in mint extract. Divide batter between two greased 9- by 13-inch pans and bake as directed. Cool in pan. Meanwhile, combine chocolate and heavy cream in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat; whisk until melted and smooth. Pour half the chocolate over each pan of cooled brownies; spread evenly. Divide crushed candies in half; sprinkle each half on each pan of brownies. Refrigerate until chocolate sets, about 1 hour. Cut each pan into 24 squares.
