Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a mixing bowl, combine warm water and yeast; let stand for several minutes. Stir in mashed potatoes, sugar, butter, and salt; mix well. Stir in enough flour to make a soft dough. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead 5-8 minutes, or until dough is smooth and elastic, adding flour as needed. Place dough in bowl, cover, and let rise 1 hour. Punch dough down, divide in half, and shape each half into a loaf. Place in 4 x 8 loaf pans, cover, and let rise 30-45 minutes, or until doubled. Bake 30-35 minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool on wire rack.
