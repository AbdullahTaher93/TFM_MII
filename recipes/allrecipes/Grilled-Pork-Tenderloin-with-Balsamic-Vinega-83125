Combine oil, vinegar, and garlic with rosemary in a self-sealing bag. Add pork tenderloins and marinate them for 30 minutes in the refrigerator. Remove from marinade and discard remaining marinade. Season tenderloins with salt and pepper. Grill over medium-hot fire, turning occasionally, for 15-25 minutes, until a meat thermometer inserted reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Slice to serve.
