In shallow baking pan, place chicken pieces in single layer; brush both sides with marinade mixture. Cover and refrigerate at least 15 minutes. Sprinkle chicken pieces with remaining cilantro. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes or until juices run clear and internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Serve immediately with hot cooked rice, if desired.
