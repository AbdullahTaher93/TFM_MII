Press carrot and zucchini between paper towels to remove excess moisture. In a medium bowl combine carrots, zucchini, tofu, onion, celery, egg, bread crumbs and curry paste. Chop 2/3 of the basil and add it to the tofu mixture. Mix well and form into 4 patties, about 1/2 inch thick. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook patties for 5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Serve with remaining basil leaves.
