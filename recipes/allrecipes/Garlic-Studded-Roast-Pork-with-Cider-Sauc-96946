Adjust oven rack to center position and heat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). With a small knife, pierce the top and sides of the roast in 36 places. Force garlic slices into the cuts. Rub roast with olive oil and generously sprinkle the roast all over with salt, pepper and thyme. Set roast, fat side up, on the bay leaves in a shallow roasting pan. Pour vinegar in the bottom of the pan. As pork roasts, continue adding water as necessary to keep pan bottom moist. Cook until a meat thermometer registers between 150 and 160 degrees F (65 - 75 degrees C), about 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hours. Leaving the roast in place, turn on broiler; cook until roast is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove roast from oven and let rest for at least 10 minutes and up to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, pour pan drippings into a small saucepan, add apple cider and bring to a simmer. Mix cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water; whisk into the drippings and continue to simmer until sauce is a thin consistency, about 5 minutes. Cut roast into 1/2-inch-thick slices and serve with sauce.
