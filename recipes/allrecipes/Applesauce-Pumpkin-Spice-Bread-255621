Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf pans with cooking spray. Mix flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, baking soda, salt, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Combine brown sugar, white sugar, applesauce, and eggs in a large bowl. Add pumpkin and mix well. Add flour mixture alternately with water, mixing well between additions. Divide between the prepared loaf pans. Bake loaves in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 60 to 65 minutes. Cool in pans for 10 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack to cool completely.
