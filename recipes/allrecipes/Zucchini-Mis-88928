Place sesame seeds in a skillet over medium heat. Cook 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until lightly toasted. In a large bowl, mix the chicken broth, miso paste, soy sauce, rice vinegar, lime juice, chile sauce, brown sugar, green onions, and cilantro. Toss zucchini in the dressing to coat just before serving, and top with toasted sesame seeds, nori, and almonds.
