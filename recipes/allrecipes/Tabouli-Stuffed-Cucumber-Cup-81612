First prepare the tabouli. Into a small bowl, add the tabouli mix, the boiling water, lemon juice and cumin. Stir well and cover. Set aside. Remove the stem from the tomato, slice in half and squeeze to remove the seeds (most of them anyway - that's good enough). Dice the tomato. Mince the parsley and mint leaves. Uncover the tabouli and stir. Add the parsley, mint, tomatoes and olive oil. Stir well, cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Wash the cucumbers to remove the vegetable wax that is usually put on them. I prefer to leave the peels on (test to see if too bitter however), but you can peel them or partial peel them (making attractive stripes). Cut off the ends then cut into 1 inch long slices. It is assume that you can get 8 slices from an English cucumber. Using a rounded teaspoon or a melon baller, scoop out the centers about 2/3 or 3/4 deep. This makes nice cups. Fill each cup with about 1 Tbsp of the tabouli. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
