Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Toss leeks with bacon and 1/4 cup olive oil and place in a baking pan. Roast in the preheated oven until leeks are softened, about 10 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon thyme and white wine; roast 10 more minutes. Top with whitefish and drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil; bake until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes. Garnish with thyme sprig.
