Heat oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook garlic, white parts of onions, coriander, cumin, and chile powder, stirring, until garlic and onions are tender, about 3 minutes. Add corn and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 2 minutes. Transfer mixture to a blender. Add buttermilk, water, and salt and puree until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard solids. Chill at least 1 hour. Serve chilled, garnished with green parts of onions and cilantro (if using).
