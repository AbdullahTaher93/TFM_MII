Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground lamb and onion. Cook and stir until the lamb is evenly browned and onions are translucent. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir in the tomatoes and their liquid, water, consomme, and tomato soup. Add the carrots, celery, and barley, and season with chili powder and pepper. Simmer over medium heat for 45 minutes.
