Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In shallow dish, combine nuts, salt, and pepper. Press smooth side of chicken in nut mixture. Wash hands. Heat oil in large nonstick skillet. Add chicken, nut-side down, and cook over medium-high heat until golden, 2 minutes per side. Transfer chicken in skillet to oven; bake 12 to 15 minutes, until juices run clear when thickest part of chicken is pierced or temperature on instant-read thermometer reaches 170 degrees F.
