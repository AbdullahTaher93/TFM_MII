Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions until softened, about 5 minutes. Slowly pour chicken broth over onions; add potatoes, flour, basil, salt, pepper, garlic salt, and hot sauce. Bring chicken broth to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring and mashing potatoes often using a potato masher, until soup is cooked through and smooth, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir evaporated milk into soup.
