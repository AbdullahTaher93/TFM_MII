Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Blanch peaches in a pot of boiling water for 30 seconds each. With slotted spoon, transfer peaches to cutting board and peel with paring knife. Cut each peach into 10 slices (you will have 10 cups). Transfer to large bowl; toss with lemon juice. Whisk together sugar, flour, and nutmeg in a small bowl; toss with peaches. Transfer mixture to a 9-by-13-by-2- inch glass baking dish, spread evenly, and dot with butter. Make topping: Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl. In a large bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter and 1/2 cup sugar until light and fluffy. Add egg and beat until blended. Slowly add dry ingredients to butter mixture and beat on low speed just until blended. Stir in buttermilk with a fork just until blended. Drop 18 heaping tablespoons (3 rows of 6) of topping onto peaches, leaving a 1/2-inch space around edges of dish. Sprinkle with remaining 2 teaspoons sugar and bake about 35 minutes, until top is golden brown and fruit is bubbling.
