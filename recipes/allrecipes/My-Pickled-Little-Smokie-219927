Place the sausages into a saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes, poking sausages with a sharp fork to release fat. Drain and rinse the sausages. Place the sausages into a 1-quart glass canning jar. Pour white vinegar and water into a saucepan, and stir in the pickling salt, pickling spice, mustard seeds, celery seeds, dill seeds, onion slices, garlic, black peppercorns, and banana pepper rings. Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook for 5 minutes, stirring often. Pour the vinegar mixture over the sausages in the jar; cap the jar, and refrigerate at least 3 days before serving.
