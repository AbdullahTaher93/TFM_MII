Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook and stir ground beef in a large pot over medium-high heat until the beef is crumbly and completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard excess grease. Stir cream of chicken soup, enchilada sauce, and milk with the ground beef; bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Spread crushed tortilla snack chips into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour ground beef mixture over crushed chips; stir. Arrange cheese slices atop the mixture. Bake in preheated oven until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes; stir the melted cheese into the beef mixture.
