Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. In a small saucepan, combine JIF(R), honey and cinnamon; heat through. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Place oats in a large, shallow roasting pan or a 15 x 10 x 1-inch baking pan. Pour warm JIF(R) mixture over oats and stir gently until oats are coated. Spread evenly in pan. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn off oven. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, cover raisins in boiling water. Let stand for 10 minutes; drain well. Stir raisins, nuts and figs into baked mixture. Return to oven and let dry 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Store in covered containers.
