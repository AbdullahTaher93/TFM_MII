Whisk egg. Whisk in mashed banana, breast milk or formula and nutmeg until very well combined. Heat a pan over medium heat. Add egg and banana mixture and cook, stirring often, until eggs are scrambled and completely cooked through. Remove from heat, let cool and chop into tiny pieces that your baby can easily manage.
