Combine chicken thighs, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, brown sugar, and black pepper in a bowl. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator, 2 hours to overnight. Heat a wok or very large skillet over high heat for 30 seconds. Pour in vegetable oil. Reduce heat to medium; add onion and garlic. Cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Increase heat to high and add marinated chicken to the wok; cook, stirring constantly, until no longer pink, about 4 minutes. Push chicken mixture to one side of the wok; pour eggs into the empty side. Cook until just starting to set, about 2 minutes. Stir eggs slowly until scrambled. Mix into the chicken mixture. Season with 3 tablespoons soy sauce, sugar, and white pepper; stir for 1 minute. Stir rice into the wok until evenly incorporated and heated through, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in green onion and cilantro. Mix gently until combined.
