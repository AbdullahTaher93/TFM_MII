Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat, stir garlic, ginger, green onions, and oil just until onions are limp, about 5 minutes. In a bowl, mix soy sauce with chicken. Rinse and core tomatoes; cut crosswise into 1/8- to 1/4-inch-thick slices. Place bread shell in a 12-inch pizza pan or on a 14- by 17-inch baking sheet. Spread shell evenly with sauce, then scatter chicken mixture and onion mixture over sauce. Arrange tomato slices evenly over the surface, then sprinkle pizza with cheese. Bake until cheese is melted and pizza is hot in center, 12 to 15 minutes. Cut into wedges.
