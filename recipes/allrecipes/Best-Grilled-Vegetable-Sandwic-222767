Combine zucchini, eggplant, and red bell pepper in a bowl. Sprinkle salt over the mixture. Set aside to allow the vegetables to tenderize, at least 3 hours. Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Drain moisture from vegetable mixture. Brush vegetables with olive oil to coat; season with black pepper. Cook vegetables on hot grill until tender, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Toast cut sides of baguette in a toaster oven until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Spread basil pesto evenly over toasted surface. Arrange grilled vegetables evenly onto 2 of the baguette halves. Top each with sliced mozzarella and plum tomato slices; top sandwich with the remaining baguette pieces to serve.
