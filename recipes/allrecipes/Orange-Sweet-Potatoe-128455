Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat a 9 inch x 9 inch (23 x 23-cm) baking dish with nonstick spray. Brown butter in a small skillet, until butter turns a nutty color. Remove from heat and set aside. Peel sweet potatoes or yams, cut in half lengthwise, and then into 1/2 inch-thick (1.25-cm) slices. Place in the prepared baking dish. Pour orange juice over sweet potatoes or yams. Sprinkle with orange peel, salt, nutmeg, and pepper. Top with brown sugar and browned butter. Cover and bake 40 to 45 minutes, or until sweet potatoes or yams are crisp-tender. Uncover and cook 12 to 15 minutes, or until juices are almost absorbed.
