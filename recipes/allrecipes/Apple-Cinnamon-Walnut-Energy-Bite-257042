Place oats, dates, flax seeds, apple, cinnamon, 1/2 cup walnuts, and honey in the bowl of a food processor. Blend until ingredients form a sticky ball. If desired, add salt to taste preference. With slightly wet hands, form about a tablespoon each into a tight ball. Roll in additional chopped walnuts. Refrigerate, covered, until chilled. Store leftovers in refrigerator, covered.
