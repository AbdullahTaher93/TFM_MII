In a Dutch oven, cook meat and onion in hot oil until meat is brown. Stir in beer, water, tomato paste, paprika, salt, caraway seed, and pepper. Cover, and simmer 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours. Add potatoes, undrained sauerkraut, and fresh dill to soup. Cover. Cook for about 20 minutes, or until vegetables are tender. Cook uncovered for 10 minutes more, or until mixture is thickened and most of the liquid is evaporated. Sprinkle parsley on top before serving.
