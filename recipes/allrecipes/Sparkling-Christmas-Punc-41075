Pour the apple juice or pear nectar into a medium saucepan. For spice bag, place the stick cinnamon, vanilla bean (if using), and cardamom on a double-thick, 6-inch-square piece of 100%-cotton cheesecloth. Bring up corners; tie with string. Add spice bag to juice. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Cool and refrigerate at least 4 hours or until thoroughly chilled. Before serving, remove spice bag and discard. Pour juice into a large pitcher or punch bowl. Stir in vanilla extract (if using) and the champagne or carbonated water. Add apples or pears and cranberries, if desired. Add ice just before serving.
