Pour the goat's milk into a large pot. Cook over medium-high heat until small bubbles form, and the milk becomes foamy. Do not bring to a boil. Remove from the heat, and stir in the vinegar; let stand 10 minutes to curdle. Line a colander with a double layer of cheesecloth. Pour the curdled milk into the cheesecloth to separate the curds from the whey. Gather up the sides of the cheesecloth, and gently squeeze as much remaining whey from the curds as you can. Place the cheese into a mixing bowl, and stir in basil and garlic. Season to taste with salt, then cover, and refrigerate until cold.
