In a bowl, combine the crabmeat and shrimp with the vodka, lemon peel and juice; season with salt. Refrigerate for 10 minutes. In another bowl, mix the chopped celery, horseradish, hot sauce, chili sauce and pepper. Add the chilled seafood and toss; season with salt to taste. Divide the seafood among 4 chilled martini glasses. Skewer the olives and celery chunks on toothpicks and set in the glasses; set a cocktail fork next to each glass.
