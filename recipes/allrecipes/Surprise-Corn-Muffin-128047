Heat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat 12 muffin cups with nonstick spray. Whisk flour, cornmeal, baking powder and baking soda in a bowl. In another bowl, whisk yogurt, egg, honey and margarine. Add yogurt mixture to dry ingredients and stir just until moistened; divide half of batter among muffin cups. Top batter in each cup with 1 teaspoon of fruit spread; top with remaining half of batter. Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove muffins from pan and place on a wire rack to cool. Serve warm or cooled.
