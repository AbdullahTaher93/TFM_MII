Remove frozen spinach from pouch; place in colander. Rinse with warm water until thawed; drain well. Squeeze spinach dry with paper towel. Meanwhile, in large bowl, mix egg, both cheeses, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, sour cream, oil and ricotta cheese until well blended. Add spinach to cheese mixture; mix well. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time, until well blended. Fill 10-inch skillet half full with oil; heat over medium heat until candy/deep-fry thermometer reads 350 degrees F. (Or use deep fryer; add oil to fill line and heat to 350 degrees F.) Meanwhile, place bread crumbs in small bowl. Shape spinach-cheese mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls (about 40), using about 1 1/2 tablespoons for each; roll in bread crumbs and place on cookie sheet. Fry 6 balls at a time 4 to 6 minutes, turning as necessary, until golden brown. With slotted spoon, remove balls from skillet; place on paper towels to drain. Cool 2 minutes before serving; serve with warm pasta sauce for dipping.
