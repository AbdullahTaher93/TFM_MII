In a bowl, combine eggs, oil and brown sugar. Combine the oats, baking powder, salt and cinnamon; add to egg mixture, stirring just until moistened. Stir in the coconut, raisins and chocolate chips. Spoon into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Serve warm with milk if desired.
