MAKE THE DUMPLINGS: In a food processor, blend the egg white with the soy sauce, scallion, ginger, vegetable oil, sesame oil, cornstarch, salt and pepper. Add all but 3 of the scallops and process to a coarse paste. Scrape the paste into a bowl. Cut the remaining scallops into 1/2-inch dice and fold them into the paste. Cover and refrigerate. MAKE THE BROTH: In a large saucepan, combine the broth with the lemon zest, garlic, soy sauce, ginger and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and discard the lemon zest and garlic. Add the snow peas and cabbage and bring to a simmer. Drop scant tablespoons of the scallop paste into the broth, then cover and simmer over low heat until the dumplings are just cooked through, about 2 minutes. Ladle into bowls, top with the garnishes and serve.
