Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8 inch springform pan. Using a fork, combine gingersnaps, graham crackers, 2 tablespoons SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, and melted butter. Press mixture onto the bottom and two inches up the sides of the pan to form the crust. With an electric mixer, beat cream cheese and 1/2 cup SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener until light and fluffy. Stir in the pumpkin. Mix in the molasses, evaporated milk, maple syrup, cinnamon, allspice and vanilla. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing until smooth. Pour batter into prepared crust. Bake in the preheated oven for 90 minutes, or until center of cheesecake is set. Allow to cool in pan for 30 minutes, then refrigerate overnight.
