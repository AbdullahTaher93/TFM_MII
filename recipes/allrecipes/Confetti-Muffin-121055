In a large bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. In a skillet, saute onions and peppers in butter until tender. Stir in parsley; cook for 10 minutes. In a bowl, beat eggs, sour cream and mustard. Add onion mixture. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.
