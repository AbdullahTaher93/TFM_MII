In a large soup pot, heat the EVOO, 4 turns of the pan, and the garlic over medium heat. Add the potatoes, eggplant, zucchini and onion and cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Add the thyme, rosemary and sage; season with salt and pepper. Stir in the tomato sauce and chicken broth, cover and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat. Discard the thyme and rosemary stems (the leaves will have fallen into the stoup) and stir in the parsley. Serve with the crusty bread.
