Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix butter or margarine, cottage cheese and flour together. Roll the dough into a circle about 1/4 inch thick. Cut the dough into triangular wedges. Sprinkle raisins into the broad end of the wedge along with cinnamon and sugar. Roll from the broad edge toward the pointed edge to form crescents. Sprinkle the crescents with cinnamon and sugar. Arrange the cookies on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 12 minutes.
