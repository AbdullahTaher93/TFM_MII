Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly tender, about 10 to 15 minutes. Drain. Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Heat peanut oil in a large deep skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir red curry paste, ginger, and garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir coconut milk into curry paste mixture until well blended. Stir cayenne pepper, paprika, cumin, and salt into coconut milk mixture; add chicken and cook until chicken is about half-cooked, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir chicken stock, potatoes, onion, green bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, red bell pepper, carrot, fish sauce, brown sugar, curry powder, and bay leaf into coconut milk-chicken mixture; cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Add peas to mixture; cover skillet and cook until peas are heated through, about 5 more minutes. Serve over cooked jasmine rice.
