Whisk together rice vinegar, sugar and salt in medium bowl. Add carrots and daikon tossing to mix. Refrigerate until serving. Whisk together mayonnaise and Sriracha in small bowl. Chill. Preheat grill pan (or grill) to medium-hot. Grill sausage links until heated through, then slice into strips 4 - 6 inch long. To assemble, dip spring roll skin into lukewarm water then let dry. Place cucumber slices on one side of roll and an equal portion of the pickled vegetables, add a grilled sausage slice, cilantro and drizzle with the Sriracha mayonnaise. Roll (like a taco) and serve immediately. Garnish with sprigs of fresh cilantro.
