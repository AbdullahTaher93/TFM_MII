Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin with cooking spray. Mix oats, milk, apples, raisins, walnuts, flaxseed meal, eggs, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Spoon mixture into the prepared muffin tin. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are crisp and center is moist, 50 to 60 minutes.
