Pour milk into large bowl. Add dry pudding mixes and juice. Beat with wire whisk 2 min. or until well blended. (Mixture will be thick.) Spread 1-1/2 cups of the pudding onto bottom of crust; set aside. Add half of the whipped topping to remaining pudding; stir gently until well blended. Spread over pudding layer in crust; top with the remaining whipped topping. Refrigerate 3 hours or until set. Garnish with lemon peel, if desired. Store leftover pie in refrigerator.
