In a large skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Meanwhile in a large bowl, combine the biscuit mix and water until a soft dough forms. Spread into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Layer with the beef, tomatoes and green pepper. In a large bowl, combine the onions, 1/2 cup cheese, sour cream and mayonnaise; spread over top. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until edges are browned. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake 5 minutes longer or until the cheese is melted.
