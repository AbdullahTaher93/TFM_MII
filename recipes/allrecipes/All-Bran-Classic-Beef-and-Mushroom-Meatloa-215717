In no-stick skillet, over medium heat, heat oil. Add onions; saute about 4 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook until tender, stirring frequently. Remove from heat, stir in parsley. Let cool slightly. In medium bowl, stir together cereal and beef stock. Let stand 2 minutes or until stock is absorbed and cereal softens. In large bowl, combine beef, egg, ketchup, Worcestershire, salt and pepper. Add mushroom mixture and cereal. Mix together until lightly blended. Press mixture into 2 L (9 x 5-inch) loaf pan. Bake at 180 degrees C (350 degrees F) for 60 to 75 minutes or until cooked through. Let stand about 15 minutes before slicing. Pour off any accumulated juices.
