Toss cooked turkey, cooked rice and salsa in large bowl. For each burrito, spoon 3/4 cup turkey mixture onto tortilla. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons cheese. Fold in sides and roll up. Wrap in foil that has been sprayed with cooking spray. Refrigerate until ready to grill. Heat grill. Cover and heat foil-wrapped burritos 10 minutes, turning once, or until hot. Serve with your favorite burrito toppings, if you like.
