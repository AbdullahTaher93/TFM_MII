Put the chicken stock in a medium-sized saucepan or stockpot, over medium-high heat; add in the bay leaves, thyme, carrot, onion, celery and cloves. Bring to a boil and skim off any impurities. Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking, until the liquid (chicken stock) reduces by one-half (approximately 1 hour). Add in the black beans and continue cooking for 10 minutes. Remove the black beans to an oven-proof dish and keep hot, in the oven at 140 degrees F. In a separate saucepan, over medium-high heat, saute the chopped shallots in 1 tablespoon olive oil until they are translucent. Add in the white wine and reduce to one-half volume. Stir in the heavy cream and continue cooking until all the liquid reduces by one-half, again. Remove from the heat and let cool, for approximately 5-7 minutes. Strain into a blender, add in the goat cheese and butter and blend until all ingredients are fully combined. Put back into your pot, cover and keep hot. Coat the chicken breasts with remaining olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper. In a separate skillet, saute the chicken breasts until just cooked through, remove from the heat, cut each breast into diagonal slices and arrange on dinner plates. Add a serving of black beans, on the side, pour sauce generously over the chicken slices and serve.
