Spread watermelon, yellow tomato, and red tomato onto paper towels to drain some of the moisture; transfer to a large bowl. Whisk vinegar, olive oil, chile-garlic sauce, and honey together in a small bowl until the olive oil and vinegar have combined; pour over the watermelon mixture. Season with lemon basil, salt, and black pepper; toss gently to coat.
