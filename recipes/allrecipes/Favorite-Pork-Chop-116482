In a blender, combine the soy sauce, green pepper, brown sugar, onion, ginger and garlic; cover and process until smooth. Set aside 2 tablespoons for sauce. Pour the remaining marinade into a large resealable plastic bag or shallow glass container. Add pork chops and turn to coat. Seal or cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight; drain and discard marinade. Grill chops, covered, over medium-hot heat for 5-8 minutes on each side or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees (63 degrees C). In a saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch, water and reserved soy sauce mixture; stir until smooth. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Serve over chops.
