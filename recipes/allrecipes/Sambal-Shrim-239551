Combine sambal paste, sugar, lime juice, olive oil, garlic, ginger, mirin, fish sauce, and sesame oil in a large bowl; mix well. Reserve half of the marinade for basting. Stir shrimp into the remaining half of the marinade, coating evenly. Cover and refrigerate for about 45 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove shrimp from marinade; discard marinade. Grill shrimp about 2 minutes on each side. Brush with the reserved marinade. Remove shrimp from grill to serving platter. Garnish with cilantro.
