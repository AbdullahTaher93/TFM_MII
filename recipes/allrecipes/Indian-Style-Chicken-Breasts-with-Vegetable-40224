Remove excess fat from chicken; rinse and pat dry. Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Saute chicken, skin-side-down, 5 to 6 minutes or until lightly browned. Turn chicken; add onion. Cook and stir onions 3 to 4 minutes longer. Add tomatoes, carrot, garlic salt and water (push carrot down into cooking liquid). Sprinkle 1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala over all; bring to boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally or until chicken and vegetables are tender. Remove chicken to serving plate (cover with foil to keep warm). Add remaining garam masala to skillet mixture; bring to boil. Cook, stirring, 2-4 minutes to reduce liquid and thicken vegetable mixture. Spoon over chicken. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro. Serve with cooked rice, if desired.
