In a 2 to 3 quart pan, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook, stirring often, until golden, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, peel carrots, potatoes, and turnips. Thickly slice carrots crosswise. Cut potatoes and turnips into 1/2 inch cubes. Add broth, carrots, potatoes, turnips, and 1 tsp. of the orange peel to onion. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer over low heat until vegetables are tender when pierced, 20 to 25 minutes. Puree mixture in a blender or food processor, a portion at a time. (If making ahead, cool, cover, and chill up to 1 day.) Return soup to pan; reheat over medium heat until hot. Stir in sherry, if using, and cilantro. Add salt and pepper to taste. Pour into bowls. If desired, garnish with a dollop of yogurt and a few shreds of orange peel.
