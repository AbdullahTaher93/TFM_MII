Rinse pork under running water. Pat dry with paper towels. Make about 10 shallow slits in each tenderloin. Combine next 9 ingredients in food processor or blender to make sofrito. Rub sofrito over entire surface of pork, forcing mixture into slits. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour or overnight for extra flavor. Combine salsa ingredients in medium bowl. Cover and chill. Grill or broil pork 10 minutes per side or until internal temperature is 160 degrees F. Slice pork and top with salsa.
