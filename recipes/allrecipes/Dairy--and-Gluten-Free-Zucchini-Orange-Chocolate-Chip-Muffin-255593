Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin with cooking spray. Mix almond flour, chocolate chips, coconut flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a small bowl. Beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and frothy. Add brown sugar, almond oil, maple syrup, 1 teaspoon orange zest, and vanilla extract; mix well. Stir in zucchini. Fold in almond flour mixture until well blended. Thin batter with almond milk if it appears too thick. Divide batter among prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes. Let cool for 2 to 3 minutes. Combine confectioners' sugar, orange juice, and 1 teaspoon orange zest in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer on high speed until glaze is smooth. Spoon glaze over muffins. Let stand for 5 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to cool.
