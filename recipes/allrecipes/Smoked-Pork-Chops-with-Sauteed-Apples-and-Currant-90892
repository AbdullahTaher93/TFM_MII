In a 12- to 14-inch nonstick frying pan over high heat, stir 1 teaspoon butter with the currants until the currants puff, about 2 minutes. Pour currants from pan into a small bowl and set aside. To pan, add 1 1/2 more tablespoons butter. Reduce heat to medium-high and lay apple wedges in pan in a single layer. Cook until apples are lightly browned and feel soft when pressed, 15 to 20 minutes; turn slices occasionally with a spatula to brown both sides. While apples cook, add remaining butter to another 12- to 14-inch frying pan over medium-high heat. Add pork chops and cook, turning occasionally, until meat is lightly browned and heated through, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a platter and keep warm. When apples are done, sprinkle fruit with sugar and return currants to pan. Shake pan to mix and brown apples for 1 more minute. Spoon apples and currants over pork chops and serve.
