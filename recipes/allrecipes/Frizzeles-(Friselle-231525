Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Stir olive oil and cold water into dry ingredients, mixing to make a soft dough. Pinch off a handful of dough, roll into a thick log between your hands, and use a scissors to cut into pieces about 2 inches long. Place biscuits about 1 1/2 inches apart on baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven on middle rack for 15 minutes; flip biscuits and bake until golden brown on both sides, about 15 minutes more. Let cool on pieces of waxed paper. Place biscuits into a sealed container and refrigerate overnight for best flavor.
