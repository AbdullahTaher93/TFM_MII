Bring rice and water to a boil in a pot. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 20 minutes, or until rice is tender and water has been absorbed. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the tofu in the oil until browned, about 10 minutes. Add the onion and garlic; cook and stir until the onion is translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Mix in the tomato paste and peanut butter; cook and stir until peanut butter has melted completely, about 5 minutes. Serve over cooked rice.
