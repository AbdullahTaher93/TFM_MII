Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the sausage until well browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes more. Remove the sausages, and cut them into 1 1/2-inch to 2-inch pieces. Pour the beef stock, tomatoes, tomato puree, and hot sauce into the skillet with the onion and bring the mixture to a simmer, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom. Place the carrots into a slow cooker, followed by the garbanzo beans and kidney beans. Arrange the sausage pieces on top. Pour the sauce from the skillet into the slow cooker. Cook on Low for 4 to 6 hours.
