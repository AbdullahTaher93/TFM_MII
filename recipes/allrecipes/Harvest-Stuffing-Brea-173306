Combine 1 cup all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, undissolved yeast, sugar, 2 tablespoons onions, parsley, poultry seasoning and salt in a large bowl. Heat water and butter until very warm (120 to 130 degrees F). Stir into flour mixture. Beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Stir in remaining all-purpose flour to make stiff batter. Cover and let rest 10 minutes. Turn batter into greased 1-1/2 quart casserole. Smooth top of dough in casserole with floured hands. Cover. Let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 minutes. Brush beaten egg on loaf. Sprinkle with remaining onion and celery seed. Bake at 375 degrees F for 35 minutes or until done.* Remove from casserole; cool on wire rack.
