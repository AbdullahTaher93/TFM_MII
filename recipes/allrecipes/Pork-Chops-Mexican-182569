Cook chops in large nonstick skillet sprayed with cooking spray on medium-high heat 2 to 3 min. on each side or until browned on both sides. Combine salsa, peanuts, cocoa and cinnamon; spoon over chops. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer 5 min. or until chops are no longer pink in the center and sauce is thickened, turning chops over and stirring sauce after 3 min. Sprinkle with cilantro.
