In a skillet, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Stir in the cream cheese until melted. Separate each tube of crescent dough into four rectangles; seal seams and perforations. Spread rectangles with sausage mixture. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long side. Pinch seams and ends to seal. Place seam side down on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand 5 minutes before cutting each roll diagonally into fourths.
