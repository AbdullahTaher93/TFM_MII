Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Prepare stuffing as directed on package. Combine Miracle Whip and mustard in small bowl; set aside. Arrange chops in 13x9-inch baking dish; brush with half of the mustard mixture. Turn chops over; brush with remaining mustard mixture. Top chops with stuffing; cover dish with foil. Bake 10 min. Meanwhile, place beans on large sheet of foil; drizzle with Italian dressing. Fold foil over and seal edges to form packet. Uncover chops; place bean packet in oven. Bake an additional 20 min. or until chops are cooked through (160 degrees F) and beans are heated through. Sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley, if desired.
