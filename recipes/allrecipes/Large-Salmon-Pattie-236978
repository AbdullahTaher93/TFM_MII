Mix salmon, bread crumbs, onion, eggs, flour, dill, basil, garlic salt, and onion powder together in a bowl; form into 5 large patties. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt shortening in a large frying pan over medium-high heat; fry patties until golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes per side. Transfer patties to a baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until patties are cooked through, about 20 more minutes.
