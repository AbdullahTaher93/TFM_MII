Sherry Vinaigrette: Combine vinegar, mustard, sea salt, pepper with Stevia Extract In The Raw. Whisk vigorously to dissolve. Add extra virgin olive oil and whisk in until incorporated. Set aside. Roasted Pears And Ricotta Salata: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F and place rack in middle position in oven. Toss the cut pears in the olive oil, sea salt and pepper. Carefully remove preheated sheet pan or saute pan from oven and spread pears out. Quickly put pears back into oven to roast approximately 5 minutes. They should be soft, but maintain firmness. Remove from oven and set aside on rack to cool. Shave ricotta salata or any hard cheese to substitute like pecorino romano or parmigiano reggiano. Place pears and cheese on radicchio and serve.
