Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine butter, seasoning, and salt in a bowl. Add seeds; stir with a spoon until coated. Spread in a single layer on the baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, about 45 minutes.
