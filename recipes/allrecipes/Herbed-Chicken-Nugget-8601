Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray. Trim any fat from chicken and cut into 1-inch cubes. In a bowl, beat the eggs with the water and add the chicken. Combine the parsley, thyme, red pepper, bread crumbs, wheat germ, basil and pepper. Stir in the oil with a fork and mix well to distribute evenly. Pour seasoning mixture into a resealable plastic bag and toss the chicken pieces to coat. Place coated chicken pieces on the prepared baking sheet and bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 10 minutes, turn the pieces, and bake for an additional 5 minutes.
