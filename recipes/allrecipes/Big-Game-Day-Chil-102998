Heat the oil in a large deep pot over medium-high heat, and stir in the onions, garlic, and bell peppers. Cook and stir until the onions are transparent, about 5 minutes. Add the beef stew meat, sausage, and bacon. Cook until meats are evenly browned. Drain the fat. Stir in the tomato sauce, tomato paste, black beans, kidney beans, chipotle peppers with sauce, beef broth, beer, chili powder, oregano, pepper, salt, and chocolate. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for at least 1 hour; 2 hours is preferred.
