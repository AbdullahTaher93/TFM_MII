Combine juice from canned pineapple, water, brown sugar, vinegar, and cornstarch in a saucepan; bring to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is thickened and you notice a change in color, about 5 minutes. Stir pineapple chunks, green bell pepper, and luncheon meat into sauce and simmer until heated through, about 10 minutes.
