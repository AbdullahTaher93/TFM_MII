Cut eggplant lengthwise into 1/2-in. thick slices. Place on a broiler pan. Brush with butter; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Broil 4 in. from the heat for 3-4 minutes on each side or until tender. Meanwhile, heat the tomato sauce and garlic powder. Drizzle over eggplant. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese if desired.
