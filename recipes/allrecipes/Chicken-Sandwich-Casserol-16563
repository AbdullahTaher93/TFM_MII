Place 6 slices of the toasted bread in the bottom of a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle the chicken, celery and onion on top of the bread, then cover with the other 6 slices of toasted bread. In a medium bowl mix together the beaten eggs, mayonnaise, milk and salt and pepper to taste. Pour this mixture over the sandwiches, then top with soup; cover baking dish and refrigerate overnight. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bake dish, covered, at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 45 minutes; remove cover, sprinkle with cheese, and bake for another 30 minutes, uncovered. Remove from oven and let cool and set for 10 minutes before serving.
