In a stockpot, combine chicken stock, star anise, cinnamon stick, and savory. Cook, covered, 15 minutes. Add the chicken, and poach, uncovered, on medium heat, until just cooked through, about 15 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer chicken to a plate. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add noodles, and cook until al dente, about 4 minutes. Strain, and place under cold running water to stop cooking. Set aside. Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium-low heat. Cook the leek, celery, carrot, and garlic until softened, about 6 minutes. Add portobello. Cook 5 minutes. Remove star anise and cinnamon from broth; add broth to the sauteed vegetables. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat; cook 10 minutes. Slice chicken on the bias 1/4 inch thick. Add chicken, noodles, and spinach to broth. Over medium heat, cook until spinach has wilted, about 2 minutes. Ladle mixture into individual bowls, and serve immediately.
