Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Wash and sort cranberries. Combine sugar, vinegar, port, orange marmalade, raisins, pumpkin pie spice, curry powder, and salt in a large bowl. Add cranberries and mix well. Spray a 2-quart baking dish with non-stick cooking spray. Pour in cranberries and cover with foil. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes until cranberries are soft. Let sit for 10 to 15 minutes before serving to thicken slightly.
