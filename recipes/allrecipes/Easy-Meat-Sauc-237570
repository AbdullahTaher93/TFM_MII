Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; saute onion in hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Season onion with Italian seasoning; continue to saute until the herbs are fragrant, about 3 minutes more. Break beef into small pieces and add to the skillet; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir tomato sauce and diced tomatoes into the beef mixture; season with salt, place a lid on the skillet, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer for 1 hour. Splash wine over the mixture, stir, and simmer until thickened, about 20 minutes.
