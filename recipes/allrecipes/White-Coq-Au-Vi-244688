Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine cream of mushroom soup, Cheddar cheese, and half-and-half in a saucepan; bring to a boil, stirring often. Remove saucepan from heat and stir white wine and mayonnaise, a little at a time, into soup mixture, stirring after each addition until white sauce is smooth. Arrange chicken breasts side-by-side in a shallow baking dish. Pour white sauce over chicken and top with Parmesan cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and chicken is warmed, about 45 minutes.
