Rinse bell peppers; discard stems and seeds. Finely chop peppers. In a 2- to 2 1/2-quart pan, combine bell peppers, onion, vinegar, and sugar; add chili flakes to taste. Bring mixture to a boil over high heat. Stir often over medium-high heat until liquid looks syrupy and is reduced to about 3 tablespoons, about 25 minutes. Add salt to taste.
