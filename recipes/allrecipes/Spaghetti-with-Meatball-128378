To Make the Meatballs: Coat a Dutch oven with nonstick spray. Warm over medium heat. Add the onions, parsley, and garlic. Cook, stirring often, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the onions are soft. Add a few tablespoons water, if necessary, to prevent the onions from sticking. Remove 1/4 cup of the onion mixture to a large bowl. Set the remainder aside. To the bowl, add the bread crumbs, milk, egg, Italian seasoning, and salt. Stir to mix. Stir in the beef and turkey. Shape into 12 meatballs, each 2 inches in diameter. Return the Dutch oven to the stove top. Warm the oil over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs. Cook, turning often, for 5 minutes, or until well-browned. To Make the Sauce: To the Dutch oven, add the tomato sauce, diced tomatoes (with juice), sugar, Italian seasoning, and the reserved onion mixture. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through. Meanwhile, cook the pasta according to package directions. Place in a serving bowl. Top with the sauce and meatballs.
