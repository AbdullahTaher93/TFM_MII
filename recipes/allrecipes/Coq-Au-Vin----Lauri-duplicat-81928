Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large skillet over high heat fry the bacon until crispy. Transfer to bacon to paper towel. Crumble bacon when it cools. Cook the chicken parts in the bacon fat until brown all over. Work in batches. Transfer chicken to a deep casserole dish that has a lid (aluminum foil can be used as a lid). Pour off most of the bacon fat, leaving about 1 Tbsp. Over medium-high heat, saute the onions, shallots and garlic for about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook for another 2 minutes; stirring frequently. Add the red wine and the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and pour the wine and mushrooms over the chicken. Add the thyme, bay leaf and half the bacon. Cover and cook in a 350 degrees F oven for about 1 hour. Carefully pour or ladle out the majority of the liquids into a sauce pan. Remove and discard the bay leaf. Return the chicken to the oven, covered. Reduce heat to 200 degrees F. Add the tomato paste to the liquids and bring to a boil. Cook sauce, stirring frequently until the sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon (approx 15 minutes). Taste test and add salt and pepper as desired. Place the chicken on to a serving platter (add any liquids to the sauce). Pour the sauce over the chicken and garnish with the remaining bacon and the parsley.
