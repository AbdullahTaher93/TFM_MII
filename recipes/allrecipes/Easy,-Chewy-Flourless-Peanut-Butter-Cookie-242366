Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat peanut butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Stir egg, vanilla extract, and baking soda into peanut butter mixture; stir in chocolate chips. Drop mixture by small rounded spoonfuls onto a baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are flattened and golden, about 8 minutes.
