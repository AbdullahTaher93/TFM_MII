In a skillet, saute onion and garlic in butter, until onion becomes tender and begins to brown. Add undrained tomatoes, water, salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer. While soup is simmering, toast rolled oats in a heavy bottomed sauce pan, stirring till they are brown. Stir in oats to soup and cook for about 6 to 10 minutes, and then serve.
