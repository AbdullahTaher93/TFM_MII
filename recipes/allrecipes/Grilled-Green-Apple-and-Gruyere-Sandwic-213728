Preheat large heavy skillet over medium heat. Spread 1 side of each slice of bread with 1 teaspoon butter. Place 4 slices bread, butter side down, into skillet. Layer apple slices, cheese and honey evenly onto bread in skillet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Top with remaining bread, butter side up, creating 4 sandwiches. Cook 3 to 4 minutes or until the bottom slices of bread are golden brown. Carefully flip each sandwich. Cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until golden brown and cheese is melted.
