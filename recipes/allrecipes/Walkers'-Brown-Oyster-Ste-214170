Cook the bacon in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat until browned and crispy, about 10 minutes. Pour off all but 1/4 cup of bacon fat, and stir in the onions and celery until the onions have turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the flour, and cook until the flour begins to brown, about 10 minutes. Pour in the clam juice, water, and potatoes. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are just tender, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, and stir in the oysters. Recover, and simmer 5 minutes until the oysters have firmed. Ladle into bowls to serve.
