Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. Put stuffing mix in a heavy-duty plastic bag; seal bag, then use a rolling pin to crush stuffing into evenly coarse crumbs. Pour crumbs into a shallow pan. In another shallow pan, beat egg with water. Rinse turkey and pat dry. Turn each turkey slice in egg mixture to coat; drain briefly. Then turn in crumbs, pressing firmly to coat well all over. Place turkey in a single layer in a lightly oiled shallow 10- by 15-inch baking pan. Drizzle evenly with butter. Bake until coating is golden brown and meat is no longer pink in thickest part; cut to test (about 10 minutes). Transfer to a platter. While turkey is baking, drain tomatoes, reserving 1 tablespoon of the oil. Chop tomatoes and place in a small nonstick frying pan along with olives and reserved tomato oil. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes to allow flavors to blend. To serve, top turkey cutlets with olive-tomato mixture. Offer lemon wedges to season individual servings to taste.
