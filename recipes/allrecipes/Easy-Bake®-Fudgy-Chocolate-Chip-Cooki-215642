PREHEAT your oven for 15 minutes. PREPARE THE PAN. Spray the baking pan with cooking spray to prevent sticking. MIX THE DOUGH. Pour one cookie mix and 3/4 teaspoon of water into a bowl. Stir until you form a dough. SHAPE THE COOKIE. Press the dough evenly into the baking pan. BAKE THE COOKIE. Use the pan pusher to move the cookie into the oven. Bake for 10 minutes. After baking, use the pan pusher to move the cookie into the cooling chamber. Let it cool for 10 minutes. MIX THE FROSTING. Pour one frosting mix and 1 teaspoon of water into a warming cup. Stir until smooth. If the frosting is too thick, add an extra drop or two of water. WARM THE FROSTING. Slide the frosting into the warming chamber. Allow the frosting to warm, but do not let it get hot. FINISHING TOUCHES. Use a spoon to drizzle the warm frosting over your cookie and serve!
