Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread mayonnaise on each half of the split hoagie rolls. Layer 1/4 cup turkey, 1/4 cup stuffing, 2 tablespoons gravy, and 2 tablespoons cranberry sauce on each of the four hoagie halves. Top each sandwich with the remaining 4 pieces of bread. Wrap each sandwich in aluminum foil and place in the oven for 15 minutes or until the sandwiches are heated through.
