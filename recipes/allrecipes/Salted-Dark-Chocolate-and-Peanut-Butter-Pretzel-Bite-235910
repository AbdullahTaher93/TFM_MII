Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or waxed paper. Arrange pretzels on the prepared baking sheet. Melt chocolate chips and milk together in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, whisking frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and gradually stir peanut butter into chocolate mixture until fully melted. Remove chocolate-peanut butter mixture from heat and drizzle over pretzels. Freeze pretzels until coating is hardened, at least 2 hours.
