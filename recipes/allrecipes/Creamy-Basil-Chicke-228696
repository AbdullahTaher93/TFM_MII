Cook and drain pasta as directed on package. In resealable food-storage plastic bag, place dressing and chicken. Seal bag; refrigerate 15 minutes. In 12-inch skillet, heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil over medium-low heat. Drain chicken, discarding dressing. Add chicken to skillet. Cook chicken 5 to 7 minutes on each side or until juice of chicken is clear when center of thickest part is cut (at least 165Â°F). Stir in wine; cook until most of the wine has evaporated. Stir in cooking sauce, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Heat to boiling; reduce heat to low. Simmer uncovered 4 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until hot. Serve over pasta. Top with basil and Parmesan cheese.
