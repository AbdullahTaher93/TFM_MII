Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sprinkle almond slices on cookie sheet and bake for about 5-7 minutes or until lightly toasted, stirring occasionally. Set aside. Reduce oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). In medium bowl, beat egg whites, vanilla and vinegar at high speed until foamy, about 2 minutes. Combine Stevia Extract In The Raw with both sugars, and gradually add Stevia mixture, about 1 tablespoon at a time, while beating until stiff peaks form. Fold in coconut and almond meal. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper and drop rounded teaspoons of meringue batter onto prepared cookie sheets. Decorate with toasted almond slices. Bake at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for 15 minutes then reduce oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) for about 1 hour 45 minutes. Remove from oven. Cool for about 1 minute on cookie sheet before removing to wire rack to complete cooling. Store in airtight tin.
