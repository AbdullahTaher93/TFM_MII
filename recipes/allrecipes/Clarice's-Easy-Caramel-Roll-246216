Cut bread dough into 32 equal slices. Place slices in a single layer in baking dish. Combine nuts, white sugar, brown sugar, vanilla pudding mix, and cinnamon together in a bowl; sprinkle over dough slices. Cut 1/2 cup butter into slices, distribute on dough. Let rolls rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until sugar is brown and bubbly, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool in the baking dish for 5 minutes before carefully invert baking dish onto a work surface and gently tap bottom to release rolls.
