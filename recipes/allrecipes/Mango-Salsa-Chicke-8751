TO MAKE SALSA: In a small bowl, combine the mango, onion, cilantro, green bell pepper and red chile pepper. Put aside until serving time. Lightly pound the chicken breasts with a mallet to flatten. Beat the egg and milk together. Then coat them in the egg/milk mixture then the breadcrumbs. Chill for 1/2 hour. Saute the chicken in olive oil until cooked through and juices run clear. Drain and serve with the mango salsa. Garnish with cilantro leaves.
