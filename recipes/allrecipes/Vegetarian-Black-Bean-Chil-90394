In a large pot over medium-low heat, mix the applesauce, brown sugar, coriander, cayenne pepper, cumin, oregano, cloves, rosemary, sage, thyme and asafoetida powder. Cook just until heated through. Stir in black beans and tomato paste. Mix in garlic, onion, squash, carrots, sweet potato and mushrooms. Pour in enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
