Heat a saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage, onion, bell pepper, and celery together in the hot skillet until sausage is browned and vegetables are tender, 7 to 10 minutes; drain and discard grease. Pour chicken broth into the pot; add white rice and yellow rice. Bring the mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the rice is tender and the moisture is absorbed, 20 to 30 minutes.
