Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Drain and finely chop artichoke hearts. Place in clean kitchen towel; squeeze to remove excess moisture. Combine artichoke hearts with Parmesan cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise, thyme, garlic and pepper. Place in small (2-1/2 to 3-cup) baking dish. Sprinkle with paprika, if desired. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until hot. Serve with Keebler(R) Toasteds(R) crackers.
