In a large bowl, combine the first five ingredients. In another bowl, beat the egg, milk and oil until smooth. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in the nuts. Pour into a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
