Cook sausage links according to package directions; drain, cut into 1/2-inch slices and set aside. In a large bowl, combine mozzarella, ricotta, egg, parsley and seasonings. On a lightly floured surface, cut dough in half. Roll each into a 12-inch circle. On two parchment-lined baking sheets, carefully place one dough round on each baking sheet. Spoon 1/2 cup of pizza sauce, half the cheese mixture and half of the sausage slices onto the lower half of each dough round, keep the outer 1/2-inch of dough free of ingredients. With a pastry brush, moisten the outer 1/2-inch of each round with water. Fold dough over filling and crimp edges firmly to seal. Bake at 350F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Cut each Calzone in half and serve with remaining pizza sauce.
