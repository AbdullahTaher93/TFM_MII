Cook the linguine according to the package directions. Add the broccoli for the last 4 minutes of the cooking time. Drain the linguine and broccoli well in a colander. Stir the soup, milk, cheese and black pepper in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the turkey and linguine mixture and cook until it's hot and bubbling. Serve with additional Parmesan cheese.
