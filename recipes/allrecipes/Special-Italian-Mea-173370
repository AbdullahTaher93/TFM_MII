Preheat an oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Whisk together the flour, salt, pepper, and paprika in a large bowl; set aside. Dissolve the bouillon cube in the water in a 2 quart casserole dish, then whisk in the sherry, tomato soup, garlic powder, sugar, oregano, thyme, rosemary until blended; set aside. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Toss the beef in the flour mixture to coat, and shake off excess. Cook the beef in the hot oil, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides. Remove the beef to the casserole dish, and reduce heat to medium. Stir in the onion, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir the onion into the beef mixture. Cover, and bake in the preheated oven until the meat is very tender, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.
