In a large, heavy pot or a large enameled cast-iron casserole dish, set over medium-high heat, heat the oil. Add the ground turkey and cook, breaking the turkey with a wooden spoon and stirring, until browned, about 5 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer to a bowl and set aside. Add the onions and zucchini to the pot and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent, about 6-8 minutes. Add the garlic, chili, cumin, oregano, salt, and black pepper and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add the turkey, tomatoes with the liquid, beans and chocolate, stir until chocolate melts. Simmer the chili over low heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve the garnishes in individual bowls as a toppings bar, or serve individually, topping each bowl with a dollop of sour cream, sprinkle of cheese and scallions. Kids can crumble tortilla chips on top.
