Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. Prepare the instant long grain and wild rice mix according to package directions. Spread 1/2 the cooked rice mix over the bottom of the prepared baking dish. In a bowl, mix the sour cream and green chiles. Spread 1/2 the sour cream mixture over rice, and top with 1/2 the cheese. Repeat the layers. Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until bubbly.
