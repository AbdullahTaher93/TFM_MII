Stir the red wine, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and brown sugar together in a bowl until the sugar is thoroughly incorporated into the mixture; set aside. Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir the onion in the melted butter until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the mushrooms, season with black pepper, and continue cooking and stirring another 3 minutes. As the mushrooms reduce in size and begin to brown, stir the wine mixture into the mushroom mixture. Simmer until hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve immediately.
