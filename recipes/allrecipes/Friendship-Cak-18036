Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. In a large bowl, combine cake mix with eggs and oil. Mix thoroughly and stir in fruit and nuts. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
