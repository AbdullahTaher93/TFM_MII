Mix popcorn, candy corn, peanuts, and peanut butter pieces together in a large bowl. Melt the almond bark in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until smooth, 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch. Pour melted almond bark over popcorn mixture; stir until popcorn is well coated. Spread popcorn mixture out onto a flat surface lined with waxed paper or parchment. Let dry completely, then break into clumps.
