Whisk together lemon juice, olive oil, parsley, pepper flakes, and salt in a bowl. Add bass fillets; marinate for 10 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill bass on the preheated grill until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes each side. Discard any remaining marinade.
