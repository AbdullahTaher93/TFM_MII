In a wide nonstick frying pan, stir almonds over medium heat just until golden, about 4 minutes. Pour out of pan and set aside. Rinse chicken and pat dry. In a small bowl, mix tarragon, garlic, and oil; rub all over chicken to coat evenly. Place frying pan over medium heat; when hot, add chicken and cook, turning once, until meat in thickest part is no longer pink; cut to test (8 to 10 minutes). In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, lemon juice, sugar, and poppy seeds; mix well. In a large bowl, combine salad mix, strawberries, and half the mayonnaise dressing; mix lightly to coat with dressing. Divide salad among dinner plates. Cut chicken on the diagonal into wide strips; set chicken alongside or on top of salad. Drizzle chicken with remaining dressing, then sprinkle with toasted almonds. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
