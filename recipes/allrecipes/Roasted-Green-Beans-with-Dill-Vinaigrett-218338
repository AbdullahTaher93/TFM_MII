Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Combine the green beans in a large bowl with 1 tablespoon olive oil and the coarse salt; toss to coat. Roast the green beans in the preheated oven until cooked through, about 20 minutes. Whisk 1 tablespoon of olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, sugar, dill, and pepper together in a bowl; drizzle over the roasted green beans to serve.
