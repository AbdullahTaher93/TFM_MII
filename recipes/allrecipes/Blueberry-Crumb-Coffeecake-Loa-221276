Combine muffin mixes, water, sour cream, egg, lemon juice and lemon peel in large bowl until moistened. Spread into prepared pan. Mix flour, brown sugar and butter with a fork until blended. Crumble over batter. Bake 55 to 60 minutes or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 20 minutes. Using the foil, lift loaf out of pan. Cool completely.
