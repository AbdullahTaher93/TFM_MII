Place shiitake mushrooms in a small bowl. Cover with hot water and let soak until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain. Squeeze out excess water and slice. Pound cilantro root, garlic, and black peppercorns into a coarse paste in a mortar and pestle. Transfer paste to a large pot. Pour beef stock into the pot. Add pork belly and chicken wings. Bring to a simmer; cook for 10 minutes. Add sliced shiitake mushrooms, tofu, and pickled radish. Simmer soup until chicken wings are cooked through, about 45 minutes. Stir in oyster sauce and soy sauce. Season with fish sauce and sea salt. Place a steamer basket into a large pot and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add noodles, cover, and steam until tender, about 5 minutes. Place some noodles in each serving bowl and ladle soup on top. Garnish with bean sprouts, green onions, and cilantro.
