Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil; add green beans, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook pecans in melted butter until lightly browned; add green beans and stir to coat in butter. Season beans with salt.
