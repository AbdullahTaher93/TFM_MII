Heat the oil in a 6-quart saucepot over medium heat. Add the onion, zucchini, carrots, mushrooms and peppers and cook for 5 minutes or until the vegetables are tender-crisp, stirring often. Stir the beans, sauce, chipotle pepper and oregano in the saucepot and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 10 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.
