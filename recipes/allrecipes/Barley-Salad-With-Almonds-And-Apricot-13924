Rinse barley in a fine sieve. Bring water to a boil in a heavy saucepan. Stir in the barley, and return to a boil. Cover, and reduce heat. Simmer until water is absorbed, about 45 to 50 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Pour oil into a small skillet, and place over medium heat. Add onion, and saute until golden brown. In a serving dish, combine barley, onion, apricots, almonds, and parsley. Toss. In a small bowl, mix together yogurt, honey, lemon juice, cinnamon, turmeric, salt, and nutmeg. Pour over the barley mixture ,and toss well to combine. Serve at room temperature.
