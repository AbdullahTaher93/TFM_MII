In a medium bowl, mix together ginger, tamari, sea salt, barley flour, and water. Stir in mung bean sprouts, coating the sprouts with the batter. You may want to break some sprouts into smaller pieces before adding to the batter. Heat vegetable oil and sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Reduce heat to low, and pour in batter to make one 6 inch pancake. Cook for about 4 minutes on each side. Serve hot or cool. Sprinkle cayenne pepper or more soy sauce over the cooked pancake if you like!
