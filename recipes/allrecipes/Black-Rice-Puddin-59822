Rinse and drain glutinous black rice and glutinous white rice, then combine with sugar and water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and cook until rice is tender and creamy, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes. Stir in coconut cream and vanilla extract. Serve warm.
