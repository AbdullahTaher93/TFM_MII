Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet or line with baking parchment. Mix onions, sugar, egg, vegetable oil, and warm water in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Mix the baking powder, salt, pepper, and poppy seeds into the onion mixture. Beat the flour into the onion mixture in batches with the mixer set to Low speed until incorporated into a dough. Drop dough by the tablespoon onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, 20 to 30 minutes.
