Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. In a small bowl mix salsa, preserves and vinegar; set aside. Coat each side of the pork chops with 1 teaspoon of taco seasoning. Add chops to pan; cook until deep brown and cooked through, about 5 to 7 minutes per side. Transfer pork chops to dinner plates and keep warm. Add salsa mixture to the skillet. Stir and bring to a simmer. Cook for about 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Spoon a portion of sauce over each chop and serve.
