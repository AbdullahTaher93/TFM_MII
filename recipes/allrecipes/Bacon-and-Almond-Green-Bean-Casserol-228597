Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels; break into 1-inch pieces. Stir milk and cream of mushroom soup together in a large bowl. Add almonds, garlic pepper, and 3/4 can French-fried onion; stir to combine. Fold green beans carefully into mixture. Pour into a 9x9-inch ceramic or glass baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and bubbling, about 20 minutes. Top with remaining 1/4 can French-fried onions; bake until onions are lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes.
