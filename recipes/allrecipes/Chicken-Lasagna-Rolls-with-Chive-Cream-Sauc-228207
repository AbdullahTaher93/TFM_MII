Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions. Drain noodles; rinse with cold water. Drain again. Cut each in half crosswise; set aside. Meanwhile, for white sauce, in a medium mixing bowl, beat cream cheese with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Slowly add milk, beating until smooth. Stir in Romano cheese and chives. For filling, in a medium mixing bowl, stir together 1/2 cup of the white sauce, the chicken, broccoli, roasted red sweet peppers, and ground black pepper. Place about 1/4 cup filling at one end of each cooked noodle. Roll up noodles around filling. Arrange rolls, seam sides down, in a 3-quart rectangular baking dish. Spoon the Classico(R) Four Cheese pasta sauce over the rolls. Spoon remaining white sauce over Classico(R) Four Cheese pasta sauce. Cover with foil. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until heated through.
