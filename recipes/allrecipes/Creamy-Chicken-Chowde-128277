Combine the broth, carrots, celery, onions, garlic, mushrooms, salt, and rosemary in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Using a slotted spoon, transfer half of the vegetable mixture to a food processor. Process until pureed. Return to the saucepan. Stir in the chicken and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the flour until smooth. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Gradually add the milk and cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes, or until thickened. Stir into the chicken mixture. Add the peas, parsley, and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, or until the mixture is heated through and the peas are tender.
