Cut papayas in half lengthwise (do not peel); remove seeds. Set, cut side up, in a 9- by 12-inch baking pan; brush with half the butter. Bake in a 375 degrees F oven until very warm, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, combine 1/4 cup water, honey, lemon juice, ginger, Chinese five-spice, and cornstarch. Stir well and set aside. Place a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add remaining butter and ham; saute until meat is slightly tinged with brown, about 5 minutes. Add peas and saute for about 3 minutes. Stir honey mixture, then add to pan; stir until mixture boils. Spoon ham and peas equally into papayas.
