Whisk together the peanut butter and beef broth in a medium bowl until well blended. Season the meat with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large stew pot over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, bell pepper and carrots. Saute until the onions are translucent. Add the meat and continue to cook, stirring often, until browned on all sides. Add the peanut butter mixture, tomatoes with liquid, thyme and bay leaf. Stir well. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally for about 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is tender. Remove the bay leaf and discard. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve hot over cooked rice.
