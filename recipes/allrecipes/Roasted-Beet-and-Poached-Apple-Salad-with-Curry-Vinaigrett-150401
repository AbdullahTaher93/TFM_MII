Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the beets in a small roasting pan, cover with foil and bake for about 1 hour, or until tender. Peel the beets, then slice them 1/4 inch thick. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, combine the apple juice and wine with the sugar, saffron and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil. Strain in a fine strainer and return to the saucepan. Bring back to a boil and add the apples. Simmer over moderate heat for 3 minutes, or until the apples are crisp-tender. Drain the apples and discard the liquid. In a small skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of the vegetable oil. Add the curry powder, remove the skillet from the heat and let stand for 10 minutes. Stir in the remaining 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil, along with the vinegar, pine nuts and raisins; season the dressing with salt. In a medium bowl, toss the apples with half of the dressing and arrange on a serving platter. Put the beets in the bowl and toss with the remaining dressing. Arrange the beets on the platter, garnish with the parsley and serve.
