Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until very tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Blend broccoli, sour cream, onion, lemon juice, chili powder, salt, and garlic in a food processor or blender until very smooth. Refrigerate until completely chilled, 2 to 3 hours.
