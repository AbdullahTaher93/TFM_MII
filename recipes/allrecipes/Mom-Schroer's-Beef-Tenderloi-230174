Mix olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt, oregano, basil, rosemary, and black pepper together in a bowl; rub marinade onto tenderloin. Wrap the coated tenderloin with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 days. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Place tenderloin on a baking sheet and broil in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Turn tenderloin onto opposite side and broil for additional 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Cook tenderloin to your desired degree of doneness, with an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C) for medium-rare, about 2 hours.
