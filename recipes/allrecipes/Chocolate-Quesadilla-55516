Lightly coat one side of each tortilla with cooking spray. Place tortillas on clean work surface, coated sides down. Spread 1 tablespoon each peanut butter and marshmallow creme on half of each tortilla. Arrange 1/4 of the banana slices and 2 tablespoons chocolate chips over marshmallow creme; fold each tortilla over to cover filling. Heat large non-stick skillet over medium heat 1 minute. Add two quesadillas; cook 1 to 2 minutes or until tortillas are golden brown and crisp, turning once. Repeat with remaining quesadillas. Serve warm.
