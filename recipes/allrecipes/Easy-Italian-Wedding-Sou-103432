In a medium bowl, mix egg, bread crumbs, milk, Parmesan cheese, parsley, salt and black pepper until moistened. Mix in ground beef, just until combined. Shape meat mixture into small 1-inch meatballs. Cook meatballs in large, nonstick skillet for 8 to 10 minutes or until no longer pink inside, shaking pan often to turn meatballs and help keep them round. Meanwhile, in a 2-quart saucepan, bring chicken broth to a boil over high heat. Add pasta and reduce heat. Simmer pasta in broth for 14 minutes, or until tender. Add spinach, carrots and meatballs and simmer 1 minute or until spinach has cooked through.
