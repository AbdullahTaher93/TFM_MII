Place onions, cabbage, bell peppers, and tomatoes in a food processor, and pulse until finely minced. Drain, and remove contents to a large bowl. Sprinkle with salt, cover, and let stand overnight. Pour contents into a colander; rinse, and drain. Return contents to bowl. In a separate bowl, stir together mustard seed, celery seed, turmeric, sugar, white vinegar, and water. Pour over vegetable mixture, and stir to combine. Pour mixture into a large pot, and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 5 to 10 minutes. Store, refrigerated, in sterilized, sealed pint jars.
