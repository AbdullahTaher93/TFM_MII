Mix flour, basil, and onion powder in a large bowl. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Whisk eggs and 1 3/4 cups water in another bowl; pour egg mixture into the well and stir until combined. Dough will be thick. Bring 4 cups water and 2 tablespoons salt to a boil in a wide pot. Place part of the dough into a spaetzle press or potato ricer. Press dough into boiling water; cook and stir until pasta is tender, about 1 minutes. Remove pasta with a slotted spoon to a large bowl. Repeat with remaining dough.
