Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix together venison, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, crackers, and egg in a bowl. Season with mustard, cilantro, garlic powder, onion flakes, thyme, cinnamon, and paprika; mix well. Pat mixture into a 9x9-inch pan, or a loaf pan. Bake in preheated oven to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 40 minutes. Stir together the ketchup, with 1 tablespoon brown sugar. Spread on top of the meatloaf, and place back in the oven for 10 minutes more.
