In food processor, process cereal, cheese, Italian seasoning, flour and garlic salt until cereal is fine crumbs. Place in shallow bowl. Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry. Dip each piece in salad dressing letting excess drip off. Coat with cereal mixture. Place on foil-lined baking sheet or shallow baking pan, sprayed with non-stick cooking spray. Spray chicken lightly with cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) for about 30 minutes, or until tender and no longer pink inside. Do not cover or turn while baking.
