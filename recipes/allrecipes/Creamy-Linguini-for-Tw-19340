Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for about 7 to 8 minutes or until al dente; drain. Remove from pot, cover and set aside. Meanwhile, in a small skillet cook bacon over medium heat until crispy. Break up into small pieces and set aside. In the pasta pot, melt butter over medium-low heat and add cream; heat thoroughly, but do not allow to boil. Combine cooked pasta with butter/cream mixture. Add Parmesan cheese and bacon; toss well. Allow sauce to thicken for a few minutes; add ground white pepper and nutmeg. Serve immediately.
