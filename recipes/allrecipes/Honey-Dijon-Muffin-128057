Heat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat 12 muffin cups with nonstick spray. Whisk flour, baking powder, and baking soda in a bowl. In another bowl, whisk 5 tablespoons (75 ml) of honey and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of mustard. Add milk, egg, and oil, and whisk until blended. Add milk mixture to dry ingredients and stir just until moistened; divide batter among muffin cups. Bake until a toothpick inserted into center of a muffin comes out clean, about 18 minutes. Remove muffins from pan and place on a wire rack to cool. In a cup, blend remaining 1 tablespoon (15 ml) honey and remaining 1 tablespoon (15 ml) mustard, and brush over warm muffins. Serve warm or cooled.
