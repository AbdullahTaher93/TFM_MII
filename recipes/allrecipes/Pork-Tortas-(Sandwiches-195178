Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Roast pork until the internal temperature as measured with an instant-read thermometer reaches 150 degrees F., about 30 minutes. Remove pork from the oven and allow to rest for about 10 minutes. Transfer pork to a cutting board and carve into very thin slices. Use your fingers to hollow out the bottom half of the bread. Spread 1/3 cup of beans in the hollow of each half. Arrange 3 to 4 pork slices over the beans; layer on the pickled jalapenos, tomatoes and cilantro. Spread mayonnaise on the top half of the bread and place on top to make a sandwich. Serve immediately.
