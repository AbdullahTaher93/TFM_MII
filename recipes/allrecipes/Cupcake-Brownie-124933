In a small saucepan over low heat, melt butter and chocolate; cool for 10 minutes. In a mixing bowl, beat eggs and sugar. Add vanilla and chocolate mixture; stir in flour and nuts. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until brownies test done with a wooden pick. Cool.
