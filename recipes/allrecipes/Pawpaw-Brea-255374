Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the bottom of an 8-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Combine sugar and butter in a bowl; beat together until smooth. Beat in eggs. Add pawpaw pulp and water; beat until combined, about 30 seconds. Stir in flour, walnuts, baking soda, salt, and baking powder. Pour into the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Allow to cool before slicing, about 30 minutes.
