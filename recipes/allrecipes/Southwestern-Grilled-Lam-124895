In a saucepan, combine the first eight ingredients. Simmer, uncovered, for 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, grill lamb chops, turning once, over medium coals for 10-14 minutes for rare, 14-16 minutes for medium or 16-20 minutes for well-done. Brush with sauce during the last few minutes of grilling. Serve with sour cream.
