In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the linguine until al dente; drain. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, heat the olive oil. Add the diced fennel and chopped garlic and cook over moderate heat until the fennel is softened, about 10 minutes. Add the clams and the white wine, cover the saucepan and cook over moderately high heat until the clams open, about 5 minutes. Discard any clams that do not open. Add the cooked linguine to the clams and toss over moderate heat until the pasta is well coated, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with the chopped parsley and season with salt. Transfer to warm bowls and serve right away.
