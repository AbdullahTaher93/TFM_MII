Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Place the softened butter, Gorgonzola cheese, thyme, rosemary, parsley, red pepper flakes, garlic, and pine nuts into the bowl of a food processor. Puree until incorporated, taste, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Season the steaks on all sides with salt and pepper. Grill to desired doneness on preheated grill, about 5 minutes per side for medium rare. To serve, top each with about 2 tablespoons of the butter.
