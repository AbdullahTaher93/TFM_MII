Combine chicken broth, potatoes, and garlic in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer and cook until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Stir milk into the mixture, place over medium heat, and simmer until warm, about 5 minutes; add soy sauce and black pepper. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese into the soup in small batches while stirring, allowing each addition to melt into the soup before adding more. Pour soup into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid in place; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Return blended soup to the saucepan; return to a simmer over medium heat. Slowly stream beer into the soup while gently stirring. Garnish with paprika to serve.
