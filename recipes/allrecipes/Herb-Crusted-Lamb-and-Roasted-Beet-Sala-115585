Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 425 degrees F. Place beets and fennel on a large piece of foil. Drizzle with 1 1/2 teaspoons oil, wrap in foil and place on a baking sheet. Bake until the vegetables are easily pierced with a knife, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Unwrap, being careful of steam, transfer to a cutting board and let cool slightly. About 15 minutes before the beets and fennel are ready, combine wheat germ, parsley, rosemary, thyme and fennel seed in a large plastic bag; shake until combined. Add lamb cubes and shake to coat with the herb mixture. Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium, add the lamb and cook, turning often, 6 to 9 minutes for medium. Cover and set aside. Whisk the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, vinegar, shallot and mustard in a small bowl. Peel the beets, cut them and the fennel in half and then cut both into 1/4-inch slices. Place lettuce in a large serving bowl; top with the beets, fennel and lamb and drizzle with the dressing.
