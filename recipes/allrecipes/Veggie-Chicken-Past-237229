Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken in hot oil until browned completely, 3 to 5 minutes. Add asparagus, zucchini, yellow squash, onion, and mushrooms; continue to cook until the chicken is no longer pink in the middle, about 5 minutes more. Pour chicken broth over the vegetable mixture, place a cover on the skillet, and continue cooking until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir cooked pasta into the vegetable mixture; season with red pepper flakes and top with feta cheese.
