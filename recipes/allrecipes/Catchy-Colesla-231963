Toss green cabbage, carrot, red cabbage, and onion in a colander and sprinkle with kosher salt. Set aside to drip for 30 minutes. Heat cider vinegar, sugar, celery seed, and dry mustard together in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and let cool. Squeeze as much juice as possible from cabbage mixture and transfer vegetables to a serving bowl. Pour vinegar mixture to taste over vegetables and drizzle vegetable oil over the top. Sprinkle with black pepper and stir coleslaw to coat with dressing. Refrigerate 2 hours before serving for flavors to blend.
