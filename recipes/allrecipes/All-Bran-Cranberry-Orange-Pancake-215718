In medium bowl, stir together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Set aside. In large bowl, lightly beat egg. Stir in milk and oil. Grate orange rind; add to egg mixture. Cut remaining peel from orange and finely chop flesh; add flesh to egg mixture. Stir in All-Bran cereal and chopped cranberries. (Thaw, drain and chop frozen cranberries.) Stir in dry ingredients, mixing just until combined. (Will thicken if it sits awhile, add more milk as needed.) Using 75 mL (1/3 cup) batter for each pancake, pour batter onto lightly greased preheated non-stick skillet. Cook until bubbles form on surface, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook about 1 minute longer, until golden brown. Serve immediately with maple syrup.
