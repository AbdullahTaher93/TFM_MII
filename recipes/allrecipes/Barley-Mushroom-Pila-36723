Remove and discard stems from mushrooms, and slice mushroom caps. Heat a large nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray over medium-high heat until hot. Add mushrooms, and saute 3 minutes. Remove from skillet. Heat oil in skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion; cover and cook 6 minutes. Add bell peppers; cover and cook 2 minutes.
