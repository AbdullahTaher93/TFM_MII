In a large pot over medium high heat, brown the meat on all sides in the butter. Add 4 cups of the water and bring to a boil. Add the onion, salt and ground black pepper. Reduce heat to low and simmer for one hour. Add the carrots, celery and potatoes and simmer for another 1 1/2 hours. Then combine the flour and remaining 1/2 cup water in a separate small bowl, forming a thin paste. Add this to the soup, stirring well; simmer for 15 more minutes.
