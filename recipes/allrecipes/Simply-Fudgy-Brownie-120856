In a small bowl, combine cocoa and oil until smooth. In another bowl, beat eggs. Add the sugar, vanilla and cocoa mixture; mix well. Stir in flour and salt just until moistened. Fold in walnuts. Pour into a greased 8-in. square baking pan; sprinkle with chocolate chips. Bake at 325 degrees F for 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
