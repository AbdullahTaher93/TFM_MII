Bring the water to a boil and add the rice, bay leaf, thyme, sage and the salt and pepper. Bring back to the boil, cover and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook for 40 minutes if using as a stuffing, and 60 minutes as a side dish. Drain, lightly rinse and remove the bay leaf. Meanwhile, in a sauce pan or small skillet, melt the butter over medium high heat. Add the celery and saute for 1 minute; add the garlic and saute for another minute. For a stuffing: remove from heat and toss with the rice, hazelnuts and scallions. Taste test before stuffing the bird and add additional thyme, sage or salt and pepper. As a side dish: add the scallions and hazelnut to the fry pan and saute for 1 or 2 minutes then combine with the rice. Taste test and add additional thyme, sage or salt and pepper as needed. Remove from heat and cover. Let stand for a couple of minutes. Serve.
