Preheat oven to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 inch pie plate. In a large glass or metal bowl, beat egg whites until soft mounds form. Gradually add sugar and baking powder while continuing to beat. Whip whites until stiff peaks form. Fold in crushed crackers, vanilla, and walnuts. Pour mixture into greased pie plate. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Cool before serving. Garnish with whipped cream.
