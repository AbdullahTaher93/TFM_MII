Mix cider vinegar, mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and hot sauce together in large bowl. Transfer wings to sauce and mix well. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Preheat indoor grill over medium-high heat; make sure your kitchen is well ventilated. Place wings on griddle turning every 1 1/2 minutes getting a good charred crust all around and preventing burns. Total cook time is about 12 minutes or until internal temp is 165 degrees F. Serve with your favorite cool blue cheese dip!
