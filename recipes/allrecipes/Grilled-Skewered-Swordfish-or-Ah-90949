Preheat barbecue grill. Rinse swordfish, drain, and cut into 1-inch chunks. Cut 1 lemon in half lengthwise, then cut halves crosswise into 1/4-inch slices. Discard seeds. Cut remaining lemon into wedges. Thread swordfish onto metal skewers (10 to 12 in. long), separating each piece alternately with a lemon slice, then a bay leaf half. Brush filled skewers with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Lightly oil grill and place skewers over a solid bed of hot coals or on high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning skewers as needed to brown all sides, until fish is opaque but still moist-looking in center of thickest part (cut to test), about 8 minutes. Remove fish, lemon, and bay leaves from skewers, dividing them evenly among 4 dinner plates. (If desired, remove bay leaves, since they are not meant to be eaten.) Add additional salt and juice from lemon wedges to taste.
