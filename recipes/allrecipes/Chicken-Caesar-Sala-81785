Place the egg in boiling water for 1 minute then remove and let cool enough to handle. Separate the egg, discarding the whites and placing the yolk in a small non-metallic mixing bowl. Beat the egg yolk. This coddling process is enough to kill any salmonella present -- although it is rarely found in eggs any more. If you have pasteurized eggs then you can just use the egg yolk directly without coddling it first (as that it what is meant by pasteurized). Add anchovy paste, oil, mustard, garlic, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce and pepper. Mix well. Chill dressing for 15 or 20 minutes to allow flavors to meld. Wash and tear lettuce into bite size pieces. Toss in the chicken. Add the dressing and toss. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve immediately.
