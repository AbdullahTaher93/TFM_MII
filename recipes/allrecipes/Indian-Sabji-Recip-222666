Heat canola oil in a wok over medium heat. Cook and stir cumin and mustard seeds in the hot oil until they begin to dance, 1 to 2 minutes. Add coriander, turmeric, and cayenne pepper; cook about 1 minute. Stir cabbage, potatoes, ginger-garlic paste, and salt into spice mixture; stir to coat. Pour enough water into wok to steam vegetables; cover and cook, stirring occasionally and adding more water as needed, until potatoes and cabbage are very tender, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat; sprinkle vegetables with cilantro.
