Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Cut dried beef into smaller pieces and spread in the bottom of a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Wrap each pork chop with a strip of bacon and secure with toothpicks. Lay wrapped pork on top of the dried beef. In a medium bowl mix together the soup and sour cream until well blended; pour mixture on top of pork chops. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until internal temperature of pork has reached 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
