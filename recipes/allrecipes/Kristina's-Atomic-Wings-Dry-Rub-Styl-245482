Combine cayenne pepper, jalapeno pepper, habanero pepper, oregano, salt, sugar, black pepper, and cinnamon in a small bowl; mix well to make dry rub. Place chicken wings in a large resealable bag or container. Add dry rub mixture to wings; seal container and shake well until evenly distributed. Preheat a grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Cook the chicken wings on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until the chicken is well-browned and no longer pink, 15 to 20 minutes.
