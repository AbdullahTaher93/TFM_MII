Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mash together soft pear, garlic, olive oil, white wine, and rosemary. Season pork with salt and pepper, and place into a 10x10 inch glass baking dish. Pour pear mixture over pork and sprinkle with chopped onion. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes, until the internal temperature of the pork reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) when taken with a meat thermometer.
