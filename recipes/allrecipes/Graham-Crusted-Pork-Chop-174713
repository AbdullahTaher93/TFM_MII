Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Rinse the pork chops and pat dry. Combine graham cracker crumbs, cinnamon, curry powder, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Dip the pork chops in the egg and place in plastic bag; shake to coat. Place the pork chops in a prepared 9 x 13 inch baking dish. Bake until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
