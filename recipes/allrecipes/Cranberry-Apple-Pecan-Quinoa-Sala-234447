Stir chicken broth and quinoa together in a saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, place cover on the saucepan, and cook until the broth is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and fluff with a fork. Whisk olive oil, Dijon mustard, maple syrup, and cinnamon together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Drizzle sauce over the quinoa; stir. Add apple pieces, pecan pieces, cranberries, and Parmesan cheese; stir. Return cover to the saucepan and let the mixture steam until the sauce warms and the apples soften slightly, 5 to 10 minutes.
