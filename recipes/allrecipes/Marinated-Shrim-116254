In a large bowl, combine the shrimp, onion and capers. In a jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine the oil, vinegar, salt and celery seed; shake well. Pour over shrimp mixture and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 6 hours or overnight, stirring occasionally. Using a slotted spoon, transfer shrimp mixture to a serving bowl.
