In a bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat marshmallow creme, Neufchatel, and 1 tablespoon orange juice concentrate until smooth. In another bowl, stir together pumpkin maple syrup, cinnamon, nutmeg, and remaining tablespoon orange juice concentrate. Fold in 1/4 cup of the cream cheese mixture until no white streaks remain. Spoon about 3 tablespoons of the remaining cream cheese mixture into each of four dessert or parfait glasses, followed by about 3 tablespoons of the pumpkin mixture. Repeat layers, ending with pumpkin. Chill until cold, at least 2 hours or up to 1 day. Just before serving, sprinkle each parfait with chopped pecans and gingersnap crumbs.
