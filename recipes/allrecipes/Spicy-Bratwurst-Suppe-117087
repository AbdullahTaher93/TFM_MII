In a large skillet, cook bacon and onion over medium heat until bacon is almost crisp. Remove to paper towels to drain. In the same skillet, saute the bratwurst, mushrooms and jalapeno for 3-4 minutes or until mushrooms are tender. Stir in spaghetti sauce and bacon mixture. Cover and cook for 4-6 minutes or until heated through. Sprinkle with cheese. Serve with rice.
