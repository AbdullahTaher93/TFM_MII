In a bowl, mix together the sage, rosemary, thyme, fennel seed, sugar, bay leaf, and salt until thoroughly combined. Rub both sides of the pork chops with the herb mixture, and coat them with olive oil. Refrigerate several hours or overnight. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate. Grill the chops until they are browned, show good grill marks, and the meat is no longer pink inside, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a chop should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
