Prepare French toast according to package directions. Saute smoked sausages in a skillet over medium heat until browned. Cut French toast into 1-inch wide pieces. Spread a little maple syrup on each piece of toast then sandwich one smoked sausage between two pieces of toast and seal together with a toothpick. Repeat with remaining smoked sausages. Mix 1/4 cup maple syrup and Dijon mustard in a small bowl and serve alongside French toast bites. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar before serving.
