Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Cut the red bell pepper in quarters and remove seeds and pith. Peel the carrot and cut into chunks. Arrange onion, tomatoes, pepper, zucchini and carrot in a single layer on a heavy tray that has been sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Brush vegetables with the olive oil. Roast, uncovered for 8 - 10 minutes, or until lightly browned. Remove vegetables from oven and cool slightly. Dice into 1/2" pieces. Spray a 4 qt. saucepan with nonstick spray and heat to medium, add garlic and cook 10 seconds. Increase heat to medium-high and add broth, diced roasted vegetables and thyme. Bring soup to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes.
