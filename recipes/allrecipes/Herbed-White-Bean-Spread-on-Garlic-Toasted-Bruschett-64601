Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet. Add the green onion, garlic and sage and cook for about 2 minutes. Add beans, water and chicken granules and continue to cook until liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes, then add the cheese. Cool to room temperature. Place bean mixture in a food processor and process until smooth. Rub the bread on both sides with the cut side of garlic, and then brush lightly with remaining oil. Place on a baking sheet and place under broiler for about 1 minute or until golden on one side and turn for another minute. Place about 2 tablespoons of spread on each slice.
