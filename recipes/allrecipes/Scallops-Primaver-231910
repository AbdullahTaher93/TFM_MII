If scallops are large, slice them in half crosswise to make thin medallions. Combine scallops and lemon juice in a shallow baking dish; cover and refrigerate 30 minutes. When finished marinating, stir in sherry cooking wine and cornstarch. Melt butter in a large skillet over high heat. Add carrots and garlic; cook about 1 minute. Add mushrooms and thyme; cook and stir about 3 minutes. Stir in scallop mixture; cook until scallops are opaque, about 4 minutes. Stir in pea pods and green onions; heat through. Serve over hot cooked rice.
