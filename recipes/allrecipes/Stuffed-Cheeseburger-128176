In a 10-inch (25-cm) nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, cook the mushrooms and onion in the margarine, stirring frequently, until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the mushroom mixture to a large bowl. Stir in the tomatoes, bread crumbs, parsley, capers, and pepper. Add the turkey and mix well. Shape the turkey mixture into 4 patties. Coat a grill rack with nonstick spray. Place the rack over medium-hot coals. Grill the patties for 4 minutes. Turn the patties and top each with a cheese slice. Grill until the patties are cooked through and no longer pink on the inside, about 5 minutes on a side.
