Mix egg, Worcestershire sauce, mayonnaise, parsley, seafood seasoning, baking powder, and salt together with your hands in a large mixing bowl. Tear bread into tiny bits; add to the egg mixture. Gently fold in crabmeat; form into 4 cakes and arrange onto a lined baking sheet. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake crab cakes until heated through and lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
