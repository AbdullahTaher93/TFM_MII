In a 12-in. skillet, cook bacon until crisp; remove to paper towel to drain. In drippings, cook onion and sausage until the onion is tender; drain. Stir in remaining ingredients; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 45 minutes or until vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally. Crumble bacon and sprinkle on top.
