Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix chili, black beans, and onion together in a bowl. Layer 4 tortillas in the bottom of the prepared baking dish; cover with 1 cup Cheddar cheese. Spoon half the chili mixture over cheese layer. Repeat 2 more layers with the remaining ingredients, ending with Cheddar cheese on top. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until lasagna is bubbling, 20 to 30 minutes.
