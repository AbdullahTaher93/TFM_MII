Sprinkle meat with salt and pepper. In a Dutch oven over medium heat, brown the meat on both sides in oil; drain. Combine 1-1/2 cups of water, brown sugar, raisins, onion, vinegar, lemon juice, mustard and bay leaf if desired in a saucepan. Bring to a boil. Combine flour and remaining water until smooth; stir into raisin sauce. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Pour over the meat rolls. Cover and bake at 325 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours or until the meat is tender. Discard bay leaf. Serve over rice.
