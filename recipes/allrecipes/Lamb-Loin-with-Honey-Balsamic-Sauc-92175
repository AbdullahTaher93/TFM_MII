Cut meat into 4 to 6 equal pieces. Place each piece between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. With a heavy, flat-sided mallet, pound meat firmly but gently all over to a thickness of 1/4 to 1/3 inch. In a small bowl, stir together broth, wine, vinegar, honey, and cornstarch. Set aside. Melt butter in olive oil in a wide nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. When butter sizzles, add as many lamb pieces to pan as will fit without crowding (you may need to cook lamb in batches). Cook, turning once, until lamb is well browned on both sides and just pink in center; cut to test (3 to 4 minutes). Transfer to a platter and keep warm. Add broth mixture to pan, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil, stirring. Then continue to boil and stir until slightly thickened (about 1 minute). Pour over lamb. Drizzle with sesame oil and sprinkle with mint, if desired.
