Beat the eggs slightly. Add the salt, 3/4 cup water, the flour, and the rest of the water, if needed to make a thin, smooth batter. Cover a hot, well-Criscoed skillet with a thin layer of the batter, tipping skillet in all directions to obtain a thin layer. Fry until it is golden brown on one side and then turn out on a clean cloth. Continue until all batter is used. Mix filling ingredients together. Place a full tablespoon of the mixture in the center of each batter sheet on the brown side. Roll up, tucking in the ends. Fry in a well-Criscoed skillet immediately or place in refrigerator until needed. Serve with fruit sauce, fresh fruit, butter sauce, jelly, sour cream, or cinnamon. Other fillings: meat, mushrooms, jelly.
