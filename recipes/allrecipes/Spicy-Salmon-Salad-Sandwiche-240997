Put salmon into a bowl and use a fork to flake and mix with the liquid from the can. Mix cucumber and capers with the salmon. Stir mayonnaise, red wine vinegar, chile paste, and reserved liquid from the capers together in a bowl; add Sriracha hot sauce and adjust to taste. Pour mayonnaise mixture over the salmon mixture and stir to coat. Spoon onto toasted bread to make sandwiches.
