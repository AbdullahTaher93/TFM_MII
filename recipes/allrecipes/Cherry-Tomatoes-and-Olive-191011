Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the garlic, tomatoes, and balsamic vinegar. Cook, stirring, until the tomatoes are hot and wrinkled, about 7 minutes. Mix in the olives and pine nuts, and season with pepper. Continue to cook and stir until heated through, about 3 additional minutes.
