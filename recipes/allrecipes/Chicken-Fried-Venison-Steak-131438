Combine the bread crumbs, flour, salt and pepper in a 1-gallon size plastic zipper bag. Beat the eggs and milk together in a shallow bowl. Dip each steak in the egg mixture, place it in the plastic bag, and shake to coat with crumbs. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat and fry the steaks, turning once, until both sides are golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes per side.
