Heat oil in a 2 1/2 quart saucepan over medium heat. Saute shallots in oil until translucent; add garlic and cook briefly, avoiding color. Add white wine and simmer over low heat until most of the liquid has evaporated. Add LACTAID(R) Fat Free Milk, bring to a boil, lower heat to a simmer and reduce mixture by half. Skim milk skin off the top. Meanwhile, cook angel hair pasta in lightly salted boiling water until al dente - about 2-3 minutes. Drain. When LACTAID(R) Fat Free Milk is reduced, remove from heat, stir in chopped basil and Prosciutto. Season to taste. Add cooked pasta and serve.
