In a saucepan over medium-high heat, bring oil, vinegar, and sugar to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, and stir until sugar is completely dissolved. Refrigerate 1 hour. In a medium bowl, mix together the green beans, peas, corn, pimentos, celery, and onion. Pour in dressing, and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours, or overnight. Season with salt and pepper, and serve chilled.
