Place 2 ring molds, 3 to 4 inches each, in the center of 2 salad plates. Arrange watercress around the molds. Whisk Dijon mustard, white wine vinegar, and salt in a small bowl. Pour in olive oil slowly, whisking constantly, until dressing is thick and smooth. Stir in shallots, parsley, and thyme. Toss tomato with 1 tablespoon of the dressing and 1 teaspoon of the chives. Spoon tomato into the ring molds. Repeat with avocado, cucumber, hearts of palm, artichoke hearts, and crabmeat, pressing each layer down with the back of a spoon. Remove ring molds carefully; drizzle remaining dressing over watercress.
