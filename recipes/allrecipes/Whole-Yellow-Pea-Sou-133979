Cover the peas with at least 3 inches of cold water and soak overnight. Drain the peas from the water. In a large kettle or stockpot, bring the chicken stock and peas to a hard boil for 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to a simmer. Add the chopped onion and ham shank, and cook for an additional two hours. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove the ham shank before serving.
