In a 10-inch (25-cm) nonstick skillet, warm the oils over medium-high heat. Add the onions, carrots, celery, peppers, and corn, and saute until the vegetables are slightly softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the rice, peas, spinach, tamari or soy sauce, and the sugar, and saute until the rice is heated through, about 3 minutes. If necessary, add a few drops of water to prevent sticking. Serve immediately.
