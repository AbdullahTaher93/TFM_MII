Heat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Sprinkle a 12-inch (30-cm) pizza pan with cornmeal. Unroll dough and press it evenly into pan. Brush with oil and sprinkle with oregano. Bake until crust begins to brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Spread sauce over crust. Top with peppers, garlic, cheese, basil, and red pepper flakes. Bake until crust is golden and cheese begins to melt.
