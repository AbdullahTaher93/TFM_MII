Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter an 8-inch square baking dish. Beat the baking mix, vanilla pudding mix, milk, butter, and egg together with an electric mixer in a bowl for 2 minutes; pour into the buttered dish. Chop the peaches and scatter over the mixture. Beat the cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, and reserved peach juice together in a bowl; pour over the peaches. Stir together the 1 tablespoon sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle over the cream cheese mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until set in the center, 30 to 35 minutes.
