Mix coconut milk, garlic, soy sauce, salt, hot sauce, and black pepper together in a large skillet or wok; add swai fish. Cook over medium-high heat until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes. Stir cornstarch and cold water together in a bowl; mix into fish mixture and cook until sauce is thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.
