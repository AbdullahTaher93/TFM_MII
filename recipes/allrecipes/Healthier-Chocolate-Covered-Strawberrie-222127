Insert toothpicks into tops of strawberries. Melt chocolate and shortening in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Holding strawberries by toothpicks, dip into chocolate mixture. Turn strawberries upside down and insert toothpick into styrofoam or simply place strawberries on a sheet of wax paper. Allow to cool completely.
