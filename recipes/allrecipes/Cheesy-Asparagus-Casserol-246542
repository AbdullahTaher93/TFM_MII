Bring 1/2 inch water to a boil in a saucepan. Add asparagus, cover, and steam until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain. Spread a thin layer of butter onto each bread slice. Cut bread into cubes. Stir cream of mushroom soup, processed cheese food, and 2/3 of buttered bread cubes together in a bowl; stir in asparagus. Transfer asparagus mixture to a 9x13-inch baking dish; top with remaining bread cubes. Bake in the preheated oven until bread is golden brown, about 20 minutes.
