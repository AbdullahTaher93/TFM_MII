Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly spray 6 (6-ounce) custard cups with vegetable cooking spray. Set aside. Combine 1/2 cup Splenda(R) Sugar Blend for Baking and water in a small heavy saucepan; cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until sugar dissolves. Continue cooking, without stirring, until mixture is golden in color (about 4 minutes). Pour mixture evenly into prepared custard cups. Set aside. Beat eggs and yolks with a wire whisk until blended. Whisk in milk, Splenda(R) Sugar Blend for Baking, salt and vanilla. Divide mixture evenly among prepared custard cups. Place cups in a 13- x 9-inch baking pan. Add hot water to a depth of 1-inch. Bake for 50 minutes or until a knife inserted in center comes out clean. Remove cups from pan; cover and chill for 4 hours or overnight. Loosen edges of custards with a knife; invert onto dessert plates. Garnish with fresh mint sprigs, if desired.
