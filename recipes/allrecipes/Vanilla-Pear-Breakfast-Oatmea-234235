Drain canned pears, reserving syrup. Chop the pear slices. Bring water, drained syrup from canned pears and salt to a boil over medium-high heat in a medium saucepan. Stir in oats; reduce heat. Cook, uncovered, for 1 minute, stirring occasionally. Remove pan from heat. Stir in almonds, cinnamon and vanilla. Cover and let stand for 2 to 3 minutes to reach desired consistency. To serve, top each serving with chopped canned pears and raspberries. Sprinkle with brown sugar.
