Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Pour 2 tablespoons maple syrup into a shallow bowl. Dip bacon slices in maple syrup and roll up. Arrange rolls seam-side down on the baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 20 minutes. Combine remaining 2 tablespoons maple syrup and pecans in a bowl. Drizzle over bacon rolls. Continue baking until bacon is crisp and pecans are browned, about 30 minutes more.
