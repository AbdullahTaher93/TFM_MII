Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 2 (8-inch) layer pans with baking spray; set aside. Puree beets with their juice in a blender until smooth; set aside. Mix the cake mix, pureed beets, milk, eggs and food coloring in the large bowl of an electric mixer. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds and on high for 2 minutes, until batter is thick and smooth. Pour and scrape batter into the prepared pans and bake in the oven for 30 minutes until a tester inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs clinging to it. Cool in the pans on racks for 15 to 20 minutes, until cool enough to touch. Remove the cakes from pans and cool on racks until room temperature. While the cake is baking prepare filling. Puree peaches with their juice and cornstarch in a blender until smooth. Pour into a large saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until boiling and thick, about 5 minutes; cool completely. To make the frosting, puree cream cheese, 2 tablespoons cooled peach filling mixture, confectioners sugar and vanilla in a food processor until smooth; set aside. To assemble cake, place 1 cake layer on a serving plate, top with the remaining peach mixture and half the raspberries. Place the second layer on top. Ice the sides and top of the cake with cream cheese frosting, and decorate with remaining raspberries. Refrigerate until serving. Cut in 12 wedges and serve.
