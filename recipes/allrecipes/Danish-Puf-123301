In a bowl, cut butter into the flour until crumbly. Sprinkle with water; toss with a fork until moist enough to shape into a ball. Divide in half. On a floured surface, roll each portion into 1 12-in. x 3-in. rectangle. Place on greased baking sheets. In a saucepan, bring water and butter to a boil. Add flour and salt all at once; stir until a smooth ball forms. Remove from the heat; let stand 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Add extract; beat until smooth. Spread over dough. Bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour or until puffed and golden brown. Cool on pans for 10 minutes. Combine sugar, butter, water and vanilla until smooth; spread over warm puffs. Sprinkle with almonds. Refrigerate leftovers.
