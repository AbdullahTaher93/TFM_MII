Preheat the oven to 350. In a large skillet, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until just crisp, about 5 minutes. Add the shallots, celery, carrots and white pepper and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Stir in the chicken broth, ham, mushrooms and sage. Add the cornbread and black-eyed peas and mix until combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon the stuffing into 2 buttered 3-quart casserole dishes and bake, uncovered, for 40 minutes.
