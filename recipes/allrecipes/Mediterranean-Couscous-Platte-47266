In a medium saucepan, bring the broth to a boil. Stir in couscous. Cover pan and remove from heat. Let stand about 10 minutes until liquid is absorbed. Fluff couscous with a fork, then toss with 1/3 cup of the vinaigrette. To assemble, place couscous in center of a large platter or divide among serving plates. Arrange artichoke hearts, tomatoes, olives and chicken (or tuna or anchovies) separately but surrounding the couscous; drizzle with remaining 1/3 cup vinaigrette.
