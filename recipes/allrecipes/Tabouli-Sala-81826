In a mixing bowl, add the tabouli mix, the boiling water, lemon juice and cumin. Stir well and cover. Let sit for 10 minutes while you do the following. Remove the stem from the tomato, slice in half and squeeze to remove the seeds (most of them anyway and that's good enough). Dice the tomato. Peel and dice the cucumber. Mince the parsley and mint leaves. Uncover the tabouli and stir. Add the parsley, mint, tomatoes, cucumber and olive oil. Stir well, cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. On 4 salad plates, make a bed of lettuce and then spoon the chilled tabouli into the centers.
