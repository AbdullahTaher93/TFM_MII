Grind rice until not quite powdered using a food processor or mortar and pestle. Sprinkle rice over all surfaces of the steaks, pressing in to coat. Transfer to a rack on a paper-towel-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate uncovered 2 to 3 days. Using the back of a knife, scrape the koji rice from the steaks; discard. Season steaks with kosher salt. Heat skillet over medium-heat. Melt clarified butter and place steak in skillet. Sear on one side for 2 minutes; turn and sear the other side. Continue cooking until steaks are firm and reddish-pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Transfer steaks to a warm plate to let rest for 10 minutes before serving.
