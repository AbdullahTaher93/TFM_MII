Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Place eggs, flour, milk, salt, and nutmeg in a medium bowl; whisk until combined. Batter may still be slightly lumpy. The batter may be made a day ahead and chilled overnight. For each pancake, melt 1 tablespoon butter in a 4-inch crepe pan or ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Using a ladle, pour one-third of the batter into the very hot pan; transfer pan or skillet immediately to the oven. Bake until pancake is golden brown and very puffy, about 10 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar; serve immediately.
