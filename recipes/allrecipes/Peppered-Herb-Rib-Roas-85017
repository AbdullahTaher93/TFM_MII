Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place meat on rack in shallow roasting pan. Combine next 5 ingredients in a small bowl and press evenly into surface of meat. Roast, uncovered, until internal temperature reaches 135 degrees F for medium-rare (1 3/4 to 2 1/4 hours) or 150 degrees F for medium (2 1/4 to 2 3/4 hours). Cover with foil and let stand 15 minutes before carving. (The temperature of the meat will rise about 10 degrees during standing.)
