Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the rosemary, thyme, garlic powder, parsley flakes and salt. Mix in the mustard, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, cumin, and cayenne pepper. Warm gently for about a minute. Mix equal parts of the sauce with beef steak drippings to complete the sauce just before serving.
