Heat olive oil in a skillet over high heat; cook and stir onion, garlic, and salt in the hot oil until onion is softened and browned, about 15 minutes. Mix tomatoes and green beans into onion mixture. Add sugar and cinnamon to mixture; bring to a boil, lower heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until green beans are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
