Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Season halibut steaks with salt, pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon lime-flavored seasoning blend. Arrange the halibut steaks on a baking dish. Place panko bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, 1/8 teaspoon lime-flavored seasoning blend, thyme, and garlic in a blender. Blend with enough olive oil to just moisten the panko crumbs. Spoon panko crumb mixture over the halibut. Bake in the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 20 to 30 minutes.
