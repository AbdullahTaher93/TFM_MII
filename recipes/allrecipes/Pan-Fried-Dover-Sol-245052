Spread crushed crackers onto a plate. Pour eggs into a shallow dish. Place fish in a 1-gallon plastic bag and add flour; gently shake until completely coated. Heat oil in a large, non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Dip each flour-coated piece of fish in the egg, allowing excess to drip back into dish. Press coated fish in the cracker crumbs until evenly coated. Fry fish in the hot oil until lightly browned and fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes per side. Season fish with dill and salt.
