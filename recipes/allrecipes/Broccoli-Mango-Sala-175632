Combine ranch dressing, orange juice, and horseradish in a bowl; mix well and set aside. Toss together the chopped broccoli, cubed mango, cashews, and wedged onion in a salad bowl. Pour the dressing over the broccoli mixture; toss to coat. Refrigerate at least 4 hours. Add the drained oranges to the salad just before serving.
