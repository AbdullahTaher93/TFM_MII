Spear five or more asparagus stalks together side by side, like a raft. Combine the sesame oil, soy sauce, and garlic, then stir and brush the mixture onto both sides of the raft. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top. Salt and pepper to taste. Grill over direct heat for 2 to 4 minutes, until brown on both sides.
