In large bowl, gently mix beef, onion, sweet pepper, basil, oregano, garlic, and black pepper. Shape into 4 burgers. Coat a nonstick skillet with nonstick spray, and warm over medium-high heat. Add burgers and brown on both sides. Add stewed tomatoes and cook for 10 minutes. Place each burger on a toast slice and top with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) cheese, stewed tomatoes, and another toast slice.
