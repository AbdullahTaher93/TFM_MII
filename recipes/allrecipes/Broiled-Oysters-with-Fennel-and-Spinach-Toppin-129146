Check the oysters to make sure there are no bits of shattered shell on them. Arrange them, on their half shells, in 4 individual flameproof dishes, or on one large dish, and season with salt and pepper to taste. (Propping the shells with crumpled foil will prevent them from tipping.) Heat the broiler to medium. Melt the butter in a skillet. Add the shallot and cook over low heat until beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the diced potato and fennel and saute until tender, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Stir in the spinach and cook until it just wilts, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the lemon juice, parsley, and seasoning to taste. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the mixture over each oyster. Cook the oysters under the broiler until the topping is tinged brown, 3 minutes. Serve immediately, with lemon wedges.
