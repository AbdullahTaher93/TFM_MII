Place fatback in a large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook until crisp. Remove pieces, and set aside. Reduce heat to medium, and add onion. Fry onions in the fatback grease until softened. Stir in potatoes, making sure they are well coated with the fatback grease. Season generously with pepper. Pour in the liquid from the clams, and the bottle of clam juice. Cover, and simmer gently for about 15 minutes. While the potatoes are simmering, chop clams into pieces. Add clams to potatoes during the last 3 minutes. Serve in deep bowls with the crispy bits of fatback sprinkled over the top.
