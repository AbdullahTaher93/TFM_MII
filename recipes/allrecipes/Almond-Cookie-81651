Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, mix together the almond meal, whey, Splenda and baking powder. Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender or two knives or your fingers, blend the butter into the dry mixture keeping it light and fluffy. (I prefer using my fingers, smashing the pieces of butter until well incorporated with no noticeable pieces of butter remaining.) You can buy chopped almonds but they are more course than I like for this recipe so run them through the food processor for a minute. I sometimes purchase whole raw almonds (they are usually cheaper) and give them a course grind in the food processor. Add the almonds to the mixture. Lightly beat the egg with the salt and almond extract. Pour into the mixing bowl. Stir until well blended. Using lightly buttered hands, rolls batter into 20 balls each about 2 Tbsps. Place 10 to 12 on a parchment lined cookie sheet. Flatten just slightly. Bake for 10 minutes or until cookies have a golden color and just to turn brown along the edges. Transfer to a cookie rack and then repeat with the remaining batter.
