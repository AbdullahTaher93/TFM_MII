Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix almond flour, baking soda, and sea salt together in a bowl; stir in coconut oil until fully incorporated. Stir eggs and honey into almond flour mixture until a dough ball forms. Scoop dough using an ice cream scoop and arrange dough scoops in the parchment paper. Lightly press each piece of dough to create a biscuit shape. Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are lightly browned, about 15 minutes.
