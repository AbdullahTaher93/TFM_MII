Crumble the ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until no longer pink. Pour in the sauerkraut and chicken broth and add the green pepper, celery and onion. Simmer for at least 1 hour. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve on a good hard roll or a semmel (Kaiser) roll.
