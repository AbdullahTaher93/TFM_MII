In a large bowl, combine raspberry jam, pineapple juice, soy sauce, rice vinegar, garlic, and basil. Add chicken breasts, and turn to coat evenly. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Preheat grill for medium heat, and lightly oil grate. Cook chicken breasts on grill until meat is no longer pink, and juices run clear.
