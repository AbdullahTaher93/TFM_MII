Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan. Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in the chocolate syrup, 2/3 cup Irish cream, and instant coffee. Mix in the flour until just incorporated. Fold in the pecans; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour into the prepared pan (the pan will seem very full). Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 55 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. Melt the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch. Stir the sour cream and 1 tablespoon Irish cream into the chocolate. Spread over top of the cooled cake allowing some of the chocolate to drizzle down the side of the cake. Cool until topping is set and serve.
