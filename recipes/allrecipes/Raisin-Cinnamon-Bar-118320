In a mixing bowl, combine butter and brown sugar until crumbly, about 2 minutes. Add egg; mix well. Gradually beat in coffee. Combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda and salt. Add to the coffee mixture; mix well. Stir in raisins and pecans. Transfer to a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until edges begin to pull away from the sides of the pan and a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Meanwhile for icing, in a bowl, combine the confectioners' sugar, vanilla and enough water to achieve spreading consistency. Spread over warm bars.
