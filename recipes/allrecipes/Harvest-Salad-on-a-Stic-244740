Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F degrees. Place the sweet potato slices on a sheet tray in an even layer. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with the seasoning mix. Toss well to coat. Roast for about 20 minutes, until sweet potato is tender but still firm enough to hold its shape when punctured with a skewer. Remove and let cool slightly. On one skewer, thread one wedge of lettuce. As the butter lettuce is softer, you'll want to pile several pieces together to make the wedge. Follow this with a slice of sweet potato and an apple chunk. Repeat two more times with this same pattern on the first skewer. Repeat with remaining skewers until ingredients are gone. Drizzle skewers with dressing. Serve immediately.
