Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, nutmeg and cinnamon. Make a well in the center, and pour in the soy milk, vanilla and melted butter. Stir just until dry ingredients are moistened. Mix in the apples, dried cranberries and most of the coconut. Reserve a small handful for sprinkling over the top of the loaf. Pour into the prepared loaf pan, and sprinkle reserved coconut on top. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until a knife inserted into the loaf comes out clean. Cool for at least 5 minutes before removing from the pan.
