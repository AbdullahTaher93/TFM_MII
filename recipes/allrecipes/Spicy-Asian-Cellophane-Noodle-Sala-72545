Place eggs in a saucepan with enough cold water to cover, and bring a boil. Remove from heat, cover, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel, and chop. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the onion and zucchini until tender. Mix in the tofu, and continue to cook and stir until browned on all sides. With a mortar and pestle, grind the garlic and Thai chiles into a fine paste. Mix with the fish sauce, lime juice, sugar, and salt. Bring 1 quart water to boil in a pot. Turn off heat, and soak the cellophane noodles in the hot water 1 minute, or until soft. In a large bowl, toss together the eggs, tofu mixture, garlic and chile paste, noodles, and lettuce.
