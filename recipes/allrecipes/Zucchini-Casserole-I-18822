Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2 quart casserole dish. In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, cook zucchini in lightly salted water until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Drain, and place in a large bowl. Stir in the condensed soup, sour cream, onion and carrots. In a small bowl, Mix together stuffing and melted margarine. Spread half of the stuffing mixture in the bottom of the casserole dish. Add the zucchini mixture, and top with remaining stuffing mixture. Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top is golden brown.
