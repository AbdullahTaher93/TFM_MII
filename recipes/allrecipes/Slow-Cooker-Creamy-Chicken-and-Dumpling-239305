Combine chicken, cream of mushroom soup, onion, butter, rosemary, and black pepper in a slow cooker; add enough vegetable broth to cover the ingredients completely. Cook on High for 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 hours. Arrange torn biscuit dough on top of chicken mixture; continue cooking until dough is cooked through, about 30 minutes more.
