Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place the chicken thighs in a shallow baking dish. Drain the peaches and apricots, reserving the juice in a small bowl. Stir the vinegar into the juice, and adjust the amount to taste if necessary. Season with curry powder and garam masala and stir to blend. Arrange the peaches and apricots around the chicken thighs, and pour the flavored syrup over all. Sprinkle the pistachios on top. Bake uncovered for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until sauce has thickened and chicken juices run clear.
