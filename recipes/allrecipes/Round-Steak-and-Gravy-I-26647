Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Trim the fat from the steak, and cut into desired number of servings. In a roasting pan over medium high heat, sear both sides of the steak, about 1 minute per side. Remove from heat. Stir the cream of mushroom soup, French onion soup and water into the roaster. Bake in the preheated oven 2 1/2 hours.
