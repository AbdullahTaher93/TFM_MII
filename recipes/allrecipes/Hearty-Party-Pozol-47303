Season pork with pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan (4 quart) over high heat. Add pork to pot and cook, stirring until no longer pink (about 5 minutes). Transfer meat to a clean plate. Reduce heat to medium, add remaining tablespoon oil, the onion and garlic and cook, stirring until softened and golden (about 5 minutes). Stir in chili powder and cumin and cook for one minute. Add hominy, tomato, chicken broth and green chiles and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes to develop flavors. Stir in reserved pork, season with salt and pepper to taste and cook one minute longer. For a garnish, serve with finely-sliced scallions.
