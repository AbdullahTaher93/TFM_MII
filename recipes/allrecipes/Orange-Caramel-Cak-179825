With a mixer, beat eggs and 1/2 cup sugar in a bowl until thick and lemon colored. Add flour, baking powder, orange peel, and butter; beat until mixed thoroughly. Scrape batter into a greased and flour-dusted 9-inch-diameter cake pan. Bake in a 375 degree oven until cake just begins to pull from sides of pan and center springs back when lightly pressed, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make syrup. In a 1 1/2- to 2-quart saucepan, bring 1/3 cup sugar, water, and orange juice to a boil over high heat. Boil, uncovered, until reduced to about 1 1/2 cups, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in liqueur. Keep warm (if made ahead, cover and chill up to 1 day, then reheat to use). Remove cake from oven and let stand for 10 minutes, then invert onto a rack. Holding rack and pan together, invert to return cake to pan. Pierce cake all over with a fork. Slowly pour warm syrup over warm cake; let cool (if made ahead, cover airtight up until next day). Lay a rimmed serving plate, top down, on cake pan; hold together and invert to release cake. Garnish cake with orange sections. No more than 4 hours before serving, place 1/4 cup sugar in a 6- to 8-inch frying pan over high heat; tilt and shake pan to mix melting sugar with dry sugar until sugar is melted and caramel colored, 3 to 4 minutes. Watch carefully to avoid burning. Pour hot caramelized sugar in a thin stream, rippling back and forth over the top of cake and fruit.
