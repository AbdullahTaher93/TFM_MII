Prepare mashed potatoes according to package directions. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Sautee diced onions in oil until tender and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add cooked mashed potatoes and season with salt and pepper. Place tortillas on a plate. Heat in microwave until pliable, 15 to 20 seconds. Place 1/4 cup of potato mixture in each tortilla, fold in half and secure each end with toothpicks. Heat oil in a skillet until shimmering. Fry each taco until crispy and golden brown, about 1 minute on each side. Remove toothpicks and top with garnishes.
