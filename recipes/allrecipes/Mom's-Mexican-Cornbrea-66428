Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9X12 inch baking dish with cooking spray. Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook the ground beef in the skillet until no longer pink. Set aside. In a large bowl, stir together the cornmeal, salt, and baking soda. Mix in milk, egg, onion, corn, Cheddar cheese, and jalapeno pepper. Stir in browned beef. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 1 hour.
