In a soup kettle or Dutch oven, cook beef, sausage and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the tomatoes, water, tomato paste, mushrooms, pepperoni, Parmesan cheese and seasonings. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Cool. Freeze in serving-size portions.
