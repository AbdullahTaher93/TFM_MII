Grind soy nuts in a food processor until finely chopped; add sunflower seeds, and grind until fine. Remove the nuts from the food processor, then grind the dried cranberries until fine. Return nuts to the bowl of the food processor along with vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, and salt. Pulse to mix thoroughly. With the processor running, slowly pour in the water until the mixture reaches a spreadable consistency.
