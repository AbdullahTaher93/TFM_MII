Pour the wine into a large saucepan set over medium heat. When the wine is heated, carefully set it aflame. Let the flames die out, then increase the heat and bring the wine to a boil; continue boiling until the liquid reduces by half. Remove from the heat. Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat the oil in a Dutch oven or large casserole, large enough to hold the 6 portions of ribs, over medium-high heat. Season the ribs all over with salt and the crushed pepper. Dust the ribs with about 2 tablespoons of matzoh meal and then when the oil is hot, slip the ribs into the pot and sear for 4 to 5 minutes on each side, until well browned. Transfer the browned ribs to a plate. Remove all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pot; lower the heat to medium, and toss in the vegetables and herbs. Saute the vegetable until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes, then stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute to blend. Add the reduced wine, browned ribs, and stock. Bring to a boil; cover the pot tightly, slide it into the oven, and cook until the ribs are tender enough to be easily pierced with a fork, about 2 1/2 hours. Every 30 minutes or so, lift the lid and skim and discard whatever fat may have bubbled up to the surface. Carefully transfer the meat to a heated serving platter, cover, and keep warm. Boil the pan liquid until it thickens and reduces to approximately 1 quart. Season with salt and pepper and pass through a fine-mesh strainer; discard the solids. Pour the sauce over the meat.
