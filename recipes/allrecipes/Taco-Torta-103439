Cook beef in large nonstick skillet, over medium heat, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until beef is brown. Drain, and stir in taco seasoning. Preheat a contact grill (like George Foreman or panini grill). Meanwhile, slice bread in half lengthwise. Cut the bread into four equal sections. Use fingers to pull out soft center. Spray crust side of bread with cooking spray. Sprinkle cheese in bottom halves of bread then mound beef on top. Place top halves over beef and gently press down. Grill sandwiches two at a time about 5 minutes until crisp. Or, use a nonstick skillet over medium heat to brown sandwiches on both sides until crisp, about 10 minutes. Press gently with a spatula while cooking. If desired, gently remove tops of sandwiches and add your favorite taco-style toppings (tomato, onion, avocado, lettuce and hot sauce). Replace tops and serve.
