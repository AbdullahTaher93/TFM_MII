Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil; cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop. In a large bowl, combine the eggs, peas, celery, pimento, onion, 1 cup bread crumbs, mayonnaise, milk, garlic salt, salt and pepper. Mix well and pour into a 1 quart casserole dish. Melt butter and fry remaining 1/2 cup bread crumbs until lightly browned. Sprinkle over casserole and bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 30 minutes.
