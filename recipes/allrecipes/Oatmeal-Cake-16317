In a medium mixing bowl, sift together flour and baking powder. Add the remaining ingredients and stir to combine. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each cake. Cook until bubbles form in the cakes. Flip and cook the other side. Serve warm with syrup or jam.
