In a bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. Crumble beef over mixture mix well. Shape into eight patties. Grill, uncovered, over medium-hot heat for 5-7 minutes on each side or until juices run clear. Top each patty with a cheese slice; grill 1 minute longer or until cheese is melted. Grill rolls cut side down for 1-2 minutes or until toasted. Top with lettuce and burgers.
