In a large saucepan over medium high heat, combine the chicken, onion, garlic and butter or margarine. Saute for about 5 minutes, or until the onions are tender. Add the carrots, tomato vegetable juice, water, macaroni and seasoning. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for about 20 minutes. Add the spinach and cook 5 more minutes. Serve hot with the crackers.
