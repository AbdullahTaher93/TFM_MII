Cook and drain spaghetti as directed on package. In large resealable food-storage plastic bag, mix bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Shake each chicken breast in bread crumb mixture; set aside. In 10-inch skillet, heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts; cook 6 to 10 minutes, turning once, until browned. Pour cooking sauce around chicken; sprinkle chicken with remaining bread crumb mixture and mozzarella cheese. Heat to boiling. Cover; reduce heat to medium. Cook 5 to 8 minutes or until juice of chicken is clear when center of thickest part is cut (at least 165Â°F) and cheese is melted. Serve with spaghetti.
