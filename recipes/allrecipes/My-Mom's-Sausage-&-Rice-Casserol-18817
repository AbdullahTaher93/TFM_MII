Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet over medium high heat, combine the sausage, onion, celery and green bell pepper and saute for 5 minutes. Drain any excess fat. Stir the dry rice in with the sausage and vegetables, then add the water and the soup mix. Transfer this mixture to a lightly greased 2 quart casserole dish and top with the almonds. Bake, covered, at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 90 minutes.
