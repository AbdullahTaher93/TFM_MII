Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (225 degrees C). In a small saucepan combine 2 tablespoons sugar and cornstarch. Mix well then whisk in water. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is thick and clear. Remove from heat and allow to cool. In a large mixing bowl combine egg whites, salt, and vanilla extract. Beat until soft mounds form. Gradually add 5 tablespoons sugar, beating well after each addition. Continue to beat egg white mixture while slowly pouring in cornstarch syrup. Beat until stiff peaks form. Spread meringue on top of pie, or pipe desired shapes onto parchment-lined baking sheet using a large pastry tip. Bake in preheated oven for 12 minutes or until golden brown.
