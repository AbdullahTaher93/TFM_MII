In a deep skillet or Dutch oven, heat the oil. Saute the onion, green pepper, celery and garlic until vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Add frozen Grilled Fillets, tomatoes, tomato sauce, broth, and seasonings. Cover and simmer for 20 - 25 minutes. Uncover and break fish into chunks. Just before serving, mix in the green onions. Serve over the rice.
