Pat shrimp dry with paper towels and season lightly with salt. Preheat large skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil and heat until shimmering. Add shrimp, chopped poblano pepper and adobo sauce; cook two minutes, stirring to ensure shrimp are evenly coated with sauce. Reduce heat to medium, add garlic and cook one minute more or until shrimp are cooked through, stirring constantly. Remove from skillet and set aside. In same skillet, place water, contents of rice package and corn in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce heat. Simmer for 7 minutes or until water has been absorbed and rice is tender. Remove from heat and stir in green onions and cilantro. Place rice mixture on a serving platter. Top with shrimp; serve with lime wedges.
