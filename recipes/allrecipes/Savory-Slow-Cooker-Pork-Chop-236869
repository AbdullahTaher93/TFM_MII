Arrange pork chops into the bottom of a slow cooker crock. Whisk teriyaki sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, chile-garlic sauce, ginger, garlic, shallots, garlic pepper, and kosher salt together in a bowl; pour over the pork chops. Cook on High for 1 hour. Switch slow cooker to Low and continue cooking until the pork chops are completely tender, about 3 hours more.
