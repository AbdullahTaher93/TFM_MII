Combine ricotta cheese and sugar in small bowl; mix well. Combine eggs, milk and vanilla extract in shallow bowl; mix well. Spread ricotta-sugar mixture evenly over 4 bread slices. Top each slice with 1/4 cup strawberries and remaining bread to form sandwiches. Spray large skillet with nonstick cooking spray; heat over medium heat. Dip sandwiches in egg mixture, coating both sides. Cook on each side for 2 to 3 minutes or until golden brown. Sprinkle with powdered sugar; top with remaining strawberries. Serve with maple syrup, if desired.
