Preheat a cast-iron skillet to medium-high. In a small bowl, stir together the syrup, mustard, oil, garlic, salt, and pepper. Place the chops and mustard mixture inside a large ziplock plastic bag, then shake thoroughly to coat the chops. Place the chops in the skillet, cooking 3 to 4 minutes per side. In the last minute of cooking, pour the remaining mustard mixture onto the chops.
