Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken breasts in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Lay a ham slice, then a cheese slice on top of each breast. In a medium bowl combine the soup, sour cream, wine, garlic powder, parsley, salt and pepper. Mix well and pour mixture over chicken/ham/cheese pieces. Top all with the dry stuffing mix to cover. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 30 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
