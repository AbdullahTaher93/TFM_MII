Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Mix bread crumbs and taco seasoning mix together in a shallow bowl. Press salmon into bread crumbs mixture until evenly coated. Gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place the breaded salmon onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack. Cook salmon in the hot oil until it flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes per side.
