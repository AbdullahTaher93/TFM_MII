Whip the cream cheese with an electric mixer until fluffy. Beat in the honey, cocoa powder, and vanilla extract. Beat the cream in a separate bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the cream should form a sharp peak that holds its shape. Gently fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture.
