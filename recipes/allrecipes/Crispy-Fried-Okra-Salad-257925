Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble into a large bowl. Heat 1/2 inch of vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry okra in the hot oil, turning often, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Add to bacon in the bowl. Toss tomatoes, red onion, garlic salt, salt, and pepper together in a separate bowl. Stir into the bacon and okra mixture.
