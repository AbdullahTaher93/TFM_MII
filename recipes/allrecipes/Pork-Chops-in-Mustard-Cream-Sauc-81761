Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork chops and cook until well browned, about 4 minutes per side. Remove chops and cover them to keep warm. Add the butter and the shallots and saute for about 1 minute. Remove the skillet from the heat and slowly add the sherry. Pour from the tablespoon and not directly from the bottle. Return the skillet to the heat and add the cream, mustard, thyme, oregano and some salt and pepper. If using fresh herbs then wait and add them in the last two minutes of cooking. Bring sauce to a boil stirring frequently. Reduce heat to low and add the pork chops to the skillet (with any juices that may have accumulated). Simmer uncovered for 3 minutes then turn the chops over and simmer for an additional 2 minutes. Serve immediately.
