Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place wire racks over 2 baking sheets lined with aluminum foil. Combine beef, salt, oregano, basil, black pepper, rosemary, and chili powder in a large bowl. Stir in eggs, onion, cilantro, and garlic until evenly distributed. Gradually incorporate bread crumbs until mixture is moist but not gooey. Scoop up meat mixture using a mini ice cream scoop and shape into balls that are slightly smaller than golf balls. Arrange meatballs on prepared wire racks. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 30 minutes. Flip and continue baking until browned on the other side, about 15 minutes more. Transfer meatballs to a large pot; pour in pasta sauce. Bring to a simmer; cook until flavors combine, at least 30 minutes.
