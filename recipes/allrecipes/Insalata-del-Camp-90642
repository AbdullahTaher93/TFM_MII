In a small bowl, season vinegar with salt and pepper to taste. Add shallots and macerate (soak) for 20 minutes. Then add the oil in a thin stream, whisking constantly to emulsify. Adjust seasonings, if necessary, and set vinaigrette aside. Remove any wilted outer leaves from radicchio, if necessary, then cut whole head in half lengthwise. Cut out the core. Slice radicchio in a thin julienne. Cut the base off the heads of the frisee. Pull apart the heads into bite sized tufts. Gently wash the frisee and arugula or other greens in cold water and dry well. Combine the radicchio, frisee, and arugula in a salad bowl. Cover with a wet paper towel and refrigerate until you are ready to finish. In a 10 to 12 inch nonstick frying pan over medium high heat, cook pancetta until crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. Season greens with salt and pepper to taste. Chop pancetta into small pieces. Crush walnuts with the side of a knife. Toss the pancetta and walnuts into the greens. Add the vinaigrette and mix well. Using a vegetable peeler, shave as much parmesan as you like over the salad.
