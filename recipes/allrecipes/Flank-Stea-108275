Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for direct heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is directly under the food). Rinse olives and drain well. Combine olives, garlic, parsley, rosemary, lemon peel and oil in a food processor and pulse until mixture forms a fine paste. Set aside 1/2 cup of the tapenade mixture for seasoning meat; reserve remainder for serving or another use (see note). Rinse flank steak and pat dry. With the tip of a sharp knife, make shallow diagonal cuts about 1 inch apart over one side of steak, then make cuts perpendicular to the first to create a diamond pattern. Repeat on other side of steak. Spread 1/2 cup of the olive mixture on both sides of steak to coat evenly. Lay steak on oiled grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand just above grill level for only 2 to 3 seconds). Keep charcoal grill uncovered; close lid on gas grill. Cook steak until browned on the bottom (lift edge with tongs to check), 8 to 10 minutes. With tongs or a wide spatula, turn steak and continue to cook until as done as desired, about 2 minutes longer for rare (red in center; cut to test) or 4 minutes longer for medium rare (pink in center). Transfer steak to a clean platter or rimmed carving board and let rest about 5 minutes, then cut in thin, slanting slices across the grain to serve. Offer remaining tapenade to add to the meat to taste (see notes).
