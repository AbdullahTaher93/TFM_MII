Cook pasta as directed on package. Drain well. Meanwhile, melt butter in large skillet on medium-high heat. Add chicken; cook and stir 5 minutes or until lightly browned. Add Seasoning Mix, tomatoes, cream and cheese. Bring to boil, stirring constantly with wire whisk until well blended. Reduce heat to low; simmer 5 minutes. Stir in pasta; toss gently to coat. Serve with additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.
