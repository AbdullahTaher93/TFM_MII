Put gelatin mix into a large bowl. Pour boiling water over the gelatin and stir to dissolve powder completely. Let the mixture sit to thicken slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir sugar into the gelatin mixture to dissolve; add oranges, pecans, cranberries and apples and stir. Refrigerate the gelatin mixture until set, at least 3 hours.
