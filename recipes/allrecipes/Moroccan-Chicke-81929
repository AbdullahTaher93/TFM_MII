Remove the skin and rinse off the chicken. Set aside. Mince the garlic, parsley and cilantro very finely. Add to a large zip lock baggie (or a bowl). Setting the baggie in a large bowl helps keep it upright and makes filling it easier. Wash the lemon with soap and warm water to remove any wax. Zest 1/2 of a lemon with a zester or a grater. Be sure not to get any of the bitter white part. Squeeze the lemon, strain out the seeds. This should yield 3 to 4 Tbsps. Add only half of the juice to the marinade (save the rest for another recipe). Add the cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, salt, water and oil to the marinade. Add the chicken and squeeze out most of the air and seal the baggie. Marinate for at least 30 minutes at room temperature, or up to several hours in the refrigerator. Place the chicken and the marinade into a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. (If desired, use another 1/3 cup of water to rinse out the marinade baggie and add to the skillet). Arrange the chicken so that the boney side is down and the fleshy side is up. Cover (if your skillet doesn't have a cover then use aluminum foil). As soon as it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer. Simmer for 30 minutes, turn the chicken over and simmer another 20 minutes. Remove chicken from the skillet to rest (covered). Stir in the guar gum. Turn up the heat and bring the liquids to a boil for a couple of minutes and reduce it to about 1/2 cups of liquid. Drizzle the sauce over the chicken just before serving.
