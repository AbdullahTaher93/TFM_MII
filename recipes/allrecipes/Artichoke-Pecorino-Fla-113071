Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Butter 9 cups of a 12-cup muffin tin. Heat the cream in a small saucepan. Add the cheese and stir over medium heat until melted and smooth. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for about 1 minute, or until the mixture darkens slightly. Whisk in the cheese mixture until well incorporated. Stand the pan in a bowl of cold water and let the mixture cool for a few minutes, then whisk in the eggs. Place the prepared muffin tin inside a large roasting pan. Divide the chopped artichokes evenly among the 9 prepared cups. Pour the custard over the artichokes, filling each cup almost to the top. Set the roasting pan with the muffin tin in the oven and fill the roasting pan with cool water until the water level is near the top of the muffin tin. Bake the custards until set, about 25 to 30 minutes. Cool completely, then gently run a wet knife around the edge and carefully lift the custards out onto serving plates.
