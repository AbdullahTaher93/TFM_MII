Toss steak with 2 tablespoons of the steak sauce; let stand 10 minutes to marinate. Meanwhile, combine remaining 2 tablespoons steak sauce, the barbecue sauce and mustard; set aside. Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Thread steak onto eight long soaked wooden or metal skewers. Grill skewers 6 minutes or until steak is cooked through, turning after 3 minutes and brushing generously with the barbecue sauce mixture.
