Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 2-quart casserole dish. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain well and pour into prepared casserole dish. Meanwhile, place the Cheddar cheese, hot milk, flour, onion, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, salt, mustard powder, and garlic powder in the bowl of a blender. Blend until cheese is melted and onion is finely chopped. Pour cheese mixture over macaroni. Sprinkle top with wheat germ and Parmesan cheese. Bake uncovered for 30 minutes.
