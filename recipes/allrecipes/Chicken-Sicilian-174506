Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line 13 x 9-inch baking pan with foil. Combine 1/4 cup cheese, pesto and capers in small bowl. Cut each chicken breast horizontally three-fourths of the way through the meat creating a pocket for stuffing, being careful to not cut all the way through. Place 2 tablespoons pesto mixture into each breast pocket. Secure with wooden picks. Place chicken in prepared baking pan. Drizzle lemon juice over chicken; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over chicken; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink in center or reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F. Remove from oven. Prepare pasta according to package directions. Remove wooden picks from chicken; cut into slices and serve over prepared pasta.
