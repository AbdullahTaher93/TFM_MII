Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix flour, baking powder and salt. In a medium bowl, mix egg, milk and canola oil. Stir into the flour mixture. Mix in bananas and lemon juice. When thoroughly mixed, form mixture into about 10 balls. In batches, fry balls in the prepared oil 5 minutes, or until lightly browned. Drain on paper towels, and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
