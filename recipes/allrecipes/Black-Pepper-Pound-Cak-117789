In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in pepper and extract. Add eggs, one at a time, beating very well after each addition. Add flour alternately with cream; mix well. Pour into a greased and floured 10-in. fluted tube pan. Bake at 325 degrees F for 70-75 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar if desired.
