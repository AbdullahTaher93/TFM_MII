Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Combine all graham cracker crumbs, SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend and butter in a small bow and mix until incorporated. Butter and paper an 8 inch pan. Pour the mixture into the bottom of the pan spreading until level. Gently press the crumbs down. Bake for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven to cool and adjust oven temperature for filling step. Preheat oven to 275 degrees F. Combine the cream cheese, ricotta cheese and SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend in an electric mixer with a paddle attachment. Mix at a medium speed until smooth, approximately 5 to 8 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients and mix slowly until all is incorporated and smooth. Pour the filling into the cake pan, sprinkle remaining cracker crumbs over the top and place cake pan into a tray or dish that has 2-3 inch sides. Pour into the tray about an inch of water creating a water bath. Bake the mixture for 45 minutes. Gently turn the tray and continue to bake for another 30-45 minutes or until the filling is set. Once the cake is set, remove from the oven and allow cooling at room temperature. Refrigerate cake overnight in plastic wrap. To serve, gently run a knife around the cheesecake and dip the bottom of the cake pan in warm water for a few seconds. This allows the cheesecake to come out of the cake pan easily. Turn the pan upside down with plastic wrap on top and gently tap the bottom of the cake pan. The cheesecake should come out easily and place on serving dish, crust down.
