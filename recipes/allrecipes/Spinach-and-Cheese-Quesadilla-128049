Coat a baking sheet with nonstick spray. Puree chickpeas, garlic, and water in a food processor. Mist one side of each tortilla with a nonstick spray. Place 2 tortillas, sprayed side down, on a baking sheet. Spread tortillas evenly with puree to within 1/2 inch (1 cm) of their edges. Sprinkle with spinach, peppers, cheddar, and chili powder. Top with remaining tortillas, sprayed sides up. Bake at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) until golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool for at least 5 minutes. Cut each quesadilla into 4 triangles.
