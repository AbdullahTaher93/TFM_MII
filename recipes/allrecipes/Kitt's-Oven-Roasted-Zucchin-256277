Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place zucchini in a non-stick baking dish. Drizzle olive oil over zucchini; add bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, garlic, salt, and pepper and mix well. Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 10 to 15 minutes, until zucchini is tender and cheese is melted, about 40 minutes.
