Shuck clams from shell. Clean shells thoroughly. Place each clam onto a clean 1/2 shell; set aside. Preheat broiler for medium heat. In a food processor or blender, combine green and red pepper, red onion, bread crumbs, garlic, sea salt, pepper, oregano and butter. Blend until mixture becomes a mush, but not watery. Spoon 1 teaspoon of mixture onto the top of each clam, and add one 1 inch piece of bacon on top. Place the clams on a broiler pan and place under broiler about 4 inches from the heat. Broil for 8 to 12 minutes or until desired crispness of bacon is achieved.
