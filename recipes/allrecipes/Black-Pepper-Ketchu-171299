Put onion and oil in a small saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring often, until onion is soft and pale golden, about 10 minutes. Add ketchup, sugar, lemon juice, pepper, and mustard. Reduce heat to low. Stir often until flavors are blended, about 10 minutes. Scrape into a bowl and serve warm, or chill airtight up to 1 day and serve at room temperature.
