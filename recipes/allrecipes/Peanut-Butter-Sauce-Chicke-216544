Heat the sesame oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and salt. Cook and stir 1 minute, then stir in the pine nuts, and cook until golden, about 5 minutes. Add the diced chicken breast, and cook a few minutes to reheat. Stir in the peanut butter, soy sauce, and jalapeno pepper until the peanut butter has melted. Pour in the water, and bring to a simmer. Cook and stir until the sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes more.
