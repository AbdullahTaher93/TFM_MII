Scrub sweet potatoes, pierce in several places with a sharp knife, and place in a shallow 9- by 13-in. or 10- by 15-in. pan. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven until sweet potatoes give readily when gently squeezed, about 1 hour, depending on size. Let stand until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes. Cut sweet potatoes in half and scoop flesh into large bowl; discard peels. With a potato masher or a mixer, mash or beat sweet potatoes with milk. Stir in ginger, lime juice, and 2 cups marshmallows. Spread evenly in a shallow 3-quart casserole. Cover sweet potatoes evenly with remaining marshmallows. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven until potatoes are hot in center and marshmallow topping is richly browned, 15 or 20 minutes. Sprinkle with orange peel and serve, adding salt to taste.
