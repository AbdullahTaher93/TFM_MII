Heat a skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir pecans until toasted and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Combine toasted pecans and canola oil in a mini food processor and pulse until smooth (a little graininess is fine). Mix pecan mixture, maple syrup, cocoa powder, and hemp protein powder together in a bowl. One by one, add apple slices, flax seeds, graham cracker crumbs, sunflower seeds, walnuts, and puffed quinoa. Whisk almond flour and cinnamon together in a small bowl. Form pecan mixture into 1-inch balls and roll in the cinnamon mixture until coated. Freeze energy bites until firm, at least 1 hour.
