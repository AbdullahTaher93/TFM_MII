Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Rub chicken breasts with salt and white pepper. Place chicken breasts in the hot skillet, and cook for about 10 minutes on each side, until the juices run clear. Meanwhile, place bacon in a saucepan over medium-high heat, and cook until crisp. Remove bacon, and drain grease, leaving about 1 tablespoon in the pan. Stir in some of the chicken broth, and scrape any bacon bits stuck to the pan. Pour in the rest of the broth, and bring to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes. Add pears, and boil for 5 more minutes. In a small cup, mix together the cornstarch and water. Pour the mixture into the saucepan along with the green onions. Allow the sauce to boil until thick and bubbly, about 2 minutes. Crumble bacon into the pan. Serve sauce over chicken.
