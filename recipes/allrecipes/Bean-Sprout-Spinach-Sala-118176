In a small saucepan, whisk together the first six ingredients. Cook and stir over low heat until the mixture reaches 160 degrees F. Remove from the heat; cool. In a serving bowl, toss the spinach, bean sprouts, bacon and green onions. Drizzle with 1/2 cup salad dressing; toss to coat. Garnish with egg slices and sunflower kernels. Serve immediately. Refrigerate remaining dressing.
