In a large skillet, saute the onion, celery and green pepper in butter until tender. Add the broth, rice, Creole seasoning, Worcestershire sauce and cayenne. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; cover and cook for 15-20 minutes or until rice is tender. Stir in the tomatoes, shrimp and peas; heat through.
