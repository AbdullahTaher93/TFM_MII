Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir together the cream cheese, margarine, salt, pepper, milk, and onion together. Fold the chicken into the cream cheese mixture. Separate crescent rolls into 4 rectangles and smooth the perforations. Spoon 1/2 cup of the chicken mixture into the center of each rectangle. Fold the corners over the chicken mixture and pinch along the edges to seal into a ball shape. Arrange on a baking sheet. Sprinkle bread crumbs over the top of the newly formed 'baseballs.' Bake in preheated oven until browned, about 20 minutes.
