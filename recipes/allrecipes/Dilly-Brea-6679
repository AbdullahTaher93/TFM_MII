Stir the yeast into the warm water, and add a pinch of sugar. Set aside to proof. In a large saucepan, warm the cottage cheese and margarine until the fat is melted. Remove from heat, and add sugar, onion flakes, dill seed, salt, and soda. Mix in egg and dissolved yeast. Stir in flour for a stiff dough. Place dough in a greased bowl, and turn several times to thoroughly coat. Let rise until double in size in a warm place, usually 50 to 60 minutes. Stir the dough until it is deflated. Place into an 8 inch round, buttered 2 quart casserole. Let rise 30 to 40 minutes in a warm place. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 40 to 50 minutes until golden brown. Brush top with melted margarine. Sprinkle lightly with salt.
