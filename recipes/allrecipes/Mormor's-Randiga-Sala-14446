Place eggs in a saucepan, and cover completely with cold water. Bring water to a boil. Cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, and cool. Peel and chop. Combine the lettuce, bell peppers, beets, egg, cucumber and carrots in a large bowl, or in individual bowls. Toss, and serve the dressing on the side.
