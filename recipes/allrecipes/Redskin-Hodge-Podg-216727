Place the potatoes and garlic into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Combine potatoes and garlic with 1/4 cup melted butter, milk, heavy cream, and salt. Mash the potatoes until smooth, then stir in Parmesan cheese. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix the chicken and corn in a 9x13-inch baking dish, then spread the mixture into an even layer. Spread the mashed potatoes on top; set aside. Combine the cornbread mix, sugar, and egg in a bowl. Spread the mixture over the mashed potatoes. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Spread the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter over the cornbread, and allow to melt completely before serving.
