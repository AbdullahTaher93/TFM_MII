Heat oil in a tagine or Dutch oven over medium heat; cook and stir onions and garlic until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add turmeric, cumin, agave nectar, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, and black pepper and stir until onion mixture is evenly coated. Add just enough water to cover the bottom of the tagine; add carrots and salt. Cook over medium-low for 12 minutes. Mix chickpeas into carrot mixture, adding more water if needed to cover the bottom but keeping the sauce thick. Cook mixture for 7 minutes. Serve tagine with lemon wedges and cilantro.
