In a small bowl, mix together the molasses and warm water; stir in the yeast. Let stand for 10 minutes, or until foamy. In a large bowl, stir together the rye flour, gluten, potato flakes, and salt. Add the yeast mixture and shortening to the dry ingredients, and stir until stirring is too difficult. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and knead for 8 to 10 minutes. It's okay to take a few breaks. Place bowl upside down over the dough, and let dough rise until double in size, about 45 minutes. When the dough has risen, flatten out to remove air bubbles, and roll up into a nice tight loaf. Grease a baking sheet, and sprinkle with cornmeal. Place the loaf on the sheet, and let rise in a warm place until double, about 45 minutes Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake the loaf for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
