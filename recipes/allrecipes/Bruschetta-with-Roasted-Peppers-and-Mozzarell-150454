Preheat broiler. Combine roasted peppers, basil and vinegar in a medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Toast or grill bread slices lightly. Rub both sides of the bread with the cut sides of the garlic. Place bread on a baking sheet; top with the roasted peppers. Lay mozzarella strips on a diagonal over the roasted peppers and drizzle with oil. Broil bruschetta 6 inches from the heat source until the cheese melts and starts to brown. Serve hot.
