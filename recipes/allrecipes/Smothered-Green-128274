Place greens in heavy, 2 1/2- to 3-quart pot, preferably of enameled iron or steel, or stainless steel, and cover with cold water. Cook on low boil until greens are barely tender. That means about 4 minutes for spinach, escarole, bok choy, Swiss chard, and beet greens; about 7 minutes for turnip or mustard greens, collards, and broccoli rabe. Drain thoroughly on a kitchen towel. Chop coarsely if necessary, and set aside. Heat olive oil in heavy, 2-quart sauce pan or casserole of a non-reactive material, such as enameled steel or iron, or of stainless steel. Saute garlic over low heat until it turns pale golden brown. Remove, if you like a mild garlic flavor, or leave in for a stronger taste. If using hot pepper flakes, add for the last minute or two of frying. Turn heat off and place all the greens in the pot quickly, so no sputtering oil will splash up to burn you. Add salt; turn greens carefully through oil, and salt. Set over low heat and cover tightly. Cook gently, turning greens over several times so they cook evenly. Cook until tender, about 10 minutes for spinach, Swiss chard, and beet and turnip greens; about 15 minutes for collards, broccoli rabe, and dandelions. Trickle in a little water as needed to prevent scorching. When tender, turn off heat but leave greens in pot, tightly covered, for 5 to 7 minutes before serving, to develop flavor. Adjust seasoning. Serve as a separate course in warm, deep bowls with forks and spoons and chunks of Italian bread. Pass bread crumbs as a topping if desired.
