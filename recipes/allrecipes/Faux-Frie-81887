Peel the jicama. I think a knife works best but a sharp vegetable peeler may work too. The jicama should be sliced just a wee bit bigger than the size of fast food fries. In a fry pan, heat the oil until it quivers but well under the smoke point. Add the fries carefully; using long handled tongs (or wrap your hand in a towel) and cook on each side for about 30-60 seconds or until desired color (the first side will take longer). With tongs or a slotted spoon transfer to paper towels and immediately salt them. They can also be cooked in a deep-fat fryer if you happen to have one.
