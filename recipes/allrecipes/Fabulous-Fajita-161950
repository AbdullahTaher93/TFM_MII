Cut steak across the grain into thin slices; cut long slices in half. Place in resealable plastic bag. Add rice vinegar and jalapeno. Close bag securely, turning to coat. Refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight. Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Drain steak and discard marinade. Cook steak until barely pink in center, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate; set aside. Add bell peppers, onion and garlic to skillet; cook over high heat until vegetables are almost tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle with fajita seasoning. Return steak to skillet. Cook 1 minute or until heated through. Spoon steak mixture into warm tortillas. Serve with toppings, as desired.
