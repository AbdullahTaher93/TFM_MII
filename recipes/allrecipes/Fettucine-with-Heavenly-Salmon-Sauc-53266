Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the salmon, leek, onion, and garlic, and fry until fragrant, about 2 minutes. In a medium bowl, mix together the cream, sour cream, and cornstarch; stir into the skillet. Stir in the lemon zest, pepper, and paprika. Cook, stirring constantly, for 10 minutes, until sauce is thickened and salmon flakes easily with a fork. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccine and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain, and toss with the salmon sauce. Top with Parmesan cheese to serve.
