Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Skim off the foam from the surface of the butter. Remove from the heat. In a food processor, pulse the bread to coarse crumbs. Transfer the crumbs to a small cookie sheet, toss with 1 teaspoon of the olive oil and season lightly with salt and pepper. Bake for about 2 minutes, until golden brown. On a large rimmed baking sheet, toss the broccoli with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil; season with salt and pepper. Arrange the broccoli in an even layer and roast for about 15 minutes, until just tender and starting to brown. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, bring 1 inch of water to a simmer. In a stainless steel bowl, mix the egg yolks with the boiling water. Set the bowl over the saucepan and whisk the yolks constantly until thickened slightly and bright yellow, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat. Gently reheat the butter; very gradually, whisk it into the yolks until a slightly thick sauce forms. Whisk in the lemon juice and a dash of Tabasco and season the hollandaise sauce lightly with salt and pepper. Whisk in the mint and thyme. Transfer the broccoli to a platter; pour the hollandaise sauce on top. Sprinkle with the bread crumbs and serve.
