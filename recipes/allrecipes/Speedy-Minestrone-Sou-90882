Pour broth into a 5- to 6-quart pan. Add tomatoes (break up with a spoon) and their liquid, zucchini, and macaroni. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Then reduce heat and simmer until pasta is tender to bite (18 to 20 minutes). Ladle soup into bowls and add jack cheese. Pass bowls of pesto and parmesan cheese to add to individual servings to taste.
