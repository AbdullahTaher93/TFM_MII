Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix artichoke hearts, spinach, cream cheese, sour cream, Romano cheese, Parmesan cheese, roasted peppers, garlic, and lemon juice together in a baking dish and top with croutons. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and croutons are browned, about 35 minutes.
