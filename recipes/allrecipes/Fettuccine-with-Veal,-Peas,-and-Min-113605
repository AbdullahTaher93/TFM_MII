In a large frying pan, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter with 1 tablespoon of the oil over moderately high heat. Add the veal and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, turning, until just done, about 1 minute in all. Remove. Reduce the heat to moderately low. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and the onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the vermouth and then the broth and cream; bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 4 minutes. Add the peas and heat through, about 1 minute. Add the meat with any accumulated juices and the remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the fettucine until just done, about 12 minutes. Drain. Toss with the sauce, the pepper, the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, and the mint. Let sit for 2 to 3 minutes so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce.
