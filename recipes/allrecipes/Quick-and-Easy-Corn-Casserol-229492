Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 1-quart casserole dish with cooking spray. Mix corn, Cheddar cheese, black olives, green chilies, and green olives together in a bowl; pour into prepared casserole dish. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 25 minutes.
