Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Spray a standard 12-muffin tin with CRISCO(R) No Stick Cooking Spray. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. Set aside. In another medium bowl, whisk the milk, CRISCO(R) Oil and eggs until smooth. Add the dry ingredients and mix just until blended- do not over mix. Add the blueberries and stir just until evenly blended. Spoon batter into the prepared tins. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 15-20 minutes. Sprinkle muffins with coarse sugar (optional). Cool in tins on a baking rack for 5 minutes then remove.
