Mix egg substitute, milk, and pepper in a shallow dish. Place the turkey, ham, and cheese between the bread slices. Dip both sides of the sandwich into the egg-substitute mixture. Coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and put the sandwich in it over medium heat. Cook for 3 minutes on each side or until golden. If desired, sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve with strawberry jam.
