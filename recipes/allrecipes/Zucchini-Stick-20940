In a heavy saucepan or deep fryer, preheat oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a blender, mix the eggs, whipped cream, pepper and salt. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl. Slice the zucchini into pieces 2 to 3 inches long. Dip the pieces into the egg mixture, then coat them with the bread crumbs. Carefully place the battered pieces in the oil and fry 3 to 4 minutes, until brown and crispy. Drain fried pieces on a paper towel. Repeat until all the slices have been fried.
