Heat the oven to 425 degrees F. Remove all the skin and fat from the duck breasts. Place them in a baking dish, pour the wine over, and add the red currant jelly, garlic, and ginger. Place the dish in the oven and bake until tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, mix together the oil, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste in a large salad bowl. Using a small serrated knife, cut the peel and pith from the oranges. Hold each orange over the bowl to catch the juice, cut between the membranes to release the segments; add them to the bowl. Add the red cabbage, Napa cabbage, bean sprouts, watercress (reserving a few sprigs for garnishing), and the water chestnuts. Toss well to coat everything with the dressing. Remove the duck from the oven and transfer it to a warm plate. Pour the cooking liquid into a saucepan over high heat and boil the liquid to reduce slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Meanwhile cut the duck diagonally across the grain into neat slices. Pour the wine sauce over the salad and toss together. Pile the slices of duck on top, and garnish with the reserved sprigs of watercress
