Stir apples, cranberries, sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt together in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook until apples and cranberries are tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir lemon juice into cranberry mixture. Mash cranberry mixture with a wooden spoon or fork to make a chunky sauce.
