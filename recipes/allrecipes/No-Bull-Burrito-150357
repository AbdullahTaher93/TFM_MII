Place the ground beef in a large skillet set over medium-high heat. Season with garlic powder and oregano, and cook, stirring to crumble, until no longer pink. Drain off grease, then reduce the heat to medium-low and stir in the refried beans and salsa. Cook until heated through. Warm the flour tortillas for 2 minutes in the microwave, or until pliable. Spoon 1/4 cup of the beef mixture into the center, top with shredded cheese, and roll up, folding in the ends when you get to the halfway point.
