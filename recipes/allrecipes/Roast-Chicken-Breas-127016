Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. To prepare the chicken: Season with salt and pepper. In a saute pan over medium high heat, heat olive oil and sear skin side down until golden in color, about 3 minutes. Turn and saute another 3 minutes. Transfer pan to oven and roast for 15 to 20 minutes or until done. Remove chicken and wrap in foil to keep warm. Remove fat from pan. Add fennel, sage, lemon zest and raisins and deglaze with 1 cup of white wine and 1/2 cup sweet wine. Over high heat, reduce by half. Add brown chicken stock and cream. Reduce until slightly thickened. Remove sage and finish sauce with butter and grapes. To prepare the couscous: In a saucepan, heat olive oil. Add onions and cook for 1 minute, until glossy (do not brown). Add pearl couscous and stir until well coated with oil. Season with salt and add 1 cup of chicken stock. Stir occasionally until 2/3 of the liquid is absorbed. Add the remaining 1 cup of stock, and continue to cook until al dente. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and finish with parsley. Set aside and keep warm.
