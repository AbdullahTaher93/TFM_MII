Bake, cool and remove the 'tops' of the pastry shells according to the package directions. Heat the butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook for 3 minutes. Add the flour and cook and stir for 2 minutes. Gradually stir the stock into the skillet and heat to a boil, stirring constantly. Add the shrimp and corn to the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Stir in the cream, lemon juice and hot pepper sauce and cook until the shrimp are cooked through. Season to taste. Spoon the shrimp mixture into the pastry shells. Sprinkle with the cilantro.
