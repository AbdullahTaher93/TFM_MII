Cook linguine according to package directions. Drain. Set aside; keep warm. Meanwhile, melt butter in 10-inch skillet until sizzling; add onion, shrimp, green pepper, garlic, salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until shrimp turn pink (6 to 7 minutes). Stir whipping cream and flour together in small bowl until smooth; stir into shrimp mixture. Continue cooking until mixture just comes to a boil (about 1 minute). Stir in tomatoes and basil. Place hot, cooked pasta in large pasta bowl or on serving platter; top with shrimp mixture.
