Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place ribs in a 13-inch x 9-inch baking dish. Bake, uncovered for 1 1/2 hours. Combine remaining ingredients except rice in a medium saucepan to make BBQ sauce. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 15 minutes. Set aside; keep warm. Drain juice from the meat pan. Pour about 2 cups of sauce over the ribs. Cover pan loosely with foil; continue baking for 30 to 45 minutes or until ribs are tender. Cook rice; keep warm. Serve ribs over rice along with extra sauce.
