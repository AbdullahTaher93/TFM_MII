Cook and stir apple cider in a saucepan over medium-low heat until cider is reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Combine reduced apple cider, cranberries, orange juice, maple syrup, ginger, allspice, and cinnamon in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until cranberries have burst and sauce is thickened, about 10 minutes.
