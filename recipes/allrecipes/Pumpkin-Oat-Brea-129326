Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly grease a 9 x 5 x 3-inch loaf pan. In a large bowl stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, mace, and cloves. Stir in the oat bran. In a medium bowl combine the pumpkin, egg, egg white, oil, sugar, orange juice, and orange rind. Add this mixture to the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Fold in the walnuts. Pour the batter into the loaf pan and bake for 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the bread cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then turn it out onto a rack to cool.
