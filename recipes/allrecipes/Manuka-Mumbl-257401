Combine coconut oil and honey in a chilled bowl. Line a small tray with a sheet of plastic wrap; evenly spoon oil-honey mixture on top. Cover with another sheet of plastic wrap and press down to a 1/2-inch thickness using a tray of similar size. Refrigerate for 8 hours to overnight. Remove top layer of plastic wrap and cut hardened mixture into bite-size squares. Place squares in the bottom of a large, chilled bowl. Sprinkle 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg over squares, stir lightly. Sprinkle remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg on top. Refrigerate.
