Prepare sirloin: wash, remove fat, cut in half lengthwise, make shallow cuts for better marinating. Mix marinade, adding all ingredients to olive oil. Rub loin pieces with the marinade. Set aside for 3-4 hours. Prepare ingredients for Tatar sauce: cut pickles, eggs and chives into cubes, add sliced pickled mushrooms, sugar, pepper, and mayo. Mix gently. Wash potatoes and cut in half. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Put a slice of bacon and a slice of onion on each half. Wrap potatoes carefully into aluminum foil and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, at 450 degrees F. Weave pieces of loin onto kebab skewers. Pour a bit of oil onto grilling pan and fry loins on each side for 2-3 minutes. Serve with mustard, tartar sauce, and baked potatoes, gently unwrapped from the foil. You can serve the potatoes with garlic sauce.
