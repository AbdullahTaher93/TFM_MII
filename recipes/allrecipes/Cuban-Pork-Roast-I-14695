In a small bowl, mix together crushed garlic, rosemary, dill, oregano, and red wine. Place roast in a large plastic or glass container, pour wine mixture over meat, and cover. Marinate overnight in refrigerator. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Transfer meat to a Dutch oven. Make eight to ten 1 inch deep cuts into the meat with a sharp knife. Insert a whole peeled garlic clove into each hole. Pour marinade over meat, and cover. Roast for 35 minutes per pound, or until an instant read thermometer inserted into the center of the roast registers 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
