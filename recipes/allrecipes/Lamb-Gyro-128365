Wrap pitas in foil. Heat at 400 degrees F (200C) until warm, abut 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine cucumber, yogurt, and dill. In medium bowl, toss lamb with garlic and pepper. Coat a large nonstick skillet with nonstick spray and warm over medium-high heat. Add lamb and stir-fry for 5 minutes, until browned. Arrange onion slices in center of pita breads. Top with lamb, tomato, and spinach. Fold pita sides in to form cones. Secure with toothpicks or wrap bottoms of cones with foil. Serve with yogurt sauce.
