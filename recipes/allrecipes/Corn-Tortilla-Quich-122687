In a skillet, cook the sausage until no longer pink; drain. Place four tortillas in a greased 9-in. pie plate, overlapping and extending 1/2 in. beyond rim. Place remaining tortilla in the center. Layer with sausage, Monterey Jack and cheddar cheeses and chilies. Combine eggs, cream, cottage cheese and chili powder; slowly pour over chilies. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes or until the center is set and puffed. Sprinkle with cilantro. Cut into wedges.
