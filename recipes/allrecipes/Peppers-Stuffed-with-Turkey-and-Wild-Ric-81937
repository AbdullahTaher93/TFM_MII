In a small sauce pan with a well fitting lid, bring the water to a boil and add the rice, bay leaf, thyme and the salt and pepper. Stir, bring back to the boil, cover and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook for 40 minutes. Drain, lightly rinse and remove the bay leaf. (This part can be made a day in advance, if you wish). Meanwhile, mince the celery very finely and mince or chop the scallion. In a skillet over medium-high heat, add the ground turkey and cook until it has lost all of its pinkness. Turn off heat and add the minced celery and scallions. Toss or stir. Pour in the French dressing and add salt and pepper to taste. Stir well. (This part can also be made a day in advance). Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut off the tops of the bell peppers, rinse out the seeds and with a knife carefully cut off any white membrane. Toss together the turkey and the wild rice. Place the peppers on a cookie sheet and stuff them (loosely) with the turkey mixture. Be sure the peppers are not touching each other. Loosely place a sheet of aluminum foil on top off them (to help reduce evaporation). Bake for 20 minutes. (Bake for 25 minutes if the turkey and rice were made in advanced and were cold when added to the peppers).
