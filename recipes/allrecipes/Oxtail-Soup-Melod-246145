Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place oxtail in a baking dish and sprinkle seasoned salt over oxtail. Roast oxtail in a baking dish until well-browned, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven, reserving any drippings in baking dish. Heat beef broth, cabbage, potatoes, tomatoes, carrots, onion, orange juice, lime juice, garlic, bouillon, cumin, red pepper, bay leaves, salt, and black pepper together over medium heat in a large stockpot. Add oxtail and reserved drippings to soup; pour in water to fill stockpot halfway. Simmer soup, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are easily pierced with a fork, 30 to 40 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.
