Bring a small pot of salted water to a boil. Cook potatoes in boiling water until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and chop. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; add potatoes and cook until warm. Stir in curry paste and cream over low heat. Place two slices of cheese on each tortilla and microwave individually for fifteen to twenty-five seconds until melted. To assemble, divide the potatoes and spinach evenly between the tortillas and add chipotle salsa to taste. Heat in the microwave for twenty seconds, then enclose the tortillas around the filling.
