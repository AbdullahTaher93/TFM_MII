Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 6-cup muffin tin. Mix spinach, flour, eggs, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper in a bowl; divide evenly between prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 20 minutes.
