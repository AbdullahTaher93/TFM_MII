Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line muffin tin with paper liners. For biscuits, whisk flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda in a bowl. Blend in butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in Ranch and milk. Drop a heaping tablespoon of biscuit mixture into each muffin cup, filling only halfway. Press the biscuit mixture flat. Reserve extra mixture. For sandwich filling, combine meat, cheese and Ranch. Spoon filling over biscuit mixture; top with a spoonful of remaining biscuit mixture and bake 25 minutes.
