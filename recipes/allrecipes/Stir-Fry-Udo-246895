Whisk hoisin sauce, water, cornstarch, sugar, ginger, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl to make sauce. Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Add ramen noodles. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain. Heat peanut oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add asparagus, carrots, onion, and garlic; saute until slightly tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add chicken; toss until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Add cabbage and mushrooms. Pour in sauce; toss until coated. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until flavors combine, 3 to 5 minutes more. Serve sauteed asparagus mixture over noodles.
