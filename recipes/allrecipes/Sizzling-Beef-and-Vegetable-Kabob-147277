Place steak in large resealable plastic bag. Add 1/4 cup of the dressing; seal bag. Refrigerate 30 minutes to marinate. Remove steak from bag; discard bag and marinade. Preheat grill to medium heat. Thread steak onto 12 wooden skewers alternately with the tomatoes, mushrooms and asparagus. Grill kabobs 15 minutes or until steak is cooked through and vegetables are crisp-tender, turning and brushing occasionally with the remaining 1/4 cup dressing.
