In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Whisk in eggs and milk until smooth. Place the butter in a 9-in. pie plate. Heat at 400 degrees F for 2-3 minutes or until melted. Pour batter into hot plate. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Meanwhile, in a skillet, cook the sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Stir in the peaches, syrup and nutmeg. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, simmer, uncovered, for 7-10 minutes or until sausage and peaches are coated with syrup. Spoon into pancake. Serve immediately.
