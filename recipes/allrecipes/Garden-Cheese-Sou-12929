In a 6-quart pot, saute celery, onion, and garlic in butter or margarine until soft. Stir in flour. Gradually add water, and then vegetables, bouillon cubes, and chives. Bring to a boil, and then reduce heat. Cover the soup, and simmer for 15 minutes. Stir in cheese and milk, and stir until melted. Do not boil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
