In a mixing bowl, beat egg yolks until slightly thickened. Gradually add 3/4 cup sugar and hot water, beating until thick and lemon-colored. Blend in the orange juice, vanilla and orange and lemon peels. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt; add to egg yolk mixture. In another mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Add the remaining sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until stiff peaks form. Fold a fourth of the egg whites into the batter; fold in remaining whites. Spoon into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 20 - 25 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Immediately invert pan; cool completely. Cut into slices; serve with whipped topping.
