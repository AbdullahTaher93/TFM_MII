Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Mix salt, pepper, and sugar together in a small bowl. Brush chops with oil and sprinkle with seasoning mix. In a small bowl, blend butter with garlic, rosemary, lemon juice and a pinch of salt and pepper. Place chops on hot grill. Cover and cook until char-grill marks appear on one side, about 3 to 5 minutes. Turn and continue to grill until marks form on remaining side, about 3 to 5 minutes longer. Transfer chops to individual serving plates, placing a portion of the rosemary-garlic butter on top of each chop.
