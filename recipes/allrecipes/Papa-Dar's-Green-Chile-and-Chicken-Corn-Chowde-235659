Place bacon in a large stockpot; cook and stir over medium-high heat until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add onion and saute until onion is tender, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir green chiles into bacon-onion mixture and bring to a simmer; add chicken. Simmer mixture until chicken is almost fully cooked, about 10 minutes. Add potatoes and butter to green chilies-chicken mixture and reduce heat to medium; cook until potatoes are almost tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir corn and cream into mixture and reduce heat to medium-low; cook, stirring frequently and scraping bottom of pot with a wooden spoon, until potatoes are tender, about 10 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
