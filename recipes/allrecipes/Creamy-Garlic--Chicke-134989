Coat a large pan with cooking spray, and brown the chicken over medium heat till thoroughly cooked. Remove the chicken, and fry the vegetables and garlic powder for 3 minutes. Add the soup, water, and soy sauce to the pan and bring it to a slow boil. Add the chicken and let it simmer uncovered for 1 minute. Goes well with rice.
