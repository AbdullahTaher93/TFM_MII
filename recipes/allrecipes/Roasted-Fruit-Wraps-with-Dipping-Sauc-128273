To make the dipping sauce: In a small bowl, mix yogurt, ginger, and orange juice. Cover and refrigerate. To make the fruit wraps: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (215C). Coat a large nonstick baking sheet with nonstick spray. Add apples, peaches, pineapple, orange juice, sugar, and pumpkin pie spice. Toss to coat and spread in a single layer. Bake 10 to 15 minutes, or until fruit is tender. Place one-fourth of warm fruit down the center of each tortilla. Roll up like an envelope and place, seam side down, on a nonstick baking sheet. Bake 8 to 10 minutes, or until crisp and golden. Cut each wrap in half diagonally. Serve with sauce.
