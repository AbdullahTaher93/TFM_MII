Put the ham in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Transfer the ham to a medium bowl. Stir in the mayonnaise, parsley, jalapeno, mustard and paprika and season the deviled ham salad with hot sauce and salt. Lay half of the bread slices on a work surface and spread them with the deviled ham. Top with the sprouts and close the sandwiches. If making larger sandwiches, quarter them before serving.
