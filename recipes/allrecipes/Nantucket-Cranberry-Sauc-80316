Place the orange juice, maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, butter, and salt in a pan. Cook over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to low, and stir in the cranberries. Cook until cranberries pop, about 10 minutes. Bring the mixture to a boil. Cook and stir until mixture reduces to approximately 1 3/4 cups, about 10 minutes. Cool, cover, and refrigerate until needed.
