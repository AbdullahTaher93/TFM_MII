Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Mix in the sausages, onion, potato, green bell pepper, and garlic. Cook 10 minutes, stirring often, until potatoes are slightly tender. Mix the zucchini into pot. Pour in the tomatoes and their liquid and 3/4 tomato can (21 fluid ounces) water. Season with basil, oregano, parsley, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce to low, and simmer 40 minutes. Stir the green beans into the pot, and continue cooking 5 minutes, until beans are heated through.
