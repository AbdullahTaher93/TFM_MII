In a deep sauce pan over high heat, add the water and the polenta mix. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir occasionally. Remove from heat, stir in the cheese and allow to cool for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, remove the stems from the peppers and cut into halves. Remove the seeds and membranes. Cut each half into 4 squares. This will yield 48 squares total. Drain the sun-dried tomatoes and slice. You want to end up with 48 slices. Once the polenta has cooled enough to handle, spoon out 1 Tbsp worth per pepper square and garnish with a slice of sun-dried tomato.
