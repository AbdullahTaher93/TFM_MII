Combine chicken, sausage, mirepoix mix, diced tomatoes, bell pepper, garlic, Swanson(R) Chicken Broth, Cajun seasoning, thyme, and oregano in a slow cooker. Cook on High until chicken is tender, 4 to 5 hours. Stir occasionally. During the last 30 minutes, add rice and shrimp; stir to combine. Turn off slow cooker. Let stand, covered, for at least 15 minutes to allow rice to absorb most of the remaining liquid. Garnish with fresh parsley, if desired.
