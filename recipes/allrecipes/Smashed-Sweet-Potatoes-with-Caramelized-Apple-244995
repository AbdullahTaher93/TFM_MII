Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add sweet potato, cover, and steam until soft, about 1 hour. Scoop the meat from the skin, transfer to a bowl, and smash using an electric mixer or wooden peg. Stir 1/4 cup brown sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon into smashed sweet potatoes; allow to cool. Stir cream, orange juice, 1/4 cup unsalted butter, salt, and pepper into smashed sweet potatoes; transfer to a baking dish. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Melt 3 tablespoons unsalted butter in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir apples and 3 tablespoons brown sugar in the melted butter until lightly browned on both sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Spoon caramelized apples over smashed sweet potatoes. Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 20 minutes.
