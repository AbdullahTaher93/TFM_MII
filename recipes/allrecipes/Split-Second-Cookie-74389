Divide dough into four equal portions; shape each into a 12-in. x 3/4-in. log. Place 4 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Make a 1/2-in. depression down center of logs; fill with jam. Bake at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool for 2 minutes; cut diagonally into 3/4-in. slices. Remove to wire racks to cool completely.
