Combine coriander, garlic salt, turmeric and 1 tablespoon cornstarch; pat onto chicken. Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat. Saute chicken 3-4 minutes per side until golden and cooked through. Remove chicken to platter; tent with foil. Steam sugar snap peas in a separate pan about 3 minutes, or until crisp-tender. Meanwhile, combine broth, wine, cilantro, and remaining 1 tablespoon cornstarch; add to skillet. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer, cook 1 minute. Stir in cream. Serve over chicken with sugar snap peas and couscous or rice, if desired.
