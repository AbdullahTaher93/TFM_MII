Bring chicken broth to a boil in a stockpot; add beef stew meat, potatoes, mushrooms, beet, onion, kale leaves, chipotle peppers, jalapeno pepper, garlic, sage, dill, and bay leaves. Reduce heat, cover pot, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender, about 3 hours. Ladle borscht into serving bowls and top with sour cream.
