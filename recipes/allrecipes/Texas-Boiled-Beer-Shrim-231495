Bring beer with dry crab boil to a boil in a large pot. Add shrimp to boiling beer and place a cover on the pot. Bring the beer again to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer for 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat and leave shrimp steeping in the beer another 2 to 3 minutes; drain. Serve immediately.
