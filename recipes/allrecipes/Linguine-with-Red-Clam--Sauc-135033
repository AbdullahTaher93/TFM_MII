Saute the garlic in the oil or butter in a large skillet. Dump in the tomatoes with chile peppers (including the liquid in the can) and the oregano. Cook for 2 minutes. Pour in the wine and cook for 1 minute. Drain the canned clam juice into the pan. Cook for 2 minutes. Add the cooked pasta and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the clams, anchovies and basil. Heat through. Top with grated Parmesan cheese. If you're not an anchovy fan, leave them out.
