Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Boil the tagliatelle until cooked through yet slightly firm, 8 to 10 minutes; drain. Drizzle olive oil over the cooked pasta and toss gently to coat. Heat the cream in a saucepan over low heat until warm; stir in the blue cheese, garlic powder, lemon juice, salt, black pepper, white pepper, nutmeg, oregano, and basil. Cook very gently until the blue cheese has melted and the sauce is hot, but don't let the sauce boil. Place the tagliatelle in a serving dish and pour the sauce over the pasta. Top with walnuts to serve.
