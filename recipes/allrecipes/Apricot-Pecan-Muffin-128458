Preheat the oven to 400F (200C). Grease a 12-cup muffin pan. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. Stir in the apricots and pecans. In a large bowl, stir together the buttermilk, oil, egg, and brown sugar until well-blended. Stir in the flour mixture until just combined. Do not overmix. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups, filling them about two-thirds full. Bake for 13 to 15 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Cool on a rack for 5 minutes. Remove to the rack to cool completely.
