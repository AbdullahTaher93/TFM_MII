In a small saucepan over low heat, melt butter. Stir in bouillon and garlic powder. Remove from the heat; let stand until bouillon is dissolved. Meanwhile, unroll breadsticks and separate into 12 sticks. Place eight sticks lengthwise side by side on a greased baking sheet. Place another breadstick along the bottom of the house, stretching dough as needed. To create the entrance, move two center sticks so they extend 2 in. above the other sticks. To form the roof, place two of the remaining sticks on top of the house so they extend about 1 in. beyond the sides. Cut remaining breadsticks as needed to fill spaces beneath the roof. Gently pinch edges of breadsticks together to seal seams. Brush with the butter mixture; sprinkle with rosemary and thyme. Bake at 375 degrees F for 11-13 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool for 2 minutes before carefully transferring to a serving platter.
