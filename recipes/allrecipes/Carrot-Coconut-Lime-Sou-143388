Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir and cook the chili paste, cumin, and 1 tablespoon of cilantro until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the ginger, onion, and garlic; cook until the onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Place the potatoes and carrots into the pot with the onion mixture and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Pour the vegetable broth and coconut milk over the cooked vegetables. Turn the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes or until the potatoes and carrots are soft. Remove the Dutch oven from the heat and stir in the lime juice. Working in batches, puree the soup in a blender or food processor until smooth. Serve hot or chilled, garnished with the remaining cilantro.
