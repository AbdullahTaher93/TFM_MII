In a large skillet, brown chops, about 2 minutes each side; reserve. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange apple slices in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon. Dot with butter or margarine. Top with browned pork chops and season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour sherry over all, cover and bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour or until tender and the internal temperature has reached 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
