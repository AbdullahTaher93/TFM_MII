Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, 12 to 14 minutes; drain. Cook and stir sausage, onion powder, and garlic powder together in a large skillet over medium heat until sausage is heated through, 5 to 7 minutes. Add white wine and cook until wine hot, about 2 minutes. Stir tomato sauce, Cajun seasoning, paprika, and black pepper into sausage mixture until evenly coated; stir in yogurt. Cook sausage mixture until almost bubbling; reduce heat to low and cook until mixture is thickened, about 5 minutes more. Mix pasta, parsley, and Parmesan cheese into sausage mixture.
