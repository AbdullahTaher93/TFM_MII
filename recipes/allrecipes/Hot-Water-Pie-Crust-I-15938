In a large bowl, combine shortening, vinegar, and milk. Pour in hot water and whip until mixture is smooth. In a separate bowl, mix together flour, salt, and cornstarch. Add flour mixture to shortening mixture and stir just until dough comes together. Roll out dough between sheets of wax paper. If dough is difficult to work with, refrigerate before rolling.
