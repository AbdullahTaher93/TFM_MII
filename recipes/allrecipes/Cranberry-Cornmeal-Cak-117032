Melt 1/4 cup butter; pour into an ungreased 9-in. round baking pan. Tilt to grease sides of pan. Sprinkle with 3/4 cup brown sugar. Top with cranberries and raisins; set aside. In a large mixing bowl, cream the remaining butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Combine the flour, cornmeal and baking powder; add to creamed mixture alternately with milk. Carefully spread over cranberries and raisins. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center of cake comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before inverting onto a serving platter. Serve warm.
