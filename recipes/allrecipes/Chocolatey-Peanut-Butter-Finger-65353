Beat at medium speed of electric mixer until well blended. Beat in 1/3 cup JIF(R)Peanut Butter and vanilla. Combine flour, oats, baking soda and salt. Add gradually to creamed mixture at low speed. Beat until well blended. Spread in greased baking dish. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until light brown and center is just set. Do not over-bake. Remove pan and immediately sprinkle with chocolate chips. Let stand 5 minutes or until chips become shiny and soft. Spread to cover. Cool slightly. Cut into bars about 2x13/4-inches. Cool completely. For drizzle and topping, combine confectioners' sugar, 2 tablespoons JIF(R)Peanut Butter and evaporated milk. Stir until well blended. Drizzle over chocolate. Sprinkle with toffee bits, if desired.
