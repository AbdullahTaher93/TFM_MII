Preheat oven to 200 degrees F. Cut pork crosswise into slices about 1/2 inch thick. Place slices between sheets of plastic wrap; with a flat mallet or rolling pin, gently and evenly pound pork to a 1/4-inch thickness. Peel off plastic wrap. Coat slices lightly with flour. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add as many slices of pork as will fit in a single layer. Cook, turning once, until lightly browned on both sides, about 1 minute total. Transfer to an ovenproof serving platter, cover lightly with foil, and keep warm in oven while you cook remaining pork. Add more butter to frying pan if necessary. When all the pork is cooked and warming in the oven, add shallots and pepper to frying pan; stir until shallots are limp, about 2 minutes. Add wine, orange peel, and orange juice. Boil over high heat until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 5 minutes. Pour sauce over pork and serve. Add salt to taste.
