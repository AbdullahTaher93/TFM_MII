Flatten the chicken breasts with a meat hammer or rolling pin and season them with salt and pepper. Char the red and yellow pepper over a gas flame or under a hot broiler until the skin is completely burned. Wipe off the skin. Cut each pepper in half and remove the seeds, then cut into quarters. In a saucepan, blanch the green part of 4 of the scallions. Place 1 blanched scallion on the inside of chicken breast, then add a piece of the yellow pepper and a piece of the red pepper. Roll up the breast to enclose the peppers and secure with string. Season the outside with salt and pepper. Repeat with the remaining breasts. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat a large, heavy ovenproof skillet. Add the chicken breasts and brown them on all sides. Place the skillet in the hot oven and cook the breasts for 15 minutes, until cooked through. Remove from oven and keep the chicken warm on a plate. Halve the remaining scallions lengthwise, then cut them into 1-inch pieces. Heat a saute pan. Add the olive oil and heat until hot. Saute the scallion pieces for 1 minute. Add the vinegar and plum wine or sherry and reduce by two thirds. Add the cream and reduce it until the sauce lightly coats the back of a spoon. Whisk in the butter, a little at a time over very low heat. Season the sauce to taste with salt and pepper.
