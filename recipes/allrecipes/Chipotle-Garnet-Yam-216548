Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place yams onto a baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven until very soft, about 1 hour. Once done, allow to cool, then peel and place into a mixing bowl. Mash the chipotle chiles into a paste, and add to the potatoes along with the butter, brown sugar, and heavy cream. Mash until smooth, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Spread the potatoes into a shallow baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, 20 to 25 minutes.
