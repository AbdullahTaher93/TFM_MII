Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line a 9x9x2-inch baking pan with foil, leaving about 1 inch of the foil extending over the edges of the pan. Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray; set aside. In a large bowl, stir together Ghirardelli(R) Dark Chocolate Brownie Mix and baking soda. Stir in vegetable oil, eggs, and red food coloring until well blended. Pour into prepared baking pan. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 1 hour. Use foil to lift uncut brownies out of pan. Cut into 16 two-inch squares. Dollop cream cheese frosting over each square. Top each piece with a Ghirardelli(R) Holiday Impression.
