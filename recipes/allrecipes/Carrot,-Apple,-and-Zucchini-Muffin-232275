Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat 24 muffin cups with cooking spray. Stir zucchini, carrots, and apple together in a large bowl. Mix in yogurt, sucralose and brown sugar blend, eggs, applesauce, skim milk, canola oil, lemon zest, and orange zest until thoroughly combined. Whisk all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice in a separate bowl. Gently stir dry ingredients into wet ingredients until just combined. Fold walnuts into batter. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
