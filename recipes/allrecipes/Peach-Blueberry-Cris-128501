Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat a 9 inch x 9 inch (23 cm x 23 cm) baking dish with nonstick spray. To make the filling: In a large bowl, stir together the peaches, blueberries, sugar, apricot nectar or peach nectar, flour, and lemon juice. Pour into the prepared baking dish. To make the topping: In a medium bowl, mix the flour, oats, sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Cut in the butter or margarine until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Sprinkle over the fruit. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the top is lightly browned. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.
