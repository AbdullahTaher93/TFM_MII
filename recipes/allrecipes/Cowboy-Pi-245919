Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Heat a 10-inch oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat and add smoked sausage, cook until browned. Add garlic, onion and bell pepper and cook until vegetables are soft, about 6 minutes. Stir in chili powder, cumin, salt, tomatoes with their juice and beans. Cook for 3 - 5 minutes, until mixture starts to bubble. Turn off heat and stir in cheese. Mix jalapeno into the prepared corn muffin mix. Spread corn muffin batter over the mixture and bake until golden brown and cooked through, 20 - 25 minutes.
