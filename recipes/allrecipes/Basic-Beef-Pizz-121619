In a skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Add salt, celery salt and pepper; set aside. On a floured surface, roll dough into a 13-in. circle. Press onto the bottom and up the sides of a greased 12-in. pizza pan. Spread sauce over crust to within 1/2 in. of edge. Top with cheese and beef mixture. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until crust is golden and cheese is melted.
