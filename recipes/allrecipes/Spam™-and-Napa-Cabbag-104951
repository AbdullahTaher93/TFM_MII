Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add the Spam(tm) and cover; fry until browned, about 10 to 15 minutes. Turn the heat to low; add the cabbage and water. Cover and steam until the cabbage is crisp tender, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the lid, and stir in the soy sauce and tomato (if using). Season to taste with salt and pepper.
