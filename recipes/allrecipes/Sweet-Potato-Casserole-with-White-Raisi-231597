Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix eggs, sugar, melted butter, raisins, milk, and vanilla extract in a large mixing bowl. Add mashed sweet potatoes; stir to combine. Spread the sweet potato mixture into the prepared baking dish. Mix brown sugar and flour together in a small bowl. Mash butter into the mixture with a fork until crumbly; add pecans and stir. Sprinkle the brown sugar mixture over the sweet potato mixture. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.
