Mix hot water and chicken stock concentrate in a bowl until dissolved; pour into a blender. Add 1 can black beans, chipotle pepper, and adobo sauce; puree until smooth. Place bacon in a large pot and cook over medium heat, turning occasionally, until crispy, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer bacon to a plate lined with paper towels using a slotted spoon, reserving grease in the pot. Stir onion, green bell pepper, and red bell pepper into the bacon grease in the pot; cook until soft, about 10 minutes. Add garlic, cumin, and black pepper; cook until fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds. Stir black bean puree into the pot. Add remaining 2 cans black beans, bacon, diced tomatoes, and cilantro; bring to a boil. Simmer soup, stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, 20 to 30 minutes.
