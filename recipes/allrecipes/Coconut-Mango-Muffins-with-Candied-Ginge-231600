Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, brown sugar, 1/2 cup flaked coconut, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Beat the eggs in another large bowl until creamy. Add applesauce, coconut milk yogurt, skim milk, vegetable oil, and honey to eggs. Blend well. Stir flour mixture, dried mango, candied ginger, and honey into egg mixture just until blended. Spoon batter into muffin cups, filling about 3/4 of each cup. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons flaked coconut on top. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
