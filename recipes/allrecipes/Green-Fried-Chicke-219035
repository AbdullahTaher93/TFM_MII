Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Combine mayonnaise and TABASCO(R) Green Sauce in a pie plate and mix well. Combine bread crumbs, cheese, and parsley in a second pie plate. Dip each chicken breast into mayonnaise mixture and coat well on both sides, then dip into bread crumb mixture and coat well. Place on a baking sheet and bake 20 to 25 minutes or until chicken is golden brown and no longer pink inside.
