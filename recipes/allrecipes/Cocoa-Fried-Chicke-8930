Mix flour and cocoa powder in a shallow dish or plate. One by one, coat chicken pieces in flour mixture, then dip in beaten egg, then in seasoned bread crumbs. Heat oil in a cast iron skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry coated chicken pieces in oil until cooked through and juices run clear (approximately 5 minutes). Drain on paper towels.
