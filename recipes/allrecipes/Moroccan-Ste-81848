Cut the lamb into bite sized cubes. Trim away any gristle from the meat. Zest the lemon and then squeeze all the juice out into a large re-sealable bag. Remove any seeds. Add the zest, vinegar, minced garlic, cumin, salt, cinnamon, ginger and turmeric. Shake to blend. Add the minced cilantro and mint leaves and the lamb. Seal and toss/shake until everything is well coated. Squeeze out the excess air, reseal and refrigerate over night. In a heavy soup kettle over high heat, add the chicken stock (or water), canned tomatoes with their juice and the chopped onions. Bring to a boil. Add the lamb and all the marinade that you can scrape out of the bag. Return to the boil then reduce heat to a simmer. Cover and simmer for about 11/2 hours until the meat is very tender. Stir occasionally. Serve hot.
