In large saucepan or Dutch oven, bring water to a boil over high heat. Once boiling add fish and garlic. Cover and reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes or until fish is opaque and flakes easily when tested with fork. Remove fish with slotted spoon and set aside. Keep stock in saucepan for later use, approximately 2 cups. In a small nonstick saute pan, heat olive oil over medium heat until hot. Saute onions for approximately 5 minutes or until tender. Once onions are tender add almonds and bread crumbs, stirring for 3 to 5 minutes or until lightly browned. Add onion and bread crumb mixture to reserved fish stock along with the vegetable broth, tomatoes, paprika and pepper. Add fish; cover and cook over medium heat until fish is heated through. Season to taste with salt. Serve hot!!
