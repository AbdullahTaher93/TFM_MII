Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 20 muffin cups, or line with paper muffin liners. Mix water and flax seeds together in a bowl. Stir all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Add carrots and chopped apples; toss to coat. Stir applesauce, white sugar, brown sugar, olive oil, eggs, walnuts, and flax seed mixture into the flour mixture. Mix until batter is well combined. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups, filling each cup about 3/4 full. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 18 minutes.
