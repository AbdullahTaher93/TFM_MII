Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a small bowl stir together the 2 tablespoons melted butter and the mustard. Brush one sheet of phyllo dough lightly with butter mixture; fold in half crosswise. Brush again. Repeat with remaining sheets. Stack the sheets on a baking sheet to make 6 layers. Brush any remaining butter mixture over top. Bake in a 375 degree F oven for 8 to 10 minutes or until browned and crisp. Cool. Break into large shards; set aside. In a large skillet heat the 3 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Cook and stir leeks or onion in hot butter for 2 to 3 minutes or until tender. Add the flour to the skillet; cook and stir about 1 minute. Stir in LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk; cook and stir until mixture is slightly thickened and bubbly. Stir in the crabmeat, peas, seafood seasoning, and, if desired, ground red pepper. Spoon the crab mixture into a 2-quart square baking dish. Bake, covered, in a 375 degree F oven for 20 to 25 minutes until heated through. To serve, top with the shards of phyllo.
