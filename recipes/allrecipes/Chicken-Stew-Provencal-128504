Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook, turning occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until browned on all sides. Add the onions, celery, and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until the onions are lightly browned. Add the broth, tomatoes (with juice), potatoes, herbs de Provence, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink and the potatoes are tender.
