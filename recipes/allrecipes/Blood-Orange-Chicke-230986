Place chicken breasts into a baking dish. Squeeze juice of 2 blood oranges over chicken. Marinate from 12 to 24 hours; drain and discard used marinade. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season each chicken breast with salt and black pepper. Brown chicken in hot oil on both sides, about 4 minutes per side; transfer to a plate and cover with aluminum foil. Melt butter in a clean skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in melted butter until onion is translucent and garlic has begun to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in juice of 3 blood oranges, chicken stock, white wine, and parsley. Bring mixture to a boil. Return chicken breasts to skillet, reduce heat to low, and cover. Simmer until chicken is no longer pink inside, about 7 minutes per side. Place chicken to serving plates, leaving pan juices; dissolve honey in the pan juices and simmer sauce until thickened, about 2 minutes. Spoon sauce over chicken breasts to serve.
