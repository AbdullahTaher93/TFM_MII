Place beans in a large pot with onion, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, garlic, and lard; add enough water to cover with 4 to 5 inches of water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cook for 2 to 3 hours. Depending on the beans, it may take up to 5 hours. Add more water if necessary. When beans are soft, season to taste with salt.
