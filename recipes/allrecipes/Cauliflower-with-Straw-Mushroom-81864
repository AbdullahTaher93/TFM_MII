Slice the cauliflower into florets. Cut away and discard 1/2 of the scallions' green tops. Cut the remaining portion in half and then julienne. Mix together in a small bowl the soy sauce, water, sweetener and ginger. Set aside. In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the cauliflower and scallions before the oil begins to smoke. Stir fry for about 2 minutes. Add the mushroom and the sauce and cook for another 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Serve immediately.
