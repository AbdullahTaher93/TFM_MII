To Marinate: Arrange chicken pieces in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a small bowl combine the onion, soy sauce, ginger, garlic and honey; mix together and spoon mixture over chicken. Cover dish and refrigerate to marinate for 1 hour, turning pieces once. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bake chicken at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Turn pieces over and top with green onion, then continue baking for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until chicken is tender and cooked through and juices run clear. Serve immediately.
