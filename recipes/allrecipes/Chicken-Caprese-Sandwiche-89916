Place each chicken breast in a quart-sized resealable plastic freezer bag. Flatten with meat mallet or rolling pin to 1/4-inch thick. Heat oil in large skillet, over medium-high. Add chicken. Cook 6 to 7 minutes or until chicken is cooked, turning once. Remove from pan; set aside. Meanwhile, in blender add 1/2 cup basil leaves, mayonnaise and salt; blend until well combined. Slice focaccia in half lengthwise. Broil 1 to 2 minutes until lightly toasted. Spread each half with basil mayonnaise. Top with tomato, mozzarella, remaining 1/4 cup basil leaves, cooked chicken and remaining half of bread. Cut into wedges to serve.
