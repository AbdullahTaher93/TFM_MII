To make glaze, bring pear nectar to simmer in large, non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, ginger root, and cayenne. Stir until sugar is dissolved and sauce begins to simmer. Add pears and stir to coat. Cook, basting pears frequently, until pears are barely tender, 4 minutes. Mix remaining 2 tablespoons of pear nectar with cornstarch and stir into pear mixture. Simmer until sauce thickens slightly. Transfer to bowl and set aside. Wipe out skillet. Combine flour, thyme, pepper, and salt on plate. Dredge chops in flour mixture, coating all sides and shaking off excess. Using same pan, heat olive oil over medium-high heat and swirl to coat pan. Add pork chops and brown on each side, turning once, about 4 minutes per side. Turn heat to low and pour pear mixture over top, cover, and cook until chops are cooked through and pears are tender, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.
