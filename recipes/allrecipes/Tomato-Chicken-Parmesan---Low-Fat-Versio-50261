Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly coat a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray. Pour beaten eggs into a shallow dish or bowl. In another shallow dish or bowl, mix together the grated Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs. Dip chicken breasts into beaten egg, then into bread crumb mixture to coat. In a large, nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium high heat. Add coated chicken, and cook for about 6 to 10 minutes each side, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Pour tomato sauce into a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange chicken in a single layer in the tomato sauce, then place a slice of Monterey Jack cheese over each breast. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until cheese is completely melted.
