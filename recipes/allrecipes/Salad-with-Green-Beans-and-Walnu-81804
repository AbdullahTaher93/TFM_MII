Whisk together the walnut oil, vinegar, lemon juice, chives, basil, mint and the salt & pepper. Let stand at room temp while you prepare the salad. Rinse green beans and trim the ends. Cut to desired lengths. Steam the green beans until just tender but still a bit crisp (about 2 minutes in the microwave, depending on the green bean variety and amount of crispness desired). Drain off the hot water and plunge beans into an ice water bath to stop the cooking process (and help retain that bright green color). Let sit in bath for at least two minutes. Drain thoroughly. Shred or thinly slice the lettuce. Toss together the green beans, lettuce and walnuts. Re-whisk the dressing then pour it over the salad and toss it again. Serve immediately. If making the salad in advance, do not add then dressing until just prior to serving.
