Place cream cheese in a food processor and pulse until smooth, 8 to 10 pulses. Add powdered sugar and vanilla. Process again until smooth. Place half of the mixture into a small glass bowl or other small clear container. Place jam in a microwaveable bowl; microwave until smooth and liquefied, about 10 seconds. Stir. If not completely liquefied, microwave another 5 seconds. Spread liquefied jam evenly over the top of the cream cheese mixture. Spread over the entire surface to the edges. Carefully spread remaining cream cheese mixture on top of the jam. Sprinkle semi sweet chips. Refrigerate at least 3 hours. Garnish with raspberries. Spread on Pretzel Crisps(R) or use the spread as a dip.
