In a bowl, combine bread crumbs, egg, green onions, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger. Add turkey and gently mix with a fork just until ingredients are evenly blended. Divide turkey mixture into 4 equal portions. With your hands, shape each portion into a 3/4inch thick patty. If making ahead, lay patties side by side on a plate, cover air tight, and chill up to 24 hours. Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for direct heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is directly under the food). For charcoal grill: Before you put the grill over the hot coals, brush grill with a generous coat of oil. For gas grill: When hot, brush grill with a generous coat of oil. Lay patties on well oiled grill over a solid bed of medium coals or medium heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand just above grill level only 3 to 4 seconds). Keep charcoal grill uncovered; close lid on gas grill. Cook 5 minutes, then turn burgers with a wide spatula. Continue to cook cooking until meat is opaque in center (cut to test), 5 to 6 minutes longer. Transfer burgers to buns and garnish to taste.
