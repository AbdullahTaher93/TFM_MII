Combine the pig's feet, vinegar, water, soy sauce, onion, garlic, peppercorns, bay leaves, sugar, and salt together in a stockpot; bring to a boil for 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; allow the stew to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the meat pulls easily from the bones and the liquid has thickened, about 1 hour. Serve hot.
