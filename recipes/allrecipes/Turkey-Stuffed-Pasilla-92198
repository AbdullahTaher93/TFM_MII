Rinse and dry chilies. On a baking sheet, broil 4 to 6 inches from heat, until skins are charred and blistered, about 5 minutes. Turn and char other sides, about 5 minutes more. Remove from oven and cover loosely with foil. Let stand 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in an 8- to 10-inch nonstick frying pan, combine oil, turkey, onions, chili powder, and cumin. Stir often over medium-high heat until turkey is browned, about 7 minutes. Stir in corn and 1/2 cup salsa. Set aside. Uncover chilies; gently peel off and discard skins. Carefully make a lengthwise cut in each chili (from stem to tip), cutting through only the top side. Gently open up each chili to form a cavity for filling. Scoop out and discard seeds, leaving stem intact. Return chilies, cut side up, to baking sheet. Spoon turkey mixture into chilies, dividing equally. Top with cheese. Bake in a 400 degree F oven until cheese bubbles, about 10 minutes. Transfer chilies to individual plates. Serve with additional salsa and sour cream.
