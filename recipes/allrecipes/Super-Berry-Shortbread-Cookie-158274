Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Stir together all-purpose and whole wheat flours, brown sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Cut in butter spread until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add cherries, cranberries and blueberries. Form dough into ball and knead 5 times or until smooth and holds together without crumbling. Form dough into 1-inch balls. Place 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Flatten to about 1/4 inch thickness. Bake cookies in preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until edges are firm. Transfer cookies to a wire rack and cool completely.
