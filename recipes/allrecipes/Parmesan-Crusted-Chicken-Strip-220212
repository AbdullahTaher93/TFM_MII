Place Parmesan cheese into a shallow bowl. Beat eggs and water together in a bowl. Dip chicken strips into the egg mixture. Press chicken into Parmesan cheese. Gently toss between your hands so any cheese crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place the coated chicken onto a plate while coating the rest; do not stack. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry chicken strips in batches until no longer pink in the center and crust is golden brown, about 4 minutes on each side.
