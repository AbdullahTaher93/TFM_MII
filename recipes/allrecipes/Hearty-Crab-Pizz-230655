Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a pizza pan and sprinkle corn meal into pan. Poke several holes into pizza crust and place into the prepared pizza pan. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove crust and turn oven heat down to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in hot butter until onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Stir basil, oregano, and Parmesan cheese into onion and garlic. Spread onion mixture evenly over pizza crust; top with 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese. Heat imitation crab in the saucepan over medium-high heat until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle imitation crab over pizza, followed by tomato and corn kernels. Top pizza with remaining 1 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. Season with Italian seasoning. Bake in the hot oven until cheese is melted and crust is golden brown, 10 to 20 minutes.
