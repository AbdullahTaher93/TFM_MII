Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with vegetable oil. Beat sweet potatoes, white sugar, eggs, milk, 1/2 cup melted butter, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth; pour into the prepared baking dish. Mix brown sugar, pecans, flour, and 1/3 cup melted butter together in a bowl; spread over sweet potato mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until souffle is set in the middle, 25 to 30 minutes.
