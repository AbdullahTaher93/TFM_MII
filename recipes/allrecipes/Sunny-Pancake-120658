In a large bowl, combine the first four ingredients. In another bowl, combine the egg, orange juice, milk, oil and orange peel; add to dry ingredients just until moistened. Pour batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto a lightly greased hot griddle. Turn when bubbles form on top; cook until second side is golden brown. For orange sauce, combine sugar, cornstarch and salt in a saucepan. Stir in the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Serve warm with pancakes.
