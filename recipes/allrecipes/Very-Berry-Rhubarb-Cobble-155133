Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Mix rhubarb, strawberries, blueberries and vinegar in large bowl. Combine 1 cup sugar and the cornstarch in small bowl. Add to fruit mixture; mix lightly. Spoon into 11x7-inch baking dish; set aside. Combine flour, remaining 3/4 cup sugar, almonds and salt in medium bowl. Stir in egg until mixture is crumbly; sprinkle evenly over fruit. Drizzle with Fleischmanns. Bake 35 to 40 minutes, or until topping is lightly browned and fruit mixture is hot and bubbly. Serve warm topped with a serving of Reddi-wip. Sprinkle with nutmeg, if desired.
