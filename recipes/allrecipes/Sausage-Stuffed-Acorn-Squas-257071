Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread bread cubes on a baking sheet. Toast bread in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, 10 to 15 minutes. Mix cinnamon, sage, sumac, white pepper, and cloves together in a small bowl. Brush acorn squash halves with olive oil. Sprinkle 3/4 teaspoon of the cinnamon mixture evenly over both halves. Transfer to a baking sheet. Bake acorn squash in the preheated oven until tender, about 30 minutes. Scrape flesh with a fork to loosen slightly. Combine toasted bread and vegetable stock in a pot over medium-low heat. Stir bread around to soak up the vegetable stock and warm up, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Cook and stir sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir into the bread in the bowl. Add remaining cinnamon mixture, cranberries, pecans, and thyme; stir until evenly mixed. Divide bread mixture between the acorn squash halves. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
