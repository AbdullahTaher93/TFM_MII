In a large skillet, brown pork chops in oil. Place in an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Combine bread cubes, soup, celery, onion, garlic, egg, poultry seasoning and pepper; spread over pork chops. Bake uncovered at 350 degrees F for 45-55 minutes. If desired, sprinkle with cheese and return to the oven for 5 minutes or until melted.
