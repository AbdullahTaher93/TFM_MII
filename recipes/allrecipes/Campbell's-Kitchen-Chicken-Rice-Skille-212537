Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until well browned on all sides. Remove the chicken from the skillet. Pour off any fat. Stir the broth, garlic powder, hot pepper sauce, if desired, green pepper, tomatoes and rice in the skillet and heat to a boil. Return the chicken to the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 30 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.
