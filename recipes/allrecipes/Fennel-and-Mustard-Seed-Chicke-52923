Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper to taste. Grind the fennel and mustard seeds in a clean coffee grinder. Sprinkle freshly ground spices over chicken pieces. In a large frying pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Cook garlic in the olive oil, stirring frequently. Once the garlic begins to brown, place the chicken in the pan. Increase heat to high, and quickly brown both sides. Reduce heat, and cover. Cook chicken until juices run clear and meat is tender.
