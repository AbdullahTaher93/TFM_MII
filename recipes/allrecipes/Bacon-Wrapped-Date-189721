Cut bacon slices in half crosswise. Wrap each date in a bacon piece, securing meat with a toothpick; cover and chill. Lay wrapped dates on a rack on a baking sheet. Bake in a 375 degrees F oven, turning pieces over after 20 minutes, until the bacon is browned, about 30 minutes total. To serve, pass appetizers when warm.
