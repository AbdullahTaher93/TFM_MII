Toss strawberries with sugar; let stand 10 minutes or until sugar is dissolved. Meanwhile, cut each cake slice diagonally in half; place one cake piece on each of 12 dessert plates. Pour milk into large bowl. Add dry pudding mix. Beat with wire whisk 2 minutes or until well blended. Gently stir in half of the whipped topping. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the strawberries over each cake piece; top with 1/4 cup of the pudding mixture and second cake piece. Cover with remaining strawberries and remaining whipped topping. Serve immediately, or cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
