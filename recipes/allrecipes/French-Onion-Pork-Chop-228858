Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and brown the pork chops, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Mix cream of mushroom soup, dry onion soup mix, milk, and sherry together in a bowl and pour over the pork chops; cover and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until pork chops are tender and no longer pink inside, 15 to 20 minutes.
