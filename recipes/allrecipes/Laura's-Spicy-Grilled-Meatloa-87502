Combine first 7 ingredients and 1 teaspoon chipotle peppers in adobo sauce or 1/2 teaspoon dried chipotle seasoning. Shape into a loaf. Wrap in aluminum foil and chill 1 hour or overnight. Poke fork-size holes on both sides of foil. Grill meatloaf in foil package, covered with grill lid, over medium-high heat 10 to 15 minutes on each side or until a meat thermometer inserted into thickest portion registers 155 degrees F. Stir together ketchup and remaining chipotle peppers or chipotle seasoning. Spoon sauce evenly over meatloaf and cover with aluminum foil for 5 minutes to heat through. Serve immediately.
