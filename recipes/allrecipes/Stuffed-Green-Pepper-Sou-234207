Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir bell pepper, onion, and garlic in hot oil until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Break ground beef into small chunks and add to the pot; cook and stir until completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes more. Drain excess fat and return pot to heat. Stir water, tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, ketchup, beef base, brown sugar, salt, and pepper into the beef mixture; bring to a simmer and cook until the flavors marry, about 30 minutes. While the soup simmers, bring water and brown rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes; stir into the soup.
