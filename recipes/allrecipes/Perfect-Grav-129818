Pour drippings (juice and fat) from roasting pan carefully into heatproof measuring cup or fat separator. Let stand until fat rises to the top. Remove 1/4 cup of the fat; return to roasting pan. Discard any remaining fat. Add enough water or broth to remaining drippings to measure 2 cups. Gradually add flour to drippings mixture; stirring constantly with wire whisk until well blended. Return drippings mixture to roasting pan over two burners. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer 5 to 10 min. or until slightly thickened, stirring frequently. Season to taste with pepper; stirring lightly with wire whisk.
