Start with the vegetable stew. Heat the oil in a large saucepan or stockpot over medium-high heat. Add the onions and half of the garlic, and cook until slightly softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in the cumin, chili powder, cinnamon, turmeric, cloves, coriander, and ginger. Cook for a few seconds. Add the tomatoes with their juice, the vegetable broth, pumpkin, sweet potato, celery, carrot, turnip, and green beans. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the vegetables are just tender, about 15-20 minutes. Stir in the zucchini, chickpeas, and remaining garlic. Cook until all of the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Season lightly with salt and pepper if needed. Meanwhile, place the couscous and raisins in a large bowl. Add 1 cup of boiling water and mix well. Soak for 5 minutes. When the vegetables have finished cooking, ladle 2 cups of the hot liquid from the stew over the couscous. Cover and soak for 10 minutes. Cover the pan of vegetables and remove from the heat. To make the harissa sauce, ladle a cup of hot cooking liquid from the vegetables into a bowl, and stir in the ground cumin, chopped cilantro, and lemon juice. Add chili sauce to taste. To serve, reheat the vegetable stew if necessary. Fluff the couscous with a fork, then mound it on a platter or in a large bowl, and sprinkle with the cinnamon and the orange zest. Ladle some of the vegetable stew over the couscous and serve the rest separately. Serve the spicy harissa sauce on the side.
