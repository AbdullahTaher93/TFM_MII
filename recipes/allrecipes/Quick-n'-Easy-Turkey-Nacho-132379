In a large skillet, heat the oil and saute the onion until translucent, about 4-5 minutes. Add the ground turkey and saute, stirring, until meat is browned, about 8 minutes. Stir in taco seasoning and remove from heat. Spoon ground turkey mixture over tortilla chips. Top with sour cream, tomatoes and jalapeno slices and serve.
