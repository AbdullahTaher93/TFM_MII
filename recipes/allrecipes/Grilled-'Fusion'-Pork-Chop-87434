In a bowl, stir together soy sauce, lime juice, garlic, and ginger. Place pork chops in a glass dish. Pour soy sauce mixture over chops. Cover, and refrigerate 2 to 3 hours, turning occasionally. Preheat an outdoor grill for direct heat and lightly oil grate. Place chops on the grill. As they cook, sprinkle with garam masala. Cook about 10 minutes on each side.
