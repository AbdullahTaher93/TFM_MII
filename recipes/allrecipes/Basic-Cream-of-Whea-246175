Bring cold water to a boil in a saucepan; add wheat berries. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover saucepan, and simmer until wheat berries are tender yet firm to the bite, about 30 minutes. Drain. Combine wheat berries and almond milk in a large saucepan over medium; heat just until about to boil, about 5 minutes. Transfer mixture to a blender, working in batches if needed. Blend mixture on high until creamy, adding more milk to reach desired consistency, about 30 seconds.
