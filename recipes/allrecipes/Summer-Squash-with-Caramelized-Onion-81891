In a sauce pan over medium heat, melt the butter and then add the onion slices. Stir well. Let cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the vinegar and cook another 10 minutes. Meanwhile; slice, cube or julienne the squashes (whichever you prefer). Tear or slice the prosciutto into thin strips. Add the squash to the onions. Stir well. Cook for 3-5 minutes, just until heated through but not mushy. Add the cracker pepper and toss in the prosciutto. Serve right away.
