Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook and stir minced garlic, pepper, oregano, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, dried thyme, mustard, marjoram, and basil in hot butter until fragrant, thick, and easy to spread, 2 to 3 minutes. Place pork in a roasting pan. Spread garlic mixture over the top of the roast and season with salt. Pour beer into bottom of the roasting pan and cover pan with aluminum foil. Roast in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and continue to cook for 1 hour. Increase temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) and cook until pork is slightly pink in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove roast to a plate to rest and tent with aluminum foil. Place roasting pan over medium-low heat and whisk flour, garlic salt, and onion powder into the pan drippings. Cook and whisk until gravy thickens, about 5 minutes. Serve roast with gravy.
