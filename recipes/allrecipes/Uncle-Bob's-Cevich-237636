Put swordfish, halibut, and squid in a large, resealable plastic bag; add lime juice and mix to coat seafood with the lime juice, squeeze bag to remove excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 8 hours to overnight. Pour seafood mixture into a large serving bowl. Stir cilantro, bloody mary mix, green olives, black olives, yellow onion, pimento peppers, jalapeno peppers, corn, peas, cumin seeds, and Worcestershire sauce with the seafood mixture. Sprinkle ground cumin over the mixture to cover completely.
