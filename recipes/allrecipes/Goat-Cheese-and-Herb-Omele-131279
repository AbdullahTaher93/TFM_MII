Mix the egg whites, chives, parsley, and tarragon in a medium bowl. Beat lightly with a fork until combined. Spray a small nonstick frying pan and place over medium-high heat. Add egg mixture. Cook about 5 minutes or until set. Sprinkle egg with goat cheese, carefully fold in half, and cook through. Omelet should be very lightly browned. Season. Transfer to a microwave-safe container and let sit 5 to 10 minutes. Cover container. At work, microwave omelet at 30-second intervals on low until warmed through. Eat immediately.
