Season the elk roast with the steak seasoning and sage, and place into a slow cooker along with the onion, garlic, cream of onion soup, and water. Cover, and cook on Low until the elk is easily shredded with a fork, 5 to 7 hours. Stir in the sour cream, and cook 30 minutes more. Shred the meat before serving.
