Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Mist a baking pan with non-stick vegetable spray. Season chicken breasts with Sister's Season Mixture. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until chicken is thoroughly cooked. Reserve 4 tablespoons pan juices. Chill chicken and chop coarsely. In a mixing bowl, gently toss next 7 ingredients together with chicken, adding more mayonnaise if desired. Top each toasted rolls with a small amount of Gruyere and 1 tbsp of chicken salad for Sister Schubert's Parker House Rolls and a bit more for the Sister Schubert's Dinner Rolls. Garnish with toasted almonds.
