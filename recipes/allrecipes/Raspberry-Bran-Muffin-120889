In a bowl, combine the flour, bran, sugar, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, beat egg substitute, milk and oil; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Gently fold in raspberries. Coat muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray or use paper liners; fill two-thirds full with batter. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
