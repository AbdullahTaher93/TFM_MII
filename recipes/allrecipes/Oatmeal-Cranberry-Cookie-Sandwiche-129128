Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Using an electric mixer, beat the granulated sugar with the butter on medium speed until fluffy; beat in the egg and molasses. On low speed, add the flour, cinnamon, cloves, baking powder and salt and mix until blended. Stir in the oats and cranberries. Using your hands, roll a level tablespoon of dough into a ball and place on a baking sheet. Continue rolling the cookies, then press each mound flat with a spatula. Bake the cookies until barely golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool. Meanwhile, beat together the cream cheese, confectioners' sugar and vanilla. Spread the filling on half of the cooled cookies and top with the remaining cookies to form sandwiches.
