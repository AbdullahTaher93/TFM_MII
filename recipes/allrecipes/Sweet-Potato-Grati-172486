Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. With a food processor or a knife, slice potatoes. Lightly oil a 9- by 13-inch baking dish. Place a layer of potatoes in dish. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and jalapeno. Repeat layers until all are used. Pour cream evenly over the top. Bake, uncovered, for 45 minutes. Check, and if top seems dry, baste lightly with cream from around edges. Continue baking for another 15 to 20 minutes until cream around sides is very thick and top is golden. To serve, cut into squares.
