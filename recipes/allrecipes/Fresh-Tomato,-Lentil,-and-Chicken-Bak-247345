Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place an 8x8-inch glass baking dish in the preheating oven to warm briefly. Remove and add coconut oil, 1 teaspoon turmeric, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Stir in lentils. Bake in the preheated oven until lentils are warmed through, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and oregano over tomato slices. Remove lentils from the oven and layer tomato slices and accumulated juices on top. Pour boiling water over tomatoes. Continue baking until tomatoes soften, about 10 minutes. Toss remaining 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, chicken, avocado, Kalamata olives, and macadamia nut oil together in a small bowl. Remove lentils from the oven and spread chicken mixture on top. Return to the oven and bake until flavors combine, about 10 minutes more.
