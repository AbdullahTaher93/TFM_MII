Rinse chicken, pat dry, and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks. Thread chicken, pancetta, and onion alternately on four 12- to 14-inch metal skewers, dividing equally. Thread mushrooms on another 12- to 14-inch metal skewer. In a small bowl, stir together vinegar and oil. Brush foods generously with vinegar mixture. Place skewers on a grill 4 to 6 inches above a solid bed of medium-hot coals (you can hold your hand at grill level for only 3 to 4 seconds) or over medium-high heat on a gas grill. Close lid on gas grill. Cook for 6 minutes, then turn and baste with remaining vinegar mixture; close lid on gas grill again. Continue to cook until mushrooms and onion are browned and chicken is no longer pink in thickest part; cut to test (6 to 8 more minutes). To serve, transfer skewers to a platter. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
