Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Coat custard cups or cups of a popover pan with cooking spray. Place the custard cups on a 15x10x1-inch baking pan; set aside. In a medium mixing bowl beat eggs, LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, and oil with a wire whisk or rotary beater until combined. Add flour and salt; beat until smooth. Fill the prepared cups 1/2 full with batter. Bake for about 40 minutes or until very firm. Immediately after removing from oven, prick each popover with a fork to let steam escape. Turn off the oven. For crisper popovers, return the popovers to the oven for 5 to 10 minutes or until desired crispness is reached. Remove popovers from cups; serve immediately.
