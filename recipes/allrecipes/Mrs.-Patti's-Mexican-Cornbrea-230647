Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a large cast-iron skillet. Whisk cornmeal, baking powder, and salt in a bowl; beat sour cream and eggs into cornmeal mixture until thoroughly combined. Stir cream-style corn, onion, vegetable oil, and jalapeno peppers into batter. Pour half the batter into prepared cast-iron skillet; spread 1 cup Cheddar cheese over batter. Pour in remaining batter and spread remaining 2 cups Cheddar cheese on top. Bake in the preheated oven until set and the cheese topping is melted and browned, about 45 minutes.
