Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add chicken, garlic, chives, oregano, thyme, basil, salt, pepper, and bay leaf; cook and stir until juices run clear, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in 3 cans great Northern beans, water, chopped tomatoes, and salsa. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, about 1 hour. Stir remaining 2 cans great Northern beans and sour cream into the pot. Increase heat to medium-low and simmer until thick, about 25 minutes. Ladle into bowls.
