Heat oil in a large skillet over low heat while preparing vegetables. A couple of minutes from cooking, increase heat to medium-high heat and add onions and green peppers; cook until tender, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add ground beef; cook until beef loses its raw color, about 4 to 5 minutes. Drain off excess fat, if any. Add garlic powder, yellow mustard, ketchup and brown sugar. Bring to a simmer; cook, partially covered, to blend flavors, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and serve.
