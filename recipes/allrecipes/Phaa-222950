Place tomatoes, water, garlic, ginger, tomato puree, salt, ghost peppers, chili powder, garam masala, cumin, coriander, fenugreek, and black pepper into a blender and pulse several times to chop. Blend the ingredients until liquefied. Be careful, ghost chilies will burn eyes, mouth, or nose if touched. Pour the blended mixture into a large bowl and stir in lamb to coat; let lamb marinate at least 1 hour in refrigerator. Heat clarified butter in a large pan over medium-high heat and cook onion until lightly golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes, stirring constantly. Pour the lamb and marinade into the skillet and bring to a boil; cook and stir until sauce begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and simmer until lamb is tender, about 20 more minutes. Garnish with cilantro to serve.
