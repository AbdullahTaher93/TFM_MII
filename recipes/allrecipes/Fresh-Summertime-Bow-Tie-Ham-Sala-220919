Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Toss ham chunks, tomatoes, yellow bell pepper, red bell pepper, orange bell pepper, green onions, garlic, black pepper, and salt together in a bowl. Stir drained bow-tie pasta and mayonnaise into the ham mixture. Sprinkle cilantro and Romano cheese over the pasta mixture; stir to combine. Chill at least 1 hour before serving.
