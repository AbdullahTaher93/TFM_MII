Saute onion and garlic in a stockpot over medium-high heat until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add canned tomatoes, tomato sauce, chili beans, kidney beans, chili powder, cumin, salt, and sugar; pour in 2 cups water and simmer until flavors blend, about 1 hour. Bring 2 cups water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir quinoa into chili.
