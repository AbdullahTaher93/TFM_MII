Heat the oil in a deep fryer or heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). In a bowl, beat together the egg and milk. In a resealable plastic bag, mix the flour, mesquite seasoning, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. Dip the steak pieces in the egg mixture, then place in the plastic bag, seal, and shake to coat. In the hot oil, fry the coated steak pieces in small batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
