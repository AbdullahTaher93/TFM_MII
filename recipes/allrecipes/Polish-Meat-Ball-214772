Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix the onions and celery together in the bottom of a large roasting pan. In a large bowl, thoroughly mix together the veal and pork with your hands; lightly mix in cream of mushroom soup, cracker crumbs, bread crumbs, evaporated milk, eggs, salt, marjoram, onion flakes, and pepper until well combined. Form the mixture into meat balls, dipping your hands in water between making the balls. Place the meat balls gently into the roasting pan on top of the onions and celery; cover the pan with foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour and remove foil. Carefully separate the meat balls where they have stuck together and return the pan to the oven until the meat balls are browned, turning every 15 minutes, 30 to 45 additional minutes.
