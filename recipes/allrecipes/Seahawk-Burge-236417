Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and mushrooms in hot oil until onion begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Season vegetable mixture with salt and pepper; continue to saute until onions and mushrooms brown, about 5 minutes more. Pour the red wine into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook and stir until wine evaporates, about 2 minutes; remove from heat. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Cook burgers until they are firm, hot in the center, and just turning from pink to grey, 8 to 10 minutes per side for medium well. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 150 degrees F (65 degrees C). Whisk mayonnaise, Sriracha sauce, and espresso together in a bowl until aioli is smooth. Spread aioli on each hamburger bun. Place a beef patty on the bottom bun, top with a slice of Monterey Jack cheese, 1/4 the onion-mushroom mixture, 1/4 cup arugula, and cover burger with the top bun. Repeat with remaining burgers.
