Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the bell pepper and black beans, bring to a simmer, then stir in the tomato and jalapeno peppers. Cook and stir until the tomatoes are hot and beginning to soften. To make the wontons: Separate and place the wonton wrappers onto your work surface. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling onto the center of each wrapper. Use your finger or a pastry brush to lightly moisten the edges of the wonton wrappers with water. Fold one corner of the wrapper over the filling onto the opposite corner to form a triangle. Press the edges together to seal. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry the poppers a few at a time until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate, and serve within 15 minutes.
