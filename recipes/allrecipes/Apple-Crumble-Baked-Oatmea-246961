Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch glass baking dish with butter. Spread apples evenly on the bottom of the baking dish. Mix oats, walnuts, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Spread over apples in the baking dish. Combine milk, honey, coconut oil, vanilla extract, and olive oil in another bowl. Pour evenly over oat mixture; do not stir. Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden, 30 to 45 minutes. Cool in the baking dish before serving, about 30 minutes.
