Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan and set aside. Cream together the shortening and sugar. Add eggs and vanilla; beat until fluffy. Sift together the flour, oatmeal, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. Add dry ingredients alternately with bananas and milk. Mix until blended. Fold in raisins and pour into prepared pan. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes; remove from oven and cover for 5 minutes.
