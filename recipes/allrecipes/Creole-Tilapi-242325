Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Layer bell peppers, tomatoes, onion, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, and garlic in a baking dish. Drizzle olive oil over mixture; add juice from 1 lime and mix well. Arrange fish fillets over mixture and season with Creole seasoning. Sprinkle Mexican cheese blend over fish and add remaining lime juice. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 40 minutes.
