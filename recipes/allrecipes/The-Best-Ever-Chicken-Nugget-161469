Heat 1 inch oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a large skillet or saucepan. Stir together the flour, garlic salt, and pepper in a bowl. Dip the chicken pieces individually into the beaten eggs before pressing into the flour mixture to coat; shake off the excess flour. Place the coated chicken pieces onto a plate until all the chicken has been coated. Cook the chicken in batches in the hot oil until golden brown and no longer pink in the center.
