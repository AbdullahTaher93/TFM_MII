Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x4-inch loaf pan. Combine 1 cup sugar and butter in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in eggs and vanilla extract. Mix in flour and allspice gradually until batter is blended. Fold in bananas and banana-flavored yogurt. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan. Mix 3 tablespoons sugar and cloves together in a small bowl; sprinkle over batter. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
