Whisk canola oil, vinegar, honey, soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger and salt in a bowl. Place tofu and 2 tablespoons of the dressing in a large nonstick skillet. Cook over medium-high heat, turning every 2 to 3 minutes, until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes total. Remove from the heat, add 1 tablespoon of the dressing to the pan and stir to coat. Toss greens, carrots and cucumber with the remaining dressing. Serve immediately, topped with the warm tofu.
