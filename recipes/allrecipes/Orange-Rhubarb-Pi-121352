In a large bowl, combine the first eight ingredients. Let mixture stand for 30 minutes. Line a 9-in. pie plate with bottom pastry; trim even with edge of plate. Pour filling into crust; dot with butter. Roll out remaining pastry to fit top of pie; place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edges; cut slits in top. Brush milk over pastry; sprinkle with sugar. Cover edges loosely with foil. Bake at 400 degrees F for 30 minutes. Remove oil; bake 5 minutes longer or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool on a wire rack.
