Place steak in a large roasting pan. Coat completely with dressing. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator 2 hours or up to 8 hours, turning occasionally Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Uncover the pan and roast steak in the oven 35 to 40 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted in the center registers 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) for medium-rare. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with black pepper. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing.
