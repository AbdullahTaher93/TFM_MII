Place chicken and water in a Dutch oven or soup kettle; bring to a boil. Skim fat. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 2 hours or until chicken is tender. Remove chicken; allow to cool. Add enough water to broth to measure 3 qts. Remove chicken from bones; cut into bite-size pieces and return to pan. Add remaining ingredients; cover and simmer for 10 minutes or until vegetables are tender. If desired, pour into 1-pint freezer containers and freeze for future use.
