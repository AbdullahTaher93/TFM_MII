Place meat on a solid, level surface, or between sheets of waxed paper, and pound thinly with a mallet or moistened cleaver, using a glancing motion. In shallow dish, combine flour and seasoning salt. Dredge cutlets in flour mixture, and let rest 15 minutes on wire rack. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt butter with oil. Cook floured cutlets on both sides until brown. Introduce mushrooms, reduce heat to low, cover and cook 10 minutes. Pour in Marsala and simmer 5 minutes more, until veal is tender and sauce is hot. Serve immediately.
