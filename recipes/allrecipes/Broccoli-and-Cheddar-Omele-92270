Stem and seed bell pepper; cut into 1/4-inch strips. Cut off broccoli florets; slice lengthwise. Thinly slice stems lengthwise. In a 9- to 10-inch ovenproof, nonstick frying pan, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add bell pepper, broccoli stems, and 1 tablespoon water. Stir often until stems are tender when pierced and liquid has evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add florets and 1 tablespoon water; stir just until florets turn bright green but are still crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour vegetables into a bowl and keep warm. In a medium bowl, beat eggs to blend. Pour into frying pan used to cook vegetable mixture. Cook on medium-low heat until eggs on bottom begin to set; push aside or lift cooked egg to let liquid egg flow to pan bottom. Repeat until eggs are set but still creamy looking on top, about 7 minutes total. Cover omelet with half the cheese. Add vegetable mixture and tomatoes; sprinkle with remaining cheese. Broil omelet 6 inches from heat until cheese melts, about 3 minutes. Add salt and hot chili flakes to taste. Cut into wedges or scoop from pan.
