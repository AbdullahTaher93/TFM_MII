In a Dutch oven, saute the long grain rice, onion, carrots and raisins in butter until onion is tender. Add the broth and onion salt; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender. Stir in peas, wild rice and cashews; heat through. Sprinkle with green onions if desired.
