Grease an 8- x 8-inch pan with vegetable cooking spray. Butter sides of a heavy 2-quart saucepan; add SPLENDA(r) Sugar Blend, brown sugar, half and half, and milk. Cook over medium-high heat until mixture comes to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring frequently, until candy thermometer reaches 236 degrees or soft ball stage (about 15 to 20 minutes). Remove from heat. Add butter and vanilla; do not stir. Cool, without stirring, until mixture reaches 110 degrees (about 50 minutes). Add pecans; beat with a wooden spoon or with a mixer fitted with paddle attachment until mixture thickens and just begins to lose its gloss. Quickly pour into prepared pan and spread evenly. Score in squares and cool completely; cut when firm,
