Preheat greased grill to medium-high heat. Mix meat, 3 tablespoons of the mayo and the seasoning mix; shape into 12 thin patties. Combine cheese and 2 tablespoons of the salsa; spoon over 6 of the patties. Cover each with one of the remaining patties; pinch edges together to seal. Grill 7 minutes on each side or until cooked through (160 degrees F). Meanwhile, combine remaining 2 tablespoons salsa and remaining 1 tablespoon mayo. Place lettuce, tomatoes and burgers on bottom halves of buns; top with salsa mixture. Cover with tops of buns.
