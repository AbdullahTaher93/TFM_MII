In a 3- to 4-quart saucepan over medium heat, bring apple cider and beet to a boil. Cover and simmer until beet is tender, stirring occasionally, 40 to 45 minutes. Add apples, cider vinegar, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla. Simmer uncovered until apples and beet are very tender, about 25 minutes. Pure mixture in food processor until chunky. Refrigerate, covered, until chilled, about 2 hours.
