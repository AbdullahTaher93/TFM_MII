Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place 2 bread slices in a food processor; process 30 seconds or until crumbs are fine. Combine the breadcrumbs, beef, and next 8 ingredients (beef through egg) in a bowl. Shape mixture into 24 (1-inch) meatballs. Place meatballs on a broiler pan coated with cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees for 17 minutes or until browned. Combine 1 bread slice, almonds, and next 6 ingredients (almonds through garlic) in a food processor, and process until smooth. Spoon mixture into a skillet; add broth, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add meatballs; reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Sprinkle with parsley, if desired.
