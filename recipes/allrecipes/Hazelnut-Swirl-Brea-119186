In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the milk, potato flakes, shortening, sugar, eggs, salt, whole wheat flour and 1 cup all-purpose flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining all-purpose flour to form a stiff dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Roll each portion into a 14-in. x 9-in. rectangle. For filling, in a small mixing bowl, beat butter, brown sugar and egg yolks until creamy. Add milk and vanilla; mix well. Stir in hazelnuts. Spread over dough to within 1/2 in. of edges. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a short side; pinch seams to seal. Place seam side down in two greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15 minutes. Cover with foil. Bake 20-25 minutes longer or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
