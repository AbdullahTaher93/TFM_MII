Combine sea salt, red pepper flakes, black pepper, granulated garlic, and chili powder in a plastic container with lid. Seal container and shake until seasonings are well mixed. Rub entire batch of spice mixture over turkey breast to coat completely; wrap breast in aluminum foil and refrigerate for 24 hours. Remove breast from fridge and let stand at room temperature as you heat the oil. Heat oil in a pot with a lid and large enough to hold the oil and breast to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Gently add breast to the oil, cover pot with lid, and fry until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
