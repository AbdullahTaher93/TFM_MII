Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat and brown the chicken thighs on both sides, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Remove the chicken thighs and set aside. In the hot skillet, cook and stir the onions until softened, about 5 minutes. Pour the apricot halves, chili sauce, brown sugar, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, and black pepper into a blender, and pulse several times to puree. Pour the mixture into the skillet with the onions, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to a simmer. Simmer the sauce until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Return the chicken thighs to the sauce, and spoon sauce over the chicken. Simmer until the chicken is tender and no longer pink inside, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve chicken topped with sauce.
