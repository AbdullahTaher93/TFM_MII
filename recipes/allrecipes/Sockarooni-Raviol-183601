Season a large pot of water with 2 to 3 tablespoons salt and begin to bring to boil. In a medium skillet, heat olive oil and add the onions and garlic. Cook until soft. Add the Italian sausage and brown. While browning break the sausage into uniform pieces. When done drain the meat and add the Sockarooni sauce. Simmer the sauce and begin the raviolis. Begin by squeezing the water out of the spinach. In a bowl, mix the spinach, ricotta, egg, and parmesan cheese. Cut the egg roll wrappers in half and in half again so you have 4 equal squares. Working in batches of four, place a rounded teaspoon of ricotta mixture on each wrapper. Using your finger or a small pastry brush, wet all four sides of the wrapper with water. Place another wrapper on top and seal the edges. Try to press out any air pockets. Place the ravioli on a cookie sheet and cover with a slightly damp towel. Repeat with the remaining egg roll wrappers. Place 6 to 8 ravioli in the boiling water and cook 2 to 3 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Use a slotted spoon to remove them from the water and place in a serving dish. Cook remaining raviolis. Top with Sockarooni sauce and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese.
