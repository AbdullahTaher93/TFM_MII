Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook until soft. Stir in flour, salt and pepper and cook briefly. Whisk in chicken broth and LACTAID(R) Milk, stirring until you reach a simmer. Add the vegetables and cook until they become slightly soft, stirring frequently for about 10 minutes. Add chicken and set aside. Unroll 1 pie crust and place in a 9-inch glass pie pan. Pour mixture into crust-lined pan. Top with the second crust and seal edges. Cut several slits into the top of the dough with a sharp knife. Place foil around the outer crust to prevent burning. Bake for 45 minutes. Remove foil from edges and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Allow pie to rest for at least 10 minutes before serving.
