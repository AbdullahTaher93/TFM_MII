Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Rinse potatoes with cool water. Place on a baking sheet and drizzle with oil and 1 tablespoon salt. Bake for 45 minutes or until fork tender. Cut a 3-inch slit in top of each potato and scoop insides into a medium-sized bowl, reserve skins. Mash together with spinach, dried cranberries, pepper and remaining salt. Divide mixture into four portions and spoon into reserved skins. Top with crumbled goat cheese and bake for 10 minutes or until cheese has melted.
