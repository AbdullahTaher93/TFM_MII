Cut beef into 1-inch cubes. Melt shortening in Dutch oven. Cook beef in shortening over medium heat until brown; remove. Cook onions and mushrooms in Dutch oven, stirring occasionally, until onions are tender, adding shortening if necessary. Remove mushrooms and onions; cover and refrigerate. Return beef to Dutch oven; sprinkle with flour, salt, marjoram, thyme and pepper. Stir in bouillon and Burgundy. Heat to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer about 1 1/4 hours or until beef is tender. (Liquid should just cover beef.) If necessary, stir in additional bouillon and Burgundy (1 part bouillon to 2 parts Burgundy). Add mushrooms and onions; heat through, stirring occasionally.
