Generously butter a 22 X 30 cm (9 X 12 in) baking dish.* In a bowl, gently combine the croissant pieces, both salmons and the Evanjules. Spread evenly in the bottom of the prepared dish. In a bowl, beat together the milk, sour cream and eggs by hand for 1 minute. Add the onion, capers, dill, salt and pepper. Pour over the salmon mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 12 hours. Remove from the refrigerator and place on the counter for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C (350 degrees F). Bake in the middle of the oven for 45 minutes or until the mixture is nicely puffed and well browned and the eggs are cooked. Serve with lemon wedges.
