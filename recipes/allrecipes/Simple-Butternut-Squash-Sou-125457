In a large saucepan, combine squash and broth, bring to a boil, and then reduce heat to medium. Simmer until squash is very tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand until slightly cooled; puree in batches in blender. Return puree to sauce pan and place over medium-low heat. Stir in sour cream cheddar cheese, butter, fresh chives and fresh Italian herbs. Season with salt and pepper. Stir until heated through. Add sugar to taste sprinkle with chives.
