Heat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cook chicken, onions, garlic and seasonings in large skillet on medium-high heat 7 to 9 minutes or until chicken is done, stirring occasionally. Cut tops off peppers; chop tops, then stir into chicken mixture along with the tomatoes and beans. Cook 5 to 6 minutes or until slightly thickened, stirring frequently. Meanwhile, remove cores and seeds from pepper shells; stand, fill sides up, in shallow pan. Spoon chicken mixture into peppers. Add enough water to pan to fill to 1/2-inch depth around peppers; cover. Bake 40 minutes. Carefully remove peppers from pan; drain water. Return peppers to pan. Top with cheese; bake 5 minutes or until melted.
