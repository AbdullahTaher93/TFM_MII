To Make the Streusel: In a small bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Stir with a fork until no lumps remain. Add the butter or margarine. Press with the fork to work into the dry ingredients. Add the orange juice concentrate and almonds. Toss until coarse crumbs form. Set aside. To Make the Cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch (23-cm) round cake pan with nonstick spray. Line the bottom with a round of waxed paper. Coat lightly with nonstick spray. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, 1/2 cup (125 mL) of the sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In another medium bowl, combine the butter or margarine and the remaining 1/2 cup (125 mL) sugar. With an electric mixer on medium speed, beat until creamy. Add the egg, egg white, and vanilla extract. Beat until smooth. Add the flour mixture and the sour cream alternately to the batter, beating on low speed just until blended. Spread half of the batter into the prepared cake pan. Sprinkle evenly with one-third of the streusel. Sprinkle evenly with the remaining batter. Sprinkle with the cranberries and the remaining streusel. Bake for 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cook in the pan on a rack for 5 minutes. Run a knife around the sides of the pan. Turn onto the rack. Remove and discard the waxed paper. Place a plate on the cake and turn it right side up.
