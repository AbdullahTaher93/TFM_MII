Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Use a sharp knife to poke 3 to 5 holes into the pork roast. Stuff about half the garlic into the holes. Cook roast in hot oil to brown completely, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer roast to the crock of a slow cooker. Blend orange juice, lime juice, remaining garlic, cumin, salt, and oregano in a blender until smooth; pour over the pork. Leave the pork marinating in the orange juice mixture for 10 minutes; turn roast and let other side marinate for 10 minutes. Turn slow cooker to Low and cook for 8 hours. Remove pork to a cutting board. Shred meat using 2 forks. Drain liquid from the slow cooker crock, reserving 1 cup. Return shredded pork to the slow cooker crock, pour reserved liquid over the meat and stir. Look on Low until the meat is again hot, 15 to 20 minutes.
