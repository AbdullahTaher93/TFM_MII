Split and toast the ciabatta rolls. Mix together the cooked chicken breast, salad dressing, Dijon mustard, onion, lime juice, cilantro, cayenne pepper, and salt and pepper in a bowl. Cover, and refrigerate at least 15 minutes to chill the salad and blend the flavors. Place a slice of Swiss cheese onto the bottom slice of each roll, and spoon half the chicken salad per sandwich onto the cheese. Place the top halves of the rolls onto the sandwiches, and serve.
