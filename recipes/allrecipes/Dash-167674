Place 6 cups water in a large saucepan over high heat. Add kelp and bring to a boil. Immediately remove kelp with tongs (if it boils it can turn the broth bitter), reserving it for Second Dashi. Add the remaining 1/2 cup cold water (to cool the broth), then add bonito flakes. Return to a boil, then immediately turn off heat (if boiled, bonito can also turn the broth bitter). Let the broth rest for 2 minutes, then pour through a cheesecloth-lined sieve, making sure to avoid pressing down on the solids (which will turn dashi cloudy). Save the used fish flakes for Second Dashi.
