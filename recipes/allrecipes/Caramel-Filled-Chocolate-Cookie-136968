In medium bowl, combine flour, cocoa and baking soda; mix well. In large bowl, combine 1 cup sugar, brown sugar and margarine; beat until light and fluffy. Add vanilla and eggs; beat well. Add flour mixture; blend well. Stir in 1/2 cup of the pecans. If necessary, cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate 30 minutes for easier handling. Heat oven to 375 degrees F. For each cookie, with floured hands, shape about 1 tablespoon dough around 1 caramel candy, covering completely. In small bowl, combine remaining 1/2 cup pecans and 1 tablespoon sugar. Press one side of each ball into pecan mixture. Place, nut side up, 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 7 to 10 minutes or until set and slightly cracked. Cool 2 minutes; remove from cookie sheets. Cool on wire rack for 15 minutes or until completely cooled. Melt candy coating in small saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly until smooth. Drizzle over cookies.
