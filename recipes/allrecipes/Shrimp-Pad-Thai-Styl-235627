Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp and cook for 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the shrimp from the skillet. Add the onion and red pepper to the skillet and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the tofu and cook and stir for 3 minutes. Stir in 1 3/4 cups broth and the sugar and heat to a boil. Stir the remaining broth and cornstarch in a small bowl until the mixture is smooth. Add the cornstarch mixture, shrimp, rice noodles and bean sprouts to the skillet. Cook and stir for 2 minutes or until the mixture boils and thickens and the shrimp are cooked through. Serve with the cilantro, peanuts and lime wedges, if desired.
