Bring water and butter to a boil in a saucepan; remove from heat. Add couscous and stir well. Cover saucepan and let couscous sit until water is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir cannellini beans, kale, and garlic in the hot oil until kale is wilted, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix kale mixture into couscous; fold in almonds. Spoon couscous mixture into 4 serving bowls; top with Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and black pepper.
