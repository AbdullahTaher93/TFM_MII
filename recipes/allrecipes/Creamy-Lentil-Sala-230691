Bring water and lentils to a boil in a saucepan; cook until lentils are tender, 15 to 25 minutes. Drain and transfer cooked lentils to a large bowl. Mix cucumber, yellow bell pepper, cilantro, olive oil, feta cheese, dill, sea salt, and black pepper into lentils until fully incorporated. Refrigerate until completely cooled.
