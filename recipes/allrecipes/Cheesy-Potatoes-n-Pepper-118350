In a large skillet, saute onion in butter until tender. Whisk in flour, salt and pepper until blended. Gradually add milk. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Cook and stir for 2 minutes or until sauce is thickened. Remove from the heat. Stir in cheese until smooth. Place half of the potatoes in two greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dishes. Pour half of sauce over potatoes. Top with half to two-thirds of peppers and remaining potatoes. Pour remaining sauce over potatoes. Sprinkle with remaining peppers. Cover; bake at 350 degrees F for 1-1/4 hours. Uncover and bake 10-15 minutes longer or until potatoes are tender and sauce is thickened.
