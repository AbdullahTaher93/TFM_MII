Rinse and drain the chickpeas, then let dry on paper towels. Place the chickpeas in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and toast, shaking the pan occasionally, until golden, about 15 minutes. Add the cheese and pepper and shake the pan to evenly coat the chickpeas. Remove from the heat and continue shaking the pan until the cheese is golden and sticks to the chickpeas.
