Heat the oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and carrots and cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes, or until tender. Add half of the escarole; cook, stirring, for 2 minutes, or until the escarole is wilted. Add the remaining escarole and the pepper; cook, stirring, for 2 minutes, or until wilted. Add the broth, 2 1/2 cups of the water, the broccoli, and chickpeas. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 8 minutes, or until the broccoli is tender. In a small bowl, using a fork, stir together the eggs, cheese, and the remaining 1/4 cup water. Slowly pour into the soup and stir briskly with the fork to create fine threads.
