Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut the boneless, skinless chicken parts into bite sized pieces. In a non stick frying pan, brown the chicken in batches and transfer to a lightly greased casserole dish (you don't need to cook the chicken completely through at this step). Arrange the chicken into an even layer. (You can minimize this step by using precooked or leftover chicken but then remember to reduce the cooking time to 20 minutes). Sprinkle over the chicken the chopped artichoke bottoms and scallions. In a sauce pan over medium-high heat, melt the butter and saute the celery for a minute or so. Add the white wine and let it boil for a full minute. Reduce heat to medium heat. Add the cream, Cheddar, Jack and mozzarella cheeses and the thyme. If you want it spicy then add the Tabasco sauce at this time too. Stir constantly until the cheeses melt. Pour cheese sauce over chicken, top with the Parmesan cheese and bake for 35 minutes, uncovered.
