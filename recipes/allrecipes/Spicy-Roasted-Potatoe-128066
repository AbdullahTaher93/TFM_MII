In a medium bowl, make a smooth paste with the mustard, oil, garlic, tarragon, paprika, and red pepper. Cut the potatoes into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces. Pat dry with paper towels. Add the potatoes to the bowl and toss. Coat a baking sheet with nonstick spray. Add the potatoes in a single layer. Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) until tender, 30 to 35 minutes.
