Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Coat a 12-muffin tin with cooking spray. Finely chop frozen cherries. Place chopped cherries in a small bowl and toss with 2 teaspoons flour. Do not thaw frozen chopped cherries. Place cherries in freezer until needed. In a medium bowl, stir together 1 3/4 cups flour, the Splenda(R), baking powder, and salt. Set aside. In another small bowl, stir together milk, egg product, butter, 1 tablespoon lime peel, and 1 tablespoon lime juice. Make a well in center of flour mixture and pour in milk mixture. Stir just until flour mixture is partially moistened. Add frozen chopped cherries and stir just until moistened. (Do not over mix.) Divide batter equally between the 12 muffin cups. Bake at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes, or until golden brown and wooden toothpick inserted into center comes out clean. Cool muffins in pan for 5 minutes. Remove muffins from pan and slightly cool on wire rack. In a small bowl, stir together powdered sugar, 1/2 teaspoon lime peel, and enough of the lime juice to make glaze a drizzling consistency. Drizzle glaze over muffins and serve muffins slightly warm.
