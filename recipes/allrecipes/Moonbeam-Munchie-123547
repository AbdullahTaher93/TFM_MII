In a mixing bowl, cream sugar and shortening. Add egg and extract. Combine flour, baking soda and salt; add to the creamed mixture alternately with sour milk. Mix well. Refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with a round cookie cutter. If desired, cut some circles in half and form into half moon shapes. Place on greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until the edges begin to brown. Remove to wire racks to cool. Combine water and food coloring; brush over cooled cookies. Allow to dry completely. Store in airtight containers.
