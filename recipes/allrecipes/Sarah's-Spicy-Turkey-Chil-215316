Heat the olive oil in a skillet. Brown the turkey meat, breaking it up into crumbles as it cooks, then stir in onion and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the turkey is no longer pink, about 8 minutes. Sprinkle on 1 tablespoon of chili powder, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1 teaspoon of black pepper; stir to combine, and continue cooking until the meat is browned, about 5 more minutes. Pour in the beer, and cook until the beer is reduced by about half. Pour the diced tomatoes with chile peppers, stewed tomatoes, kidney beans, 1 more tablespoon of chili powder, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, oregano, and cumin into a slow cooker. Stir in the turkey mixture and chicken broth. Set the cooker to High, and cook for 2 hours.
