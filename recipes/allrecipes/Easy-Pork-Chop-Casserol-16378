Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, combine the mushroom soup, onion soup mix, water and mushrooms. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown the pork chops on each side. Transfer chops to a 9x9 inch baking dish, and cover with the mushroom soup mixture. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours, or until internal pork temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
