Melt butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Cook chicken breasts, turning occasionally and reducing heat when necessary, 5 minutes per side, or until no longer pink in center and juices run clear. Add thyme, rosemary, garlic, black and green olives, mushrooms, pearl onions, and chicken stock to the skillet. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes, or until chicken is to desired tenderness. Stir in potatoes, peas, and wine. Cover and continue simmering another 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until potatoes are tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve.
