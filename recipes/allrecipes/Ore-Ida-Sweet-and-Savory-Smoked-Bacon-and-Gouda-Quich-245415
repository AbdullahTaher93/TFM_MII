Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, mix sour cream, half-and-half, eggs, salt and pepper. Once blended well, fold in potatoes, bacon, and Gouda. Spoon egg mixture evenly in each pie crust. Top off quiches with more bacon and cheese (optional). Place pie shells on cookie sheet and bake in oven for 40-45 min or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. Let rest for at least 10 minutes. Cut into sections and serve.
