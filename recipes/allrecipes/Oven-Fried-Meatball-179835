In a large bowl, mix bulgur with boiling water. Let stand until grains are tender to bite (about 10 minutes). Meanwhile, place ground beef in another large bowl with onion, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper. Drain bulgur; add to meat mixture. Mix well and shape into 15 meatballs, using about 1/4 cup mixture for each. Space meatballs apart in a lightly oiled 10- by 15-inch rimmed baking pan. Bake in a 425 degree oven until meatballs are well browned, 25 to 30 minutes.
