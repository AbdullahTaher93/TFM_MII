Steam carrots until tender. In a blender or food processor, combine cooked carrots and 3/4 cup broth. Blend until smooth. Set aside. In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Stir in flour, parsley, basil, and ground red pepper. Add half-and-half cream all at once. Cook and stir until slightly thickened and bubbly. Stir in carrot mixture and remaining broth. Season with salt and black pepper. Thin with milk or water if needed.
