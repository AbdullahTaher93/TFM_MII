Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 13x9-inch pan with cooking spray. Cut cookie dough in half crosswise. Cut each section in half lengthwise. With floured fingers, press dough evenly in bottom of pan to form crust. Bake 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in medium bowl, mix condensed milk, peanut butter, vanilla and egg yolks until smooth. Spoon milk mixture evenly over partially baked crust; carefully spread. Bake 20 to 25 minutes longer or until set. Sprinkle with chocolate chips; let stand 3 minutes to soften. Spread chocolate evenly over top. Cool completely, about 1 1/2 hours. Refrigerate 30 minutes to set chocolate. For bars, cut into 6 rows by 6 rows.
