In a small mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, butter, chives and horseradish until combined. Cut the bread into 1-in. slices to within 1/2 in. of bottom. Spread cream cheese mixture between slices. Wrap the loaf in a large piece of heavy-duty foil (about 28 in. x 18 in.). Bake at 400 degrees F for 14-17 minutes or until heated through.
