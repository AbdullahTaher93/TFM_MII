In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, rosemary, lime juice, and jalapeno jelly in a bowl, and whisk together. Place the pork chops and marinade in a resealable plastic bag. Remove the air from the bag, and seal; refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight. Preheat your grill for high heat, or preheat broiler. Remove the chops from the marinade, and season with salt and pepper. Place the chops 2 to 3 inches above the white coals, or under the broiler. Cook the meat on both sides until done, turning frequently so the marinade doesn't burn.
