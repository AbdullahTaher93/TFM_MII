Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place pork roast in a large roasting pan. Season with salt and black pepper. Mix sauerkraut, water, onion, and apple together in a large bowl. Pour sauerkraut mixture over roast. Bake roast in the preheated oven until heated through, about 1 hour. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Continue to cook roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), adding water if sauerkraut mixture looks dry, about 2 hours more. Remove roast from oven and allow to rest in a warm area before slicing, about 10 minutes.
