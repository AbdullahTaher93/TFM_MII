Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9-inch square baking pan and set aside. Scrub the potato clean and cut into a 1/2-inch pieces. In a medium saucepan, cover potato cubes with cold salted water and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until the potatoes are barely tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain in a colander. In a large bowl, combine the potato cubes with Mann's Broccoli Cole Slaw, the mashed potatoes and turkey ham, stirring to mix well. Turn mixture into the prepared pan and top with cheese. Cover with foil and bake until heated through, about 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake until the top is lightly browned, about 5 minutes longer.
