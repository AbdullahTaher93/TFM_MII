Season the shrimp with 1/2 teaspoon each of garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Sprinkle shrimp with lemon juice, then roll in grated Parmesan, if using. Shake the remaining garlic powder, salt, and pepper together with flour in a plastic bag. Add seasoned shrimp to bag; close the bag and shake to coat shrimp. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and fry until golden and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Remove to paper towels to drain; serve hot.
