Combine sweet potatoes and beef broth in a pot; cook over medium-high heat until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Mash sweet potatoes into the broth using a potato masher. Mix coconut milk, shallot, maple syrup, curry powder, sea salt, chili powder, and paprika into sweet potato mixture; cook and stir until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and blend soup with a hand blender until smooth.
