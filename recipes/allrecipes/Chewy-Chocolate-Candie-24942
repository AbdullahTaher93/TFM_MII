In a medium mixing bowl, stir together butter and chocolate. Beat in corn syrup, 2 cups of confectioner's sugar, powdered milk and vanilla. Dough will be stiff. Sprinkle a work surface with the remaining 1 cup confectioners' sugar. Turn dough out onto work surface and knead until remaining sugar is incorporated. Shape into small logs and wrap in waxed paper.
