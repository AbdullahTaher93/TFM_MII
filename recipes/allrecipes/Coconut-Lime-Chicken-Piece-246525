Slice chicken breasts in half horizontally, then cut into thin strips. Place chicken strips in a bowl; stir in lime juice to marinate at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours. Place 1/4 cup honey into a bowl; whisk coconut and flour together in another bowl. Dip chicken strips into honey to coat; roll chicken through flour mixture to coat. Discard excess honey and coconut mixture. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; fry chicken pieces until browned, crisp, no longer pink at the center, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle with lime zest.
