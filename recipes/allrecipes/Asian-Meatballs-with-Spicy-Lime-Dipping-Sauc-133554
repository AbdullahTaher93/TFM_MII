In the bowl of a food processor, combine the scallions, half of the ginger, the bell pepper, half of the chile pepper, the garlic, the 3 tablespoons of soy sauce, the cilantro leaves and the lime zest. Pulse for 30 seconds, scrape down the bowl and process 1 minute more, or until finely ground. Add the meat and process until well combined, about 30 seconds more. Roll the meat into 24 balls the size of walnuts. Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and add the vegetable oil. Add the meatballs and don't move them until they are brown on 1 side, about 2 minutes. Turn the meatballs and continue to cook, browning them on all sides, until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more. While the meatballs cook, make the dipping sauce. In a bowl, combine the remaining ginger and chile pepper, the 1/3 cup of soy sauce, the lime juice, the sesame oil, the honey and a splash of water. Taste and adjust the seasoning; if it's too salty, add another drizzle of honey. Place the finished meatballs on a serving platter, with toothpicks on the side. Serve with the spicy lime dipping sauce.
