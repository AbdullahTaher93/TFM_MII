Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp and cook for 4 minutes, stirring often. Remove the shrimp from the skillet. Heat the remaining oil in the skillet. Add the crushed red pepper, broccoli and red pepper strips. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add 1 1/4 cups broth and heat to a boil. Stir the remaining broth and the cornstarch in a small bowl until the mixture is smooth. Add the cornstarch mixture and the shrimp to the skillet and cook and stir for 2 minutes or until the mixture boils and thickens and the shrimp are cooked through. Serve the shrimp mixture over the rice.
