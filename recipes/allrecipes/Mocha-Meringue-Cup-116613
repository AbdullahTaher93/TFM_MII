In a small mixing bowl, beat the egg whites, cream of tartar and salt on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, on high until stiff peaks form. Spoon meringue into eight mounds on parchment-lined baking sheets. Shape into 3-in. cups with the back of a spoon. Bake at 275 degrees F for 45-50 minutes. Turn oven off; leave meringues in oven for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and cool on baking sheet. When completely cooled, remove meringues from the paper and store in an airtight container at room temperature. For filling, in a heavy saucepan, melt the chocolate chips, cream and coffee granules; stir until smooth. Remove from the heat; stir in vanilla. Transfer to a small mixing bowl; refrigerate until chilled. Beat until stiff peaks form. Immediately spoon into a pastry bag or plastic bag with a #20 star tip. Pipe filling into meringue cups. Refrigerate until serving.
