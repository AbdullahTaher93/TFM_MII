Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a muffin pan, or use paper liners. In a large bowl, mix together all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder and salt. Make a well in the center, and pour in applesauce, milk, and oil. Stir until moistened. Fold in dried blueberries. Fill muffin cups 3/4 full. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
