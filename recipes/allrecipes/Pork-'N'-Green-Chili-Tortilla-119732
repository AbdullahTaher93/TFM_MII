In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the flour, salt and pepper. Add pork cubes and shake to coat. In a large saucepan or skillet, cook pork in oil over medium heat until no longer pink. Add the chilies and salsa. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 30 minutes or until meat is tender. Spoon 1/2 cup onto each tortilla; sprinkle with cheese and roll up.
