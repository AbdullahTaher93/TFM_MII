Clean the taro leaves by removing the skin from the stalks, and removing the tip from the center rib. Rinse, and cut into bite size pieces. Place the taro leaves, okra, onion, thyme, garlic, salted pig's tail, pumpkin, water, habanero pepper (whole), and coconut milk into a large pot. Cover, and simmer over low heat for 30 minutes. Add the crab to the pot. Be careful not to puncture the habanero pepper. Cover, and continue to simmer for 30 minutes. Remove the habanero, and season with salt to taste. Puree the soup using an immersion blender until smooth. You could also puree in small batches using a blender. Serve over rice.
