Important: have diet margarine at room temperature. Sift flour, salt, and baking powder together in a deep bowl. Add margarine all at once. Cut in with fork or pastry blender and continue mixing until no pastry sticks to the sides of the bowl. Shape into a ball and wrap in wax paper. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled (one hour or more).
