In a large frying pan, melt the butter over moderately low heat. Add the onion and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion starts to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in the curry powder and cook for 1 minute. Transfer the onion mixture to a blender and add the tomato paste, broth, and cream. Puree until smooth. Return the sauce to the pan. Bring the curry sauce just to a simmer. Stir in the spinach and scallops. Simmer, covered, until the scallops are just done, 5 to 7 minutes.
