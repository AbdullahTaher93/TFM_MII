In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in water. In a mixing bowl, beat egg and oil. Add cornmeal, sugar, chili powder, salt, yeast mixture and 2 cups flour; mix well. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl; turn once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down; divide in half. Roll each portion into a 12-in. circle. Cut into 12 wedges. Roll up each wedge, starting with wide end. Place on greased baking sheet; curve into a crescent shape. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for about 20 minutes or until browned. Cool on wire racks.
