Combine flour and seasoned salt in a wide, shallow dish. Coat the chicken breasts in the seasoned flour. Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown chicken in the butter, about 3 minutes on each side. Transfer chicken to a plate and tent with foil. Combine the onions, mushrooms, and apples in the skillet. Cook and stir until the apples are just tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the brandy, thyme, salt, and pepper; bring to a simmer. Return chicken to the pan; cook, uncovered, about 10 minutes. Stir in cream, and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes.
