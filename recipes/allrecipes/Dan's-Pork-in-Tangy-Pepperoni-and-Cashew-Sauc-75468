Heat the oil in a wok over medium-high heat, and evenly brown the pork chops. Set aside. Mix the garlic, onion, and green pepper into the wok, and cook until tender. Stir in the chicken broth, wine, and tomato paste. Mix in Worcestershire sauce, thyme, parsley, salt, and pepper. Cook until heated through, then stir in pepperoni. Return chops to wok. Cover wok, and continue cooking 15 minutes over medium heat, until sauce has thickened and pork chops are cooked to desired doneness. Mix in the tomato and cashews, and cook until heated through. Scoop sauce over chops and garnish with basil sprigs to serve.
