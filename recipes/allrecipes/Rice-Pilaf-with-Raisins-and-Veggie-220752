Bring chicken broth to boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat; continue simmering while preparing remaining ingredients. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir celery, onion, green onion white portions, garlic, curry powder, and salt in the hot oil until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables to a bowl. Cook and stir rice in the same skillet until lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Stir toasted rice into boiling chicken broth. Reduce heat to medium-low; continue simmering until rice is tender and broth is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove rice from heat and stir in raisins, green onion tops, and celery mixture until well blended.
