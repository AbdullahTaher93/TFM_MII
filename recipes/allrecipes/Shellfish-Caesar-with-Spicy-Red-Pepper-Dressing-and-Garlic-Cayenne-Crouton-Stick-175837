In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine garlic and oil. Microwave at full power (100%), uncovered, for about 30 seconds or until oil is very warm and garlic is fragrant. To make crouton sticks, cut bread slices into 1/2- by 4-inch strips. Brush all over with 2 tablespoon of the garlic oil. Arrange sticks in a single layer in a 9- by 13-inch baking pan so that they are not touching one another. Bake in a 375 degrees F oven until crisp and golden, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, sprinkle lightly with cayenne, and set aside. While croutons are baking, combine red peppers, mayonnaise, lemon juice, and vinegar in a small bowl. Whisk together to blend. Season dressing to taste with salt and cayenne. Place lettuce in a wide salad bowl. Pour remaining garlic oil over lettuce and sprinkle with cheese; toss until lettuce is evenly coated. Divide between 2 bowls and top equally with crab and shrimp. Arrange croutons on top of salads, or serve them on the side as breadsticks. Offer dressing and lemon wedges to season salads to taste.
