Place orange juice, steak sauce and chile in blender container; cover. Blend until smooth. Pour into small saucepan. Bring just to boil. Remove from heat. Remove 1/4 cup of the orange juice mixture for brushing onto steak as it cooks; reserve 1/2 cup of the remaining orange juice mixture for serving with the cooked steak. Store in separate containers. Pour remaining orange juice mixture over steak in resealable plastic bag; seal bag. Turn bag over several times to evenly coat steak. Refrigerate 30 minutes to marinate. Preheat grill to medium heat. Remove steak from bag; discard bag and marinade. Grill steak 15 minutes for medium doneness, turning occasionally and brushing with the reserved 1/4 cup orange juice mixture. Cut steak into six pieces. Serve with the remaining 1/2 cup orange juice mixture and the broccoli.
