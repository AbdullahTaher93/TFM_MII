Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a muffin pan with paper muffin liners. In a medium bowl, stir together the applesauce, sugar and eggs. Combine the flour and baking soda, add to the wet mixture and mix well. Stir in the sour cream, then fold in the berries. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups. Cups should be at least 3/4 full. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until muffins spring back when touched lightly.
