Combine ground pork, napa cabbage, egg, green onions, ginger, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 teaspoon sriracha sauce, garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil in a bowl. Arrange gyoza wrappers on a flat work surface. Place 1 teaspoon of pork mixture in the middle of each wrapper. Wet edges with your finger or a brush. Fold up sides to form a semicircle; pinch edges to seal. Heat oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add 12 to 15 gyoza to the skillet. Cook until golden brown on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Pour in 1/2 cup water; cover and cook until water is absorbed, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer gyoza to a plate. Repeat with remaining gyoza. Mix 2 tablespoons soy sauce, rice vinegar, 1 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil, and 1 dash sriracha sauce together to make dipping sauce. Serve dipping side alongside gyoza.
