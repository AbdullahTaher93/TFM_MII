Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place pita bread on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the bread is a light brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool, 1 to 2 minutes. Break toasted bread into bite-size pieces. Combine lettuce, radishes, cucumber, tomato, garlic, green onions, parsley, mint, and salt and pepper together in a bowl; toss until salad is well mixed. Pour lemon juice, olive oil, and sumac into a salad dressing bottle with a lid; cover and shake until blended. Add dressing to salad and toss. Garnish salad with toasted pita.
