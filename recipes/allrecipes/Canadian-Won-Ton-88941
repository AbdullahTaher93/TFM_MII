In a large bowl, toss together the chicken, corn, green pepper, green onions, and Cheddar cheese. In a separate bowl, stir together the cream cheese, barbeque sauce, cayenne pepper, paprika, salt and pepper. Blend the cream cheese mixture into the chicken mixture until everything is evenly coated. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lay out the wonton wrappers on a clean surface, and place a spoonful of the chicken and cheese filling on each one. Fold into triangles or rolls, sealing with a bit of water if necessary. Place onto baking sheets, and brush with lightly with vegetable oil or spray with cooking spray. Bake for about 10 minutes in the preheated oven, turning once, until golden brown.
