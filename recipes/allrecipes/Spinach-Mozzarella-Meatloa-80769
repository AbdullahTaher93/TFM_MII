Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 5x9 inch loaf pan. In a bowl, mix the beef, spinach, bread crumbs, 1 1/2 cups cheese, and eggs. Transfer to the prepared loaf pan. Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, to a minimum internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Top with remaining cheese to serve.
