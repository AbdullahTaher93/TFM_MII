In a 2- to 3-quart pan, add salt to water to taste and bring to a boil over high heat. Add couscous, and cook following directions on package. Fluff couscous and keep warm. Meanwhile, combine oil and onion in a 12- to 14-inch nonstick frying pan with a lid over high heat. Stir often until onion is lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. While onion browns, cut chicken strips into 2-inch pieces, if necessary. To pan, add garlic, chicken, and marinade; stir to mix. Cover pan, reduce heat to medium-high, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is almost completely thawed, about 5 minutes. Stir in frozen vegetables. Cover pan and cook 3 minutes. Uncover pan, increase to high heat, and stir often until vegetables are thawed and tender-crisp when pierced, 3 to 4 more minutes. Blend coconut milk with cornstarch until smooth. Add to pan and stir to blend well. Simmer until sauce thickens, about 1 minute more. To serve, spoon over couscous.
