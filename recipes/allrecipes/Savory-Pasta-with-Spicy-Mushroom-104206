In small bowl, combine garlic, olive oil and Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM). Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight. In large skillet, saute garlic mixture until garlic is soft, stirring occasionally. Mash garlic with fork to break up cloves. Add mushrooms and saute until mushrooms are soft and reduced. Gradually add chicken broth and continue to simmer until mushrooms are soft but not mushy, about 5 to 8 minutes. Cook pasta according to package directions, substituting Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM) for salt. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking liquid; drain pasta and toss with mushroom/garlic mixture. Stir in Alfredo sauce. Add pasta water if needed to thin sauce; adjust seasoning. Spoon pasta mixture into 13x9x2 inch baking dish; smooth top. Sprinkle with cheese and additional Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM). Bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes or until heated through and cheese melts. Top with fresh basil and serve immediately.
