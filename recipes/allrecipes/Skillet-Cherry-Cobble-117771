In a small bowl, combine the biscuit mix, sugar and orange peel. Stir in milk just until moistened; set aside. In a small nonstick skillet, combine pie filling and orange juice; bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Drop biscuit mixture in two mounds onto boiling cherry mixture. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Uncover; simmer 5-7 minutes longer or until a toothpick inserted into a dumpling comes out clean.
