Soak skewers in hot water 15 minutes. Thread steak onto skewers. Arrange in 9x13-inch non-reactive dish. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup Nakano(R) Natural Rice Vinegar, 2 tablespoons oil, half of the garlic and red pepper flakes, and 1 teaspoon salt. Turn to coat. Chill 1/2 hour to 24 hours. In a bowl, mix red onion, parsley, remaining rice vinegar, oil, garlic, red pepper, and salt. Chill. Remove from refrigerator 1/2 hour before serving. Drain steak; discard marinade. Grill or broil steak until browned, but pink in center, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve with the sauce.
