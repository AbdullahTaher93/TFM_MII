Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken, onions, and garlic until the chicken has browned; about 5 minutes. Stir in potatoes, salt, and curry powder; add enough water to cover the chicken halfway. Cover, and simmer until tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Season to taste with hot pepper sauce.
