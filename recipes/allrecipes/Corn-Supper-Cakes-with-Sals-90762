In a bowl, mix together salsa, feta cheese, lime juice, and minced cilantro. Cover bowl and set aside. In large bowl, whisk egg until well blended. Stir in corn, red pepper, milk, and melted butter. In a small bowl, mix together flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt and pepper to taste. Add to the corn mixture and stir just until dry ingredients are evenly moistened. Place a 12- to 14-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. When pan is hot, spoon batter into pan in 3-tablespoon portions, spacing them about 3 inches apart. Use the back of the spoon to gently spread each portion out into a 3-inch circle. Cook cakes until tops look dry and bottoms are lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn cakes over with a wide spatula and continue to cook until lightly browned on other side, about 1 more minute. As cakes are cooked, transfer them to a platter or individual plates and keep warm. Repeat to cook remaining batter. Just before serving, spoon equal portions of salsa mixture over cakes (or let diners add to taste). Garnish with cilantro sprigs and lime wedges if desired.
