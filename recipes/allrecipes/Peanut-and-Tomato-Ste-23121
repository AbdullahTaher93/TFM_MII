Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Saute white and red onion, garlic, bell pepper and peanuts for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, water, onion salt, garlic salt and cayenne pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer at least 30 minutes; simmering for 1 1/2 hours is optimal.
