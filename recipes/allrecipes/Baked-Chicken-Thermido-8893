Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large heat-resistant bowl combine the chicken, celery, peas, water chestnuts, 1/4 cup of the almonds, bell pepper, onion, pimiento, wine and lemon juice. Mix all together.

Top with bread crumbs. Bake casserole in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, until bubbly. Sprinkle cheese on top and bake for 5 to 6 minutes more. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup almonds on top and serve.
