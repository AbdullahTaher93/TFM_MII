Preheat oven to 190 degrees C/ 375 degrees F. Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Cut 8 disks of puff pastry approximately 8cm/4 inches in diameter. Place the pastry discs on a silicone mat or parchment paper lined baking sheet. Grease the bottom of a second smaller baking sheet. Place the smaller baking sheet on top of the first weighing down the pastry discs. Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes or until the pastry is golden. Remove the top baking sheet and sprinkle each pastry disc with 1/2 teaspoon of sugar. Place under the broiler and dissolve sugar, taking care not to burn pastry. Allow pastry discs to cool. Place the mascarpone in a mixing bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of reserved citrus juice and whisk until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use. Split the vanilla bean lengthways and remove seeds. Reserve empty pods. Place vanilla seeds, reserved vanilla pods, remaining citrus juice and sugar in a saucepan. Bring mixture to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until liquid is reduced and thick, about 10 minutes. Allow mixture to cool. Remove vanilla pods. Place 4 pastry discs on 4 dessert plates. Spoon 1/4 of the mascarpone mixture onto each disc. Place remaining pastry discs on top of the mascarpone to form 4 sandwiches. Spoon the segments of fruit on top of sandwiches and drizzle with syrup.
