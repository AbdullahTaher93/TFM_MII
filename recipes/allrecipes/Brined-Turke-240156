Bring 2 quarts water to a boil in a large pot; stir kosher salt and white sugar into the water to dissolve completely. Remove from heat and let cool somewhat before transferring to a large food-safe container large enough to hold the brine and turkey, but small enough to fit in your refrigerator. Pour 2 gallons cold water into the container; add rosemary sprigs, thyme sprigs, garlic, Allspice, and black pepper. Gently submerge turkey into the brine; refrigerate for 12 to 36 hours. Remove turkey from the brine and rinse both inside and outside thoroughly. Discard brine.
