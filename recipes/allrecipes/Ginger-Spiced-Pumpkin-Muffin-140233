Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly coat 12-cup muffin pan with cooking spray (or use liners). Stir flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, and salt in large mixing bowl. Beat egg in small bowl 30 seconds, until foamy. Add milk, pumpkin, oil, and orange zest. Beat well. Add to flour mixture and stir until moistened. Fill muffin cups three-quarters full with batter. Bake 15 to 17 minutes until tops spring back when touched with finger. Turn out muffins onto rack to cool. Once cool, you can freeze the muffins, tightly wrapped, up to 2 months. Garnish with candied orange peel before serving, if desired.
