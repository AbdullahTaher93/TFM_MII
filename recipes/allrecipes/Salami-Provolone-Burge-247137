Preheat grill pan (or grill). Form meat into four patties; sprinkle with seasoning (wash hands). Place patties in grill pan (or on grill); grill 3-4 minutes on each side or until meat is 160 degrees F. Top each patty with 1 slice cheese and 2 slices salami; let stand to melt cheese. Combine chopped roasted peppers and olives. Spread 2 teaspoons peppercorn dressing on inside of buns. Place patties on bottom halves of buns; top each with 2 tablespoons olive mixture. Assemble burgers and serve.
