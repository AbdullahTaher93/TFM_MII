Drain beets, reserving 1 cup liquid (discard remaining liquid); set beets aside. In a saucepan, saute onion in butter until tender. Stir in flour until blended. Gradually add the reserved beet liquid. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Stir in the vinegar, sugar, salt, pepper and beets; heat through.
