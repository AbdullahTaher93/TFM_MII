Place beans in a Dutch oven; add water to cover by 2 in. Bring to a boil; boil for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat; cover and let stand for 1 hour. Drain and discard liquid. Return beans to pan and set aside. In a skillet, cook bacon until crisp. Drain, reserving 2 tablespoons of drippings; set bacon aside. Saute onions and gizzards if desired in drippings until onions are tender and the gizzards are browned. Add the 4 cups of water, garlic, salt, marjoram, bay leaf, pepper, bacon and onion mixture to the beans. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 3 hours or until beans are tender. Discard bay leaf. Stir in sausage and tomato sauce. Toss bread crumbs and butter; sprinkle over top. Bake, uncovered, 25 minutes longer or until golden.
