Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Brush a baking sheet with oil; set aside. Stir thyme, oil, and salt in a medium bowl. Add potatoes; toss to coat. Arrange potatoes on prepared baking sheet, overlapping slices slightly in a spiral to make 4 rounds (about 5 inches in diameter each). Add tomatoes to bowl with remaining oil mixture; turn to coat. Place 2 tomato slices on top of each potato round. Bake until potatoes are tender and edges are beginning to brown, 15 to 22 minutes. Garnish with thyme sprigs.
