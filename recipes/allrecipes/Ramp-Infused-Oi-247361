Remove the white portion of each ramp, reserving for another use. Roughly chop the green portions and place in a pint jar; cover with olive oil and place the lid on tightly. Shake jar and refrigerate for at least 1 week. Place oil and ramps in the blender and blend until pureed. For a more refined finish, strain oil through a cheesecloth.
