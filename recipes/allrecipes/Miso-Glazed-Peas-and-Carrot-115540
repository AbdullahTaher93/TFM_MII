Combine miso, mirin, vinegar, ginger and oil in a small bowl. Place carrots and water in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat; cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender-crisp, about 5 minutes. Stir in the miso mixture and peas; cook, stirring occasionally, until the peas are heated through and the sauce is slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.
