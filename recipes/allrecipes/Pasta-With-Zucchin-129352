Wash the zucchini and cut into rounds or slice them lengthwise. Heat the oil in a large deep frying pan until very hot. Fry the zucchini for 5 to 7 minutes, or until golden brown. Drain well and pat dry on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and cover with a plate to keep warm. Cook the pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain and sprinkle with pecorino. Top with fried zucchini, basil, and a drizzle of olive oil.
