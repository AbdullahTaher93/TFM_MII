Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Unroll dough on lightly greased baking sheet; press seams together to form 12x4-inch rectangle. Sprinkle cream cheese with dill; lightly press dill into cream cheese. Place cream cheese, dill side up, in center of dough. Bring dough up over cream cheese to completely enclose cream cheese; press edges together to seal. Brush with egg white. Bake 15 to 18 min. or until lightly browned. Serve with your favorite NABISCO Crackers, French bread slices or cut-up fresh fruit.
