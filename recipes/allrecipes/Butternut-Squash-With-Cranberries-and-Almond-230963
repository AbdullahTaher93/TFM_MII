Bring chicken stock, butternut squash, red onion, and cranberries to a boil in a saucepan, reduce heat to low, and simmer until squash is tender when pierced with a fork, about 15 minutes. Drain. Heat butter and olive oil together in a large skillet over medium heat. Gently stir butternut squash mixture into hot butter and oil; sprinkle with brown sugar. Gently flip vegetables when browned, about 5 minutes per side. Sprinkle with almonds, Parmesan cheese, and salt.
