In large sauce pan or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat. Add onions and 3/4 teaspoon thyme; salt and pepper to taste. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook onions, stirring frequently, until golden brown (about 20 to 25 minutes). Add sherry, stirring and scraping pan until evaporated. Add in broths and bay leaf; increase heat to medium-high and bring soup to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in remaining thyme in the last 10 minutes. Divide into soup bowls and top with cheese. Serve immediately.
