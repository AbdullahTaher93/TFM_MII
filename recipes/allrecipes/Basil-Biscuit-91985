Set aside 2 tablespoons of the cheese. In a large bowl, stir together the remaining cheese, flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Set aside 1 tablespoon butter; add remaining butter to flour mixture and rub mixture with your fingers (or cut with a pastry blender) until coarse crumbs form. Stir basil into flour mixture. Add yogurt and stir until dough clings together in lumps. Pat dough into a ball, then knead on a board until the dough holds together, about 10 turns. Gently pat and roll dough to make a log about 7 inches long. With a sharp knife, cut crosswise into 7 equal pieces. If you want rounded biscuits, roll each piece of dough into a ball. Set 1 piece in center of a buttered 8- or 9-inch cake pan; evenly space remaining pieces around center. Melt and brush reserved butter over tops; sprinkle with reserved cheese. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven until biscuits are dark golden on top, about 30 minutes. Remove from pan; serve hot.
