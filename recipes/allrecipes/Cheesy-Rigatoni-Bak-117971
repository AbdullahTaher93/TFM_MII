Cook pasta according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, melt butter. Stir in flour and salt until smooth; gradually add milk and water. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Drain pasta; place in a large bowl. Add eggs. Spoon into two greased 8-in. square baking dishes. Top each with one can of tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. Spoon white sauce over top; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Cover and freeze one casserole for up to 3 months. Bake second casserole, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F.
