Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). To make the glaze: Heat brown sugar, Kahlua and dry mustard in saucepan until melted and heated through. Reserve about 1/2 cup to serve with cooked ham. Place ham in 9x13 baking pan; add water to bottom of pan. Cover tightly with foil. Bake in preheated oven 45 minutes. Remove foil, and coat ham with some of the glaze. Cover with foil again and bake 30 more minutes. Remove foil and bake until thermometer reads 160 degrees inside ham, about 20 minutes. Slice ham and serve with reserved glaze.
