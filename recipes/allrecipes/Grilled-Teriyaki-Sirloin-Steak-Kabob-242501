Whisk soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, oil, garlic, and ginger together in a bowl until marinade is smooth. Place sirloin cubes into marinade, cover bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in refrigerator, 1 to 2 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove sirloin cubes from marinade, discarding marinade. Thread sirloin cubes, onion, tomatoes, mushrooms, and green bell pepper onto skewers. Cook skewers on grill until meat is cooked through and vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
