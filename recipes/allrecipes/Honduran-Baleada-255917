Mix flour, water, vegetable oil, egg, and salt in a large bowl; knead until dough is smooth and no longer sticky. Form the dough into 8 golf ball-sized balls. Cover and let rest, about 20 minutes. Stretch each ball of dough into a thick tortilla. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook each tortilla until browned and lightly puffed, about 1 minute per side. Layer refried beans, avocado, and queso fresco over tortillas. Drizzle crema on top; fold tortillas in half over filling.
