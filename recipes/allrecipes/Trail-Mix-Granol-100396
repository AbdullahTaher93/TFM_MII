Adjust oven rack to middle position, and heat oven to 275 degrees. Coat a 9-by-13-inch metal pan with cooking spray, then set aside. Mix oats, wheat germ, brown sugar, salt, peanuts and coconut in a bowl. Bring syrup, oil and water to a simmer in a saucepan over low heat. Drizzle over oat mixture, and stir to combine. Pour mixture onto prepared pan. Working a handful at a time, squeeze cereal to form small clumps. Bake for 30 minutes. Stir in raisins. Continue to bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes longer. Let cool. Stir chips into the granola only after it has completely cooled.(Granola can be stored in an airtight tin for up to two weeks.)
