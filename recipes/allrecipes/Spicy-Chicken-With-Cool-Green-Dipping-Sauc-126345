Preheat the grill or broiler. Coat a grill rack or broiler-pan rack with cooking spray. In a cup, combine the oregano, cumin, salt, and red pepper. Cut two 1/2 inch-deep slashes in each side of the drumsticks. Rub the spice mixture over the drumsticks, pressing it into the slits. Place the drumsticks in a baking pan and coat completely with cooking spray. Let stand for 10 minutes. In a food processor, combine the cilantro, parsley, almonds, garlic, chile pepper, and salt. Process until chopped. While the processor is running, add the lime juice and oil through the feed tube, stopping the machine once or twice to scrape down the sides of the container until the sauce is smooth. Pour the sauce into a bowl. Stir in the water, cover, and chill until ready to serve. Place the drumsticks on the prepared rack and grill or broil 6 inches from the heat, turning several times, for 25 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted in the thickest portion registers 170 degrees F and the juices run clear. Serve with the sauce.
