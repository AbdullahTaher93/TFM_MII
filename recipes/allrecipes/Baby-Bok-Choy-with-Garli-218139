Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat, and cook and stir the garlic until very lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth, add the baby bok choy, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the bok choy are tender, about 6 minutes. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.
