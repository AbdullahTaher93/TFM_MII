In a bowl, combine the eggs, bread crumbs and soup mix. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Shape into 1-in. balls. In a large skillet, brown meatballs in small batches over medium heat; drain. Sprinkle with flour; gently roll to coat. Place half of the potatoes in a greased 2-1/2-qt. baking dish. Top with meatballs and remaining potatoes. In a bowl, combine soup and milk until blended; pour over potatoes. Sprinkle with paprika if desired. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 60-65 minutes or until the potatoes are tender.
