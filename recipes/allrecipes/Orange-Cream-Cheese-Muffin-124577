In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar. Add the egg and juice. Beat well. Stir in the biscuit mix only until dry ingredients are moistened. Fold in pecans. Grease six Texas-size or jumbo muffin pans generously. Spoon 1/4 cup batter into each cup. Spoon 1 teaspoon marmalade into the center of each muffin. Divide remaining batter over marmalade. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand 5 minutes before removing to a cooling rack.
