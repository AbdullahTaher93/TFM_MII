Combine flour, salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Dredge turkey in the flour mixture. Heat oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the turkey and cook until golden and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Add shallot (or onion) and ginger to the pan. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add nectar, broth, vinegar and sugar; bring to a boil, stirring. Add apricots and cook until the apricots are tender and the sauce has reduced slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in mint. Spoon the sauce over the turkey.
