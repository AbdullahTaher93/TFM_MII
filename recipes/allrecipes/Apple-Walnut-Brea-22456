Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans. In a large bowl, stir together oil, applesauce, eggs, sugar and vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, sift together flour cinnamon, baking soda and salt. Gradually stir flour mixture into wet ingredients, mixing just until combined. Fold in apples and walnuts. Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake in preheated oven for 70 minutes, until a knife inserted in the center of a loaf comes out clean.
