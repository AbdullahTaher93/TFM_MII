Preheat electric griddle to 325 F (or medium heat). Whisk together eggs, milk, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla in a medium bowl. Set aside. Place bread in a shallow baking dish and pour egg mixture over bread. Let soak for about 10-15 seconds. Heat 1 tablespoon of canola oil in the griddle. Cook the first four slices for about 6 minutes or until golden brown, turning once. Repeat.
