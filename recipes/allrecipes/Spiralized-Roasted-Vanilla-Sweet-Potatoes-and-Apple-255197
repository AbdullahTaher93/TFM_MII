Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; spray with nonstick spray. Split vanilla bean lengthwise with the tip of a sharp knife. Holding the pod open, scrape seeds from each half using the flat side of your knife. Combine vanilla bean, scraped seeds, and olive oil in a small saucepan over very low heat. Warm the oil until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool, about 5 minutes. Cut sweet potato and apple into noodles using a spiralizer. Place in a large bowl. Whisk 2 tablespoons olive oil, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and ginger together in a small bowl. Drizzle over sweet potato and apple; toss well to coat. Spread sweet potato and apple in an even layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven, turning once, until golden, about 10 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F (218 degrees C). Roast until ends of sweet potato start to brown and toast, 5 to 10 minutes more.
