Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir corn and cheese food into the ground beef; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring regularly, until the cheese begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir corn chips into the mixture; cook just long enough for them to soften slightly, 3 to 5 minutes.
