In a large serving bowl, toss together the iceberg lettuce, leaf lettuce, carrots, broccoli, radishes and tomatoes. Place the grapes on top. You may chill the salad until needed at this point if you wish. Just before serving, sprinkle in the almonds and feta cheese. Toss with the salad dressing to taste, if desired.
