Make the ragu: Heat the oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter together in a medium saucepan over medium heat. As soon as butter begins to foam, add the minced vegetables. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables have a nice golden color. Add the pancetta, and cook until lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Add the ground beef and pork, raise heat to high, and cook, stirring and breaking up meat with a wooden spoon, until meat and vegetables have a rich brown color and bottom of pan is glazed, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the wine and cook, stirring, until almost all of it has evaporated. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the diluted tomato paste. As soon as liquid comes to a boil, reduce heat to low, partially cover pan, and simmer for about 2 hours, stirring and checking sauce every 20 minutes. The sauce should be thick, with an appealing nutty brown color, and just slightly liquid. Add a bit more broth or water if the sauce looks too dry. Add the milk, partially cover, and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes longer. Taste, and adjust the seasoning. Turn off the heat. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the tagliatelle, and cook until pasta is tender but still firm to the bite. Drain the pasta, and place in a large heated bowl. Add remaining 1 tablespoon butter, about two thirds of the sauce, and a small handful of the cheese. Toss quickly until pasta and sauce are well combined. Add more sauce if needed. Serve at once, with the cheese.
