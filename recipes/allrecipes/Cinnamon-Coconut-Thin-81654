Melt the butter and then mix with the almond meal, coconut flakes, Splenda and cinnamon. Whisk together the powdered egg whites, water and vanilla. It will resist at first but keep whisking until it is all dissolved and frothy. Add to the coconut mixture. Blend well. Flatten the dough onto a sheet of parchment paper; then place another sheet on top. Roll out a somewhat rectangular shape (roughly the size of your cookie sheet) and about 1/8 inch thick. Then place the parchment paper and dough onto an upside down cookie sheet and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Remove from refrigerator and preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Carefully loosen and remove the top parchment paper from the dough and place it on your cookie sheet. Using a cookie cutter or scoring with a knife make about 9-11 cookies. (A harlequin diamond shape is nice and has very little waste - but any shape with do). The scraps will be used to fill out the dozen in the next step. Carefully turn the dough and parchment paper over onto the lined cookie sheet. Carefully remove parchment paper. Now gently remove all the 'scrap' pieces from around your cookies (save the scraps without deforming them too much) and gently move the cookies apart so that they are at least 1/4 inch apart from each other. If a cookie breaks just fit it back together with a gentle press. Now using the scraps fit together a few interesting shapes forming the last few cookies in the dozen. Bake at 375 degrees F for about 5 or 6 minutes, just until the edges start to brown. Do not over cook. Remove from oven and let cool for 3 or 4 minutes.
