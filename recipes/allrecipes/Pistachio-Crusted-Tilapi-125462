Combine the first six ingredients in a food processor and pulse until incorporated and the nuts are chopped. Beat the eggs in a separate bowl. Heat the oil on medium in a cast iron (or other heavy) skillet. Dredge each tilapia fillet in the flour, then in the egg, and finally in the bread crumb mixture taking care that the fish has a nice coating of bread crumbs Place the fillets in the pan and cook until crispy on each side, about 3 minutes per side. Serve with lemon wedges.
