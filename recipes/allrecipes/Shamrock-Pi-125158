In a large saucepan, combine the sugar, cornstarch and water until smooth. Bring to a boil. Cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Stir a small amount into egg yolks; return all to the pan. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Remove from the heat; stir in the lemon juice, butter, lemon peel and food coloring until smooth. Pour into crust. For meringue, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Spread over hot filling, sealing to the edges. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or until lightly brown. Cool.
