Take the tortillas out of the refrigerator so that they can come to room temp while you prepare the filling. In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs with the cream and a pinch of salt and pepper. In a non-stick skillet over medium high heat, melt the butter and add the Canadian bacon and scallions. Stir fry for about 1 minute. Add the eggs and then scramble the eggs. Just before they are set, add the cubes of cream cheese and stir. Add the Cheddar cheese and stir in until it begins to melt. Lay the tortillas on a flat surface. Divide the eggs equally between the two and place on the bottom third of each tortilla. Fold the bottom third over tucking in. Fold in the two sides and then roll up. Serve.
