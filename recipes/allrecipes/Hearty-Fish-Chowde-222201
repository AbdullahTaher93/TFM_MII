Heat olive oil over medium heat in a large soup pot; stir in onion, garlic, and parsley. Cook and stir until onion is softened, about 8 minutes; pour in tomato sauce, white wine, chicken broth, and thyme. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 15 minutes; gently stir in cod and simmer until fish is cooked through and flaky, another 10 to 15 minutes.
