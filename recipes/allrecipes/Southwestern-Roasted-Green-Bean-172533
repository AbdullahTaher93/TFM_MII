Rinse and drain green beans; trim and discard stem ends. To each of two 12- by 17-inch baking pans, add half the beans. Mix half the olive oil into each pan; spread level. Bake in a 450 degrees F oven until beans are tender when pierced and slightly browned, 15 to 25 minutes; switch pan positions halfway through baking. Divide pine nuts equally between pans. Add half of the butter to each pan. Stir, then continue baking until nuts are golden, 5 to 6 minutes longer. Pour into a bowl, add cayenne, and mix well. Taste, and add more cayenne and salt if desired.
