In bowl, combine ground beef, onion, bouillon, bread crumbs, egg and pizza sauce. Shape meat mixture into 48 (1/2-inch) meatballs. In large skillet, in a small amount of oil, brown meatballs until lightly browned on all sides. Place meatballs in a single layer in a 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Spoon soup over meatballs and sprinkle with cheese. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 20-30 minutes or until meat is cooked through. Meatball Making: For 48 meatballs of equal size, shape meat mixture into an 8 x 6-inch rectangle on waxed paper. Cut into 1-inch squares; roll each square into a ball.
