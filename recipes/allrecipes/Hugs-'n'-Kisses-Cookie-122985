Cut cookie dough into 1/4-in. slices. On a floured surface, roll each slice into a 6-in. rope. Cut half of the ropes in half widthwise. Form into X's on ungreased baking sheets; seal edges and flatten slightly. Shape remaining ropes into O's on ungreased baking sheets; seal the edges and flatten slightly. Sprinkle with sugar if desired. Bake at 350 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned. Cool for 3 minute; remove from pans to wire racks to cool completely.
