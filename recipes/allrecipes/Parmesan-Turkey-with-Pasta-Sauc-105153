Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Cut turkey tenderloin into 6 even pieces. In a shallow bowl combine Grape Nuts cereal, Parmesan or Romano cheese, Italian seasoning, and cayenne pepper. In another shallow bowl slightly beat together egg white and water. Dip tenderloin pieces in egg white mixture, then coat with cereal mixture. Place turkey in a lightly greased baking pan. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until turkey is no longer pink, turning once. Meanwhile, prepare pasta according to package directions. During the last 2 minutes of cooking pasta, add zucchini or summer squash to pasta. Drain pasta mixture; set aside. Keep warm. In a small saucepan heat pasta sauce. To serve, arrange pasta and squash on dinner plates. Top with turkey and sauce.
