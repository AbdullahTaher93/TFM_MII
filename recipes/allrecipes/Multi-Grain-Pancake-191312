Combine yogurt, milk, eggs, and 3 tablespoons oil. Mix well. In another bowl combine flours, oats, baking powder and soda. Mix well. Add wet ingredients to dry and mix just to moisten. Lightly grease a non-stick skillet with remaining oil and heat griddle on medium heat. Working in batches spoon 1/4 cup batter onto the grill. Cook until golden and bubbling (2to 3 minutes), then turn and continue to cook 1 minute. Serve pancakes with warm maple syrup and fruit.
