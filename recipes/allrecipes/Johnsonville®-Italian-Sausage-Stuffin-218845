In large skillet, crumble and cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink and lightly browned; drain and set aside. In the same skillet, melt butter and saute celery, onion, green pepper and garlic until tender. In a large bowl, combine bread stuffing, sausage, vegetables, Parmesan cheese, olives and seasonings. Combine broth and eggs; add to bread mixture, stirring gently to mix. Transfer to a buttered 3-quart baking dish. Cover and bake at 325F for 60 minutes. Uncover and bake 10 minutes longer or until lightly browned. Serve.
