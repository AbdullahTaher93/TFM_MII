Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the eggplant in a medium microwave safe dish. Cook, stirring once, in the microwave 5 minutes on High, or until tender. Transfer to a 9x9 inch baking dish. Mix in 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese, stuffing mix, garlic, onion, and egg. Season with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Top with remaining cheese, and continue baking 15 minutes, until cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.
