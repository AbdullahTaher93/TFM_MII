Add beef cubes, onion, carrot, crushed rosemary, garlic powder, and bouillon cubes to a 4 - 6 quart slow cooker. Stir in tomatoes and wine. Add spice bundle. Cook on HIGH 4 hours or on LOW 7 - 8 hours. Remove spice bundle. To thicken stew: mix flour with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl until smooth; stir in several tablespoons hot liquid from stew. Then stir flour mixture into stew. Continue to cook 2 - 3 minutes or until stew thickens slightly. Toast bread and place 1 slice in the bottom of an individual bowl. Spoon stew over bread and serve.
