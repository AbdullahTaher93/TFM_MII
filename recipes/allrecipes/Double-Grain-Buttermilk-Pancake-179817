In a bowl, stir together oats, whole-wheat flour and all-purpose flour, brown sugar, baking soda, and salt. In another bowl, whisk together buttermilk, eggs, and oil. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and whisk until blended. Let stand 5 minutes while the griddle heats. Place a griddle or large nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat and coat with vegetable oil spray. When griddle is hot (drops of water should sizzle and evaporate), Ladle about 1/4 cup batter per pancake onto griddle. Cook until pancakes are golden brown on undersides, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until bottom is golden, about 1 minute longer. Serve pancakes hot; offer with maple syrup, strawberries, and cinnamon sugar.
