Heat large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. Add ground beef; cook 8 to 10 minutes, breaking into 3/4-inch crumbles and stirring occasionally. Pour off drippings. Stir in broth and pasta; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and cook 7 to 11 minutes or until pasta is almost tender. Add squash and tomatoes; continue to cook 4 to 6 minutes or until pasta is tender and sauce is slightly thickened, stirring occasionally. Garnish with Parmesan cheese, if desired.
