Place potatoes in a saucepan, covered with salted water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until tender. Drain and cool. Peel and grate potatoes; place in a bowl. Add the sour cream, cheddar cheese, 3 tablespoons butter, green onions, salt and pepper. Transfer to a greased 2-1/2-qt. baking dish. Drizzle with remaining butter. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until heated through. Refrigerate any leftovers.
