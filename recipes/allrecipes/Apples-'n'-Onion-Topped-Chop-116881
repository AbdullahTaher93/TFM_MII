In a large nonstick skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, cook chops for about 3 minutes on each side or until browned. Remove meat; set aside and keep warm. In same skillet, cook and stir onion in oil for 7 minutes or until golden brown. Add apple slices; cook and stir 3 minutes longer. Combine the water, brown sugar, vinegar, garlic powder, salt, pepper and rosemary. Stir into skillet. Bring to a boil. Return meat to pan. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 8-10 minutes or until apples are crisp-tender and a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
