Preheat a Panini maker or stove-top Panini grill.* Brush one side of each bread slice with olive oil. Place, oiled side down, on a clean surface. Spread mayonnaise on each slice. Top one bread slice with 1 slice of cheese, turkey, red peppers, and 1 slice of cheese. Cover with remaining bread slice, oiled side up. Cook in panini maker 3 to 5 minutes or until the bread is browned and cheese is melted.
