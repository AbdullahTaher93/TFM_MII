Cook beef in a large pot over medium heat until browned on all sides. Stir in onion, garlic, zucchini, squash, and tomatoes. Cook, stirring, for 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in chili powder, cumin, oregano, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes. Stir in chicken, broth, and cream. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 2 hours. Stir in corn. Cover, and increase heat to medium low. Simmer for 45 minutes. If the stew becomes too thick, stir in a little water to reach the desired consistency.
