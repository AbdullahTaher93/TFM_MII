Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch loaf pan. Place the mango, water, sugar, milk powder, yogurt, and oil in a blender. Blend until smooth, then pour into a bowl. Sift together the wheat flour, baking powder, and baking soda in a bowl. Fold the flour mixture into the mango puree. Pour resulting mixture into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 30 to 45 minutes.
