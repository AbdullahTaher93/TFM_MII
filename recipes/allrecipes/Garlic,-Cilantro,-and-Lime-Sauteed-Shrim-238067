Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion, garlic, salt, and pepper in hot oil until onion is soft and golden, about 5 minutes. Stir shrimp into onion mixture; saute until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 2 minutes per side. Season with salt and pepper. Add cilantro and lime juice; toss to coat.
