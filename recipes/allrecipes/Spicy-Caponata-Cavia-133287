Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Prick the eggplant with a fork and roast until soft, about 25 minutes. While the eggplant is working, in a medium skillet, heat the EVOO, 2 turns of the pan, over medium heat. Add the garlic, crushed red pepper, celery, onion and Cubanelle pepper and cook for 7 minutes. Stir in the roasted red pepper, olives, capers and parsley. Transfer to a large bowl. Carefully peel the roasted eggplant. In a food processor, puree the eggplant into a smooth paste; season with salt and pepper. Stir into the veggies. Serve with the melba toast or bread slices.
