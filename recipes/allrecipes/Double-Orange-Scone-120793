In a large bowl, combine the flours, sugar, baking powder, orange peel and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. In a bowl, whisk milk and egg. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Stir in oranges. Turn onto a floured surface; knead 10 times. Pat into a 6-in. circle. Sprinkle with additional sugar. Cut into eight wedges. Separate wedges and place on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Meanwhile, in a small mixing bowl, beat butter and marmalade until fluffy. Serve with warm scones.
