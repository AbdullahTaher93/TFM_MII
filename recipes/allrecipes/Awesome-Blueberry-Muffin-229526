Combine milk and vinegar in a small bowl; allow to rest for 5 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease muffin cups or line with paper liners. Mix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; make a well in the center. Pour eggs, milk mixture, and canola oil into well; stir until batter is just combined. Fold in blueberries and pour batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool slightly on a wire rack.
