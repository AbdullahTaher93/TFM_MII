Preheat grill to medium heat. Peel potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes. Fill a large saucepan 2/3 of the way with water and bring to boil over high heat, add potatoes and cook 3 minutes or until not quite tender crisp. Plunge into ice water to stop cooking process and drain well. Thread skewers alternately with smoked sausage and sweet potato pieces. Brush with oil. Place on grill and cook 6 to 8 minutes, turning once, until heated through and potatoes are tender.
