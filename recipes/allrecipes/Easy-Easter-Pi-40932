Chop each of 20 peanut butter cups into 6 pieces; set aside. Place 50 Kisses in medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave Kisses on high (100%) 1 minute or just until chocolate is smooth when stirred; stir in 3-1/2 cups whipped topping until blended. Spread half of chocolate mixture into crust; sprinkle with peanut butter cup pieces; top with remaining chocolate mixture. Cover. Refrigerate 3 hours or until set. Top with remaining whipped topping just before serving. Garnish each serving with Kisses and/or candy eggs. Refrigerate leftover pie.
