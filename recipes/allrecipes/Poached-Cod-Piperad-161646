Heat a straight sided large pan on HIGH for 3 minutes. Add 2 tbsp olive oil and stir fry mix. Cook on MEDIUM-HIGH heat while stirring for about 5 minutes or until vegetables soften. Add garlic and white wine. Let liquid cook until almost dry. Add tomatoes, ground pepper, thyme and the vinegar. Season with salt and cook about 10 minutes to reduce the liquid. Top the cod with the remaining olive oil and thyme and place in pan with sauce. Reduce heat to MEDIUM, cover and cook until fish is cooked through, about 7 to 8 minutes. Cod will flake easily when pierced with a fork.
