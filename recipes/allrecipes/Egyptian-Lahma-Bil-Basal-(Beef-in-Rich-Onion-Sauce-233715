Combine beef, butter, and canola in a large saucepan; cook and stir beef over medium heat until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add onions, chicken bouillon, bay leaf, salt, and pepper to beef; pour in water. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until beef is tender and onions have reduced into a thick sauce, at least 2 hours.
