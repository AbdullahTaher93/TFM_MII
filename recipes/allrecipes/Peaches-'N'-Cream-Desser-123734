In a large bowl, combine flour and salt; cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Whisk egg and water together; sprinkle over flour mixture and toss. Form dough into a ball; roll out on a lightly floured surface to a 13-in. x 9-in. rectangle. Place in an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. For filling, combine sugar and flour; toss with the peaches. Pour into the crust. Pour cream over peaches; sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake at 425 degrees F for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F; bake 25 minutes longer or until peaches are tender. Let stand 25 minutes before serving. Refrigerate any leftovers.
