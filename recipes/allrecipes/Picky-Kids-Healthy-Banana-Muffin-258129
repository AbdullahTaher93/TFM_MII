Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 mini muffin tins with cooking spray. Mix bananas in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until smooth. Blend in yogurt, sugar, butter, applesauce, eggs, and vanilla extract. Mix whole wheat flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Pour into banana mixture; stir until moistened. Fold chocolate chips into the batter. Scoop batter into the prepared muffin tins, filling each cup 2/3 full. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 10 to 15 minutes.
