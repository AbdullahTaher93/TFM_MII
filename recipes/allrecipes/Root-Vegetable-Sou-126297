Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and onions and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until soft. Add the marjoram, sage, salt, and pepper. Add the beef and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until browned. Add the broth, water, and tomatoes. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 45 minutes, or until the beef is very tender. Add the turnips, beets, carrots, and parsnips. Return to a simmer. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for 25 minutes longer, or until the vegetables are very tender.
