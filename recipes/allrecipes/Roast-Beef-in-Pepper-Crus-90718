Allow the meat to stand at room temperature for 1 hour before you cook it. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Place a cast-iron or porcelain baking dish or roasting pan large enough for the roast in the oven to preheat. Combine the 3 types of peppercorns with the coarse salt in a mortar or spice grinder. Grind together, and add the thyme; mix well. Pat the roast dry and brush it with the oil. Season evenly with the ground herbs and spices. Place a rack in the baking dish so that the meat will be exposed to heat on all sides. Place the meat on the rack and cook for 30 minutes. Turn off the oven and let the roast rest in the oven for another 10 minutes without opening the oven door. To Serve: Slice the roast 1/2 inch thick, the slices will be cooked pink throughout. Arrange on a warm plate.
