Using a very sharp knife, cut the halibut into 1 inch cubes; set aside. In a medium saucepan, combine the celery, carrots, orange juice and ginger. Bring to a boil, then stir in the halibut. Cover and cook over medium heat for 4 to 6 minutes or until the fish flakes easily when tested with a fork and is opaque all the way through. Using a slotted spoon, carefully transfer the halibut to a plate and set aside. Meanwhile, strain the can of pineapple tidbits; reserving 2 tablespoons of the juice. In a small bowl, combine the 2 tablespoons of pineapple juice, cornstarch, soy sauce, vinegar and honey. Stir into the vegetable mixture in the saucepan. Cook and stir until the mixture thickens and begins to gently boil. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Return the halibut to the pan and add the fruit. Cover and cook about 1 minute or until heated through.
