In large Ziploc(R) bag, combine 1 cup Teriyaki Marinade and salmon; seal bag. Marinate in refrigerator for 30 minutes or up to several hours. In small bowl, lightly mix together 2 tablespoons Marinade, pineapple, onion, cilantro, red bell pepper and jalapeno chile. Let pineapple salsa stand at room temperature up to 1 hour. Remove salmon from bag, discarding used marinade. Grill salmon on both sides over high heat for 5 to 6 minutes per side, brushing with remaining Marinade, until fish begins to flake easily. Cut fish into 4 pieces; serve with salsa on top or on the side.
