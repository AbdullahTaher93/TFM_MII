Preheat grill for medium heat. In a small bowl, mix together soup, sugar, lemon juice, oil, Worcestershire, garlic powder, and thyme. Place steak on lightly oiled grill rack over medium hot heat. Grill for 6 to 10 minutes, uncovered, turning once. Brush often with soup mixture. When done, allow to rest a few moments off the heat. Transfer any remaining sauce to a small saucepan, and heat to boiling. Serve with steak.
