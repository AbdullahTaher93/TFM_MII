In a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until the meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in water, tomato paste, bouillon and oregano. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, 1 cup mozzarella, Parmesan cheese and egg; mix well. Stuff shells with the cheese mixture; arrange in a greased shallow 3-qt. baking dish. Spoon meat sauce over shells. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes. Uncover; sprinkle with remaining mozzarella cheese. Bake 3-5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.
