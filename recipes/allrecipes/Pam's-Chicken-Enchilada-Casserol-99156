Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix chicken, cumin, coriander, cilantro, black beans and chiles in a medium bowl; set aside. Spread 1/2 can of the enchilada sauce over the bottom of a 9 x 13 inch baking dish. Make 3 layers in the following order: 4 tortillas, overlapping if necessary, 1/2 can of enchilada sauce, 1/3 of the chicken mixture, 1/3 of cheese, and 1/3 of sour cream. Cover with aluminum foil coated with vegetable oil cooking spray. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbly, about 30 minutes. Remove foil, set oven to broil; cook until cheese is spotty brown, about 5 minutes longer. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
