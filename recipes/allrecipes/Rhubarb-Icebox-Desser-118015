In a bowl, combine 1-1/2 cups cracker crumbs and butter. Press mixture into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake at 350&deg. for 10 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack. In a large saucepan, combine the sugar, cornstarch and rhubarb. Bing to a boil; cook and stir for 2-3 minutes or until thickened and rhubarb is tender. Remove from the heat; stir in gelatin until dissolved. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or until partially set. Spoon rhubarb mixture over crust. Combine whipped topping and marshmallows; spread over rhubarb mixture. In a bowl, whisk milk and pudding mix for 2 minutes. Let stand for 2 minutes or until soft-set. Carefully spread over marshmallow topping (the dish will be full). Sprinkle with remaining cracker crumbs. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.
