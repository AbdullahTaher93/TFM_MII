Place a steamer basket in a large saucepan with 1/2 inch of water. Place the sweet potatoes, celery root, and garlic in the steamer. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 10 minutes. Add the onion, cover, and cook for 10 minutes longer, or until the onion and celery root are very tender. Place the vegetables in a bowl and mash with a potato masher. Add the milk, oil, and salt. Mash to blend.
