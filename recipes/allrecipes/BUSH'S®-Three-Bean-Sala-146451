Drain beans, rinse and drain again. Combine beans, celery, onion, olives, seasonings and salad dressing. Mix carefully. Chill at least two hours (overnight is better.) At serving time, drain off salad dressing. Add eggs and mayonnaise. Again mix carefully to avoid mashing beans. Garnish with lettuce, if desired.
