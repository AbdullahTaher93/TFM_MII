Place pork chops in an ungreased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. microwave-safe dish. In a bowl, combine the next nine ingredients. Pour over the chops. Cover with plastic wrap; peel back one corner to vent. Microwave on high for 18-20 minutes or until juices run clear. Remove chops; set aside and keep warm. In a small bowl, combine cornstarch and cold water until smooth. Stir into barbecue sauce. Microwave for 1 minute or until thickened. Serve sauce over chops.
