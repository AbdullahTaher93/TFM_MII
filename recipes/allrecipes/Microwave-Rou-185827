Pour the vegetable oil into a microwave-safe glass bowl. Whisk in the flour until no lumps remain. Cook in the microwave at 70% power for 6 minutes. This will create white roux. If you would like a darker roux, carefully stir, and return to the microwave. Cook at 70% power 2 to 3 minutes at a time until the desired color has been achieved.
