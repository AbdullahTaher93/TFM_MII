Bruise lemon grass with the back of a knife to help release the aromatics. In a steamer in the bottom of a wok or a 4- to 6-quart pan, place 2 cups water, the lemon grass, sake, ginger coins, star anise, and orange peel. Bring to a boil. Meanwhile, make butter: In a 1- to 1 1/2-quart pan over medium-high heat, sweat ginger and shallots in the 1 tablespoon butter for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the 1/2 cup sake, bring to a boil, and reduce by two-thirds, about 3 minutes. Add heavy cream, bring to a boil, and reduce by half, about 2 minutes. Lay salmon fillets in the steamer basket and cover with the steamer lid. Steam until the salmon is just cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes, to taste. Meanwhile, cut remaining 1/2 cup butter into chunks. Add chunks piece by piece to cream mixture in pan, whisking constantly over medium-high heat. The butter will emulsify, creating a thick, creamy sauce. Once all the butter has been incorporated, remove pan from heat. Whisk in the remaining 1 teaspoon sake and the lime juice. Season to taste with salt. Lift salmon out of steamer with a large spoon and place on individual plates. Spoon some sake butter over each portion of fish. Garnish with a lime wedge.
