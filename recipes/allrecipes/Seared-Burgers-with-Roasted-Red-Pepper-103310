In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper and basil. Lightly mix using your hands. Divide into 4 balls and lightly pat to flatten into patties. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add burgers and fry until crusty brown on each side, about 8 minutes. Place slices of cheese on top of each patty during the last minute or so of cooking. Spread 1/2 tablespoon of mustard onto each top bun. Place the patties onto the bottom buns, top with roasted peppers and cap with the top buns. Serve immediately.
