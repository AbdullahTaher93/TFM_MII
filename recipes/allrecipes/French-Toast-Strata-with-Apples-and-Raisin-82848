Coat a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray. Arrange 1/2 of the cubed bread in the bottom of the dish. Sprinkle the Neufchatel cheese evenly over the bread, and top with the apples and raisins. If you like extra raisins, add them now. Top with remaining bread. In a large bowl, beat the eggs and egg substitute with the cream, milk, butter, and maple syrup. Pour over the bread mixture. Cover with plastic wrap, and press down so that all bread pieces are soaked. Refrigerate at least 2 hours. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
