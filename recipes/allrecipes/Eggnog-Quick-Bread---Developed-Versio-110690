Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5 inch loaf pan or three 3x5 inch loaf pans with cooking spray. Blend together the eggs, eggnog, rum extract, SPLENDA(R), vanilla, and butter. Sift together the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg. Add to eggnog mixture and stir just enough to moisten; pour into prepared pan. Bake bread in large pan for 40 to 60 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Breads baked in the smaller pans require 35 to 40 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes, and remove from pan. Cool completely, wrap tightly and store in refrigerator.
