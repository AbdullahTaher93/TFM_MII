Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place pork steaks in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a medium bowl mix together the soup and milk and pour mixture over steaks. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes or until internal temperature of the pork reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
