Spread vegetables over bottom of shallow microwave-safe dish. Top with fish. In a small bowl, combine sauce ingredients; pour over all. Cover tightly with microwave plastic wrap, and microwave on high 8-10 minutes. Vegetables will be crisp-tender. Place each filet on a plate; spoon vegetables and sauce around fish. Garnish with cilantro and a squeeze of lime juice. Serve with brown rice.
