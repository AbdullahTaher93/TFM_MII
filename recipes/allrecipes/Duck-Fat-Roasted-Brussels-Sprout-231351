Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Heat duck fat in a small saucepan until melted. Combine Brussels sprouts, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and melted duck fat in a large bowl until Brussels sprouts are evenly coated. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until Brussels sprouts are browned and tender, but still slightly firm, 15 to 20 minutes. Flip Brussels sprouts over halfway through. Top with freshly squeezed lemon juice.
