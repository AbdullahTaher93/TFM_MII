Place the Mexican Cooking Sauce, lime juice, vegetable oil, onion, garlic cloves, jalapeno pepper, cilantro, cumin, oregano, and salt in the container of a blender or food processor. Blend or pulse until mixture is smooth, and ingredients are finely incorporated into the sauce. Reserve 1/2 cup of the mixture for basting. Trim steak of any visible fat. Place steak in a non-metallic baking dish or sealable plastic bag. Add marinade; turn meat to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight, turning meat one or more times while marinating. Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Drain meat and discard marinade. Grill skirt steak about 7 minutes over direct heat with cover closed. Turn meat then baste meat with reserved sauce; grill with cover closed 3 minutes more or until cooked as desired. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare doneness. Brush any remaining sauce on steak and serve with warm corn tortillas and salsa.
