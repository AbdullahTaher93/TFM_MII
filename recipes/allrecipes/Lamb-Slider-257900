Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Mix garlic, cumin, coriander, allspice, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; add lamb and mix well. Form mixture into 2-ounce patties. Grill patties on the preheated grill until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Place rolls on the grill and heat until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes. Layer spinach, tzatziki sauce, lamb patty, red onion, and feta cheese in each roll, creating a slider.
