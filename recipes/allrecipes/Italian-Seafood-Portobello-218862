Remove stems from mushrooms; chop stems and set aside. Place mushroom caps on waxed paper, bottom side up. Mist or brush caps with oil; sprinkle with salt, pepper and garlic powder. In a food processor, combine the crabmeat, shrimp, cheeses, garlic, pepper, and mushroom stems. Pulse for 10-15 seconds until coarsely chopped. Transfer to a large bowl. Crumble sausage over crabmeat mixture. Add egg; mix just until combined. Spoon into mushroom caps. Place in greased shallow baking pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a thermometer inserted into filling reads 160 degrees F.
