Mix potatoes, flour, and salt together in a bowl; add egg and mix well. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Spoon batter into skillet, spreading to form two to three 6- to 8-inch pancakes. Reduce heat to medium and fry until golden and crisp, about 3 minutes per side. Serve pancakes alongside pickle juice.
