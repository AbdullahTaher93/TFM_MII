Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Peel and core onions, then slice halfway through. Place onions on sections of aluminum foil large enough to wrap them completely. Place a bouillon cube in the center of each onion; place pat of butter on top. Season with salt, pepper, and paprika. Wrap the onions in foil. Roast in preheated oven for 15 minutes.
