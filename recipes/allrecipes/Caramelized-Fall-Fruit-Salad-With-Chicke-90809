Place hazelnuts in an 8- to 9-inch baking pan and bake in a 350 degree F oven until golden beneath skins, 12 to 15 minutes. Pour from pan onto a clean towel. When cool enough to handle, rub nuts in towel to loosen skins. Lift nuts from towel and coarsely chop; discard skins. While nuts bake, rinse chicken and pat dry. Place chicken between sheets of plastic wrap and pound gently with a mallet until about 1/2 inch thick. Sprinkle chicken lightly with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a 12- to 14-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add chicken and turn occasionally until pieces are lightly browned and no longer pink in center (cut to test), about 6 minutes total. Transfer to a plate; cover with foil to keep warm. While chicken cooks, rinse, peel, and core pears and apples. Cut each lengthwise into 8 wedges. After removing chicken, add butter and brown sugar to frying pan. Stir over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves, about 1 minute. Add fruit and stir often until fruit begins to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in vinegar and orange juice. Bring to a boil; boil over high heat, stirring often, until fruit is tender when pierced and liquid is slightly thickened, about 8 minutes. Divide salad greens equally between 4 dinner plates and set a chicken breast half on each mound. Spoon hot fruit and liquid over chicken and greens. Sprinkle with toasted hazelnuts and blue cheese. Add more salt and pepper to taste.
