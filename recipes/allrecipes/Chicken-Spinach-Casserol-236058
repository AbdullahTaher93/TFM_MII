Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a Dutch oven or large saucepan combine spinach, half of the soup, the water and butter. Bring to boiling. (If using spinach, separate it with a fork.) Cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the stuffing mix to saucepan; stir to moisten. Spread mixture in an ungreased 3-quart rectangular baking dish or eight 10-ounce au gratin dishes; top with Grilled & Ready(R) Diced Chicken. Stir milk into remaining soup; pour over chicken. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake, uncovered, for 25 minutes or until heated through.
