Moisten steaks lightly with water. Coat evenly on both sides with Crusting Blend. Discard any remaining Crusting Blend. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in large nonstick skillet on medium-low heat. Add steaks; cook 5 minutes per side or until desired doneness. Add additional 1 tablespoon oil as needed.
