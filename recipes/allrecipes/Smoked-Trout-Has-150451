Remove skin from trout and flake fish, removing any bones. You should have about 2/3 cup. Heat oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add scallions and saute until they start to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add potatoes and cook, stirring, until they brown in spots and become crusty, 7 to 8 minutes more. Stir in milk and cook, scraping up any browned bits, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in trout and 2 tablespoons dill and cook until heated through. Season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately, topped with sour cream and remaining 1 tablespoon dill.
