Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 degrees C). Toss squash, potatoes, carrots, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a roasting pan. Spread into a single layer and place a V-rack on top. Season chicken generously inside and out with salt and pepper. Place 1 tablespoon butter in the chicken cavity. Arrange dollops of remaining butter between skin and flesh of breast meat. Cut celery into 3 or 4 pieces and place in cavity of chicken. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Turn heat down to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and continue baking until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove the chicken from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes before slicing.
