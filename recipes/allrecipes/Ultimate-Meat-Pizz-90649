Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. Place 1 unbaked or prebaked pizza crust on a 12-inch pizza pan or 12- by 15-inch baking sheet. Spread with oil. Top with pasta sauce, mozzarella cheese, mushrooms, onion, pepperoni, Italian sausage, prosciutto, and Jack Cheese. Bake on the lowest rack of the oven until crust is well browned on bottom, 10 to 15 minutes for unbaked crusts, 7 to 12 minutes for prebaked. Cut into wedges. Add salt and pepper to taste.
