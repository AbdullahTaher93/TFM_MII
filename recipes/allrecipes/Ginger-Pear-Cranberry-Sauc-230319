Combine cranberries, diced pear, orange juice, sugar, water, candied ginger, orange zest, star anise, cinnamon stick, garam masala, and salt in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to boil, reduce heat to medium, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until cranberries have softened, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool completely. Remove cinnamon stick and star anise. Chill until ready to serve.
