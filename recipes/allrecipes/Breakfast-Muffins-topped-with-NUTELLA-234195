Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 12 muffin, non-stick muffin tin with cooking spray. In a large bowl, whisk together flours, oats, baking powder and baking soda. In another bowl, whisk together milk, applesauce, honey, egg and vanilla. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and mix just to combine. Fold in raspberries and spoon batter equally between the 12 muffins. Bake muffins for 19 to 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the muffin comes out clean. Let muffins cool completely. Slice the muffin open and spread with 1 tablespoon of NUTELLA(R).
