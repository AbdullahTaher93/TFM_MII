Combine ground pork, eggs, soy sauce, green onions, garlic, and ginger in a large mixing bowl; using gloves, mix together with your hands until all ingredients are incorporated well. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator 1 to 2 hours. Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Using a 1 teaspoon cookie scoop or a teaspoon, form pork mixture into small meatballs. Cook meatballs in small batches in boiling water until they float to the top and stay there for 3 minutes. Remove cooked meatballs from water with a slotted spoon.
