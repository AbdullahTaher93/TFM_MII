Cook pasta according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, saute onions in oil until tender. Stir in tomatoes, bacon, basil and pepper; cook and stir until tomatoes are softened. Rinse and drain pasta; stir into tomato mixture. Add half of the cheese. Transfer to a 1-1/2-qt. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until cheese is melted.
