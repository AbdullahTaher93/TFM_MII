Place walnuts in food processor; coarsely chop. Add bread crumbs, lemon rind, olive oil and dill; pulse until crumbly. Mixture should stick together. Season; set aside. Arrange salmon fillets skin side down on parchment paper lined baking sheets. Brush tops with mustard. Spoon 1/3 cup of walnut crumb mixture over each fillet; gently press the crumb mixture into the surface of the fish. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate for up to 2 hours. Bake at 350 degrees F 15 to 20 minutes, or until salmon flakes with a fork. Just before serving, sprinkle each with 1 tsp lemon juice.
