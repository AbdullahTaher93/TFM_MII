Preheat grill for high heat. In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, seasoned bread crumbs, egg, 1/4 cup of steak sauce, and mozzarella cheese using your hands. Shape into 4 patties. Lightly oil the grill grate. Cook patties for 5 minutes per side, or until well done. Baste with additional steak sauce while cooking if desired.
