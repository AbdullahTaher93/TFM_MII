In a mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water. Add buttermilk and butter, stirring until butter begins to melt. Add the whole wheat flour, brown sugar, wheat germ, salt and 4 cups all-purpose flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into four pieces. Shape into loaves. Place in four greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans or on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30-40 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
