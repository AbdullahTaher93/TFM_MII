Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Combine cream cheese, SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend and lemon zest to make filling. Mix until smooth and creamy. Cut bananas into small pieces and fold into cream cheese mixture. Cover and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Beat egg and water together to make egg wash. Dust flour over a clean work surface. Unroll pie crust. Cut 7 circles out of each crust using a 4 inch round cookie cutter. Fill each circle with one tablespoon of filling. With a pastry brush, brush the outer edges with the egg wash. Fold dough to make a half moon shape. Seal the empanada by pressing with a fork along the edges. Brush whole surface with egg wash and lightly sprinkle with SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend. Repeat with remaining pie crust. Place empanadas on baking sheet. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool for 2 minutes on baking sheet, then transfer to cooling rack. Serve warm.
