In a large skillet over low heat saute the garlic in the olive oil. Continue to simmer and stir for approximately 15 minutes, or until light brown. Be careful to not burn the garlic. Set pan aside to cool. In a large pot with boiling salted water cook spaghetti until al dente. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking water and add it to the pan with the cooked garlic. Season with salt and ground black pepper. Put drained pasta into garlic pan and incorporate tomatoes, dried basil, balsamic vinegar, and spice mixture. Transfer pasta dish to a heated serving platter. Top with grated Parmesan cheese and serve immediately.
