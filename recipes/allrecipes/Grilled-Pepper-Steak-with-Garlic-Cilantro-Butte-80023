Combine mustard, peppercorns and cumin in small bowl. Remove and reserve 1/2 for brushing. Spread remaining mustard mixture on both sides of steaks. Cover and marinate in refrigerator 1 hour. Combine butter, cilantro and garlic in small bowl. Set aside. Place steaks and peppers on grid over medium, ash-covered coals. Grill round tip center steaks, covered, 8 to 9 minutes (top round 9 to 11 minutes) until steaks are medium rare doneness and peppers are blackened, turning occasionally and brushing steaks with reserved mustard mixture during the last 4 minutes. (Do not overcook.) Remove blackened peppers; cover and let stand 5 minutes. Remove skin, stems and seeds. Chop peppers and stir 1/2 into butter mixture. Top each steak with 1 teaspoon butter mixture. Sprinkle with remaining chopped peppers. Serve with remaining butter.
