Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In small bowl, mix cream cheese and 1/4 cup powdered sugar until well blended; set aside. Separate dough into 8 biscuits; separate each evenly into 2 rounds. Place 8 rounds on ungreased cookie sheet. Spread each biscuit round on cookie sheet with 1 tablespoon cream cheese mixture to within 1/2 inch of edge. Top each with 1 rounded tablespoon loosely packed apple and 1 rounded teaspoon dates. Press remaining 8 biscuits halves out slightly. Place each on apple-topped biscuit round; press edges to seal. Bake at 350 degrees F for 14 to 18 minutes or until golden brown. Meanwhile, blend 1/2 cup powdered sugar with enough milk for desired drizzling consistency until smooth. Immediately remove rolls from cookie sheet. Drizzle icing over warm rolls.
