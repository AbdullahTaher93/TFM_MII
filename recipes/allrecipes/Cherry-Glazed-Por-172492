In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan, mix together jam, Merlot, vinegar, and rosemary until thoroughly combined. Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil until reduced to 1 cup, about 11 minutes. While cherry mixture boils, cut onions in half crosswise. Thread pork and green onion pieces alternately onto 4 metal skewers (at least 8 inches long), dividing pork and onions equally between skewers. Lay skewers on a broiler pan; brush tops evenly with about 1/3 of the cherry mixture. Broil pork about 4 inches from heat until well browned on top, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn skewers over, brush with half the remaining cherry mixture, and broil until other side is browned, 2 to 4 minutes. While pork cooks, bring broth to a boil in a 2- to 3-quart pan over high heat. Add couscous, cover tightly, remove from heat, and let stand until liquid is absorbed and couscous is tender to bite, about 5 minutes. Spoon couscous onto a platter or individual plates and top with skewers. Spoon remaining cherry mixture over meat and onions.
