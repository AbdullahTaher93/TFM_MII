Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan. Mix lemon juice with milk in a measuring cup and allow to stand for 5 minutes to sour. Beat butter and sugar in a bowl, using an electric mixer, until creamy, 2 to 3 minutes; beat in egg until well incorporated. Sift flour, salt, and baking soda together in a separate bowl. Mix dry ingredients into creamed mixture in several additions, alternating with soured milk. Gently fold rhubarb and vanilla extract into batter. Pour batter into prepared baking pan. Bake until top is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.
