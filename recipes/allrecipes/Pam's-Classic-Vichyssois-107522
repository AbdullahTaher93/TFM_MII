In a microwave-safe measuring cup, heat vegetable broth in microwave on HIGH for 2 minutes, or until very hot. In a large pot, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add leeks, cover, and cook until wilted, about 5 minutes. Stir in 4 cups of hot broth; add potatoes, cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and continue to simmer briskly until potatoes are tender. Let the soup cool slightly and then working in batches, transfer soup to a blender and puree until smooth. Return soup to pot; add cream and milk. Stir in additional broth if soup needs thinning. Season to taste with salt and white pepper. Serve hot, warm, room temperature or even chilled topped with fresh chives.
