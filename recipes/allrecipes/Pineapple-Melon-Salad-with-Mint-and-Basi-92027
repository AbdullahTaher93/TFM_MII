Combine pineapple, cantaloupe, and honeydew in a large serving bowl. Stack several mint leaves on top of each other. Cut crosswise into very thin slivers (1/16 to 1/8 in. thick). Repeat to sliver remaining mint and basil leaves. Add slivered mint and basil, plus vinegar, to fruit. Stir gently until evenly mixed. Garnish with mint and basil sprigs. Wrap with plastic and refrigerate.
