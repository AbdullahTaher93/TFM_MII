Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a casserole dish. Arrange noodles in prepared dish. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, onion, and celery in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir cream of mushroom soup, cream of chicken soup, mushrooms, and milk into beef mixture until evenly combined; pour over noodles into prepared dish. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove foil and sprinkle cashews over mixture; continue baking until bubbling, about 30 minutes more.
