Rinse fish and pat dry; brush both sides of each steak with oil. Place fish on a generously oiled grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds). Close lid if using a gas grill. Cook, turning once with a wide spatula, until fish is opaque but still moist-looking in thickest part (cut to test), 6 to 8 minutes. While fish is cooking, combine wine, cream, and mustard in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart pan. Bring to a full boil over high heat; then remove from heat and whisk in butter until sauce is smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Lift fish steaks onto warm plates and drizzle each serving with sauce.
