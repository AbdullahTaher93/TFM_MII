In a large saucepan or skillet, cook meat until no longer pink; drain. Add onion, celery and green pepper; cook for 5 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender. Add Worcestershire sauce, salt if desired, basil and pepper. Stir in noodles, beans, tomatoes, water and bouillon. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until noodles are tender, stirring occasionally.
