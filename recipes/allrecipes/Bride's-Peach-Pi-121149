Line a 9-in. pie plate with bottom crust; trim pastry even with edge and set aside. In a bowl, toss peaches with lemon juice. Combine the sugar, flour, nutmeg and salt; add to peaches and toss. Sprinkle with almond extract; toss gently. Transfer to prepared crust; dot with butter. Roll out remaining pastry to fit top of pie; place over filling. Cut slits in pastry. Trim, seal and flute edges. Cover edge loosely with foil. Bake at 425 degrees F for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F; remove foil and bake for 45-50 minutes longer or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool on a wire rack.
