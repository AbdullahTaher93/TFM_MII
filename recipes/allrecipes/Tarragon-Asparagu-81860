Rinse and trim the asparagus. Chop the fresh tarragon leaves, reserving the tips of a few sprigs to use as a garnish. In a large skillet over medium heat, add the olive oil and butter. Once the butter is melted, add the shallots and saute for a minute or two, just until soft. (Do not brown). Add the asparagus, tarragon and white wine. Cover (use aluminum foil if your skillet does not have a lid) and let the asparagus steam for three minutes, or until tender. Transfer to a serving platter or individual plates, garnish with the reserve tarragon tips. The zest of 1/2 of a lemon is a beautiful and tasty garnish too.
