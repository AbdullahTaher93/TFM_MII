Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil. Cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop. Combine the spinach, mushrooms, onion, eggs and tomatoes; toss together and sprinkle with salt. Whisk together the oil and vinegar. Pour over salad and toss to coat.
