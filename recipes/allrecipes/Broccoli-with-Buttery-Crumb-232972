Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook broccoli in boiling water until heated through, about 5 minutes; drain. Transfer broccoli to a casserole dish. Pour about half the butter over the broccoli; season with seasoned salt. Top broccoli with croutons. Drizzle remaining butter over croutons. Bake in preheated oven until hot and croutons are lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
