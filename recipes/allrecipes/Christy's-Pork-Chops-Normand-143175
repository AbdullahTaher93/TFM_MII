Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place flour in a shallow dish and season to taste with salt and pepper. Dredge pork chops in flour to evenly coat both sides. Melt 1/4 cup butter in a skillet over medium heat; add pork chops, and cook until golden brown on both sides, turning once. Add mushrooms to the same skillet, and stir in 1 tablespoon butter. Cook mushrooms until tender. Remove skillet from heat. Pour the brandy over the pork chops, and carefully light with a match. Let the flames burn off, then remove the pork chops to a serving plate, and keep warm in preheated oven. Using the same skillet, pour in the apple cider. Cook over medium heat until liquid is reduced by half. Add the cream to the skillet, and cook until reduced by half. Stir in the apple slices and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Arrange the pork chops on 4 serving plates. Spoon the apple-mushroom sauce over the pork chops, and serve immediately.
