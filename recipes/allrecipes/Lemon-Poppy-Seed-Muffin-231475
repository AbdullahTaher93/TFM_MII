Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line muffin cups with paper liners. Beat cake mix, eggs, hot water, vegetable oil, pudding mix, and poppy seeds together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low until blended, about 4 minutes; pour into lined muffin cups to about 1/3 full. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 20 minutes.
