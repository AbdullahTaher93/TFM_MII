Pound flank steaks on each side. Combine bacon, mushrooms, onions, basil and chives; spread evenly over steaks. Roll the meat up and secure with skewers or wooden picks. Cut each roll into 1/2- to 3/4-in. slices and secure with a wooden pick or skewer. Grill over hot heat for 4-6 minutes per side or until meat reaches desired doneness. Remove picks before serving.
