Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spread butternut squash cubes onto a baking sheet; season with 1 teaspoon salt and cinnamon. Roast squash in preheated oven until fork-tender, about 30 minutes. Melt coconut oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir curry powder and a few dashes salt into the oil. Saute apple and onion in the seasoned coconut oil until softened, about 10 minutes. Pour vegetable broth and almond milk into the pot; add butternut squash and bring the liquid to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer about 20 minutes; season with salt. Pour soup into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid in place; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth.
