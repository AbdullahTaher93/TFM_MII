Cut garlic head in half crosswise. Rub cut surfaces with a little olive oil. Place garlic, cut sides down, in an 8- or 9-inch pie pan; cover tightly with foil. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven until garlic is soft when pressed, about 40 minutes. Pluck or squeeze garlic cloves from skin; discard skin. In a blender or food processor, puree garlic. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil, garbanzos, and lemon juice. Whirl until smooth, scraping container sides as needed. Add salt and pepper to taste. Scrape into a bowl.
