Place warm water and sugar in a small bowl. Sprinkle yeast on top and let sit for 10 minutes. Sift together flour and salt; mix in potato flakes. In a mixer bowl, combine yeast mixture, warm milk, butter and egg. Slowly beat in potato-flour mixture, one half cup at a time, until a soft dough is formed. If dough is sticky, add more flour, 2 tablespoons at a time until dough pulls away from sides of bowl and is easy to handle. Place in a greased bowl and brush with melted butter. Cover and let rise in a warm place until double in bulk. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Turn out on a lightly floured board and roll 1/2 thick. Cut into 2 inch rounds with a floured biscuit cutter or cut into squares and roll up crescent style. Place on greased baking sheets and let rise in a warm place for 45 minutes. Bake for 25 minutes. Serve warm.
