Saute onion in a large skillet until soft; add beef and sausage and cook until browned. Drain set aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread soup and beans in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Slowly add meat mixture, then top with tater tots and season with salt to taste. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 45 minutes, or until casserole is cooked through.
