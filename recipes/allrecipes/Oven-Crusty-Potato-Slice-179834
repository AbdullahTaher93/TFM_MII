While oven is preheating to 475 degrees F, melt butter in oil in a rimmed 10- by 15-inch baking pan. Remove pan from oven and stir in paprika and cumin. Arrange potatoes in pan in a single layer, then turn slices over so seasoned sides are up. Return to lower rack of oven and bake until potatoes are tender when pierced and golden brown (about 25 minutes). Season to taste with salt and pepper; garnish with chives.
