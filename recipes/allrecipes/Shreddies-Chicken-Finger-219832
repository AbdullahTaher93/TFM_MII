Combine crumbs and seasoned salt in small bowl. Combine butter and Worcestershire sauce; drizzle over crumbs. Using fork, mix until combined; transfer to shallow bowl or pie plate. Place a few filets into crumbs, pressing to coat on both side. Transfer to parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Repeat until all filets have been coated. Sprinkle any remaining crumbs on top, pressing gently to adhere. Bake at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) on lowest oven rack position for 20 min., or until chicken is done. Serve immediately. If desired, serve with plum sauce.
