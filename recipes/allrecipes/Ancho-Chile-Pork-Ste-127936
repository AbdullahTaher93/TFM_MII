Season the pork with salt and pepper, and place in a large pot with the water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, skimming the top, until the pork is opaque and firm, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Drain, reserving the liquid. Cover the pork. Place the chiles and raisins in a bowl with 2 cups of the reserved cooking liquid. Discard the excess liquid. Soak until softened, about 20 minutes. Process the chiles, raisins, and the liquid in a food processor until finely chopped. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook the carrots, onion, celery, and garlic, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste. Stir in the stock, chile mixture, and pork. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, covered, until the pork is very tender, about 50 minutes. Serve with lime wedges and cilantro.
