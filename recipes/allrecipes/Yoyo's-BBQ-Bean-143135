Cook and stir the ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned; drain. Combine the onion and garlic in the skillet with the beef, and cook until the onion becomes transparent, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir the salt , pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and parsley into the beef mixture; cook 1 to 2 minutes. Stir the canned beans into the beef mixture. Add the mustard, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and barbecue sauce and stir until blended. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper, if desired. Lower heat to medium-low and simmer mixture for 30 minutes to thoroughly combine flavors.
