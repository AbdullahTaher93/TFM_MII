Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Toss beets, potatoes, parsnips, turnips, and rutabaga with olive oil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Spread seasoned vegetables over prepared baking dish. Roast vegetables in the preheated oven until beets are easily pierced with a fork, about 40 minutes. Stir vegetable broth, balsamic vinegar, and Italian seasoning together in a small bowl. Pour broth mixture over vegetables and continue roasting until liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes more. Transfer roasted vegetables to a bowl and toss with goat cheese.
