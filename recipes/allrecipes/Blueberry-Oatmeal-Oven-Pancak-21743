Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray a 15 1/2 x 10 1/2 inch jelly roll pan with cooking spray. Beat Bisquick, oats, yogurt, milk, sugar and egg white with wire whisk or hand beater until well blended. Drain blueberries, reserving syrup and 1/4 cup blueberries. Gently stir remaining blueberries into batter. Spread batter in pan. Bake 14 to 16 minutes or until set. Meanwhile, cook reserved syrup, the cornstarch and orange peel in 1 quart saucepan over medium heat, stirring frequently, until thickened and bubbly. Stir in reserved 1/4 cup blueberries. Cut pancake into 12 squares. Serve immediately with blueberry sauce.
