In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add buttermilk, sugar, butter, salt and 1-1/2 cups flour. Beat in just until moistened. Add egg; beat for 2 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a bowl coated with nonstick cooking spray, turning once to coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. For filling, combine the first seven filling ingredients. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 16-in. x 9-in. rectangle. Spread butter over dough. Sprinkle pear mixture to within 1/2 in. of edges. Sprinkle with sugar. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with long side; pinch seems to seal. Place seam side down on a baking sheet coated with nonstick cooking spray. Pinch ends together to form a ring. With scissors, cut from outside edge to two-thirds of the way toward center of ring at 1-in. intervals. Separate strips slightly; twist to allow filling to show. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 50 minutes. Brush dough with egg. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. For glaze, combine confectioners' sugar, vanilla and enough milk to achieve drizzling consistency. Drizzle over ring.
