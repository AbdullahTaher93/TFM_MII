Place caramels and evaporated milk in a heavy saucepan. Cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until smooth. Stir in 1/2 cup of the chopped pecans. Pour into chocolate crumb crust. In a blender or food processor, combine cream cheese, sour cream and milk. Process until smooth. Add pudding mix and process for about 30 seconds longer. Pour over caramel layer and refrigerate 15 minutes, or until set. Drizzle fudge topping over cake in a decorative pattern. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup pecans. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
