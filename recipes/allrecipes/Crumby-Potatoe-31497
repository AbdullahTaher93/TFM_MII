Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small shallow bowl, mix bread crumbs, paprika, salt, dried basil, dried oregano and pepper. Brush potato halves with melted butter, and roll in the bread crumb mixture to coat. Arrange potato halves in a medium baking dish. Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until tender.
