Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter a baking sheet. Line with waxed paper. Butter the paper. Stir together the almonds and 1/2 cup sugar in a large bowl. Add the eggs, one at a time, until just blended after each addition. Stir in the flour and salt. Beat the egg whites in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until frothy. With mixer at high speed, gradually beat in the remaining sugar, beating until stiff, glossy peaks form. Use a large rubber spatula to fold them into the almond mixture. Spoon the batter onto the prepared sheet, spreading it to about 1/4-inch thick. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool the cake on the sheet for 10 minutes. Use one of the metal rings to cut out eight 3-inch disks. Carefully remove the paper from each disk and set on a rack to cool. For Coffee Mousse: Beat the egg yolks, sugar, and 1 tablespoon coffee in a double boiler until well blended. Cool over barely simmering water, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture lightly coats a metal spoon or registers 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Immediately plunge the pan into a bowl of ice water and stir until the egg mixture has cooled. Transfer to a large bowl. Set aside to cool. Sprinkle the gelatin over 2 tablespoons coffee in a saucepan. Let stand 1 minute. Sir over low heat until the gelatin has completely dissolved. Stir into the egg and sugar mixture. With mixer at high speed, beat the cream in a large bowl until stiff. Fold the cream into the cooled egg mixture. Refrigerate until the mousse begins to set. Dip the bases quickly into the remaining coffee. Set them out on one or two serving plates and place a metal ring around each one. Spoon the mousse over each of the bases. Refrigerate for 12 hours, or until firm. Remove the metal rings and dust with the cocoa. With mixer at high speed, beat the cream in a large bowl until stiff. Spoon into a pastry bag and pipe onto each mousse. Decorate with the raspberries.
