Combine flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow bowl. Dip ribs into flour mixture, turning to coat all sides. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a 5 to 6-quart pan. Brown ribs, half at a time, in hot oil on all sides. Drain off fat. Return all ribs to the pan. Add broth, wine, onion, garlic, thyme, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, for 3 hours or until beef is tender. Transfer ribs and onions to a serving platter and cover with foil. Skim fat from cooking liquid; discard bay leaves. If sauce is too thin, bring to boiling and cook, uncovered, about 10 minutes to thicken. Serve short ribs, onions, and sauce with Rosemary Polenta. [Cleaning tip: Once the stove top is cool, wipe up any oil splatters or spills with Clorox(R) Disinfecting Wipes*. Rinse hands once complete.] For Rosemary Polenta: Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan. Combine cornmeal, cold water, and salt in a small bowl. Slowly add cornmeal mixture to boiling water while stirring constantly. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture returns to a boil. Reduce heat to low. Cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes or until mixture is very thick, stirring often. Stir in milk, Parmesan cheese, and rosemary. Mixture will thicken upon standing. Add water as needed to reach desired consistency.
