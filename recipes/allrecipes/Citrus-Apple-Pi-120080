Line a 9-in. pie plate with bottom pastry; trim pastry even with edge of plate. In a bowl, combine the sugar, flour, and orange and lemon peel. Stir in juices. Add apples and toss to coat. Stir in eggs. Pour into crust. Roll out remaining pastry; make a lattice crust. Seal and flute edges. Cover edges loosely with foil. Bake at 450 degrees F for 15 minutes. Remove foil; reduce heat to 350 degrees F. Bake 30-35 minutes longer or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool on a wire rack.
