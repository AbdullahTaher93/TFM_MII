Combine ground turkey, chorizo, garlic, onion powder, chipotle flakes, and black pepper in a large bowl; mix with your hands until well-blended. Shape into 4 loosely-packed patties. Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat until hot; grease with buttery spread. Place patties on the griddle; cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; continue cooking for about 5 minutes. Flip patties and cook until browned on the second side, about 6 minutes. Top each patty with a slice of pepperjack cheese. Cook until cheese is melted, about 1 minute more. Toast hamburger buns in a toaster oven. Spread 1 1/2 teaspoon mayonnaise over each half. Place cooked patties over bottom buns. Top each patty with 1/2 cup spring mix lettuce. Sprinkle lime juice over lettuce. Cover with top buns.
