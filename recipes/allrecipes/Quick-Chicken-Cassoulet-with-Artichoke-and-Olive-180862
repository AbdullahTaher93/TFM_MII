Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir in the chicken breast, and cook 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic, and continue cooking until the chicken has turned golden brown on all sides. Pour in the white wine, and simmer for 1 minute, then stir in the chicken stock, great Northern beans, spinach, artichokes, olive, tarragon, and the whole rosemary sprig. Season with ground black pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the rosemary sprig before serving.
