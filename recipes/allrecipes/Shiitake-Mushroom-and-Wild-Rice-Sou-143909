In a small saucepan, cook chicken broth and wild rice until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, soak mushrooms in hot water for 20 minutes. Drain mushrooms, reserving soaking liquid. Cut off mushroom stems and discard. Thinly slice mushrooms. In a 2 1/2 quart saucepan, melt 1 tablespoon margarine, add mushrooms and saute for 5 minutes. Place mushrooms in a small bowl. In the same pan, melt 1 tablespoon margarine, add onion, garlic, rosemary, thyme and salt and saute for 8 minutes. Add to the onion mixture the potato, beef broth and reserved mushroom soaking liquid. Cover and simmer until potato is very tender, about 13 minutes. Using a blender, puree soup until smooth. Return soup to saucepan. Stir in wild rice, mushrooms, and LACTAID(R) Fat Free Milk. Cover and simmer 15 minutes to blend flavors. Season with pepper.
