Mix meat with 2 tablespoons of the steak sauce; shape into 4 patties. Grill or broil burgers 7 to 9 minutes on each side or until cooked through, brushing occasionally with remaining steak sauce. Top with process cheese; continue cooking until process cheese begins to melt. Fill rolls with lettuce, tomatoes and cheeseburgers.
