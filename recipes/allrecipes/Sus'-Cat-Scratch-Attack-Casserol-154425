Place the rice and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook until the rice is tender and water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix together the cooked rice, mushroom soup, mayonnaise, tuna, hot sauce, jalapeno pepper, salt, and black pepper in a bowl; pour into a 9 inch casserole dish. Bake in preheated oven until heated through, about 30 minutes.
