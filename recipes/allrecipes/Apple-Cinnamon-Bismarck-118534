Bake biscuits according to package directions. In a shallow bowl, combine the sugar and cinnamon. Brush warm biscuits with butter, then roll in cinnamon-sugar. In a small mixing bowl, beat pie filling until smooth. Cut a small hole in the corner of a pastry bag; insert a large round tip. Fill bag with pie filling. Push the tip through the top of each biscuit to fill.
