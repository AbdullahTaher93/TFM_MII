Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix carrots, celery soup, Cheddar cheese, and white pepper together in a bowl; pour into a 1-quart casserole dish. Mix bread crumbs and butter together in a small bowl; sprinkle over carrot mixture. Bake in preheated oven until topping is golden brown, about 25 minutes.
