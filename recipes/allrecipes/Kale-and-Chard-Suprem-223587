Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir ham, pineapple, and onion until onion is tender and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add kale and chard; cover and cook until greens have reduced to half the size, about 7 minutes. Remove lid and toss mixture. Cover and cook until greens have softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer kale and chard mixture to a large bowl. Stir in feta cheese, almonds, and cranberries.
