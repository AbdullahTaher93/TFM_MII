Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat oil in a large (12-inch) skillet over medium-low heat. Beat egg and 1/4 teaspoon of salt in a shallow dish. Mix bread crumbs, basil and pepper in another shallow dish. Dip both sides of each breast in egg mixture, then into bread crumb mixture to coat. Set on a platter. Increase heat to medium-high. When oil starts to shimmer, add chicken and saute, until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes on each side. Pour marinara sauce into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place chicken in dish and top each with a portion of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Bake until cheese completely melts and browns, about 20 minutes. Bring 2 quarts of water and 1 tablespoon of salt to boil in a large pot. Add pasta, use package times as a guide, and boil until just tender. Drain, cover and set aside till chicken is ready. Transfer a portion of pasta to each plate. Place sauce and chicken on top of pasta and serve.
