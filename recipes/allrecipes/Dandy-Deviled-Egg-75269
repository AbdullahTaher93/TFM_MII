Cook eggs in barely simmering water to cover until hard cooked, about 11 minutes. Drain; let stand in a pan of cold water until no longer warm. (Eggs may be prepared and refrigerated up to 2 days before serving.) Peel eggs; cut in half lengthwise. Carefully remove the yolks keeping whites intact. Crumble yolks into a bowl; add olives, mayonnaise, mustard, salt and pepper sauce; mix well. Spoon mixture into egg whites. Arrange on a serving platter; sprinkle with paprika if desired.
