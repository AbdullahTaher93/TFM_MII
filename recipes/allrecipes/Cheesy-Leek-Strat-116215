In a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray, layer half of the bread cubes, half of the leeks and half of the red pepper, 3/4 cup Swiss cheese and 3/4 cup cheddar cheese. Repeat layers once. In a bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, beer, garlic, salt and pepper. Pour over cheese. Cover with plastic wrap. Weigh strata down with a slightly smaller baking dish. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. Remove strata from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until center is set and a thermometer reads 160 degrees F. Let stand for 5-10 minutes before cutting.
