Toss bread cubes in a large bowl. In a skillet, saute onion, apples, celery and garlic in butter until apples and vegetables are tender; add to bread. Add nuts, seasonings and enough broth to moisten. Just before baking, stuff the turkey. Skewer openings; tie drumsticks together. Place on a rack in a roasting pan. Brush with some of the oil. Cover lightly with a tent of foil. Bake at 325 degrees F for 4-1/2 to 5 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 185 degrees F, brushing with oil occasionally. Remove all stuffing.
