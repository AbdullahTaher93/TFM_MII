Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the macaroni, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain and cool. In a large bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, mustard, relish, olives, celery and green onions. Mix in the macaroni, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Add more mayonnaise if you like. For best flavor, cover and refrigerate over night. Sprinkle with paprika just before serving.
