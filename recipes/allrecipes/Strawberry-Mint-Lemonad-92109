Place 2 cups water, 1 cup sugar, and mint in a 3- to 4-quart pan. Bring to a boil over high heat; cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Pour through a fine strainer into a blender; press to extract liquid. Discard mint. Thinly slice about 1 cup of the strawberries and set aside. Add half of remaining berries to blender and whirl until smooth; pour into a wide-mouth pitcher or bowl (at least 2 1/2-qt. size). Smoothly puree lemon juice and remaining whole berries in blender; add to pitcher. Stir in sliced berries and remaining water. Add sugar to taste, if needed, stirring until dissolved. Cover and chill at least 3 hours or up to 2 days. Stir before serving.
