Dip each chicken breast in honey mixture, then in breadcrumb mixture. Repeat with honey and breadcrumb mixture. In a large non-stick skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Saute chicken 5-7 minutes per side or until chicken is done. Remove from skillet and keep warm. Combine all ingredients for tomato-corn confetti. Serve over chicken.
