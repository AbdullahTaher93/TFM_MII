In a mixing bowl, combine the cake mix, eggs, pumpkin, water, pumpkin pie spice and baking soda. Beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-22 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. Frost cooled muffins. Sprinkle with pecans if desired. Store in the refrigerator.
