Combine chicken pieces, garlic powder, black pepper, curry powder, ginger, soy sauce, cinnamon, five-spice powder, and salt in a large bowl. Let marinate for 10 minutes. Sprinkle tempura batter mix over chicken; toss to coat lightly and evenly. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry chicken in the hot oil in batches until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Increase oil temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Fry Thai basil leaves until crisp, about 1 minute. Drain on paper towels. Fry chicken a second time, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Drain on paper towels. Serve chicken with basil leaves.
