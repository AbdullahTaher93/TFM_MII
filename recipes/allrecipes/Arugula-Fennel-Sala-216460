Make the dressing by whisking the olive oil, salt, lemon zest, and lemon juice together in a small bowl; set aside. Place the arugula leaves into a large salad bowl. Sprinkle the fennel, pine nuts, grape tomatoes, and Parmesan cheese over top. Toss with the lemon dressing immediately before serving.
