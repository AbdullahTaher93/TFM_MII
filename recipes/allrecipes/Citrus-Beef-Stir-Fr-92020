Grate peel (colored part only) from 1 orange. Squeeze juice from both oranges. Measure juice; if you have less than 3/4 cup, add enough water to make it equal this amount. In a small bowl, stir together orange peel, orange juice, sherry, soy sauce, and cornstarch. Set aside. Heat a wok or wide nonstick frying pan over high heat. When pan is hot, add beef and ginger. Cook, stirring, until beef is browned (2 to 3 minutes). With a slotted spoon, transfer beef to a bowl. Pour orange juice mixture into pan and bring to a simmer. Add bean sprouts and pea pods; cook, stirring, until pea pods turn a brighter green (about 1 minute). Mix in beef and serve over rice.
