Heat butter in a saute pan. Add 2 tablespoons maple syrup, and gently stir in plum slices. Cook on medium heat just until plums are soft and giving out some juice, but still holding their shape. Meanwhile, stir together the remaining maple syrup and ricotta. Set aside. Divide 1/2 cup prepared plum slices among 4 clear bowls or brandy glasses. Follow with a layer of ricotta mixture, then remaining plum slices, and then the remaining ricotta mixture. Drizzle with remaining maple syrup, and sprinkle with roasted almonds.
