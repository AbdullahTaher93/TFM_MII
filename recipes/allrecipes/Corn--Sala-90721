After cutting kernels from corn, taste corn. If it's tender, use raw; if it's starchy, cook as directed in notes. Put in a large bowl. Cut chilies, bell pepper, and cucumber into 1/4-inch dice; add to bowl, along with green onions, jicama, and beans. Cut avocados in half; pit and peel them. Cut 3 halves into 1/4-inch dice; reserve remaining half for dressing. Add diced avocado, lime juice, and 1 teaspoon chili flakes to bowl and mix gently. Add salt to taste. Mound salad equally in wide, shallow bowls. Spoon dressing over the top (or serve on the side) and pile croutons alongside. Sprinkle with more chili flakes to taste.
