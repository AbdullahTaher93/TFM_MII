For crust: In a 9-inch pie pan, combine flour and butter. Rub with fingers until fine crumbs form. Add lightly beaten egg and stir until dough clings together. Press evenly over bottom, sides, and rim of pan. With your fingers, pinch dough rim to crimp. Bake on the bottom rack of a 375 degrees F oven until pale gold, about 10 minutes. After crust has cooled slightly, scatter ham and Swiss cheese in crust. In a small bowl, beat eggs, half-and-half, salt, pepper, and dill until blended. Pour into crust; sprinkle with parmesan. Bake on bottom rack of a 375 degrees F oven until center of quiche barely jiggles when gently shaken, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool 20 minutes. Cut into wedges and serve.
