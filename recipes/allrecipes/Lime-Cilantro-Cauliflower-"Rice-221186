Grate cauliflower florets or pulse in a food processor until it resembles rice. Place grated cauliflower and water in a microwave-safe covered dish. Cook cauliflower in microwave on high until tender, about 7 minutes. Stir lime zest, lime juice, cilantro, and butter into cooked cauliflower until well blended.
