Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Soak husked ears of corn in a bowl of water for 5 to 10 minutes. Mix lime juice, chili powder, salt, and black pepper in a separate bowl. Remove corn from water and grill, turning often, until corn is golden brown on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Brush ears with seasoned lime juice as you turn the corn.
