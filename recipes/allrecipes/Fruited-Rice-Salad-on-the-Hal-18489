Prepare the vinaigrette by combining the oil, lemon juice, vinegar, honey, coriander, mustard, salt and pepper in a container with a tight fitting lid. Shake well and set aside. In a medium-size bowl, combine the boiling water, raisins and apricots. Let stand for 10 minutes, drain and cool. In a large bowl, combine the vinaigrette, raisins, apricots, rice and pecans. Refrigerate until chilled. Before serving, slice the avocados in half, remove the seed and peel. Fill each half with rice salad and serve.
