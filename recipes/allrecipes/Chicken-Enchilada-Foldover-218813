Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly spray cookie sheet with cooking spray. In medium bowl, mix chicken and 1/2 cup of the enchilada sauce. Unroll dough; place on cookie sheet. Starting at center, press out dough into 14x10-inch rectangle; cut into 4 (7x5-inch) rectangles. Spoon about 1/3 cup chicken mixture onto half of each rectangle, spreading to within 1/2 inch of edge. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons cheese over each. Fold dough in half over filling; press edges firmly with fork to seal. Prick tops with fork. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown. Meanwhile, heat remaining enchilada sauce until hot. Serve with foldovers for dipping.
