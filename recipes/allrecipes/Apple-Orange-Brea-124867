In a blender or food processor, process apples, orange and raisins until finely chopped; set aside. In a large mixing bowl, cream shortening and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition; beat until light and fluffy. Beat in extract. Combine dry ingredients; add to creamed mixture alternately with orange juice. Stir in fruit mixture and nuts. Pour into three greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-55 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool in pans for 10 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
