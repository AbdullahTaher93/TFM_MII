Toss red cabbage, apples, jicama, carrots, and red onion together in a large bowl. Whisk olive oil, rice vinegar, lime juice, cilantro, sugar, salt, red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, and ground black pepper together in a small bowl until dressing is smooth. Pour dressing over cabbage mixture and toss to combine. Let slaw sit until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.
