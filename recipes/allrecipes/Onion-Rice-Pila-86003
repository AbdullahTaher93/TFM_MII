Heat the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion, and cook until soft and translucent. In a small saucepan, combine the rice, onions, and broth. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 30 minutes. Remove from heat, let cool for several minutes, then fluff with a fork.
