Stir together flour, milk powder, salt. In a separate large bowl, dissolve yeast and honey in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in the bran cereal, egg, oil and about half of the flour. Stir in the remaining flour until a sticky dough is formed. Cover bowl with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans. Stir down batter and pour into prepared pans. Bake in preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes, until bottom of loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Let loaves cool in pans for 5 minutes before removing and placing on a wire rack to cool completely.
