Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat the butter in a 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and celery and cook until the vegetables are tender-crisp, stirring occasionally. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the broth, stuffing, sausage, chiles and cilantro to the saucepan and mix lightly. Spoon the stuffing mixture into a greased 2-quart casserole. Cover the casserole. Bake for 30 minutes or until the stuffing mixture is hot.
