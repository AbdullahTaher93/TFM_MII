Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is softened, about 4 minutes. Add quinoa to onion mixture; cook and stir for about 1 minute more. Pour water over quinoa mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, cover saucepan, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Stir spinach and lemon zest into quinoa mixture; season with salt and pepper.
