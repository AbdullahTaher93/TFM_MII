In a small bowl, combine the miso, tomato paste, chile-garlic paste and a pinch of salt; add the tofu and toss to coat. Heat 1/2 tablespoon of the oil in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet. Crack the eggs into the skillet and cook over high heat until the whites are lightly browned around the edges and the yolks are barely set, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the eggs to a plate. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to the skillet and heat until shimmering. Add the snow peas, carrot and scallion, season with salt and stir-fry over high heat until crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the bean sprouts and cook for 30 seconds. Transfer the vegetables to a bowl, cover and keep warm. Add the rice and water to the skillet along with a generous pinch of salt and bring to a boil. Cover with foil and a tight-fitting lid and simmer over low heat until tender, about 15 minutes. Spoon the tofu and sauce over the rice, cover and cook for 5 minutes longer. Stir in the vegetables and top with the eggs and sesame seeds. Mix everything together and serve with seasoned nori and chile-garlic paste.
