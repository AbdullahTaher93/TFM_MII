Cook Gorton's Fillets according to directions on package. Heat oil in a 10-inch skillet and cook onions and peppers until tender. Stir in tomatoes (with liquid) and the remaining ingredients. Heat to a boil; reduce heat. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 25-30 minutes. Place Fillets on hash mixture and serve.
