Bring coffee, milk, and 2 tablespoons sugar just to a simmer in a 3-quart saucepan, then stir in Kahlua to taste. While coffee is heating, beat cream with cocoa and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until it just holds soft peaks. Divide coffee among 4 mugs, then top with chocolate whipped cream and chocolate shavings.
