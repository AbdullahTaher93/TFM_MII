Combine chili and hot dog relish in a 4-cup glass measure. Cover with a paper towel and microwave at HIGH 3 to 4 minutes or until thoroughly heated. Using kitchen scissors, make diagonal crosswise cuts into hot dogs cutting to, but not through the opposite side. Place on microwave-safe plate, cover with a paper towel and microwave at HIGH 4 to 6 minutes, or until hot dogs are thoroughly heated and curled. To serve, spoon chili onto a hamburger bun half; top with a frankfurter.
