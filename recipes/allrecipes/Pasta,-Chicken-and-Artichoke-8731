Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling water until done. Drain, and set aside. In a large saute pan, heat olive oil over medium high heat; brown the chicken and garlic in oil (about 5 minutes). Remove from the pan, and set aside. Pour the chicken broth into the pan; then add the broccoli and tomato, and cook for about 5 minutes. Stir in the artichoke hearts, mushrooms, red bell pepper, cooked chicken, and pasta; cook for 3 to 5 more minutes, or until hot. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a serving bowl, and top with Parmesan cheese and parsley. Serve.
