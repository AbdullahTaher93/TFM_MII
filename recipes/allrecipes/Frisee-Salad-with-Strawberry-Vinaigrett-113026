In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, mustard, strawberry sauce, maple syrup, water and the olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. The vinaigrette can be made up to 2 days in advance and kept, covered, in the refrigerator. Place the almonds in a large nonstick skillet and toast over low heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 5 minutes. Place the frisee, fennel, mint, peas and toasted almonds in a large bowl. Drizzle in the vinaigrette and toss the salad. Mound the salad onto small plates and top with the cheese.
