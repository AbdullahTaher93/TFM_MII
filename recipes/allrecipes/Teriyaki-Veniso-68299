Place the venison in a large bowl. Cover with the teriyaki sauce, and sprinkle with garlic. Marinate at least 4 hours in the refrigerator. Sift together the flour and Creole seasoning. Dredge the venison in the flour mixture to coat. Discard remaining marinade. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the venison 15 minutes, or until browned.
