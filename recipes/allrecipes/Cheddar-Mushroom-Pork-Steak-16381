Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine the mushroom soup, Cheddar cheese soup and the milk. Mix until well blended. Season the pork steaks with the oregano, basil and salt and pepper to taste. Pour about 2 cups of the sauce into a 9x13 inch baking dish and place the pork steaks over the sauce. Top the steaks with the remaining sauce. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 1 hour, then turn steaks over, making sure they're always covered with the sauce, and bake for another 30 minutes.
