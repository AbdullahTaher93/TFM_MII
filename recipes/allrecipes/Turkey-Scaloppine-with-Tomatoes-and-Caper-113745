In a large nonstick frying pan, heat the oil over moderately high heat. Season the turkey with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and the pepper. Dredge the turkey in the flour and then shake off any excess. Cook the cutlets until just done, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Decrease the heat to moderate. Add the wine to the pan and cook, stirring to dislodge any brown bits that cling to the bottom of the pan, for 1 minute. Add the broth and marjoram and simmer for 2 minutes longer. Stir in the tomatoes, butter, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Simmer until starting to thicken, about 4 minutes. Stir in the capers. Spoon the sauce over the scaloppine.
