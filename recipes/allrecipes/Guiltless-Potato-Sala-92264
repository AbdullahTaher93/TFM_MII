In a 5- to 6-quart pan, bring 3 quarts water to a boil. Add potatoes, cover, and cook over medium heat until potatoes are just tender when pierced, 30 to 40 minutes. Drain, and immerse in cold water. When cool, cut into 3/4-inch cubes. In a large bowl, combine potatoes, corn, celery, and red onion. In a small bowl, blend yogurt, mayonnaise, vinegar, parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper; pour over potato mixture. Mix gently but thoroughly; season to taste with salt and more pepper if desired. Serve, or if making ahead, chill up to 1 day.
