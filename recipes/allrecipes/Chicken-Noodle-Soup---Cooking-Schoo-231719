Melt butter in a soup pot over medium heat. Cook onion, celery, and carrot in the melted butter until softened, about 5 minutes. Add chicken stock, cover, and bring to a boil. Place chicken breasts in the broth mixture and cook until no longer pink at the bone, about 30 minutes. Remove chicken breasts to a plate and allow to cool. Once cool, remove the skin and shred the breasts into bite-size pieces. Return soup to boil, add noodles, cover, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Return shredded chicken to the soup, stir in salt and thyme, and season with black pepper.
