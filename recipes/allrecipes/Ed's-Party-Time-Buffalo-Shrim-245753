Grease 2 baking sheets with cooking spray. Run a sharp knife along each shrimp's back and open slightly. Place shrimp in a large bowl of cold water. Whisk eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Drain shrimp and add to egg mixture; mix with your hands to combine and coat. Mix flour, bread crumbs, salt, pepper, and cornstarch together in a large bowl. Dredge shrimp, a few at a time, in flour until well-coated, including the opening in the backs. Place battered shrimp on baking sheets. Chill shrimp until batter is set, about 30 minutes. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan. Fry shrimp, in batches, until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per batch. Test one to make sure shrimp is cooked through. Transfer to paper towel-lined bowl to drain. Place buttery spread, cayenne pepper sauce, and garlic powder in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Heat until sauce is combined; stir in corn syrup. Divide shrimp among serving bowls. Stir in sauce until shrimp are completely covered.
