Place trout on center of a sheet of foil. Rub the inners of the trout with the butter. Drizzle lemon juice and honey all over the trout, inside and out. Sprinkle chile pepper inside as well. Sprinkle a little water (to keep it moist). Place other sheet of foil on top, roll sides tight. Place package directly on top of hot briquettes and pile 5-10 briquettes on top of package. Cook for 8 to 12 minutes, or until you can hear it sizzling. Cool, cut open foil, and then enjoy.
