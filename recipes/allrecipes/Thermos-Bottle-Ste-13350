Using a large stock pot, brown your meat (breaking into small pieces as it cooks). Once meat is browned, add onions and celery, sauteing until soft. Add frozen vegetables, tomato soup, basil, parsley, oregano, bay leaves, salt and pepper, crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce and water. Simmer for one hour and then serve. Remove bay leaves before serving.
