In a large pot, heat the oil over moderate heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Increase the heat to moderately high. Add the pork to the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pork starts to brown, about 3 minutes. Stir in the garlic, water, broth, hominy, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the pork is just tender, about 10 minutes. Serve with the lime wedges and the other garnishes, if using.
