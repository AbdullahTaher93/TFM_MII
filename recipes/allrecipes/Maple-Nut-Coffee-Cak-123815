In a large bowl, combine flour packet and yeast from hot roll mix. Add sugar. Stir in water, egg, flavoring and 6 tablespoons butter; mix well. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 2-3 minutes. Place in a greased bowl; turn once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 45-60 minutes. For filling, combine sugar, cinnamon and flavoring. Add nuts; set aside. Divide dough into thirds. On a lightly floured surface, roll out one portion to a 12-in. circle; place on a greased 12-in. pizza pan. Brush with some of the remaining butter. Sprinkle with a third of the filling. Repeat, forming two more layers, ending with filling. Pinch dough around outer edge to seal. Mark a 2-in. circle in center of dough (do nut cut through). Cut from outside edge just to the 2-in. circle, forming 16 wedges. Twist each wedge five to six times. Cover and let rise until doubled, 30-45 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire rack. Combine glaze ingredients; drizzle over warm coffee cake.
