Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until tender. Drain. While you wait for the pasta, combine the tomatoes and spinach in a saucepan over medium heat. When the spinach begins to wilt, stir in the sour cream and pesto. Toss sauce with drained pasta and serve immediately.
