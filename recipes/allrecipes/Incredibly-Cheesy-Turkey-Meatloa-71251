Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a bowl, mix the turkey, milk, bread crumbs, and eggs by hand. Season with salt and pepper. Fold the cheese cubes into the mixture. Transfer to a loaf pan, and top with ketchup. Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, to an internal temperature of 180 degrees F (85 degrees C).
