Heat peanut oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the bacon bits and garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in 2 or 3 handfuls of mustard greens, allow the greens to wilt, and stir in remaining greens; sprinkle with onion powder. Continue to cook and stir until the greens are bright green, wilted, and starting to become tender, 2 to 3 more minutes. Drizzle greens with fish sauce, stir to combine, and serve.
