Place rack in upper third of oven; preheat the broiler. Coat a broiler pan and rack with cooking spray. Gently mix beef, bell pepper, scallions, breadcrumbs, 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce and ginger in a medium bowl until just combined. Form the mixture into 2 oblong patties and place on the prepared broiler-pan rack. Brush the tops of the patties with 1/2 teaspoon oil. Broil, flipping once, until cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 teaspoon oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add watercress and cook, stirring often, until just wilted, 1 to 3 minutes. Divide the watercress between 2 plates. Return the pan to medium-high heat. Add rice wine (or sherry) and the remaining 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce. Cook, stirring, until smooth, bubbling and slightly reduced, about 1 minute. Top the watercress with the Salisbury steaks and drizzle with the pan sauce.
