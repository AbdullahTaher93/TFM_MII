Soak wooden skewers in a bowl of water for about 10 minutes. Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Wrap 1 slice bacon around each mushroom and thread onto skewers, leaving about 1/2 inch of space between each wrapped mushroom. Cook on the preheated grill, rotating the skewers often, until bacon is crispy, 10 to 15 minutes.
