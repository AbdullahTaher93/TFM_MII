Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 12 (2 1/2-inch) muffin-pan cups with the baking cups. Cook the beef in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat. Add the garlic to the skillet and cook and stir for 1 minute. Remove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the soup, vegetables and Worcestershire sauce. Spoon about 1/4 cup beef mixture into each baking cup. Spread or pipe about 1/4 cup potatoes on top of each. Bake for 20 minutes or until the minis are hot. Top each with 1 tablespoon cheese. Bake for 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted.
