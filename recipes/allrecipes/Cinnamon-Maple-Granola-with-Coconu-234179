Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Grease a 13x9-inch baking dish. Mix oats and coconut in the prepared baking dish. Stir maple syrup, honey, maple sugar, and cinnamon together in a small saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil. Cook at a boil, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Remove saucepan from heat and stir vanilla into maple syrup mixture; pour over oats and coconut and stir to coat. Bake in preheated oven, stirring every 10 minutes, until golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool completely, stirring regularly, before storing in an airtight container.
