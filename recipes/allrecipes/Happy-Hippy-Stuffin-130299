Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread the pumpkin and sunflower seeds onto a baking sheet. Toast the seeds in the oven until lightly browned and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, celery, carrot, cardamom, thyme, parsley, and bay leaves to the butter and cook until the vegetables are tender; remove the bay leaves. Toss together the toasted seeds, bread, cereal, cranberries, and vegetable mixture in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper. Add the eggs and mix. Add the vegetable stock gradually until the mixture is moist, but not mushy. Transfer mixture to a lightly greased casserole dish. Bake in preheated oven until browned, about 30 minutes.
