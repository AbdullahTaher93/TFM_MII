Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Prick potatoes all over with a fork. Place each potato on a piece of aluminum foil large enough to cover completely. Spread 1 tablespoon butter on each potato; coat liberally with hot sauce and sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Wrap each potato tightly in foil. Place potatoes into a 13x9-inch baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender, 45 minutes to an hour depending on size. Unwrap and serve.
