In a bowl, combine the first five ingredients. Stir in milk. Fill paper-lined miniature muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 300 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to waxed paper to cool completely. Let stand for 24 hours in an airtight container at room temperature before serving.
