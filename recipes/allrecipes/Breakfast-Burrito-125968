Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Wrap the tortillas in foil. Place in the oven to heat for 10 minutes. Turn the oven off, leaving the tortillas in the oven to stay warm. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the zucchini, bell pepper, and black pepper. Cook the vegetables, stirring often, for 5 minutes, or until tender. Add the corn and cook, stirring often, for 1 minute. In a medium bowl, combine the eggs, egg whites, and milk. Reduce the heat to low. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and scramble gently until the eggs are cooked but still moist. Evenly divide the eggs, avocado slices, and salsa among the tortillas. Roll up and serve immediately.
