Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Empty contents of Ready Rice pouches in mixing bowl and break up any clumps. Add panko bread crumbs, soy sauce, sesame oil, and beaten eggs. Stir together until well combined. Place a 3 1/2-inch biscuit cutter on the parchment paper. Using a large cookie or ice cream scoop (about 1/4 cup), place a level scoop of rice into the biscuit ring. Press mixture gently to fill the space evenly. Gently remove the ring (don't worry if it's not perfect). Then repeat making a total of about 10 fried rice cakes. Bake in pre-heated oven until heated through, 10 to 15 minutes.
