Trim off and discard excess fat from chops. In a small bowl, mix together soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger, and mustard; rub mixture onto one side of chops. Add oil to a 12-inch nonstick frying pan and place over medium-high heat. When pan is hot, add chops, seasoned side down, and cook until undersides are well browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Rub remaining soy sauce mixture onto tops of chops, then turn them over and cook to brown other sides, about 3 minutes more. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover pan and cook until meat in thickest part is white but still moist (cut to test), 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer chops to a serving platter and keep warm; keep pan drippings in pan. While chops are cooking, peel and segment oranges. When chops are done, dust segments heavily with powdered sugar on both sides. Add segments to pan (in batches if necessary) and cook, turning once, just until oranges are warm and slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Arrange orange segments around pork chops and drizzle all with pan juices.
