Preheat grill for high heat. In a medium bowl, mix the ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, green onions, 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning, and mustard. Form into 4 patties. In a small bowl, blend the barbeque sauce and 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning. Lightly oil the grill grate, and cook the patties 5 minutes per side, or until well done. Place a slice of cheese on each burger, and allow to melt. Serve with seasoned barbeque sauce.
