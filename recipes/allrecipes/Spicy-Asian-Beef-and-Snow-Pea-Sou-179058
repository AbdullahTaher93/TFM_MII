Spray a 12-inch skillet with cooking spray. Heat over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Add the beef and stir-fry until it's well browned, stirring often. Remove the beef from the skillet with a slotted spoon. Add the carrots, peas, onion, garlic and ginger to the skillet. Stir-fry until the vegetables are tender-crisp. Stir the broth, soy sauce, red pepper into the skillet. Heat to a boil. Return the beef to the skillet and reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes. Spoon 1/3 cup of the rice in each of 6 serving bowls. Divide the soup mixture among the bowls.
