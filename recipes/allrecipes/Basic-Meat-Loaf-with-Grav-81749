Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, beat the eggs. Add the minced scallions, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, sage, oregano, salt, pepper and Liquid Smoke. Beat the eggs well. Add the pork and the beef and squish it all together with your hands until well blended. Shape meat into a loaf while slapping the outside sharply, compacting the meat and eliminating air bubbles. Place in a casserole dish so that the sides of the loaf do not touch the sides of the dish. This will allow the sides to brown. Pour the water around the loaf. Place in a 350 degrees F oven and cook uncovered for 40 minutes. Transfer loaf to a platter. Let cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving. Using a wooden spoon and some of the chicken broth for the gravy, scrape up all the brown bits on the bottom and sides of the casserole dish. Pour the pan dripping through a strainer into a cup. Let sit a minute and spoon off excess fat. In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and add the flour stirring continuously for 2 minutes. Add the pan drippings and whisk vigorously. Add the remaining chicken broth and the Kitchen Bouquet and continue to whisk until it comes to a boil. Slice the meat loaf and serve the gravy on the side.
