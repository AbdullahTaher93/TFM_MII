Soak shiitake mushrooms in a bowl of very warm water until softened, about 3 hours. Drain and slice into strips. Soak short ribs in a bowl of cold water for 20 minutes, changing the water a few times. Drain and bring ribs to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add short ribs; cook until no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water. Remove any loose particles and excess fat; transfer to a large pot. Mix 2 cups water, sliced onion, soy sauce, garlic, brown sugar, and rice wine in a bowl; pour over ribs in the pot. Bring to a boil; cook for 20 to 25 minutes. Stir in shiitake mushrooms, radish, and carrot. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until short ribs are tender, about 1 hour. Stir eggs, corn syrup, sesame oil, and black pepper into the pot. Increase heat to medium-high; cook, stirring frequently, until most of the cooking liquid has evaporated, about 15 minutes. Transfer short ribs to a serving platter and top with chopped green onion.
