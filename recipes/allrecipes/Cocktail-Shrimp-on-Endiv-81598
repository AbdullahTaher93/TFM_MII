Finely mince the parsley (or cilantro) and the bell peppers. Rinse and drain the capers then coarsely chop them. In a mixing bowl, add the mayo, sour cream, parsley, peppers, capers, oregano and garlic powder. Mix well. Toss in the shrimp and mix. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Separate, rinse and dry the individual endive leaves. You should be able to get 8 - 10 perfect leaves per head. (Use the torn and tiny ones in your next salad). Spoon some of the shrimp into each leaf and arrange on a platter.
