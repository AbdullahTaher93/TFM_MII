Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl combine egg, bread crumbs, garlic salt, and pepper. Add ground beef; mix well. Shape mixture into twenty-four 1 1/4-inch meatballs. Arrange in a 9 x 13-inch baking pan. Bake, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Split hoagie buns nearly all the way through but leave a long side attached. Spread 2 tablespoons of Classico(R) Light Creamy Alfredo pasta sauce over the bottom of each bun. Fill buns with meatballs and cheese. Place sandwiches on a large baking sheet. Bake, uncovered, for 6 to 8 minutes or until buns are toasted and cheese is melted. Meanwhile, heat the remaining Classico(R) Light Creamy Alfredo pasta sauce and serve with sandwiches for dipping.
