Remove skin from salmon, then cut into desired portions. In a large pot, combine chicken stock, orange juice, white wine, onion, garlic and lemon grass. Season with salt and white pepper. Bring to a boil for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to a low simmer. Place the salmon in the poaching liquid until flaky and tender, about 5 minutes.
