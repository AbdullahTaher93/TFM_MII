Bring the sugar, orange liqueur, orange juice, ginger, and orange zest to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir until the sugar has dissolved, then stir in the cranberries, and cook until they pop, about 5 minutes. Add the pecans, pour into a bowl, and refrigerate several hours until cold.
