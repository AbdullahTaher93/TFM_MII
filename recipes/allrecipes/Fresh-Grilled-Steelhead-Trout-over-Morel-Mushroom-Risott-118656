Light grill using Kingsford(r) Charcoal with Sure Fire Grooves(tm). Lay trout on aluminum foil, allowing enough to cover, and place 3-4 onion slices along the length of the fish. Top with first 2 tablespoons of butter. Rub Ranch mix on trout, including inside gut cavity. Top with remaining onion and butter. Wrap entire fish in aluminum foil and seal tightly. Heat on low-medium grill for 30 to 45 minutes. Melt butter in a 4 to 5-quart saucepan over medium heat, stirring regularly. Add onion and mushrooms. Cook until onions turn soft and translucent. Add rice and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, for about 3 minutes. Using a ladle, add 1/2-to-3/4 cup of broth, stirring constantly with a spoon. When most of the liquid is absorbed into rice and rice begins to look a bit dry, add another ladle of broth to pan; stir constantly. Continue adding broth in batches. The risotto is finished when the rice is tender and has a creamy consistency, like thick oatmeal. Add grated Parmesan and salt and pepper to taste; stir well.
