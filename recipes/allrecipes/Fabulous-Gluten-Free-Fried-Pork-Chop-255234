Mix coconut flour, cornstarch, granulated garlic, paprika, flaxseed meal, parsley, baking powder, sugar, onion powder, salt, and pepper together in a shallow bowl. Dredge pork chops in the coconut flour mixture until coated on both sides. Heat coconut oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until melted. Cook pork chops, covered, until browned, about 5 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until browned on the second side, about 3 minutes more.
