Score the steaks lightly on both sides using a sharp knife. Place in a shallow baking dish. Pour the Italian dressing and Worcestershire sauce over them, and sprinkle with garlic. Rub the marinade into the steaks using the back of a spoon or fork. Turn steaks over, and repeat on the other side. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 24 hours. Preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Oil the grate lightly with a paper towel dipped in olive oil. Grill steaks for about 6 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. Season with salt and pepper to taste before serving.
