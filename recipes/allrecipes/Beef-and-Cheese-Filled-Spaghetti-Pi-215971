Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium size bowl, combine spaghetti, egg white and Parmesan cheese. Place mixture into a 9 inch pie shell. In a skillet over medium heat, cook beef until browned. Add pasta sauce, stirring, and cook for 5 more minutes. Set aside. In a medium size bowl combine egg yolk, ricotta, parsley and 1/2 cup of the mozzarella. Spread cheese mixture over spaghetti mixture in pie shell, spread meat sauce over cheese mixture and top with remaining 1/2 cup of mozzarella. Cover pie with foil and bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 35 minutes, removing foil during the last 10 minutes of cooking. Let stand before serving.
