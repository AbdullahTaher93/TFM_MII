Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly spray the bottom of a 3-quart casserole dish with cooking spray. Place chicken breasts in the prepared dish and top with mushrooms. Mix cream of mushroom soup, sour cream, and onion soup mix together in a bowl; pour over chicken and mushrooms. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
