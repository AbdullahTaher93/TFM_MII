In a small saucepan, cover the chorizo with water and bring to a boil. Simmer over moderate heat for 5 minutes, then drain. Thinly slice 1 of the sausages and finely chop the other. In a medium bowl, blend the butter with the scallions, pimenton and chopped chorizo and season with salt. In a large skillet, cook the sliced chorizo over very low heat until the fat is rendered, about 4 minutes. Add the shrimp and cook over moderate heat until barely pink, about 2 minutes per side. Add the brandy, tip the skillet and, using a long match, carefully ignite the brandy. When the flames die down, add the chorizo butter and cook, stirring, until just melted, about 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the water to make a creamy sauce. Transfer the shrimp and sauce to a shallow serving dish and garnish with the lemon wedges. Serve at once with crusty bread.
