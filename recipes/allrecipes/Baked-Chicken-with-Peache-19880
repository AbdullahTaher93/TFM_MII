Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place chicken in the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle with 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Place peach slices over chicken, then sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar, ginger, cloves, and lemon juice. Bake for about 30 minutes in the preheated oven, basting often with juices, until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
