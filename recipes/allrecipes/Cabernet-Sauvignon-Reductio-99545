In a large pot or saucepan, combine the Cabernet and port wines. Bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the beef consomme. Simmer for another 20 minutes. Stir in the beef bouillon and corn syrup. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has reduced to about 1 cup. Stir in the vinegar and simmer for 2 more minutes.
