Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Lightly oil a 9x12-inch foil pan with cooking spray. Mix butter and garlic together in a bowl. Lay zucchini slices in rows in the foil pan, overlapping if necessary. Brush butter on each slice and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Cook on preheated grill until cheese melts and zucchini is tender, 12 to 15 minutes.
