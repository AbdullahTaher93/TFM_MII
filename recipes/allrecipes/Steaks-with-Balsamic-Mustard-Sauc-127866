Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Season steaks generously on both sides with salt and pepper; place in skillet. Cook, turning once, until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer to a plate; cover with foil. Add vinegar to skillet; boil until syrupy, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat; whisk in mustard and any accumulated juices from steaks. Serve sauce with steaks.
