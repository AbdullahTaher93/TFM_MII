Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat, add the ground beef and cook it through stirring frequently (about 8 minutes). Drain off the fat. Add the cumin, salt and pepper and stir. Add the 1/2 cup of the green chile sauce and heat through, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat, add 1/2 cup of Monterey jack cheese, and stir. Lay out the 4 tortillas on a flat surface. Divide the beef mixture evenly among them placing it on the lower 1/3 portion of each tortilla. Roll up each tortilla and place seam side down in an 8x8 casserole dish. Allow a little bit of separation between the enchiladas. Cover with the remaining cup of the green chile sauce and sprinkle the top with the remaining cheese. Bake in a 350 degrees F oven (uncovered) for 15 or 20 minute, until the cheese is completely melted and starting to bubble.
