Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch (2.5-L) springform pan with nonstick spray. Place the graham crackers in a plastic food storage bag. Seal the bag and crush the crackers with a rolling pin until they form coarse crumbs. Place in the prepared pan with the butter. Stir to combine and press the crumb mixture onto the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Bake for 10 minutes, or until set. Remove to a rack to cool. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, with an electric mixer at medium speed, beat the cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Add the egg, egg whites, cocoa, salt, vanilla extract, and almond extract. Beat for 5 minutes, or until smooth and well-combined. Pour into the prepared crust. Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the center is slightly soft. Turn off the oven and leave the cake in the oven for 1 hour. Remove to a rack and cool for 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight. Decorate the cake with dollops of the whipped topping and the raspberries. Serve with the warmed caramel sauce.
