Heat the oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until tender. Add the ginger, curry powder, cumin, salt, and cinnamon. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Add the water, sweet potatoes, and apples and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring often, for 20 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are very tender. In a food processor or blender, puree the soup in batches until very smooth, pouring each batch into a bowl. Reheat if necessary. Stir in the cilantro.
