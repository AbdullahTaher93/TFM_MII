Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add garlic, onion, carrots, celery, potatoes, chili powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Toss yellow squash, spinach leaves, corn, pinto beans, and spaghetti squash into the pot. Continue to stir until spinach leaves have wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour vegetable broth, water, and green chiles into the mixture. If necessary, add more water to make sure vegetables are covered. Bring stew to a boil, then reduce heat to medium low, cover, and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes.
