Preheat grill to high or heat a large indoor grill pan over high heat. Lightly brush onion with oil and grill (after the pork is done) until lightly browned and soft, turning once, 4 to 5 minutes. Let cool on a cutting board. Lightly toast buns cut side down on the grill or in the pan. Chop the onion; transfer to a large bowl. Shred pork using two forks; add to the bowl. Add barbecue sauce; stir to combine. Serve the pork filling on the toasted buns.
