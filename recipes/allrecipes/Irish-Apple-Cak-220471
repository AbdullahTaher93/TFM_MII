Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch baking pan. Mix flour, sugar, and salt together in a bowl. Beat in egg yolks, butter, and lemon zest until dough is thoroughly mixed. Mix applesauce, cinnamon, and cloves together in a small bowl. Press half the dough into the prepared baking pan; spread applesauce mixture over dough in a layer. Top with remaining dough. Bake in the preheated oven until cake is browned, 40 to 45 minutes.
