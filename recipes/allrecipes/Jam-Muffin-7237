Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center. In a small bowl beat egg, milk and oil together. Pour all at once into the well in the flour mixture. Mix quickly and lightly until moistened, do not beat. The batter will be lumpy. Gently stir in jam. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 25 minutes or until golden.
