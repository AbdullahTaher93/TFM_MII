In a large mixing bowl combine 2 cups of the flour and the yeast. In a saucepan heat and stir the milk, shortening, sugar, and salt just until warm (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F) and shortening almost melts. Add to flour mixture along with eggs and the 1/4 cup orange juice. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping side of bowl constantly. Beat on high speed for 3 minutes. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the 2 tablespoons shredded orange peel and as much of the remaining flour as you can. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to 8 minutes total). Shape dough into a ball. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning once to grease surface of dough. Cover; let rise in a warm place until double in size (about 1 hour). Punch dough down. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half. Cover; let rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, lightly grease baking sheets. Roll each half of dough to a 10x6-inch rectangle. Cut each rectangle into twelve 10x1/2-inch strips. Tie each strip into a loose knot. Place knots 2 to 3 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly double in size (about 30 minutes). Bake in a 375 degree F oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Cool slightly on wire rack. In a small mixing bowl stir together powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon finely shredded orange peel, and enough orange juice to make of spreading consistency. Drizzle over warm rolls.
