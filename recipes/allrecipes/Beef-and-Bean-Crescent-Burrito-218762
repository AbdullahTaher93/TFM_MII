In 10-inch skillet, mix beef, beans and taco seasoning mix. Heat to boiling over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Separate or cut dough into 8 long rectangles (if using crescent rolls, press perforations to seal). Spoon beef mixture down center of each rectangle; sprinkle with cheese. Starting with short side, roll up; pinch edge to seal. Place seam side down on ungreased cookie sheet. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake at 375 degrees F 15 to 20 minutes.
