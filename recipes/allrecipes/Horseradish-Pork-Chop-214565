Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place the pork chops into the prepared baking dish. Mix together the butter, bread crumbs, and horseradish. Spoon the mixture onto the pork chops, and press down the mixture to completely coat each chop with about 1/4 of the mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until the chops are tender, about 45 minutes.
