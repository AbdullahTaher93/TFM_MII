Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place potatoes in a large pot of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain. Combine hot potatoes, cream cheese, sour cream, butter, and salt together in a large bowl. Mash until creamy. Spoon potato mixture into a 2-quart casserole dish. Sprinkle with chives and paprika. Bake in preheated oven until bubbling, about 30 minutes.
