Beat the eggs with the milk and add the minced basil and a dash of salt and pepper. Set aside. In a dry non stick skillet over medium heat add the pine nuts and roast for about 1-2 minutes, just to where they start to take on some color. Add the butter and garlic and saute for 1 minute. Add the beaten eggs to the skillet and gently scrape and flip frequently with a spatula. Just before the eggs are completely set add the Parmesan cheese. Scrape and flip then turn off the heat; letting the heat in the skillet finish off the cooking without over cooking the eggs.
