Select and arrange 240 whole Shreddies on a tray. Place dried fruit in food processor; process until finely chopped, about 30 seconds. Add honey and orange juice concentrate; process until paste-like. Transfer mixture to sturdy resealable plastic bag. Snip piece off of one bottom corner. Make 1 snack at a time by squeezing out approx. 1/2 tsp. fruit paste on top of each Shreddie. Top with 1 Shreddie, gently squeezing together to make a sandwich. Repeat to make 120 snacks.
