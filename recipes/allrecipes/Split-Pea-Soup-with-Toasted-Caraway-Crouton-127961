In a 3-quart saucepan, combine water, split peas, onions, parsnips, carrots, celery flakes and rosemary; bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low; simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until thick and the water has been absorbed. Meanwhile, in a large no-stick frying pan over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the bread, caraway seeds and mustard, saute for 5 minutes, or until the croutons are golden. Set aside. Stir the milk into the split pea mixture. Simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, or until heated through. Serve sprinkled with the croutons.
