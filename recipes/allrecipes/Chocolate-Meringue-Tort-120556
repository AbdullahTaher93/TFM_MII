Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Trace two 8-in. circles 1 in. apart on paper; set aside. In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Sift confectioners' sugar and cocoa over meringue; gently fold in. Fold in vanilla. Spread evenly over circles. Bake at 275 degrees F for 1 hour. Turn oven off and do not open door; let meringues dry for 1 hour. Remove from oven; cool on baking sheet. When completely cool, remove meringues from paper; store in an airtight container. In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar for 2 minutes. Add egg, then egg white, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat on high speed until light and fluffy. Stir in vinegar and vanilla. Combine flour, cocoa and baking soda; add to batter alternately with buttermilk and water. Pour into two 9-in. round baking pans coated with nonstick cooking spray and floured. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. To assemble, spread 1/2 cup whipped topping over one cake layer; top with a meringue and another 1/2 cup topping. Top with second cake layer, 1/2 cup topping, second meringue and remaining topping. Sprinkle with toffee bits and shaved chocolate.
