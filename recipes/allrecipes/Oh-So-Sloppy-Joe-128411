Warm the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions, green peppers, carrots, celery, garlic, and oregano; cook for 4 or 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are softened. Add the ground beef. Cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, for 3 minutes, or until no longer pink. Stir in the tomato sauce, water, and vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, black pepper, and hot-pepper sauce. Cook for 3 minutes, or until heated through. Lightly toast the buns. Place 1/2 cup (125 ml) of the mixture on the bottom half of each bun. Top with the other half.
