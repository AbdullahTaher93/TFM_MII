Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange apple slices in 9-inch circular glass pie plate. Stir oats, brown sugar, and ground cinnamon together in a bowl. Microwave butter in short 5-second increments until melted, about 20 seconds. Stir honey, melted butter, and oil into oat mixture; crumble over apples. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 35 minutes. Cool on a wire cooling rack, about 45 minutes.
