Cut off and discard the dark green portion of the leek and the root end. Slice the leek lengthwise and thoroughly rinse out all the sand and grit. Rough chop. Trim off and discard the turnip stem and root end. Do not peel. Cut into cubes. In a soup pot over medium-high heat, melt the butter, add the leeks, turnips, water and salt and pepper. Bring to a full boil. Then reduce heat to a simmer or gentle boil for about 25 minutes, until the turnips are fork tender. Stir occasionally. This soup is not finicky, slow it down, speed it up, whatever you like. If you want to cook super fast then cut the leeks and turnips into smaller pieces. This soup is best pureed; so pass it through a blender or food processor in batches or use a hand held wand blender immersed right into the soup pot. Pour in the cream and stir. Taste test and add ONLY salt and pepper as needed. Trust me on this.
