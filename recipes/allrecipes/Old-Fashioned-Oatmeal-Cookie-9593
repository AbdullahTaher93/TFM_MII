Simmer raisins and water over medium heat until raisins are plump, about 15 minutes. Drain raisins, reserving the liquid. Add enough water to reserved liquid to measure 1/2 cup. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Mix the shortening, sugar, eggs and vanilla thoroughly. Stir in reserved liquid. Blend in the remaining ingredients. Drop by rounded teaspoons about 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until light brown.
