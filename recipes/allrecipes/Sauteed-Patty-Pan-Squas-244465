Heat olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium-high heat until foaming, 1 to 2 minutes. Saute onion in the olive oil-butter until tender and translucent, about 3 minutes. Add squash and garlic; season with lemon pepper. Saute mixture until squash is easily pierced with a fork, 5 to 6 minutes. Mix spinach, parsley, and basil into squash mixture; saute until spinach wilts, about 1 minute. Squeeze lemon juice over mixture and sprinkle in Parmesan cheese; stir well. Season mixture with salt and black pepper.
