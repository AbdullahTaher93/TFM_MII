Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Heat olive oil in 12-inch skillet over medium heat and cook zucchini and mushrooms 3 minutes or until vegetables are tender; set aside. Combine ricotta cheese, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg and basil in medium bowl; set aside. Evenly spread 1/2 cup Pasta Sauce in 13 x 9-inch baking dish. Arrange 4 lasagna noodles, lengthwise over sauce, overlapping edges slightly. Spread 1/3 of the cheese mixture over noodles, then 3/4 cup sauce and 1/3 of the vegetable mixture; repeat layers, ending with noodles. Top with remaining Sauce and sprinkle with remaining 1 cup mozzarella cheese. Loosely cover with aluminum foil and bake 45 minutes or until bubbling. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
