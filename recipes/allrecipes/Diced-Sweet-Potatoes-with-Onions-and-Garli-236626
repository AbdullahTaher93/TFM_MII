Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat the inside of a glass or non-stick baking dish with olive oil. Place sweet potatoes into the prepared baking dish and turn to evenly coat with the olive oil in the baking dish. Season sweet potatoes with salt and pepper. Add onion and garlic to sweet potato mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until sweet potatoes are tender, about 1 hour.
