With a sharp knife, cut corn kernels from cobs; set aside kernels and cobs. In a 4- to 5-quart pan, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until limp, about 5 minutes. Add rice and stir until rice is opaque and milky-looking, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in about 3/4 of the corn kernels. Add broth to rice mixture. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring often. Reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until most of liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Lower heat and stir often as mixture thickens. Remove rice from heat. Holding corn cobs over the pan, scrape them with the dull side of a knife so corn juices fall into rice mixture. Gently stir in parmesan, fontina, and chopped sage. Let stand for a minute to let cheese melt. Transfer risotto to a rimmed platter or individual bowls. Scatter remaining corn kernels over risotto and garnish with whole sage leaves.
