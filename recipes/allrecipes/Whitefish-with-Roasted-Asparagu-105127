Thaw fish, if frozen. Rinse fish; pat dry. Cut fish into 4 serving-size portions; set aside. In a 2-quart rectangular baking dish stir together onion, carrot, broth, and garlic. Top with fish fillets, tucking under any thin edges. Sprinkle with salt, paprika, and pepper. Top with asparagus. Bake, covered, in a 450 degrees F oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Serve fish with vegetables.
