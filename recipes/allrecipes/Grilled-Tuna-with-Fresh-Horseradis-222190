Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Lightly oil steaks with vegetable oil. Stir soy sauce, rice vinegar, horseradish, cherry tomatoes, and hot chile paste in a bowl until well combined. Let sit for 20 minutes. Place steaks over hottest part of the grill and cook for 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Spoon soy sauce mixture over steaks and garnish with green onion.
