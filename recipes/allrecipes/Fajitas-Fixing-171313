Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above the cooking grate only 2 to 3 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). While grill heats, cut onion lengthwise into 6 wedges. Stem and seed peppers and cut each lengthwise into 1/2-inch wide pieces. Place vegetables on a platter and drizzle with olive oil, mixing to coat. Sprinkle all over with salt and pepper to taste. Lay vegetables crosswise on cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook, turning often with tongs, until tinged with brown all over, 10 to 12 minutes total. Transfer vegetables to a clean platter and serve warm or at room temperature. Place a few tortillas at a time on cooking grate, turning once, just until warm and flexible, about 5 minutes total. Stack on a plate as they are warmed. Set out vegetables, tortillas, salsa, and avocado to accompany fajitas.
