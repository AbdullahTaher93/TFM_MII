In a large bowl, whisk together vinegar, honey, sour cream, salt and red pepper flakes. Add cabbage, green onions and cilantro; toss well. Let stand 30 minutes before serving for flavors to blend. If making more than 30 minutes ahead, refrigerate dressing and salad separately. Mix in Wonderful Almond Accents just before serving.
