Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Season the pork steaks on both sides with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Place in the skillet and cook until browned on each side, about 4 minutes per side. Place sliced onions on top of the steaks in the pan. Stir together the ketchup and water in a medium bowl; pour over the steaks. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and cook for about 2 hours. The longer you cook, the better the meat tastes.
