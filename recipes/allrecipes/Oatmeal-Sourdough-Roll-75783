Place ingredients in bread machine pan in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select the Dough Cycle, then press Start. When the cycle is complete, transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and divide into 24 rolls. Cover with a towel and let rolls rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet. Arrange the rolls on the prepared baking sheet, and bake 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned.
