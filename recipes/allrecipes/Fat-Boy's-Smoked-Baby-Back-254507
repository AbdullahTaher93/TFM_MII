Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Place marinated ribs in a shallow baking dish; add water. Tent aluminum foil over baking dish. Bake ribs in the preheated oven until heated through, about 1 1/4 hour. Preheat smoker to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions. Combine vinegar and Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl and pour into a spray bottle. Transfer ribs to the smoker. Let cook, spraying generously with vinegar mixture every 30 minutes, until tender, about 3 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Add ketchup, honey, steak sauce, hot sauce, garlic, and cayenne pepper. Simmer sauce until flavors combine, about 20 minutes. Brush sauce over ribs. Grill until deeply browned, about 15 minutes.
