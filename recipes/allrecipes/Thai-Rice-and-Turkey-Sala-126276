Prepare the rice according to package directions. Spread the rice in a shallow baking pan and place it in the freezer for 10 minutes to chill slightly. Meanwhile, place the water, broth, ginger, and garlic in a medium skillet. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the turkey, cover, and cook, stirring frequently, for 4 minutes, or until the turkey is no longer pink. Using a slotted spoon, remove the turkey to a plate; cover loosely with waxed paper to keep it moist. Increase the heat to high and return the broth to a boil. Boil for 6 minutes, or until the broth is thickened and reduced to about 1/4 cup. In a large bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, lime juice, honey, and salt. Whisk in the reduced broth and continue whisking until smooth (add a few drops of hot water if the mixture becomes too thick). Add the rice, turkey and any accumulated juices, cabbage, pepper, onion, and mint. Toss to coat well. Arrange the spinach or kale on a platter. Mound the salad in the center and sprinkle with the peanuts.
