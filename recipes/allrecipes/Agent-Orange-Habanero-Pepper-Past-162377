Bring the habaneros and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 15 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in carrots, onion, cumin and garlic. Carefully puree the vegetables in a blender until smooth, then return to the saucepan, and continue simmering 45 minutes to 1 hour until thickened to the consistency of oatmeal. When ready, refrigerate overnight before using.
