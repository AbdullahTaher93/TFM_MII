Preheat oven broiler. In a 1- to 1-1/2-quart pan, stir jelly over low heat just until melted, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vinegar, minced mint, soy sauce, oil, mustard, garlic, and pepper. Preheat oven broiler. Set lamb chops on a rack in a 12- by 14-inch broiler pan. Generously brush mint sauce over tops of chops. Broil chops about 4 to 6 inches from heat until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Turn chops over, brush with more mint sauce, and continue broiling until meat is done to your liking, 5 to 7 minutes longer for medium-rare (cut to test). Transfer chops to individual plates and top with any remaining mint sauce. If desired, garnish with fresh mint sprigs. Add salt to taste.
