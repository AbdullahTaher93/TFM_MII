Mix potatoes, cream of broccoli soup, and salmon together in a saucepan; cook and stir over medium heat until heated through, about 5 minutes. Spoon filling in a line across the middle of a tortilla. Fold opposing edges of the tortilla to overlap the filling. Roll 1 of the opposing edges around the filling into a burrito. Repeat with remaining filling and tortilla.
