In a large skillet, cook bacon until crisp. Remove to paper towels. Drain, reserving 2 tablespoons of drippings. Cook beef, onion and green pepper in drippings until meat is no longer pink. Add beans, tomato sauce, chili powder, salt, pepper and bacon. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; add cheese. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted. Spoon into English muffins halves.
