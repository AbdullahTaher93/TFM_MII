Melt butter in a large skillet over low heat; add brown sugar and cook and stir until brown sugar has dissolved. Stir water and soy sauce into butter mixture, increase heat to medium-high, and bring mixture to a boil. Stir in chopped rutabaga and return to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, stirring frequently, until liquid is absorbed, about 45 minutes.
