Mix pineapple chunks and juice, cornstarch, chile sauce, raisins, sugar and cinnamon in a medium bowl and set aside. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Coat chops with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper; add chops to the hot skillet. Cook, until a rich brown crust develops, about 4 to 6 minutes on each side. Transfer to a plate, cover to keep warm. Pour pineapple mixture into hot skillet; simmer until it is a thick sauce, about 2 to 3 minutes. Serve sauce on the side with chops.
