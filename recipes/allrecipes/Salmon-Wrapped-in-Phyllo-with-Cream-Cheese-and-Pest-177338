Layer phyllo sheets on a baking sheet, brushing each phyllo sheet lightly with melted butter, or coating with butter-flavored cooking oil spray. Lay the salmon fillet down length of dough 1 inch from a long edge. Spread cream cheese evenly over the salmon, then spread pesto evenly over cheese. Fold the 1 inch of dough over salmon and trim excess dough at the narrow ends of the fish with scissors, moistening phyllo with butter so that it sticks to fish. Fold the other half of the phyllo over the salmon and trim ends again to fit fish. Turn the phyllo-wrapped fish over; brush with butter or coat with cooking oil spray. Slice the phyllo-wrapped fish into 6 equal pieces; leave in place on pan. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven until phyllo is golden and fish is barely opaque in thickest part (cut to test), about 20 minutes. Transfer to a serving plate. Add salt and lemon to taste.
