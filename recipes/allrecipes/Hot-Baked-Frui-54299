Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a deep baking dish, mix together prunes, dried apricots, raisins, and pineapple chunks. In a separate bowl, combine cherry pie filling, sherry, and water. Pour over the fruit, and blend thoroughly. Stir in almonds. Cover, and bake in preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours.
