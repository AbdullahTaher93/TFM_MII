Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a layer of tomato slices in an 8x8 inch baking pan. Spread a thin layer of mayonnaise on the tomatoes and sprinkle with about 1/4 of the Cheddar cheese and salt and pepper. Repeat layers, ending with the rest of the shredded cheese. Bake until tomatoes are softened and cheese is melted and bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes.
