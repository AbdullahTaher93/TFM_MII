In a nonstick skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Let cool and slice. In a large saucepan, whisk together the broth, soup, mushrooms, onion, Italian seasoning, garlic and herb seasoning, caraway seeds and fennel seed. Add sausage. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Add beans and leek. Simmer 10 minutes longer or until vegetables are tender.
