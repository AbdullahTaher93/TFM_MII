Flatten chicken breasts between sheets of plastic wrap to 1/4-inch thickness; set aside. Beat egg in shallow dish; place bread crumbs in additional shallow dish. Dip chicken into egg, then roll in crumbs, coating lightly. Place one prosciutto slice over each chicken breast. Top each breast with 1/4 cup cheese and 2 tablespoons peppers; roll up. Place seam-side down on foil-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake in preheated 350 degrees F oven 20 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.
