For the russet pancakes, preheat vegetable oil in a skillet until it reaches 350 degrees F. Grate potatoes and onion, set aside. Place measured amounts into a clean bar towel or cloth. Squeeze out as much moisture as possible. Whisk eggs and whisk in potato starch, salt, and white pepper until smooth. Quickly fold onion and potatoes into the egg mixture. Use a 1/4 cup measuring cup to portion out a potato pancake. Place into hot oil and flatten with a spatula. Fry until golden brown and flip with a slotted spatula (about 4 minutes per side). Fry for an additional time until the second side is golden brown. Use a slotted spatula to remove the pancake to a drain pan or rack. Sprinkle with fine salt. Use the same directions to make the purple potato pancakes using the ingredients listed above.
