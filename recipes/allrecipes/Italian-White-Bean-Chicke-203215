Prepare a skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Cook the garlic in the skillet until browned. Add the chicken and cook until slightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Stir the zucchini and white beans into the skillet; cover and cook about 5 minutes. Scatter the tomato over the dish; cover again and cook another 2 minutes. Add the basil leaves and cook 1 minute more. Season with black pepper to serve.
