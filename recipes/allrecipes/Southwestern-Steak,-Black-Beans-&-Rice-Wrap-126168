In large bowl, combine canola oil and lemon juice. Add reserved Black Beans & Rice and toss gently to blend. If desired, warm mixture in microwave on high 2 to 3 minutes before making wraps. Working with two tortillas at a time, warm tortillas in microwave on high 15 seconds and place on cutting board. Spoon 1/2 cup of the Black Beans & Rice down center of each tortilla. Top each with 1/4 cup sliced Southwestern Steak, 1/2 cup lettuce, 2 tablespoons salsa and 1/4 cup avocado. Fold up bottom and wrap two sides over each other. Repeat.
