Steam or boil diced pears until very tender. Drain if necessary and mash or puree until you have your desired consistency. Let cool, then place in a sealed container in the fridge until ready to use. Prepare baby oatmeal cereal according to package directions, mixing until you have your desired consistency. Whisk egg. Whisk in 1/4 cup (60 mL) of pureed pears and 1 Tbsp (15 mL) prepared baby oatmeal until well combined. Heat a pan over medium heat. Add egg, oatmeal and pear mixture and cook, stirring often, until eggs are scrambled and completely cooked through. Remove from heat, let cool and chop into tiny pieces that your baby can manage.
