Let dough defrost and rise (if necessary) according to package directions. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Press dough into an approximately 15x8-inch natural shape on large nonstick baking sheet. Add tomatoes evenly over the dough except the outer inch (the crust). Sprinkle garlic over tomatoes, then add cheese. Sprinkle remaining ingredients over cheese. Bake for 10 to 14 minutes or until crust is lightly browned and cheese is melted. Let pizza stand 5 minutes. Cut into 8 pieces and serve immediately.
