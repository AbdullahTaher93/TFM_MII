Whisk water and cornstarch together in a bowl until smooth. Combine cranberry sauce, turkey drippings, curry powder, thyme, anise seed, cardamom, and orange zest in a small saucepan; cook, stirring occasionally, over medium heat for about 5 minutes. Stir cornstarch mixture to remove any lumps and pour into cranberry mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until gravy is thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.
