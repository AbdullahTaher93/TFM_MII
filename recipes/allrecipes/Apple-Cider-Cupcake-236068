Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 muffin tins with paper liners. In a medium saucepan, boil the apple cider over medium-high heat until it is reduced to 1 cup, 15 to 18 minutes. Let cool. If amount of cider is more than one cup, boil the cider a bit longer. If it is less, just add a bit more cider. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter and sugar until fluffy and light in color. Add eggs, one at a time, and beat after each addition until fully incorporated. Add sifted flour, allspice, cinnamon, salt, baking powder, and the cup of concentrated apple cider. Mix until well combined. Pour the batter into paper-lined muffin tins. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle of a cupcake comes out clean. Allow cupcakes to cool before frosting. In the bowl of a countertop mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter for 2-3 minutes, or until light and fluffy. Add the Kahlua Pumpkin Spice and 1 cup of confectioners sugar, and mix until fully incorporated. Continue adding the confectioners sugar 1 cup at a time and mixing after each addition until fully incorporated. Frost each cupcake.
