Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix honey, oil, balsamic vinegar, and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl until smooth; add sweet potato cubes and toss to coat. Spread coated sweet potato onto a baking sheet with a rim. Sprinkle parsley and salt over the sweet potatoes. Bake in preheated oven, turning potatoes occasionally, until the cubes are fork-tender throughout and beginning to crisp along some edges, about 1 hour. Season with more salt, if desired.
