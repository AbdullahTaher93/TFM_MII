Place lamb shoulder chops, carrots, onions, and potatoes in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in salt and cracked black pepper. Pour in vegetable broth and enough water to cover; drop in bay leaves. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Stir in split peas and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until lamb is very tender and split peas have broken apart to create a thick stew, about 1 1/2 more hours. Stir occasionally to keep stew from burning on the bottom.
