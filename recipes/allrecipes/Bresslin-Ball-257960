Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Divide sausage into 12 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball the size of an egg. Flatten each ball of sausage and wrap around a hard-boiled egg, covering it completely. Pour bread crumbs into a shallow bowl. Roll sausage-wrapped egg in bread crumbs until coated; transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven, turning every 10 minutes, until golden brown and crispy, about 40 minutes.
