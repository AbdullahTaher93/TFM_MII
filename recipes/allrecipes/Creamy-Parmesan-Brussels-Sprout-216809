Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Generously grease a 9x9-inch baking dish with butter. Spread the sliced Brussels sprouts out into the prepared baking dish in an even layer. In a bowl, whisk together the cream, Parmesan cheese, garlic, salt, and black pepper until thoroughly combined; pour the cream mixture over the Brussels sprouts. Sprinkle the top with nutmeg. Cover the dish with foil, and bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour; remove foil, and bake uncovered until the top has browned, 15 more minutes.
