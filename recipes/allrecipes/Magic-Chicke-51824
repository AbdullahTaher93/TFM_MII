Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Poke holes in both sides of the chicken breasts using a fork, and lay them in a baking dish. Pour the cooking wine over. Cover with artichokes and the artichoke marinade. Sprinkle mushrooms over. Bake for 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until chicken is no longer pink, and the juices run clear.
