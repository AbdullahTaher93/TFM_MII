Place potatoes in medium saucepan; add about 1 inch of water. Cover and cook 10-15 minutes or until tender. Drain very well. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 1 1/2-quart casserole with cooking spray. Mix apple butter, eggs, cream, honey, and 1/4 cup melted butter. Add potatoes and beat by hand or with electric mixer until mashed and well mixed. Spoon into casserole. Mix brown sugar, pecans, and remaining butter in small bowl. Sprinkle over potatoes. Bake 20-30 minutes or until hot and bubbly.
