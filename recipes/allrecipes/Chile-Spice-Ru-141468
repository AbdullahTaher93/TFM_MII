Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Stem and seed chiles. Spread them on a small baking sheet and roast until fragrant, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Spread cumin seeds on the baking sheet and roast until smoking and very fragrant, about 6 minutes. Stir in oregano and roast for 2 minutes more. Add to the bowl with the chiles, then add paprika and salt; stir to combine. Let cool slightly. Transfer to a food processor and process until the mixture is finely ground. Store in an airtight container for up to 3 months. Measure out 2 tablespoons of the rub. Using your hands, rub it evenly onto 1 1/2 pounds (6 servings) of your chosen protein just before grilling.
