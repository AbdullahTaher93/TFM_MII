Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Season pork with salt. Wrap bacon around edge of each chop; secure with wood toothpick. Combine 4 tbsp. barbecue sauce and 1/2 c. lager beer (or non-alcoholic beer). Heat oil in large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Stand chops bacon-side down in skillet, lean against side of pan if needed. With tongs, turn chops along bacon-wrapped edges to lightly brown bacon, about 3 1/2 min. (about 45 sec. to brown each section). Place chops, flat side down, in skillet; cook until underside is lightly browned, about 1 min. Turn chops over. Spread equal amount of beer/barbecue mixture over top of each chop, letting excess run into skillet. Place skillet with chops in oven and bake for 10 min. or until internal temperature on a thermometer reads 145 degrees F. Transfer each chop to a dinner plate and let stand while making sauce. Drain fat from skillet, leaving browned bits. Heat skillet over high heat until hot. Add broth and bring to a boil, scraping up browned bits with wooden spoon; boil until reduced by half, about 2 min. Top each chop with spoonful of sauce and serve hot.
