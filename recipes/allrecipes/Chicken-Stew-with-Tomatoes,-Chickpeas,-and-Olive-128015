Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Saute onion, garlic, and 1/4 cup cilantro until soft. Add chicken broth, chickpeas, tomatoes, pitted olives, marjoram, paprika, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil; lower heat and simmer 20 minutes. Add shredded chicken; simmer 5 minutes longer. Remove from heat; stir in zest and remaining tablespoon of cilantro. Meanwhile, bring 2 cups water, butter, and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a boil in a medium saucepan. Remove from heat, stir in couscous, and cover with a tight-fitting lid. Let stand 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork before serving with stew.
