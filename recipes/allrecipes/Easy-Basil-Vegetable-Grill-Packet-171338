Prepare a charcoal or gas grill for direct, medium heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above cooking grate only 4 to 5 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine corn pieces, tomatoes, zucchini, and onion. Drizzle with olive oil, then add basil, salt, and pepper; toss to combine. Cut four 12-inches squares of heavy-duty foil. In center of 1 piece, arrange 1/4 of the vegetable mixture. Bring the 2 opposite sides of foil together and fold to create a packet. Continue to securely fold remaining foil edges. Repeat with 3 remaining squares. Place packets on cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook, turning once with a wide spatula, until zucchini and onion are just tender-crisp to the bite (open a packet to check), about 15 minutes total. Set packets on a platter, then open and pour vegetables onto plates.
