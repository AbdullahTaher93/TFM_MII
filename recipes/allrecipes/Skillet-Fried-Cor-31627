Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown, but still soft. Stir in onion and green bell peppers, and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Stir corn into skillet, and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Salt and pepper to taste. Do not drain grease from bacon - that is the secret to the flavor.
