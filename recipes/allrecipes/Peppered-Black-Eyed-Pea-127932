Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the carrots, onion, and celery. Cook, stirring often, until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the green and red peppers. Cook 2 minutes longer. Add the peas and pour in the chicken stock. Cover, and cook until the peas are very tender and they have absorbed most of the stock, 10 to 15 minutes. Just before serving, stir in the crushed peppercorns and the parsley. Season with salt. Serve at once.
