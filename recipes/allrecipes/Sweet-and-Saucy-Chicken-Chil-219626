Heat oil in Dutch oven or large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add chicken, chopped onions and bell peppers. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and vegetables are softened. Stir in chili beans, tomatoes, chili sauce, cranberry sauce, chili powder, cumin, salt and black pepper. Bring to a simmer; reduce heat. Cover and cook for 1 hour. Or pour ingredients into 4 to 5-quart slow cooker. Cover and cook on low for 4 to 5 hours or until mixture is heated through. Divide chili evenly among bowls. Top with cheese, sour cream and green onions.
