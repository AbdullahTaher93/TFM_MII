Cut avocados into medium chunks (about 1/2 inch thick) inside their shells, then scoop into a bowl with a spoon. Add remaining ingredients and mix well, but to a chunky consistency. Season with salt to taste. Gently mix a little bit more to combine thoroughly. All ingredients can be adjusted to suit your taste. Pair with corn chips.
