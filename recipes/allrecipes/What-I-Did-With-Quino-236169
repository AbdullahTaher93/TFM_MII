Soak quinoa in a bowl of water for 20 minutes; drain. Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a frying pan over medium heat; saute onion, red bell pepper, and garlic until soft, 5 to 10 minutes. Combine chicken broth, quinoa, 1/4 cup onion mixture, 1/4 cup sofrito, 1 teaspoon cumin, cilantro, salt, and pepper in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Cover saucepan with a lid, reduce heat, and simmer until quinoa is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Stir corn into quinoa mixture and cook until corn is warmed, about 5 minutes. Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken, adobo seasoning, garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, salt, and pepper together until chicken is no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix quinoa mixture, remaining onion mixture, black beans, and 1/2 cup sofrito into chicken mixture; cook until heated through, 2 to 3 more minutes.
