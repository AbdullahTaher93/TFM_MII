Place the apples in a Dutch oven. Pour in the cider. Bring to a boil and cook on medium heat 30 minutes, or until soft. Press the softened mixture through a food mill. Continue cooking at a medium boil for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Mix in the sugar, cinnamon and cloves. Continue cooking over low heat until the sugar dissolves, stirring frequently. Cook until the desired thickness has been attained. Refrigerate the finished apple butter in sterile containers.
