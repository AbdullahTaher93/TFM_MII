Place salmon chunks, parsley, bread crumbs, green onion, seafood seasoning, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper in a food processor. Pulse until salmon is chopped. Shape salmon mixture into four patties. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pan-fry patties until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side.
