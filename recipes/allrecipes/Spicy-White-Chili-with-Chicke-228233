Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion, jalapeno, and garlic until onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Add chicken broth, Great Northern beans, garbanzo beans, corn, green chiles, cilantro, lime juice, cumin, and black pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir chicken into broth. Cover and simmer chili for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Whisk cornstarch and water together in a bowl; stir into chili and bring to a boil. Cook and stir until chili is thickened, about 5 minutes.
