In a small saucepan, combine the cornstarch and sugar. Stir in water; cook and stir until thickened and clear. Remove from the heat; stir in lemon juice. Cool. In a mixing bowl, whip the cream; fold cooled mixture into cream. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. For pudding, combine dry ingredients in another mixing bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender until particles are the size of small peas. Add eggs and milk and beat on low until thoroughly combine. Spread into a greased 9-in. square baking pan. Sprinkle berries over batter. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-55 minutes or until cake tests done. Serve warm or cold with Lemon Cream Sauce.
