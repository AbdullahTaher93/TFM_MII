Mix steak sauce, lime juice and 1 tablespoon of the chipotle peppers until well blended. Remove 1/2 cup of the steak sauce mixture for brushing onto steaks as they cook. Pour remaining steak sauce mixture over steaks in large resealable plastic bag; seal bag. Turn bag over several times to evenly coat steaks. Refrigerate 30 minutes to marinate. Meanwhile, mix butter and remaining 2 tablespoons chipotle peppers until well blended; cover. Refrigerate until ready to use. Preheat grill to medium heat. Remove steaks from marinade; discard bag and marinade. Grill steaks 8 to 10 minutes for medium-rare to medium doneness, turning occasionally and brushing with the reserved steak sauce mixture. Remove steaks from grill; cut in half. Top with the butter mixture before serving.
