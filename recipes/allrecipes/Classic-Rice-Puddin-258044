Combine rice and water in medium saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer 25 minutes, or until rice is very tender and most of water is absorbed. In separate bowl combine sugar, cornstarch and salt. Add milk and sugar mixture to rice. Heat to boiling; boil 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Stir in butter and vanilla. Slowly stir about 1 cup of the hot rice mixture into beaten egg yolks in a bowl. Blend into remaining mixture in saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, just until mixture starts to bubble. Remove from heat. Serve warm or chilled, with the option of adding cinnamon and/or blueberries.
