Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lay the chicken breasts out flat and sprinkle with Ranch-style dressing mix. Sprinkle a bit of cheese onto each half of each breast. Place 2 tomato slices and a sliced jalapeno pepper onto each one, and sprinkle more cheese over the tomato and pepper. Fold each piece of chicken over, and wrap with 2 slices of bacon. Secure with toothpicks. Place wrapped chicken into a baking dish, and cover with aluminum foil. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until the chicken is no longer pink, and the juices run clear.
