In a medium bowl, thoroughly mix mayonnaise and dry Italian-style salad dressing mix. Arrange the cocktail rye bread slices in a single layer on a serving platter. Place mayonnaise mixture in a pastry bag and squeeze an approximately 1 inch dollop of the mixture onto each cocktail rye bread slice. Top each cocktail rye bread slice with a cucumber slice.
