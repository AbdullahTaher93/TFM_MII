Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Using a mixer, cream shortening and sugars until fluffy. Add egg and extracts and beat well. Add flour, baking powder, salt, nuts and mix well. Form into 1 inch balls. Press each ball around a kiss so kiss is completely covered (like a chocolate covered cherry). Bake 12 minutes on ungreased cookie sheet (do not overbake). Cool on wire rack. Frost or decorate as desired.
