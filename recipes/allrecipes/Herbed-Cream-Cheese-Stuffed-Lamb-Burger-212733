Mix cream cheese and herbs until well blended. Roll into 4 balls; flatten each into disk on sheet of waxed paper. Refrigerate 15 min. or until firm. Combine meat, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper. Shape into 8 thin patties. Place cream cheese disks on 4 patties; cover with remaining patties. Press edges together to seal. Heat oil in large skillet on medium heat. Add patties; cook about 5-6 min. on each side or until done (160 degrees F). Serve in rolls topped with watercress.
