Heat the oil in a soup pot over medium-low heat. Stir in the onion, celery, cabbage, carrots, and garlic. Cover the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables soften, 12 to 15 minutes. Add the white beans and 5 cups of the broth; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir in the thyme and savory or sage. Cover and cook until the beans are almost tender, 1 to 1.5 hours, adding broth if the soup becomes too thick. Stir in the green beans and zucchini. Partially cover and cook until the beans are tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Season with the pepper and basil or dill (if using). Divide among bowls.
