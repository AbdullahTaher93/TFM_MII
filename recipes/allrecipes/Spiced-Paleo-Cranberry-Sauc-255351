Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Add cranberries. Simmer over medium heat, stirring regularly, until cranberries burst, about 10 minutes. Stir in ginger, cloves, and orange zest. Pour in orange juice. Microwave honey in a microwave-safe bowl until runny, about 30 seconds. Scrape into the pot with a spatula. Add blueberries. Simmer until flavors combine, about 20 minutes. Remove sauce from heat and stir in cherry juice concentrate. Transfer cranberry sauce to small bowls and chill until set, about 1 hour.
