Bring water to a boil in a large soup pot and stir ditalini pasta into the boiling water. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 12 minutes. Stir tomato sauce, cannellini beans, kidney beans, black-eyed peas, frozen green peas, corn, potato, carrots, onion, garlic, parsley, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper into pasta. Bring soup to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer to blend flavors, 30 to 45 minutes. Serve topped with olive oil and Parmesan cheese.
