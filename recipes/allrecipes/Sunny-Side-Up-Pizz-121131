Place crust on a greased pizza pan. Using a 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter, cut out six circles from crust, evenly spaced and about 1 in. from edge. (Remove circles and save for another use.) Bread an egg into each hole. Sprinkle with cheese, bacon, peppers and onion. Bake at 450 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until the eggs are completely set.
