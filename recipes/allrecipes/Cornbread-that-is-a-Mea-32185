Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a skillet over medium-high heat, cook the ground beef with about half of the chopped onion until meat is no longer pink and onion is tender. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Drain juices and set aside. Empty packages of cornbread mix into a large bowl. Mix in the milk, eggs and creamed corn until smooth. Fold in the ground beef mixture and pickled jalapenos. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan, and sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the top. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.
