Stir boiling water into gelatin in large bowl at least 2 minutes until completely dissolved. Stir in cold water and spices. Refrigerate about 1-1/2 hours or until thickened (spoon drawn through leaves a definite impression). Meanwhile, mix cream cheese and sugar in small bowl with wire whisk until smooth. Gently stir in whipped topping. Spread on bottom of crust. Refrigerate. Stir apples and walnuts into thickened gelatin. Refrigerate 10 to 15 minutes or until mixture is very thick and will mound. Spoon over cream cheese layer. Refrigerate 4 hours or until firm. Store leftover pie in refrigerator.
