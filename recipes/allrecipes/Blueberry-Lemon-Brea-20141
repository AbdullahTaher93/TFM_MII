Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Dredge the blueberries in 2 teaspoons flour; set aside. In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition. Mix in the lemon zest. In a separate bowl combine flour, baking powder and salt. Stir the flour mixture into the egg mixture alternately with the milk. Fold in the blueberries. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan. Bake in preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Allow bread to cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan.
