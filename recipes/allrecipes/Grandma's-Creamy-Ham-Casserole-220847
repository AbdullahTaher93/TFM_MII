Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain. Mix egg noodles, ham, evaporated milk, cream of chicken soup, onion, and processed cheese food in a 9x13-inch baking dish until evenly distributed. Bake in preheated oven until bubbly and cheese food is melted, about 1 hour. About 5 minutes before end of baking, sprinkle chips atop casserole and return to oven; bake for 5 minutes more.
