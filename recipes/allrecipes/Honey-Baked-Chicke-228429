Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken breasts into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Whisk butter, honey, mustard, salt, and curry powder together in a bowl until smooth; pour sauce evenly over chicken. Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling and chicken is no longer pink inside, 30 to 45 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
