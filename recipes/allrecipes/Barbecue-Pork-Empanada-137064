Heat oven to 375 degrees F. In medium bowl, mix all empanada ingredients except dough, cutting up large pieces of pork if necessary. Separate dough into 8 biscuits. Press or roll each into 6-inch round. Divide filling evenly onto half of each biscuit round to within 1/4 inch of edge. Fold dough round over filling; press edges to seal. Place on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15 to 20 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Meanwhile, mix all sauce ingredients. Immediately remove empanadas from cookie sheet. Serve warm with sauce for dipping.
