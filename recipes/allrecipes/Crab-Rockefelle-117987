In a large saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Stir in flour until smooth; gradually add the milk. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Reduce heat; add the cheese and stir until smooth. Add the spinach and crab. Transfer to a greased shallow 1-qt. baking dish. Melt the remaining butter; toss with bread crumbs. Sprinkle over the top. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until bubbly.
