Pour a little boiling water into a large teapot, swish it around to heat the pot, and pour the water out. Add the tea bags to the teapot and pour in 1 cup of the boiling water. Cover and let steep 3 minutes. Add the sugar and mint leaves and stems to the teapot. Pour in the remaining 3 cups boiling water. Cover and let steep for 5 minutes. Stir. Continue to steep for 5 minutes more. Strain the mint tea into cups or heatproof glasses.
