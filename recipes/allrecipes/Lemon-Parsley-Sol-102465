Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and put exhaust fan on. Mix bread crumbs, cheese, garlic powder, salt and pepper in a shallow pan. Brush both sides of each fish fillet with butter and then dredge in bread crumb mixture. Arrange fish on a wire rack set over a baking sheet, sprinkle with parsley; and bake until fillets are golden and cooked through, about 10 minutes for 1/4-inch thick fillets and up to 15 for 1/2-inch thick fillets. Serve with lemon wedges.
