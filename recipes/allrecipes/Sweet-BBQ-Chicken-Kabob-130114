Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Using eight long wooden skewers, (two, side-by-side, for each kabob) thread chicken alternately with pineapple and peppers onto skewers, to create four kabobs. Mix barbecue sauce and juice; brush on kabobs. Grill kabobs 8 to 10 min. or until chicken is cooked through, brushing occasionally with remaining sauce.
