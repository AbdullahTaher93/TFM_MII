Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add tofu, garlic, and about half of the oyster sauce. Cook for about 5 minutes, until garlic is lightly browned but not burning. Remove from the skillet to a bowl, and set aside. Add the frozen vegetables to the same skillet and cook vegetables according to package directions, substituting chicken broth for the water, and seasoning with the remaining oyster sauce. When vegetables are cooked, mix the tofu garlic mixture back into the pan, and heat through. Serve plain or over rice.
