Heat oil in large saucepan. Add pork and onion; cook until pork begins to brown, stirring occasionally. Stir in remaining ingredients. Cover and simmer over medium heat 10 to 15 minutes or until pork is tender. Ladle chili into bowls. Or, enjoy as you would in Mexico, spooned over hot cooked rice and topped with slivered almonds and sliced green olives.
