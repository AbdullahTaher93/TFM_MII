Peel cucumber; cut in half lengthwise. Scoop out seeds with a spoon. Cut each half lengthwise into four strips; set aside. In a small mixing bowl, combine the cream cheese, mustard and dill. Spread about 2 tablespoons over each ham slice. Place a cucumber strip on the wide end; roll up tightly jelly-roll style. Cut off any cucumber that extends beyond ham slice. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Cut into 3/4-in. slices.
