To make sauce, chop onion in a food processor using the metal blade. Add tomatoes with the juice, salsa, and taco seasoning, and pulse until tomatoes are in small pieces, 3 or 4 times. Remove to a medium bowl and stir in beans. To make ricotta layer, break up egg in a small bowl with a fork. Stir in ricotta and garlic. Spread 1 cup tomato sauce mixture over the bottom of a greased 9x13-inch casserole dish; it should barely cover. Top with 5 noodles, overlapping slightly. Sprinkle with half the chicken and half the chiles. Spoon 2 cups tomato sauce mixture on top, then add the rest of the ricotta mixture; spread lightly. Sprinkle with half the shredded cheese. Top with remaining noodles, chicken, chiles, tomato sauce mixture, and shredded cheese. Bake uncovered in a 350 degrees F oven for 40 minutes or until noodles are tender when pierced with a sharp knife. Cool at least 20 minutes before serving. The casserole will stay warm for up to an hour and can be reheated if desired.
