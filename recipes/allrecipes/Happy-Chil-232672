Combine sausage, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, white kidney beans, red kidney beans, dark red kidney beans, onion, celery, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, oregano, sugar, and cayenne pepper in a large pot; bring to boil.
