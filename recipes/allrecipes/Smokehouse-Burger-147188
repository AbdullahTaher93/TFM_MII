Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Shape meat into four patties. Brush onion slices with 2 tablespoons of the dressing. Grill patties and onions 5 minutes on each side or until patties are cooked through (160 degrees F) and onions are tender, brushing onions occasionally with remaining 2 tablespoons dressing and brushing burgers with barbecue sauce. Top each patty with Singles; grill an additional 1 to 2 minutes or until Singles begin to melt. Place 1 lettuce leaf, 1 tomato slice and burger on bottom half of each bun. Cover with onions and tops of buns.
