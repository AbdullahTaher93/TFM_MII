Whisk flour, salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Dredge turkey in the flour mixture. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the turkey and cook until just beginning to color, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Increase heat to medium-high. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon oil and mushrooms; cook, stirring often, until softened, 2 to 4 minutes. Cover, reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are tender, 2 to 4 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high, add Marsala and broth; bring to a boil. Cook, stirring with a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits, until the sauce thickens slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, return the turkey to the pan. Cook, turning once, until the turkey is heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve garnished with parsley.
