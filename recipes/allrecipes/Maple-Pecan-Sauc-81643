In a sauce pan combine the water, maple flavoring, Splenda and the guar gum. Stir until guar gum is completely dissolved. Place the sauce pan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally until it comes to a boil. Reduce heat to the lowest setting and add the chopped pecans and butter. Cook for 1 or 2 minutes to bring out the flavor of the pecans. Stir occasionally. If it gets too thick then just add some more water, stirring it in vigorously.
