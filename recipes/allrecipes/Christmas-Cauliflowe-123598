In a large saucepan, cook cauliflower in a small amount of water for 6-7 minutes or until crisp-tender; drain well. In a medium saucepan, saute green pepper and mushrooms in butter for 2 minutes. Add flour; gradually stir in milk. Bring to a boil; boil for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat; stir in cheese until melted. Add pimientos and salt. Place half of the cauliflower in a greased 2-qt. baking dish; top with half of the sauce. Repeat layers. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 25 minutes or until bubbly. Sprinkle with paprika if desired.
