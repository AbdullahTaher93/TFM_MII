Pour alfredo sauce into a small saucepan and stir over medium heat until hot. Reduce heat to low, and keep warm. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season pork chops with salt and pepper, and place into pan. Cook pork chops until browned on both sides, and no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a separate large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in mushrooms, and cook for 1 minute before adding basil, oregano, dill, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Continue cooking until the mushrooms begin to release their liquid, then pour in wine. Simmer until the wine has reduced by half, then quickly stir in the butter. To serve, place pork chops onto a serving platter and top with the mushroom mixture. Ladle Alfredo sauce over top, and sprinkle with grapes, almonds, and the remaining 2 tablespoons parsley to garnish.
