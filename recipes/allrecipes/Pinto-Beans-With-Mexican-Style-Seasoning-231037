Place pinto beans into a large pot and pour in enough water to cover by 2 to 3 inches. Let beans soak overnight. Drain beans, return to pot, and pour in fresh water to cover; add diced tomatoes, bacon, onion, chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 3 hours. Stir cilantro and salt into bean mixture; simmer until beans are soft, about 1 more hour.
