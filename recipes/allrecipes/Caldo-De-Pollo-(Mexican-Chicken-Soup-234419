Combine 6 cups chicken broth, water, chicken tenders, chicken bouillon cubes, olive oil, granulated garlic, cumin, salt, and pepper in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover pot, and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 25 minutes. Gently shred chicken using 2 forks. Add onion to broth and simmer for about 5 more minutes. Bring 2 cups chicken broth, rice, and chili powder to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 25 minutes. Spoon rice into each serving bowl and pour soup over rice. Garnish with avocado slices and cilantro.
