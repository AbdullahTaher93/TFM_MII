Crush 35 of the wafers. Mix crumbs with sugar and butter until well blended. Press firmly onto bottom and up side of 9-inch pie plate. Pour 1 cup of the milk into medium bowl. Add dry white chocolate flavor pudding mix. Beat with wire whisk 2 min. or until well blended. (Mixture will be thick.) Add 1 cup of the whipped topping; stir gently until well blended. Spread evenly onto bottom of crust. Top with 12 of the remaining wafers. Pour remaining 1 cup milk into separate medium bowl. Add remaining dry pudding mix. Beat with wire whisk 2 min. Gently stir in 1 cup of the remaining whipped topping; spread evenly over wafer layer. Refrigerate at least 3 hours. Meanwhile, melt chocolate as directed on package. Dip one-third of each of the remaining 10 wafers in chocolate. Turn wafers slightly, then dip the opposite side of each wafer in chocolate, leaving a V-shaped portion of each wafer uncoated in the center. Use a wooden toothpick to decorate wafers with some of the remaining chocolate to resemble bow ties. Add "buttons" with small drops of the remaining chocolate. Place on waxed paper-covered baking sheets; let stand until chocolate is firm. Top pie with remaining whipped topping just before serving. Garnish with decorated wafers. Store any leftover pie in refrigerator.
