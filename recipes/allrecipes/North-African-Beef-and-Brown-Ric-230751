Cook and stir steak, onion, and tomato-chicken bouillon together in a large pot over medium heat until steak is browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic, 1 cup water, beef stock concentrate, carrots, and sweet potatoes to the steak mixture; cook and stir until carrots and sweet potatoes are softened, about 20 minutes. Mix 1 1/2 cups water, cabbage, cinnamon sticks, paprika, cumin, black pepper, coriander, and cardamom seeds into the steak-sweet potato mixture; bring to a boil. Add brown rice and reduce heat to low. Cover pot and simmer until rice has absorbed the liquid, about 45 minutes. Fluff rice and remove cinnamon sticks before serving.
