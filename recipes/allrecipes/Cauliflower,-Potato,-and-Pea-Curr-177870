Pour 2 cups water into a 3- to 4-quart pan. Bring to a boil over high heat, add potatoes, cover, and cook for 5 minutes. Add cauliflower to potatoes, cover, and continue to cook for another 6 to 8 minutes until potatoes and cauliflower can be easily pierced with a fork. Drain and keep warm. Meanwhile, in a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat, stir onion and garlic often in butter until brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. Add poppy seeds (if using), curry powder, ginger, cumin, and hot chili flakes; stir often for 1 minute. Stir in yogurt, then peas, potatoes, cauliflower, and cilantro. Add salt to taste.
