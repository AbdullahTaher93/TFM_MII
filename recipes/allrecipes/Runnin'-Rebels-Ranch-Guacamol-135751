In a medium bowl, using a fork or potato masher, mash the avocados until chunky. Add the onion, cilantro, bell pepper, and chile. In a small bowl, combine the lime juice and package of Hidden Valley(R) Original Ranch(R) Salad Dressing & Seasoning Mix. Add to the avocado mixture along with the pepper and stir gently to combine. Transfer the dip to a serving bowl and place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the guacamole, pressing to eliminate any air pockets (this will help keep the guacamole from turning brown). Serve at room temperature.
