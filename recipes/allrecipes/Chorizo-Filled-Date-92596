Cut the ends off of the chorizo, and cut into 12 cubes. Stuff each piece inside one of the dates. Wrap a piece of bacon around each date, and secure with toothpicks. This part may all be done ahead of time. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Place the dates in the pan with the bacon seam side down. Fry until golden, then turn and fry on the other side until bacon is cooked through. You may serve them now, or proceed to coat and fry them. Heat the oil in a deep-fryer or large skillet to 375 degrees F 190 degrees C. Whisk together the egg and water in a small bowl. Coat the dates with flour, then dip into the egg. Place immediately into the hot oil, and fry until golden, turning once. This will take about 4 minutes total. Drain and serve right away.
