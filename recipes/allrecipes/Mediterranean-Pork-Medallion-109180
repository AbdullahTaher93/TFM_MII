Heat a large pan over low heat. In a medium bowl, toss pork medallions with oil and a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper. Increase heat under pan to medium-high. Add medallions and cook, turning once, until well seared on both sides and cooked through, about 8 minutes. Transfer medallions to a plate. In a small bowl, mix wine, broth, olives, mustard, garlic and oregano. Pour into hot skillet and simmer until reduced by half, about 3 to 4 minutes. Place medallions back in the pan and allow to warm through for 1 minute before serving.
