In medium skillet over medium-high heat, cook ground beef, stirring until crumbly and no longer pink. Drain fat. Stir in cheese spread and cook until heated through. To assemble, spread heaping tablespoon refried beans on each flour tortilla. Place taco shell in center. Fold sides of flour tortilla onto taco shell to stick. Fill each taco shell with about 2 tablespoons beef mixture. Top with lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and ripe olives. Serve with salsa or taco sauce.
