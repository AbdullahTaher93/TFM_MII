Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Using a serrated knife cut baguette into 16 slices. Lightly spray both sides with olive oil cooking spray and place on baking sheets. Bake for 8 minutes, or until light golden brown. Remove from oven and let cool. Coat each crostini with Dietz & Watson Stone Ground Mustard. Place 2 strips of roast port and 1 slice of Swiss cheese on top of crostini and top with a few slices of dill pickles. Season with salt and pepper.
