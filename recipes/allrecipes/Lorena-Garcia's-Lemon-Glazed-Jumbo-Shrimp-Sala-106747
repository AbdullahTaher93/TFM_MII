Heat oil in a medium skillet over high heat; add shrimp and cook 1 minute. Stir in lemon juice and cook 3 to 4 minutes or until shrimp are cooked through. Using tongs, transfer shrimp to a plate. Add vinegar, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, crushed red pepper, and jalapeno; bring to a boil and cook 4-5 minutes or reduced by half then remove from heat and set aside. Place arugula, red pepper, mango in a large bowl; toss gently with some of the dressing and season to taste. Divide arugula mixture among 4 serving plates; top each salad with two shrimp and drizzle evenly with the warm vinegar mixture.
