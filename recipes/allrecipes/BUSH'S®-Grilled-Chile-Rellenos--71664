Cut poblano chiles in half lengthwise to create a boat for filling; scrape out seeds.* Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet. Add onion, garlic, jalapenos, red bell pepper, cilantro and cumin and cook over medium heat until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Remove pan from heat and stir in BUSH'S Vegetarian Baked Beans, hot sauce and 8 ounces cheese. Add salt and pepper to taste. Spoon the mixture into the hollowed chiles and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Preheat grill to medium. Arrange chiles on grill away from heat. Cook until chiles are tender and cheese is browned and bubbling, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from grill and serve at once.
