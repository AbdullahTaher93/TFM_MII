Season steaks with salt and pepper. Whisk eggs in shallow bowl and spread bread crumbs on a plate. Dip steaks into egg, then into bread crumbs, completely coating both sides. Heat oil in large skillet over high heat. Cook steaks 2-3 minutes per side. Top steaks with marinara and cheese, and place under broiler until sauce bubbles and cheese melts. Serve immediately.
