To make the roasted poblano cream, firstly preheat barbecue grill. Rub oil on onion slices. Place chiles, tomatoes, and onion slices on grid 4 inches above a solid bed of hot coals, or over high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level for only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook vegetables, turning as needed, until well browned on all sides, 8 to 12 minutes; as done, transfer to a board. When cool enough to handle, peel, stem, and seed chiles; core and peel tomatoes. Chop chiles, tomatoes, and onion. In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium heat, stir vegetables until hot, about 2 minutes. Add sour cream and stir just until hot but not boiling, about 2 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Scrape mixture into a bowl; keep warm. To make the steak tacos, rinse beef; pat dry. Cut steak crosswise into 6- to 8-inch lengths. If beef is thicker than 1/4 inch, place between sheets of plastic wrap and, with a flat mallet, gently and evenly pound to 1/4 inch. Sprinkle both sides of beef with salt and pepper; set on a plate. In a wide bowl, mix green onions with oil to coat. Set onions on grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level for only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning occasionally, until onions are well browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a large board or platter. Lay beef on grill; close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning once, until beef is done to your liking (cut to test), 5 to 6 minutes total. Transfer to board or platter with onions. Add salt and pepper to taste.
