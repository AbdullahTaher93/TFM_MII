Pour the whole box of pasta into a large skillet (approximately 12 inches in diameter). Pour 3 cups of cold water into skillet, ensuring that the water covers the pasta. Turn the burner to high, then set your timer for 10 minutes (optional: add a bit of salt to taste). Cook on high, stirring occasionally, until almost all of the liquid has evaporated. Add chili and bring to a simmer, then fold in the processed cheese. Remove from heat and top with corn chips and Cheddar cheese. Serve immediately.
