Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large skillet over medium high heat, brown pork chops on both sides and set aside. In a large bowl, combine the sour cream, soup and milk. Add the hash browns and chopped onion; stir to coat. Place mixture in a 13x9-inch baking dish and sprinkle the cheese over the top. Place the browned pork chops on top. Bake in the preheated oven for 50 minutes or until the potatoes are heated through and pork chops are fully cooked.
