Soften cream cheese by zapping it in the microwave for a few seconds. Blend in the lemon juice. Using about 80% of the lox (the remainder is used for a garnish) blend into the cream cheese using a fork or spoon. If you would like a brighter pink color add 1/2 tsp (or more) of the Carb Options(TM) French Dressing. Separate the endive leaves. You should be able to get 8 to 10 good whole leaves. To construct: Place a pinch of sprouts on each endive leaf, all laying the same direction. Use a melon baller or a rounded tablespoon to add a scoop of the cream cheese/salmon mixer. Place a little strip of the lox on top and a tiny bit of dill on top of that. Serve right away or cover and refrigerate until needed.
