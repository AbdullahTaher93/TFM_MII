Whisk together juice, honey, oil, ginger, cumin, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Halve peaches, remove pits, and place in a large self-sealing freezer bag with half the marinade. Place tenderloins in another bag with the remaining marinade. Put sealed bags in refrigerator to marinate 2 hours, or overnight. Preheat the grill to medium heat. Remove tenderloins from marinade; cook, searing all sides, about 4 minutes per side. Halfway through, place peaches on grill, cut side down. Sear 5 minutes; turn, brush with marinade, and cook 5 minutes more (do not burn). Let tenderloins rest 10 minutes on a cutting board. Slice thinly and serve with grilled peaches.
