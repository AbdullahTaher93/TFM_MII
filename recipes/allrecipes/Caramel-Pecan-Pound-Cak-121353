In a mixing bowl, cream butter. Gradually beat in sugars until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Stir in vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; add to the creamed mixture alternately with milk. Beat on low speed just until blended. Fold in pecans. Pour into a greased and floured 10-in. tube pan. Bake at 325 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar. Serve with fruit if desired.
