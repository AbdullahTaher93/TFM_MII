Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Stir cake mix, butter, and egg together in a large bowl. Press half of the dough into the bottom of the greased baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 10 minutes. Mix condensed milk, peanut butter, chocolate chips, and peanut butter cups together thoroughly in a bowl. Spread over the baked cake layer. Pinch off small pieces of the remaining cake dough and scatter evenly over the condensed milk layer. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set and top is dry, about 25 minutes.
