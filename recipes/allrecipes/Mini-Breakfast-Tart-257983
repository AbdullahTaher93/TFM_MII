Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange pie shells on a rimmed baking sheet. Mix milk, eggs, chives, hot sauce, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Divide Italian cheese blend, bacon, and sun-dried tomatoes evenly among the pie shells. Cover evenly with beaten egg mixture. Bake in preheated oven until eggs are set, about 30 minutes.
