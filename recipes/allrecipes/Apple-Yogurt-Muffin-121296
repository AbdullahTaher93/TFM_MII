In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Combine the yogurt, egg, oil and milk; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Stir in apple and raisins if desired (batter will be thick). Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. For topping, combine flour, sugar and cinnamon in a bowl; cut in butter until crumbly. Sprinkle over batter. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-24 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
