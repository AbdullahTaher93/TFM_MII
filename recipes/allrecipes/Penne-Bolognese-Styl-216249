Cook the beef, onion and carrots in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until the beef is well-browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat. Stir the sauce and water in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 15 minutes or until the vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in additional water, if needed, until desired consistency. Place the basil and penne into a large bowl. Add the beef mixture and toss to coat. Sprinkle with the cheese.
