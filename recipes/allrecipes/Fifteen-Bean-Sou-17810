Soak beans in a large bowl overnight; drain. In a large pot over medium high heat, combine the beans, bacon, onion, garlic powder and mixed vegetables. Fill with water to cover and season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 60 to 90 minutes, or until beans are tender.
