Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch (23-cm) springform pan with nonstick spray. In a medium bowl, mix the crumbs, sugar, and 3 tablespoons (45 mL) of the jam. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom of the pan. In a large bowl, use an electric mixer set at medium speed to beat together the two types of cream cheese until they are light and fluffy. Add the milk, egg whites or egg substitute, the egg, and lemon juice, and beat until the mixture is smooth. Pour the batter into the pan. Place the pan inside a larger one filled with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. Bake the cake until its edges are lightly browned and the center is nearly set, 50 to 55 minutes. Cool the cake on a wire rack for 30 minutes, then refrigerate it overnight. Arrange the strawberries on top of the chilled cheesecake; brush the strawberries with the remaining 5 tablespoons (75 mL) of melted jam. Refrigerate until set.
