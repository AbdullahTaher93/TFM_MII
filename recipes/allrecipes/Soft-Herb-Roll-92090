In a large bowl, sprinkle yeast over 1/4 cup cool (70 degrees F) water. Let stand until dissolved, about 5 minutes. Stir in sugar, salt, parsley, dill, chives, rosemary, butter, whole egg, and milk, then stir in 3 1/4 cups flour until moistened. Scrape dough onto a lightly floured board; knead until smooth, elastic, and no longer sticky, 12 to 15 minutes. Add flour as required to prevent sticking. Shape dough into 12 equal balls; evenly space in a buttered 9- by 13-inch pan. Let rise as directed in next step or, if making ahead, wrap airtight and chill up to 24 hours, then let rise. Place pan in a warm place; let dough rise until double in size, 45 to 60 minutes. Brush with beaten egg; bake in a 350 degrees F oven until deep golden, 25 to 30 minutes.
