Make watermelon stars as directed (below). In a food processor combine watermelon, strawberries, 2 tablespoons lime juice, orange juice concentrate, simple syrup, salt, and hot sauce. Whirl until mixture forms a smooth slush. (To make ahead and store up to 2 weeks, scoop slush into a resealable freezer bag and seal. When ready to use, let stand at room temperature to soften.) In a small bowl, mix together tequila, remaining 6 tablespoons lime juice, and the orange liqueur; keep cold. Into each chilled margarita glass (at least 3/4-cup size) mound about 1/4 of the watermelon-strawberry slush. In each glass, pour 1/4 tequila mixture over the slush. Garnish each glass with a watermelon star on a skewer. Dip star in drink to muddle between sips.
