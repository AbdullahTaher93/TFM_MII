Place all the ingredients in a food processor. Process with on/off pulses until well blended. Pour into a 1 quart container and place in freezer. Stir mixture every 15-30 minutes, until ice crystals form and the mixture is firm. This will take about 2 hours This is best served soon after preparing it, but may be stored in the freezer for a week. Let soften for 15 minutes at room temperature before serving.
