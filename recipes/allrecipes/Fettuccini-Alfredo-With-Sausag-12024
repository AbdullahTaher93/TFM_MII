In a large pot with boiling salted water cook fettuccini until al dente. Drain. In a large skillet cook sausage until brown. Drain and set aside. To make the Alfredo sauce, melt butter in medium saucepan over low heat. Add heavy cream and Locatella cheese and cook, stirring frequently, until mixture comes to a soft boil. If desired, add parsley. Pour Alfredo sauce over fettuccini noodles and top with the cooked sausage. Serve immediately as sauce will separate upon cooling.
