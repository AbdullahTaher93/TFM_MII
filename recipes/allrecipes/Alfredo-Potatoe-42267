Pierce potatoes several times with a fork and place on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave on high for 6 minutes or until tender. Allow potatoes to cool slightly. Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the Alfredo sauce, garlic powder, pepper and thyme. Stir in 1/2 cup cheddar cheese and mozzarella cheese. Cut potatoes in half lengthwise. Scoop out the pulp, leaving a thin shell. Mash the pulp and add to the sauce mixture; mix well. Spoon into potato shells. Sprinkle with remaining cheddar cheese. Microwave on high for 1 minute or until cheese is melted.
