In a 5- to 6-quart pan, bring about 3 quarts water to a boil over high heat; stir in pasta and cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, cut prosciutto into 1/4-inch-wide strips. Then rub with your fingers to separate the pieces. In a wide frying pan, combine cheese and milk. Stir over high heat until cheese is melted and sauce is smooth (about 3 minutes). Stir in prosciutto, then reduce heat to low and keep sauce warm. After pasta has cooked for 10 minutes, add spinach, pushing it down to immerse it in the water. Continue to cook until pasta is tender to bite (1 to 2 more minutes). Pour pasta mixture into a colander and drain well, then return to cooking pan. Add sauce and mix well, lifting with 2 forks. Serve in wide bowls. Season with pepper to taste.
