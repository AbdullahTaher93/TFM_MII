Place squash in a large saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook 10 minutes or until tender. Drain, and cool slightly. When cool enough, remove the skin. Transfer squash to a medium bowl. Mix in the honey, dark brown sugar, cinnamon, and allspice. Mash together thoroughly, and serve warm.
