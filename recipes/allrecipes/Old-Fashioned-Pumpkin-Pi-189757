Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Roll out pastry and line a pie pan. Shape the crust as desired. Cut a circle of foil to fit pie shell; line shell with foil, molding it up sides. Half-fill foil with raw beans or pie weights. Bake for 10 minutes. Lift off foil and beans; bake for 5 more minutes. Place on a rack and let cool. In a large bowl, beat pumpkin, half-and-half, eggs, sour cream, molasses, brown sugar, flour, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, vanilla and cloves until smoothly blended. Pour mixture into pie crust. Bake pie in lower third of oven for 15 minutes. Reduce oven heat to 350 degrees F and continue to bake until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean (40 to 45 more minutes). Place on a rack and let cool to room temperature; serve, or refrigerate for up to 24 hours. Whip cream until it holds soft peaks; fold in candied ginger (optional). Serve each slice with a dollop of whipped cream.
