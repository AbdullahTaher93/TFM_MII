Heat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Divide pizza dough in half; roll out or pat each half into 12-inch round on parchment-covered baking sheet or pizza pan. Mix rosemary, oil and garlic until blended; brush half evenly onto dough. Top with vegetables; brush with remaining oil mixture. Bake 15 minutes or until edges of crusts are lightly browned and potatoes are tender. Top with cheese; bake 5 minutes or until melted.
