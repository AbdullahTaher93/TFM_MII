Bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Add the barley and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 35 minutes, or until the barley is tender but firm to the bite. Drain off any remaining liquid. Place the barley in a medium bowl, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes, or until cooled. Meanwhile, in a large serving bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, flaxseed oil, mint, pepper, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Add the barley, tomatoes, cucumber, onion, and cilantro; toss to coat well. Let stand for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.
