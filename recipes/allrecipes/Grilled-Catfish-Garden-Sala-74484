Prepare Balsamic-Garlic Marinade/Dressing by combining marinade/dressing ingredients in a jar with a tight-fitting lid. Screw the lid on tightly and shake to blend. Preheat grill to medium-high heat. In quart-sized resealable bag, marinate catfish fillets in one-fourth of the marinade/dressing; shake vigorously and marinate in refrigerator for at least 15 minutes. Split vegetables (except lettuce) between two separate gallon-sized resealable bags, add one-fourth of the marinade/dressing to each bag. Shake vigorously to coat and marinate in refrigerator for at least 15 minutes. When ready to grill, oil grill, then place catfish fillets and vegetables on the grill. Discard leftover marinade from catfish bag, but reserve excess marinade from vegetable bags. The catfish fillets should cook about 10 minutes per inch of thickness, turning once during grilling. The fillets are done when they are opaque and they begin to flake when tested with a fork. Asparagus and peppers should cook for about 2 to 3 minutes per side; remaining vegetables should cook for about 4 to 6 minutes per side; all vegetables should be turned once during grilling. After removing catfish fillets and vegetables from grill, allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Place lettuce in a large salad bowl. Dice grilled vegetables and fillets into bite-sized pieces (approximately 1/2 inch squares) and add to lettuce. Top salad with remaining one-fourth of marinade/dressing and reserved marinade/dressing from vegetable bags.
