Stir the stuffing, soup, corn, onion and celery in a medium bowl. Spoon the stuffing mixture into a greased 9-inch pie plate. Top with the pork. Stir the brown sugar and mustard in a small bowl until the mixture is smooth. Spread the mixture on the pork. Bake at 400 degrees F for 30 minutes or until the pork is cooked through.
