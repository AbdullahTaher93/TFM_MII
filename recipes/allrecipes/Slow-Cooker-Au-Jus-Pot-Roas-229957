Rub chuck roast with 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce and sprinkle on all sides with steak seasoning. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the roast in the hot oil until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer roast to a slow cooker. Dissolve beef bouillon cube in the coffee and pour the mixture over the roast. Pour tomato sauce over meat and season with oregano; drizzle meat with 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce. Set cooker to Low and cook until meat is tender, 8 to 10 hours.
