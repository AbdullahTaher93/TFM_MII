Butter two baking sheets with the 2 teaspoons butter; set aside. In a heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, coffee, corn syrup and cinnamon. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Cook until a candy thermometer reads 234 degrees F-240 degrees F (soft-ball stage). Remove from the heat; stir in vanilla. Add peanuts; stir quickly. Pour onto prepared baking sheets. Quickly separate into small clumps with two forks. Cool completely. Store in an airtight container.
