Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a 1- to 2-quart pan over low heat, heat milk until small bubbles form around the edge. Do not boil. Remove from heat. Add tea bags and cranberries, submerging them as much as possible. Let sit until cool to the touch. Squeeze liquid from bags into milk. Discard bags. In a medium bowl, stir butter and sugar until blended. Mix in eggs. Add baking powder and 1 3/4 cups flour; stir until incorporated. Stir in cranberry mixture until blended. Place dough on a lightly floured board and sprinkle top lightly with flour. Pat into a 1-inch-thick round. Cut into 8 wedges, dipping the knife in flour between each cut. Place wedges on a buttered or oiled baking sheet. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes or until center springs back when lightly touched. Serve warm.
