In a small frying pan, toast the pine nuts over moderately low heat, stirring frequently, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Or toast the pine nuts in a 350 degrees F oven for 5 to 10 minutes. Let cool. In a large pot of boiling water, cook the carrots for just 30 seconds. Drain the carrots, rinse with cold water, and drain thoroughly. Toss the carrots with the lemon juice, salt, oil, pine nuts, and basil.
