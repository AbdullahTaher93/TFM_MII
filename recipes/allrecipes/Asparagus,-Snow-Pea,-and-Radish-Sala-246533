Bring water to a boil in a saucepan. Add asparagus; boil for 1 minute. Add snow peas to asparagus, boil for 1 minute more. Drain and pat dry. Transfer asparagus and snow peas to a large bowl. Add radishes, scallions, and dill; toss salad gently to combine. Whisk oil, sugar, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl; pour over salad and toss to coat. Set aside at room temperature to allow flavors to blend; about 1 hour. Drizzle lime juice over salad; toss gently until combined.
