In a Dutch oven or stock pot over medium-high heat, brown the ground beef. As the meat begins to brown, add the onion, green peppers, garlic, and meat tenderizer. Reduce heat to low, and cover. Cook for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the diced tomatoes, season with salt and pepper to taste, and cover. Cook for 45 minutes, or until the meat is the desired tenderness.
