Brush griddle or skillet with vegetable oil or spray with cooking spray; heat griddle to 375 degrees F or heat skillet over medium heat. In medium bowl, beat Bisquick mix, milk and eggs with wire whisk or fork until well blended. Pour 1/2 cup batter into plastic squeeze bottle with narrow opening to use for making letters. Drizzle batter from squeeze bottle onto hot griddle to form a letter. (Letters must be made backwards to make them appear 'right' when pancakes are served.) When bottom side of letter has browned, pour about 1/4 cup batter over letter. Cook pancakes until edges are dry. Turn; cook other sides until golden brown.
