In a large skillet, brown chicken in butter. Remove chicken and set aside. In the same skillet, saute onion and parsley until onion is tender. Add soup, sour cream, milk, nutmeg, sage, thyme and rosemary; mix well. Return chicken to the skillet an spoon sauce over pieces. Simmer, uncovered, for 25-30 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink, basting occasionally. Sprinkle with nutmeg.
