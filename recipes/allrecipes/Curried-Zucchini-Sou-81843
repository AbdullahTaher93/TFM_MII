Cut off and discard the stem and blossom ends of the zucchini. The zukes can be cubed or sliced depending on how you'd like the final soup to look. If it will be completely pureed, then this does not matter of course. Heat the oil in your soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the scallions, garlic and curry powder. Cook for about 1 minute, stir occasionally. Add the zucchini and stir to coat. Cook for 2 or 3 minutes, stir occasionally. Then add the chicken stock and the lemon extract. Bring to a boil then cover and reduce to a simmer. Cook for 15 - 20 minutes. To puree, either use a hand held blender or use a food processor or regular blender. (The last two will need to be done in batches). I prefer to use a hand held blender directly in the soup pot for just a bit leaving plenty of chunks. However, if I plan to serve this cold then I completely puree all of the soup. Add the cream to the soup and cook for about 3 minutes over medium heat. Taste test and add salt and pepper to your liking (it will probably need a bit of both).
