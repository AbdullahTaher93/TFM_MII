Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake sweet potatoes in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Set aside until cool enough to handle. Cut a thin lengthwise slice from the top of each sweet potato and discard slice. Scoop pulp from sweet potatoes, leaving thin shells. Place pulp into a bowl and mash with cream cheese. Stir brown sugar, pecans, and cinnamon into mixture and fill sweet potato shells with pulp. Place filled sweet potatoes onto a baking sheet. Bake until sweet potatoes are heated through, 15 to 20 minutes.
