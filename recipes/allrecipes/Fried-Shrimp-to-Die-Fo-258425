Insert a knife 3/4 of the way below the head of 1 shrimp and cut down the center of the shrimp's back to the tail. Open shrimp with your fingers so it lies flat. Repeat with remaining shrimp. Pour flour onto a shallow plate. Whisk eggs and water together in a small bowl to make egg wash. Place saltine crackers in a large resealable bag. Crush into fine crumbs using a rolling pin. Pour crumbs onto a plate. Coat each shrimp with flour. Dip in egg wash; roll in cracker crumbs on both sides. Transfer to a large plate. Refrigerate shrimp for 2 hours. Heat 1 inch vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook shrimp until golden brown, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side. Drain on a paper-towel lined plate.
