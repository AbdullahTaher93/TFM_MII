Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cook the sausage, beef and onion in a 12-inch oven-safe skillet until the sausage and beef are well browned, stirring often to break up beef. Pour off any fat. Stir in the spinach and cook until the spinach is wilted. Stir the soup, milk and beans in the skillet. Stir the stuffing and cheese in a small bowl. Sprinkle around the inside edge of the skillet. Bake for 30 minutes or until the sausage mixture is hot and bubbling.
