Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and cool. Mix yogurt, mayonnaise, eggs, pickle relish, pesto seasoning, paprika, celery salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; add potatoes and mix well. Chill salad in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
