In a 6- to 8-quart pan over medium-high heat, melt butter. Add shallots, 1/4 cup of the parsley, and thyme; stir frequently and cook until shallots are limp, about 3 minutes. Add broth, wine, cream, and mussels to pan. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Simmer until mussels pop open, 8 to 12 minutes. Sprinkle mussels with remaining parsley, then ladle into wide bowls and add cooking liquid to each bowl.
