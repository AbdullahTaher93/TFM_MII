In a skillet, saute celery and onion in oil until tender. In a bowl, combine the salmon, egg, milk, bread crumbs, salt, pepper and celery mixture. Transfer to a greased 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes our clean. In a small bowl, combine the sauce ingredients. Serve with salmon loaf.
