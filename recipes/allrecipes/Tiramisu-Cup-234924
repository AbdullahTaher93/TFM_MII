Place Ghirardelli(R) Dark Melting Wafers in a microwave-safe container. Microwave at half power or defrost setting for 30 seconds. Stir thoroughly (product keeps its original shape until stirred). If not completely melted, continue to microwave at 15 second intervals and stir until smooth. Overheating will cause wafers to burn. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of melted wafers into fifteen 2 1/2-inch paper baking cups set in muffin pan cups, working with about 5 at a time. With a small pastry brush, coat bottom and sides of liners evenly. To set, freeze for 30 minutes. Re-melt remaining wafers and cover any thin spots, adding a second coating in each liner. Freeze for 1 hour or until completely set. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk milk, pudding mix, and espresso powder for 2 to 3 minutes or until thickened. Let stand for 5 minutes. Fold in pound cake. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours. Carefully peel away liners and spoon about 3 tablespoons of the pudding mixture into each cup. Top each cup with a dollop of whipped cream and sprinkle with GhirardelliÂ® Unsweetened Cocoa.
