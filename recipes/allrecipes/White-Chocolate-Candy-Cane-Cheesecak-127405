Preheat oven to 325 degrees F if using a silver 9-inch springform pan (or to 300 degrees F if using a dark nonstick 9-inch springform pan). Mix crumbs, 3 Tbsp. of the sugar and the butter; press firmly onto bottom of pan. Bake 10 min. Beat cream cheese and remaining 3/4 cup sugar in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed after each addition just until blended. Stir in melted chocolate and the extract; pour over crust. Bake 45 to 50 min. or until center is almost set. Run knife or metal spatula around rim of pan to loosen cake; cool before removing rim of pan. Refrigerate 4 hours or overnight. Top with the whipped topping and chopped candy canes just before serving. Store leftover cheesecake in refrigerator.
