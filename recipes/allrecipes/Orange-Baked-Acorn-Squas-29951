Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fill a baking dish with about 1/2 inch water. Place squash halves cut side down in the dish, and bake 40 minutes in the preheated oven. In a bowl, whisk together the thawed orange juice, butter, brown sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Turn squash halves cut side up in the baking dish, and drizzle evenly with the orange juice sauce. Continue baking 20 minutes.
