Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place three sprigs of lavender on top of each chicken breast half. Wrap two slices of bacon around each piece of chicken keeping the lavender inside. Place chicken into a shallow baking dish. Season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Position the baking dish on the top shelf in the preheated oven, and bake chicken for 20 minutes, turning once. Turn again so the lavender is on top, and sprinkle with shredded cheese. Continue baking 10 minutes, or until cheese has melted and chicken juices run clear.
