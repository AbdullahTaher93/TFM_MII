In a bowl, combine the first six ingredients just until blended. Pour into a greased 8-in. square baking dish. Sprinkle with bacon, poppy seeds if desired and paprika. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cut into squares; serve warm.
