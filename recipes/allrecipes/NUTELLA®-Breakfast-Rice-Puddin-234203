Cut vanilla bean lengthwise down the centre and scrape the seeds out of both sides. In large saucepan, combine vanilla seeds, pod of vanilla bean and 4 cups (1L) of milk. Stir in rice, apples, apricots and sugar; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer covered for 25 minutes. Remove from heat and stir with a wooden spoon for 5 minutes or until rice is soft and creamy; add additional 1/2 cup (125 mL) of milk or more if a looser texture is desired. Serve rice pudding warm with a tablespoon (15 mL) of NUTELLA(R) swirled in.
