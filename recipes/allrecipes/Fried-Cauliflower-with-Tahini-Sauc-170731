Whisk together the tahini, garlic, parsley, water, and lemon juice together in a bowl until no lumps of tahini remain. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and set aside. Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry half of the cauliflower florets in the hot oil until they turn golden brown, about 8 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining florets. Serve immediately with the tahini sauce.
