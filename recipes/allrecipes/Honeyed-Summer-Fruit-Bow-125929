In a large bowl, combine the honey, lemon juice or lime juice, and cinnamon. Add the strawberries, cantaloupe, nectarines, peaches, plums, and blueberries. Toss just until the fruit is well-mixed and coated with the honey mixture. Let stand for 30 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to blend.
