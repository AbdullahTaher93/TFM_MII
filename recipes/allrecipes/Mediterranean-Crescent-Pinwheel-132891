Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray cookie sheets with CRISCO(R) Original No-Stick Cooking Spray. Separate or cut dough into 4 rectangles; place on lightly floured surface. If using crescent dough, firmly press perforations to seal. Press or roll each to form 8x5-inch rectangle. Arrange 1/4 of prosciutto slices evenly over each rectangle. In small bowl, mix cheese, pepper and oil. Sprinkle mixture evenly over prosciutto on each rectangle. Sprinkle with basil. Starting at short side of each rectangle, roll up; seal long edges. With serrated knife, cut each roll into 5 slices. Place, cut side up, on cookie sheets. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from cookie sheets. Serve warm.
