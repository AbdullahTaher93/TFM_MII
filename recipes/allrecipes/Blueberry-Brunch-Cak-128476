To make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat an 8 inch x 8 inch (20 x 20-cm) baking dish with nonstick spray. In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda, salt, and sugar. In a medium bowl, combine egg, yogurt, oil, and vanilla extract. Stir egg mixture into flour mixture, just until moist. Stir in blueberries. Spoon batter into the prepared baking dish. To make the topping: In a small bowl, using a fork, combine flour, sugar, butter or margarine, and cinnamon until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle over cake. Bake 40 to 45 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted into the center comes out clean.
