In a small bowl, combine cranberries and orange juice; let stand for 20 minutes. Core apples, leaving bottoms intact; peel tops of apples. Place each on a 12-in. square piece of foil. Drain cranberries; add the walnuts, brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Stuff into apples; dot with butter. Bring corners of foil up around each apple and twist to seal. Place on a rack in a pressure cooker; add water. Close cover securely; place pressure regulator on vent pipe. Bring cooker to full pressure over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-high; cook for 10 minutes. (Pressure regulator should maintain a slow steady rocking motion; adjust heat if needed.) Remove from the heat. Immediately cool according to manufacturer's directions until pressure is completely reduced. Remove apples from foil; serve warm or at room temperature.
