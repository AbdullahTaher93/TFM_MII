Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Break ground beef into small pieces and add to the skillet. Season beef with garlic powder, ground cinnamon, and allspice; cook and stir until beef is completely browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Stir water, rice, and beef bouillon with the beef; bring to a simmer and cook until the rice is soft and fluffy, about 20 minutes. Heat a small skillet over high heat; toast pine nuts in the skillet, swirling to keep pine nuts moving, until browned, 2 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle toasted pine nuts and lemon juice over the beef and rice mixture.
