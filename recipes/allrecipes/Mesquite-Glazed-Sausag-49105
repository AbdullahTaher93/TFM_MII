Combine Marinade mix and orange juice in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until smooth. Add in marmalade, water and curry, stirring constantly, until glaze mixture comes to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer 1 minute. Remove from heat; let cool. Pierce sausage with fork; place into large, self-closing plastic bag. Pour half of glaze over sausage; reserve remaining glaze. Close bag. Turn bag to coat sausage evenly. Refrigerate 30 minutes or longer for stronger flavor. Remove sausage from bag and place on preheated grill over medium heat. Grill 20 minutes or until done, occasionally turning sausage and brushing with reserved glaze.
