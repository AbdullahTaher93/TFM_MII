In a 5- to 6-quart pan, bring about 3 quarts water to a boil over high heat; stir in pasta and cook, uncovered, until just tender to bite (10 to 12 minutes). Or cook pasta according to package directions. Meanwhile, heat oil in a wide frying pan over medium-low heat. Add shallot and cook, stirring often, until soft but not brown (about 3 minutes). Stir in tomatoes, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes. Add cream, nutmeg, chopped dill, and vodka. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil; then boil for 1 minute. Drain pasta well; add to sauce and mix lightly, using 2 spoons, until pasta is well coated with sauce. Remove from heat, add salmon, and mix lightly. Season to taste with pepper. Pour onto a platter or individual plates; garnish with dill sprigs.
