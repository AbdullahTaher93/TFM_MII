In a large saucepan, simmer chicken breast in stock with the onion, parsley, lemon zest, and mint sprig until done, about 35 minutes. Remove the breast, cool, then strip off the meat and cut into a julienne. Strain the broth, return to the pot, and bring to a boil. Add pasta and chopped mint. Season to taste with salt and white pepper. Heat until the pasta is cooked al dente. Remove from heat, stir in lemon juice and chicken julienne. Ladle into soup plates and top with lemon slice and mint leaf.
