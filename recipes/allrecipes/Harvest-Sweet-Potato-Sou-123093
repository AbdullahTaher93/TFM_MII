In a Dutch oven or soup kettle, saute celery and onion in oil until tender. Add remaining ingredients; bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat; simmer for 25-30 minutes or until tender. Discard the bay leaf. Cool slightly. In a blender or food processor, process soup in batches until smooth. Return all to pan and heat through.
