Place sweet potato cubes on a large microwave-safe plate. Cook in the microwave until softened, about 10 minutes. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add half of the chopped onion; cook and stir until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add chicken; cook and stir until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the saucepan. Cook and stir remaining onion with garlic until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add sweet potato, goat's milk, apples, yogurt, ginger, curry powder, cumin, turmeric, salt, and pepper; bring to a simmer. Return chicken to the saucepan. Simmer until flavors combine, about 10 minutes. Stir chicken stock into the saucepan. Cook until heated through, about 1 minute.
