Heat oil in a skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk milk, cornmeal, flour, and egg together in a large bowl until it is a fairly thick batter. Dip each slice of tomato into batter and immediately fry in hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain fried tomatoes in a colander standing on edge to keep crisp as you fry remaining tomato slices.
