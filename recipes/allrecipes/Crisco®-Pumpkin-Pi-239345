Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Pastry: Combine flour and salt in large mixing bowl. Cut room temperature shortening into flour with pastry blender or 2 knives until mixture is uniform and shortening resembles large peas. Beat egg, water and vinegar together. Pour all liquid evenly over flour mixture. Stir with fork until all of the mixture is moistened. Flatten dough into a circle about 6" (15 cm). Wrap and chill 15 minutes for easier rolling. Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a circle 2" (5 cm) wider than 10" (25 cm) pie plate. Transfer into pie plate. Press into bottom and up sides of plate. Trim overhang and flute edges. Filling: Whisk together pumpkin, brown sugar, eggs, flour, spices and salt in large bowl until smooth and well combined; gradually whisk in evaporated milk. Fill pie shell with evaporated milk mixture. Bake in preheated oven, on bottom rack for 60 to 70 minutes or until set. Cool on wire cooling rack.
