Place a tortilla directly on a stovetop burner set at medium-low and toast, turning frequently with tongs, until light golden and fragrant, 30 to 60 seconds. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Cut the toasted tortillas into 1/4-inch-wide strips and set aside. Whisk eggs and egg whites in a medium bowl. Add the tortilla strips, salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and saute; scallions. Add egg mixture; scramble until eggs are set. Serve with cilantro and salsa.
