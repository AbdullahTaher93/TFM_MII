To prepare syrup, combine first 5 ingredients in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil; cook 3 minutes or until mixture is slightly syrupy. Remove from heat; stir in 1/4 cup mint and rind. Let stand 30 minutes. Strain syrup through a sieve over a small bowl; discard solids. To prepare salad, combine cantaloupe and next 7 ingredients in a large bowl. Add syrup; toss gently to coat. Cover and refrigerate 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
