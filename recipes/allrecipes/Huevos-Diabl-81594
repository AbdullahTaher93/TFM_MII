See page 61 for how to prepare the hard boiled egg. Peel and slice the eggs into halves. Scoop the yolk out of the whites. Mince the chipotle pepper (with whatever sauce clings to it). In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, egg yolk and chipotle pepper. Taste to test for heat (and does it need salt); it should be quite mild at this point. Add more adobo sauce to taste. I generally need 1 or 2 more teaspoons worth. But feel free to add another chilies if you prefer (only 0.5g net carbs per Tbsp). Spoon or pipe the yolk mixture into the whites. Garnish each with a single, whole cilantro leaf.
