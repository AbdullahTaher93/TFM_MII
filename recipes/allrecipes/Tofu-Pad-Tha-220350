Soak rice noodles in a bowl with enough hot water to cover until slightly softened, about 15 minutes; drain. Whisk vinegar, fish sauce, lime juice, soy sauce, sugar, and tamarind paste in a bowl until sugar is dissolved. Mix paprika and cayenne pepper in a small bowl. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir eggs in the hot oil until lightly cooked. Transfer eggs to a bowl. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir green onions and garlic together quickly, about 10 seconds. Stir tofu and paprika mixture into green onion mixture; toss to combine. Toss noodles with tofu mixture until mixed; pour vinegar mixture over noodles and toss to coat. Fold eggs and bean sprouts into noodles; cook and stir until sauce is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Garnish with crushed peanuts.
