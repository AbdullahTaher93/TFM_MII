Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Grease large dark or nonstick cookie sheet with shortening or cooking spray. Unroll dough on cookie sheet. Press out dough to 15x10-inch rectangle. Spread butter over dough; sprinkle Parmesan cheese evenly over butter. Bake 7 minutes; remove from oven. Meanwhile, in medium bowl, mix Alfredo sauce and chicken; spoon evenly over partially baked crust. Top with spinach and cheese. Bake 5 to 7 minutes or until cheese is melted and crust is golden brown.
