In a large Dutch oven, cook bacon until crisp. Drain, reserving 3 tablespoons drippings. Set bacon aside. In the drippings, saute onions until tender. Combine beans, sausage, bacon and onions. Combine the remaining ingredients; add to bean mixture and mix well. Pour into four greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dishes. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 45-55 minutes or until heated through.
