In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp. Lift out, reserving drippings; drain and break into 1-inch pieces. Measure drippings and add enough salad oil, if necessary, to make 3 tablespoons. Return drippings to pan with bacon, and stir in vinegar, shallots, and mustard. Cut off peel and white membrane from orange; cut between inner membranes, removing orange segments. In a large bowl, combine lettuce and radicchio and orange. Heat bacon mixture simmering over medium heat. Immediately pour hot dressing over salad and mix quickly until well coated. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Arrange salad on individual plates; serve immediately.
