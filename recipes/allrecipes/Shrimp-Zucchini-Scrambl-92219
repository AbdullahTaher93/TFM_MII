In a frying pan, heat oil over medium heat and saute the onion and garlic until limp, about 5 minutes. Add zucchini and cook, stirring, until just tender, 3 to 5 minutes. While the vegetables cook, beat the eggs in a bowl until they are frothy, then add the shrimp, and salt and pepper to taste. Pour egg mixture over the cooked vegetables, reduce heat to medium low, and cook until the egg is just set, lifting and turning with a spatula to cook it evenly. Serve immediately.
