Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Unwrap tamales and cut into thick chunks. Place a portion of the chopped tamales in the bottom of a 2 quart casserole dish. Then layer the onions, cheese, tortilla chips and chili without beans. Repeat this until all ingredients are used, topping off with cheese and chips. Then sprinkle with the water. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 40 to 45 minutes.
