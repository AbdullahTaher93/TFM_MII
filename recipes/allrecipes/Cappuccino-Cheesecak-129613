Preheat oven to 325 degrees F if using a silver 9-inch springform pan (or to 300 degrees F if using a dark nonstick 9-inch springform pan). Mix walnuts, butter and 2 Tbsp. sugar; press firmly onto bottom of pan. Bake 10 min. Remove from oven; cool. Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F. Beat cream cheese, 1 cup sugar and flour with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Add eggs, 1 at a time, mixing on low speed after each addition just until blended. Blend in sour cream. Dissolve instant coffee with cinnamon in water; cool. Gradually add to cream cheese mixture, mixing until well blended. Pour over crust. Bake 10 min. Reduce oven temperature to 250 degrees F. Bake an additional 1 hour or until center is almost set. Run knife or metal spatula around rim of pan to loosen cake; cool before removing rim of pan. Refrigerate 4 hours or overnight. Garnish with dollops of whipped topping and a sprinkle of additional cinnamon.
