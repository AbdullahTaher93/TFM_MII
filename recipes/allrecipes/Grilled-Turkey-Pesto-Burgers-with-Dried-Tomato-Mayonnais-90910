Oil and preheat barbecue grill. In a large bowl, combine turkey, egg white, onion, bread crumbs, and pesto. Mix lightly. Shape into 4 equal patties, each about 4 inches wide. Arrange patties on grill rack 4 to 6 inches above a solid bed of hot coals (you can hold your hand at grill level for only 2 to 3 seconds) or over high heat on a gas grill. Close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning once, until patties are no longer pink in center; cut to test (about 10 minutes). Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir together mayonnaise and tomatoes; set aside. Cut bread into 4 roughly equal pieces and cut in half horizontally. When turkey patties are almost done, toast bread, cut sides down, on grill for 1 to 2 minutes. Top each patty with a piece of cheese. To serve, spread cut sides of bread with mayonnaise mixture. Assemble sandwiches, filling each with a turkey patty and a few lettuce leaves.
