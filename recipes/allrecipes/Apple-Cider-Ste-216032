Combine the beef stew meat with the flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, the black pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon thyme in a bowl; toss to coat evenly. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a pot; cook the stew meat in the hot oil until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour the apple cider over the beef, reduce heat to medium low, and simmer the mixture until the beef is tender, about 1 hour. Add the carrots, potatoes, apples, onion, water, celery, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon thyme to the pot; continue cooking at a simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more.
