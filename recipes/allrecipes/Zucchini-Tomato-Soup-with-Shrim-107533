Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the zucchini, onion and garlic. Cook until tender, about 4-5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, broth and white beans; bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, for about 20 minutes. Stir in dill and shrimp; continue to simmer until shrimp are warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.
