In a large mixing bowl, combine cake mix and cocoa. Combine the egg whites, egg, water and yogurt; add to dry ingredients and beat well. Pour into a 10-cup fluted tube pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
