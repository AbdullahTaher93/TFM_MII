In a large bowl, blend hoisin sauce, cranberry sauce, soy sauce, white wine, honey, and red food coloring. Mix in garlic salt and Chinese five-spice powder. Place ribs in the mixture. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place water in the bottom of a large roasting pan. Arrange ribs on pan rack, and cook 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Cover with remaining sauce mixture, and continue cooking 30 minutes, to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
