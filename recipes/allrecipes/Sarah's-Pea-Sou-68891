Place the dry whole peas in a pot with enough water to cover, and soak 8 hours or overnight. Drain soaked peas, and return to the pot. Cover with 2 quarts water. Mix in the dry split peas, vegetable base, salt pork, onions, carrots, chives, savory, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 2 hours, until peas are tender. Remove and discard the salt pork before serving.
