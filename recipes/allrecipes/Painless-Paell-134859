In a 2-quart microwave-safe dish, stir together the shrimp, oil, and garlic until the shrimp are coated with oil. Nuke for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring once, until the shrimp are just pink. Remove the shrimp and all but 1 tablespoon of any accumulated juices to a plate, and cover with foil to keep warm. Now toss the sausage and onion into the microwavable dish and heat for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring once. Mix in the rice and tomatoes, and microwave for 1 to 3 minutes. Stir in 1-1/2 c water and cover the dish tightly with plastic wrap. Microwave for 15 to 18 minutes, or until the rice is tender. Uncover, and stir in the artichokes and peas. Cover the shrimp with the rice and pour the shrimp juices over the top. Nuke for 1 to 3 minutes.
