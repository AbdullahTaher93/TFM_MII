In a small bowl, mix apricots with 1/2 cup hot water and let stand until soft, about 10 minutes; drain. Meanwhile, peel and core pear; cut into 1-inch cubes and put in another small bowl. Add lemon juice; mix to coat. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Trim fat from meat and discard. Cut through loin lengthwise to within 1/2 inch of bottom side. Spread halves open like a book and lay meat flat. Scatter apricots and pear cubes evenly down the center. Gently press halves back together and tie loin with cotton string at 1- to 1 1/2-inch intervals to secure. Set roast, with cut to the side, in a 10- by 15-inch pan. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Bake until a thermometer inserted in center of loin (not in fruit) reaches 140 degrees, about 45 minutes (30 minutes in a convection oven). Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons red currant jelly in a small microwave-safe bowl in a microwave oven at full power (100%) just until melted, about 15 seconds. Brush loin with melted jelly and continue roasting until a thermometer inserted in center (not in fruit) reaches 150 degrees, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Transfer pork to a board or platter and, keeping warm, let rest 15 to 20 minutes. Spoon fat from pan drippings and discard. Add vermouth and broth to pan, set over high heat, and stir, scraping up browned bits, until reduced to 1 cup, 6 to 10 minutes. In a small bowl, mix cornstarch and cream until smooth. Add cornstarch-cream mixture and remaining 1 tablespoon jelly to broth mixture and stir until jelly is melted and mixture is boiling, 3 to 4 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Pour sauce into a bowl. Remove strings from pork roast and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Serve with sauce. Add salt and pepper to taste.
