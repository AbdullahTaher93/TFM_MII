Heat the oven to 450 degrees F. Put four 12-inch squares of aluminum foil on a work surface and brush lightly with cooking oil. Put a fish fillet in the center of each square of foil. Sprinkle the fillets with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper. Spread the fish with the pesto. Cover the pesto with the carrots and top with the zucchini. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Gather the foil around the fish and drizzle the fish with the oil and wine. Fold the edges of the foil to make a sealed package. Put the foil packages on a baking sheet. Bake the fish until just done, about 12 minutes. Open the foil packages and transfer the fillets with their vegetable topping to plates. Pour the juices over the top.
