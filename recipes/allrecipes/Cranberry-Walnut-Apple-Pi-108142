Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large saucepan, mix together 1 cup SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and salt. Stir in cranberries and maple syrup. Cook over high heat, stirring constantly. When mixture comes to a boil, reduce heat. Cover, and simmer 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir apples into simmering mixture, and continue to cook for 5 minutes, or until apples are tender. Remove from heat, and stir in the cornstarch and water mixture. Stir in walnuts. Pour apple mixture into pie shell; set aside. In a medium bowl, combine bread crumbs, 3/4 cup flour, remaining 1/4 cup SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, and melted butter. Mix well, and sprinkle over apple filling. Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until topping is golden brown. Serve warm.
