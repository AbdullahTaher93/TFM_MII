Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Grease muffin cups. Mix together egg, egg whites, and milk. Stir in coffee powder, water, and vanilla. In a large bowl, mix together flour, malted milk powder, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt. Stir in liquid mixture. Mix together really well, until batter is thin and gooey like cake batter. Fill muffin cups 2/3 full. In a small bowl, stir together cinnamon and 2 tablespoons sugar. Sprinkle cinnamon sugar over muffins. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes.
