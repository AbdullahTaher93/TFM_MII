Cut a 4 inch circle off the top of the pumpkin, including the stem; set aside to be used later as a lid. Remove seeds and stringy insides of pumpkin. Place pumpkin in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain, and mash. Season with salt, pepper and garlic powder; set aside. In a skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef until no pink shows; drain. Spoon the ground beef into the pumpkin. Pour in the creamed corn and whole kernel corn. Top with mashed potatoes. Cover with pumpkin lid. Pour 2 cups of water in the baking dish. Bake in preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until pumpkin is tender and can be pierced with a fork.
