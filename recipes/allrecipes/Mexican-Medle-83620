Steam asparagus and cauliflower about 10 minutes. Remove to a bowl, and stir in celery; set aside. Place into a blender the kidney beans, hazelnuts, dill, basil, and garlic. Pour in oil, and season with chili powder, celery seed, and salt. Puree until smooth. Pour sauce over asparagus mixture. Serve at room temperature.
