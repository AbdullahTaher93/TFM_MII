Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease 13 x 9-inch baking pan. Place 2 cups dough in prepared pan. Using fingertips, pat dough gently to cover bottom. Sprinkle 1 cup morsels, pretzel pieces and peanuts over dough. Drop 1-inch pieces of remaining 1/2 cup cookie dough over peanuts. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup of morsels and gently press down. Bake for 23 to 27 minutes or until browned around edge. Cool completely in pan on wire rack. Cut into bars.
