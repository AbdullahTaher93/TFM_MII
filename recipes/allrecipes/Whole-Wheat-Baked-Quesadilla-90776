Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. In a medium bowl, coarsely mash beans. Add mayonnaise, vinegar, and chili powder; stir until well blended. Lightly brush both sides of each tortilla with water. Spoon a fourth of the bean mixture over half of each tortilla; evenly sprinkle a fourth each of the cheese, tomatoes, and onion and cilantro, if using, over bean mixture on each tortilla. Fold plain half of tortilla over to cover filling. Set quesadillas slightly apart on a lightly oiled 12- by 15-inch baking sheet. Bake until crisp and golden (about 7 minutes). Serve with salsa.
