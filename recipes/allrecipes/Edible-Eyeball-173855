Place donuts on a platter and fill in a circle (slightly larger than the Life Saver) on the top of the donut with red icing. Place the Life Saver on the top of red icing. Place a chocolate chip in the center of the Life Saver. Run thin red icing lines from the Life Saver to the bottom of the donut to create bloodshot eyes.
