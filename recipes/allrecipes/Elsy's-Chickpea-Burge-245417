Place the chickpeas into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain water from beans and transfer beans to a pot; cover with water. Bring water to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until beans are tender, about 1 hour. Cool beans until easily handled. Combine chickpeas, cilantro, eggs, garlic, chickpea flour, tahini, coriander, salt, cumin, and chili powder in a blender; blend until well mixed but still chunky. Form mixture into patties. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry patties until golden and crisp, about 3 minutes per side.
