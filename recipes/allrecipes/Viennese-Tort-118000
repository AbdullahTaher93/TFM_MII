Line two 9-in. round baking pans with waxed paper and grease the paper; set aside. In a mixing bowl, cream butter and 1/2 cup sugar. Beat in egg yolks, milk and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture. Pour into prepared pans. In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating on high until stiff glossy peaks form and sugar is dissolved. Spread evenly over batter, sealing edges to sides of pan. Bake at 300 degrees F for 30 minutes. Sprinkle with coconut and almonds. Bake 20-30 minutes longer or until meringue and coconut are lightly browned. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. Cool meringue side up. In a bowl, whisk milk and pudding mix for 2 minutes. Let stand for 2 minutes or until soft-set. Fold in whipped cream. Place one cake layer on a serving plate, meringue side up; spread with pudding mixture. Top with remaining cake. Chill overnight. Refrigerate leftovers.
