Place roast on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours. In a skillet, saute the onion, celery and garlic in oil until tender. Stir in the remaining ingredients. Spoon 1 cup sauce over roast. Bake, 45-55 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let stand for 10-15 minutes before slicing. Serve with the remaining sauce.
