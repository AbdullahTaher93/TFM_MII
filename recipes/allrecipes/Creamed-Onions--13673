Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare the sauce by whisking together and cooking the butter, flour, milk, salt and pepper. Cook until smooth. Place onions in a 2 quart casserole dish, pour in white sauce. In a saute pan, melt 2 tablespoons butter and toast cracker crumbs until golden. Sprinkle over onions. Bake 20 minutes or until steaming hot.
