Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a deep 2 quart casserole dish. Mix macaroni, cheese, and cottage cheese in a large bowl. Pour water into the dish just to cover noodles and cheese. Dot with butter. Sprinkle bread crumbs evenly over top. Bake until macaroni is tender, and cheese is melted, about 1 hour.
