In a bowl combine mayonnaise, Pommery mustard and Morton(R) Nature's Seasons(R) Seasoning Blend. Mix well, cover and refrigerate until needed. In large bowl combine ground chicken, diced chicken breast, green onions, Dijon mustard, herbs and Morton(R) Nature's Seasons(R) Seasoning Blend. Mix well. Divide the chicken mixture equally into 6 portions and pat mixture into balls. Gently pat balls into 1/2-inch thick patties, pressing any excess air out of the patty. Place onto a wax paper lined tray in single layers, layering wax paper between layers to avoid sticking. Refrigerate for a minimum of 1 hour.* Preheat grill to medium-high (about 450 degrees F). Spray burgers with non-stick cooking spray. Place burgers on preheated, seasoned grill and grill for approximately 6 to 8 minutes per side, until fully cooked. (An instant read thermometer should register 165 degrees F). During the last 1 to 2 minutes of grilling time, lay one slice of cheese onto each burger and close grill lid to melt cheese. Place burger buns onto grill, cut side down, and grill about 2 minutes or until lightly toasted. Remove buns from grill. Remove burgers from grill and place 1 burger onto each grill toasted bun. Top with sliced avocado, tomato, alfalfa sprouts and lettuce. Serve immediately with Mustard Sauce.
