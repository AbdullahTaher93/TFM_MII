Cook the pigeon peas with 2 cups water in a pressure cooker until the water is absorbed and the peas are tender, about 5 minutes. Bring 2 cups of water to a boil with the turmeric and salt; add the amaranth greens and cook until tender, about 5 minutes; drain. Stir the cooked peas into the greens; set aside. Heat the oil in a small skillet; cook the lentils, mustard seed, cumin seed, and red chile peppers in the oil until the seeds begin to splutter. Add the green chile peppers, curry leaves, and asafoetida powder and continue cooking another 30 seconds; immediately stir into the peas and greens.
