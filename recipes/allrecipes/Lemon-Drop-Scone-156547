Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine flour, Splenda(R), baking soda and salt in medium bowl. Stir in lemon peel. Using fork or pastry blender cut butter into flour mixture until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gently stir in yogurt and lemon juice just until soft dough forms. Drop dough by 1/4 cupfuls on sprayed baking sheet. Bake 16 to 18 minutes or until light golden brown.
