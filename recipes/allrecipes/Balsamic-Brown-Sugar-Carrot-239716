Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Add carrots to the skillet and season with grill seasoning; cook and stir until lightly golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Carefully pour balsamic dressing over carrots; cook and stir until dressing is slightly reduced, about 3 minutes. Add brown sugar to carrots and cook until dissolved, about 2 minutes.
