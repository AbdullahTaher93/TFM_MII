YOGURT CHEESE: Use one 8-oz. container vanilla lowfat yogurt, no gelatin added. Line non-rusting colander or sieve with large piece of double thickness cheesecloth or large coffee filter; place colander over deep bowl. Spoon yogurt into prepared colander; cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until liquid no longer drains from yogurt, about 24 hours. Remove yogurt from cheesecloth and place in separate bowl; discard liquid. Stir together sugar and cocoa in small microwave-safe bowl. Add water; stir until well blended. Microwave at HIGH (100%) 45 seconds to 1 minute or until mixture boils. Stir well. Cool slightly; stir in vanilla. Stir cocoa mixture into yogurt cheese in medium bowl; fold in whipped topping. Spoon into individual dessert dishes. Refrigerate about 1 hour. Garnish with whipped topping and fruit, if desired.
