Place eggs in a pot with enough cold water to cover, and bring to a boil. Cover pot, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Drain, cool, peel, and chop. In a medium bowl, mix the eggs, celery, onion, salmon, and mayonnaise. Season with dill, salt, and pepper. Refrigerate at least 2 hours to allow flavors to combine. Spread 8 slices of bread with equal amounts of the salad. Top with lettuce and cucumber, and remaining bread slices to make 8 sandwiches.
