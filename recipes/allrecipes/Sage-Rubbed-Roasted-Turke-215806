Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Place turkey on rack in shallow roasting pan. Brush turkey with oil. Mix seasonings in small bowl. Sprinkle 1 Tbsp. of the seasoning mixture inside turkey. Spread remaining seasoning mixture over entire surface and under skin of turkey. Add 1/2 cup water to pan. Cover loosely with heavy duty foil. Roast 1 hour. Remove foil. Roast 2 to 2 1/2 hours longer or until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F (175 degrees F in thigh), basting occasionally with pan juices. Remove turkey from oven. Let stand 20 minutes. Transfer to platter or carving board and slice. Reserve pan juices to make gravy or to serve with turkey.
