Heat the corn oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, habanero peppers, and sea salt. Cook and stir until the garlic begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir honey into water until dissolved, then pour into garlic mixture. Simmer until the water has almost evaporated, then scrape the mixture into a metal bowl. Stir in cream, pickle, and mayonnaise. Place mixture into refrigerator, and chill until cold. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.
