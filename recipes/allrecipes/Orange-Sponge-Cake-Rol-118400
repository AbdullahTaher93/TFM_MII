Let egg whites stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Sift flour and salt; set aside. Coat a 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan with nonstick cooking spray; line with waxed paper and coat the paper with nonstick cooking spray. In a mixing bowl, beat yolks until slightly thickened. Gradually add sugar, beating until thick and lemon-colored. Add orange peel; juice and vanilla. Add sifted flour mixture; mix well (batter will be thick). In another mixing bowl, beat egg whites on high speed until soft peaks form; fold into batter. Spread into prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched in center. Cool in pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Turn cake onto a kitchen towel dusted with 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar. Gently peel off waxed paper. Roll up cake in the towel jelly-roll style, starting with a short side. Cool completely on a wire rack. Unroll cake; spread marmalade evenly over cake to within 1/2 in. of edges. Roll up again. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Sprinkle with remaining confectioners' sugar.
