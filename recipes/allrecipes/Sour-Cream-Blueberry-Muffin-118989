In a bowl, combine the biscuit mix and 3/4 cup sugar. In another bowl, combine the eggs and sour cream; stir into the dry ingredients just until combined. Fold in blueberries. Fill greased muffin cups three-fourths full. Sprinkle with remaining sugar. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
