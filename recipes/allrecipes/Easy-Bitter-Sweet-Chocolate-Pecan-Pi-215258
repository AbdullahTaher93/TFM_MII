Preheat oven 375 degrees F. Melt SunSpire Unsweetened Carob Baking Chips over double boiler with simmering water in the bottom pot and chocolate in the top pot. Stir constantly until melted. Roll out prepared dough into 13 inch round on a lightly floured surface. Fit dough into a 9 inch pie dish. Trim off excess dough, leaving a 1/2 inch overhang. For a nice trim, fold dough over hand and crimp into rim of pie plate. Spread chocolate in bottom of pie crust, let it set and cover with pecans. In a bowl whisk eggs with Hain Pure Foods Organic Light Brown Sugar, vanilla, Hain Pure Foods Iodized Sea Salt and then corn syrup. Pour mixture over pecans. Bake pie for 50-60 minutes or until filling is puffed and crust is golden. If pie browns too quickly after 30 minutes, cover with loose foil. Some pecans will rise to top of pie. Sprinkle additional pecans on top of pie to your liking. Let sit on rack to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature with whipped sweet cream or vanilla ice cream.
