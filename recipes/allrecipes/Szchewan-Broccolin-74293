Combine all ingredients and blend well. Two (2) saute pans are required: one with 1/4 cup vegetable or peanut oil and one dry. Heat pan with oil to approximately 350 degrees. Place other pan on flame until hot. Blanch 6-7 pieces of Mann's Broccolini in hot oil for 12-15 seconds. Remove and put into hot pan with 2 oz. Szechwan sauce. Cook until sauce caramelizes onto Broccolini (30-60 seconds). If sauce doesn't caramelize within this time, pan needs to be hotter. Garnish with sesame seeds or radish sprouts.
