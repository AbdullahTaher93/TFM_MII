Chop the peppers and onions into small uniform bits. Remove the ends from the snow peas. If they are larger than bite size then cut them in half at a diagonal. In a skillet or sauce pan over medium-high heat, add the butter and olive oil. Add the onions and saute for a minute or two. Add the peppers and snow peas and saute an additional two minutes or just until tender. Do not over-cook. Serve immediately.
