Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a medium-sized casserole dish. In a mixing bowl, cream together butter and sugar. Beat in eggs one at a time. Stir in cinnamon and nutmeg. Add bread and crushed pineapple into the mixture. Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and lightly browned, about 60 minutes.
