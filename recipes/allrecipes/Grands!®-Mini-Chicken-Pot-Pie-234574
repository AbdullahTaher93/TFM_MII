Heat oven to 375 degrees F. In medium bowl, combine vegetables, chicken and soup; mix well. Press each biscuit into 5 1/2-inch round. Place 1 round in each of 8 greased regular-size muffin cups. Firmly press in bottom and up side, forming 3/4-inch rim. Spoon a generous 1/3 cup chicken mixture into each. Pull edges of dough over filling toward center; pleat and pinch dough gently to hold in place. Bake at 375 degrees F 20 to 22 minutes or until biscuits are golden brown. Cool 1 minute; remove from pan.
