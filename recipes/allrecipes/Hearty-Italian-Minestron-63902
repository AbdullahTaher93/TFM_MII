In large stockpot, combine first seven ingredients. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, partially covered for 20 minutes. Add green beans, zucchini and pasta. Simmer, uncovered for an additional 15 minutes or until vegetables and pasta are tender. Stir in beans and pepperoni. Heat until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with garlic salt and pepper. If desired, serve with pesto and Parmesan cheese.
