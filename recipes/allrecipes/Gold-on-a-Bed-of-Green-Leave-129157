Peel the mango. Cut the flesh from both sides of the seed and slice it thinly lengthwise. Mix the salad leaves on a platter, adding the basil and cilantro. Arrange the mango slices on and between the salad leaves. Whisk the ingredients for the dressing together and spoon it over the salad. Sprinkle with the chopped cashew nuts or peanuts.
