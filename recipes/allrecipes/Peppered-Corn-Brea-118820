In a bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda; set aside. Combine the eggs, corn, buttermilk and oil; stir into the dry ingredients just until blended. Fold in the cheese, peppers and onions. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cut into squares; serve warm.
