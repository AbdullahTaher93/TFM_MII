Mix eggs with their shells, baby food, carrot, apple, oats, fruit pellets, bird seed mix, and cinnamon in a large bowl until combined. Add apple juice as needed to make a thick paste. Shape egg mixture into 24 individual balls and place on a baking sheet. Freeze for 1 hour, transfer to zip-top plastic bags, and return to the freezer. Defrost balls in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours before feeding.
