Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pound meat to between 1/4 and 1/8 inch thick. Spread about a tablespoon of seasoned cream cheese on the bottom of each breast half. Roll up, and place in a casserole dish. Drizzle melted butter over rollups. Bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Melt extra cream cheese with chives in the microwave, and use as sauce for the chicken.
