Heat vegan butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat until melted. Add vegetable broth, potato, carrots, onion, celery, and ginger; cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until potato is tender, about 30 minutes. Uncover soup and let cool, about 15 minutes. Puree soup in batches in a food processor or high-speed blender until smooth. Return soup to the Dutch oven; stir in coconut cream. Season with curry powder, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat until soup is heated through, about 10 minutes.
