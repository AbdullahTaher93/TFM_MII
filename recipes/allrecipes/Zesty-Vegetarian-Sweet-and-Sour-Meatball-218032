Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch rectangular baking dish with cooking spray. Mix the ground pecans, eggs, Colby-Jack cheese, minced onion, Italian seasoning, cornflake crumbs, and salt in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Add another egg if mixture isn't holding together. Shape the mixture into balls, and place into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until browned and set, about 45 minutes. Mix together the vegetable oil, vinegar, ketchup, grated onion, apricot jam, and oregano together in a bowl until smooth; pour the sauce over the baked pecan balls, and return to oven until the sauce is bubbling, 5 to 10 more minutes.
