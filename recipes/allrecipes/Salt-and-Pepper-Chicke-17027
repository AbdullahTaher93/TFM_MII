Season chicken with salt and pepper (no such thing as too much, since this is the only seasoning this dish has)! Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat and add chicken. Saute until browned, about 5 minutes each side, then add milk (enough to cover 3/4 of the chicken). Reduce heat to low and simmer for 2 hours, uncovered. Remove chicken and use juices in skillet as a sauce.
