In a medium bowl, mash the Roquefort with a fork. Add the cream a little at a time, whisking, until the mixture is fairly smooth. Some lumps of cheese will remain. In a medium, stainless-steel saucepan, bring the chicken broth and the wine to a boil over moderate heat. Cook until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 5 minutes. Add the butter. Reduce the heat to moderately low and add the Roquefort mixture. Cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Add the salt and pepper. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the ziti until just done, about 12 minutes. Drain the pasta and toss with the Roquefort cream sauce, the Parmesan, and the parsley. Serve with additional Parmesan.
