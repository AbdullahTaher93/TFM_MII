Put marmalade, sugar, ginger, vanilla bean, cloves, and lemon juice in a large, wide pot. Stir in 2 1/2 cups water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve marmalade and sugar. Add squash, and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, and partially cover pot. Gently simmer, stirring occasionally, until squash is tender when pierced with a fork, about 35 minutes. Uncover, and cook until liquid is syrupy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove vanilla bean, and discard. Serve warm. Squash and syrup can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to 1 week. Before serving, reheat over medium-low heat. If the syrup seems too thick, add 1 to 2 tablespoons water.
