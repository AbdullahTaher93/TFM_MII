In a medium, non-reactive bowl, mix shallots, garlic, sambal belachan, vegetable oil, curry powder, cumin, lime juice, salt, and pepper. Place squid in the mixture. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate. Lightly grease the banana leaf. Wrap squid in the leaf, and place on the prepared grill. Cook 10 to 15 minutes, until leaf is slightly charred and squid is opaque.
