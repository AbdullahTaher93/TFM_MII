Heat a large nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and cook until the onion is soft and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir frequently. Add the carrots and zucchini, and saute until the vegetables have softened, about 10 minutes. Stir frequently. Stir in the ground cumin and coriander, peanut butter, and fresh cilantro; mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool slightly. Mix in the bread crumbs and egg until thoroughly combined. The mixture should bind together well. Shape the mixture into 4 thick burgers about 4 inches in diameter. Wipe the skillet with a paper towel and then heat the oil over medium heat. Add the burgers and cook until firm and golden, about 5 minutes on each side. Stir the tomatoes and ketchup together. Split the hamburger buns horizontally and toast the cut sides. Spread 1 teaspoon mayonnaise (if using) on each bun, then add some lettuce and a burger to each. Spread with the tomato mixture and top with the shallot slices. Replace the tops of the buns and serve.
