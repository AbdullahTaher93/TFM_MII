Place all ingredients in a large stockpot with 10 cups water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for at least 45 minutes (or up to 2 hours). Skim foam and fat occasionally from the surface. Strain the stock in a colander lined with a damp, double layer of cheesecloth into a large metal bowl. Discard solids. Let cool. Transfer to airtight storage containers and refrigerate for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 2 months.
