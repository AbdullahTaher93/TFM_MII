Place the turnips in a pot and cover with water; bring to a boil over high heat and cook until turnips turn yellowish orange and are soft, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain water, leaving turnips in the pot. Stir the butter and caraway seeds into the turnips. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Use a potato masher to mash turnips to desired consistency. Stir in the cream and mash again, blending well.
