Stir chicken broth, lemon juice, lemon zest, butter, and salt together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Add couscous to the liquid and stir to coat completely. Place a cover on the saucepan, remove from heat, and let couscous soak in hot liquid until the moisture is mostly absorbed, about 5 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork. Stir pimento peppers, pine nuts, and parsley into the couscous.
