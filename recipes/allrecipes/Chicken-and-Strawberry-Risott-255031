Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in rice; cook and stir until rice becomes soft and slightly transparent, about 5 minutes. Stir 1 cup of chicken stock and white wine into the rice mixture. Cook and stir, adding more chicken stock as it is absorbed, until rice is fluffy and soft, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix strawberries and chicken breast into the rice mixture. Stir in Parmesan cheese, heavy cream, salt, and pepper until well mixed. Transfer to a serving dish.
