Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the tomato paste, wine, water, garlic, basil, oregano, and salt in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Set aside. Combine the turkey, oatmeal, egg substitute, zucchini, and 1/2 cup of the tomato mixture in a large bowl. Mix well. Shape into a loaf and place into an ungreased 8" x 4" loaf pan. Bake for 45 minutes. Discard any drippings. Pour 1/2 cup of the remaining tomato mixture over the top of the loaf. Bake for an additional 15 minutes. Place on a serving platter. Cool for 10 minutes before slicing. Serve the remaining tomato sauce on the side.
