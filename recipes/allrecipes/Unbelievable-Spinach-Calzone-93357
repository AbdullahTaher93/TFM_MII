Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, eggs, Italian seasoning, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese and spinach. Set aside. Divide the bread dough into 8 pieces and roll each piece out to about an 8 inch circle. Spoon about 1/2 cup of the ricotta filling onto each circle, fold over and seal the edges. Place onto a greased cookie sheet. Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until nicely browned on the tops and bottoms.
