Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and garlic salt; cook and stir until tender and just starting to brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Add hard cider and black pepper; simmer, covered, until flavors combine, about 10 minutes. Uncover skillet and cook until cooking liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Add sugar as needed.
