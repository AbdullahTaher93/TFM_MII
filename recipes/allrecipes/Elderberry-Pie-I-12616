Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix cornstarch in a little bit of water and add to berries and sugar. Cook, stirring constantly until desired thickness. Add more cornstarch if not thick enough. Add lemon juice. Pour into bottom crust. Dot with butter. Put on top crust or make a lattice. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) until browned and berries are bubbling through holes in the crust, approximately 40 minutes. Note: It is a good idea to put a pan or foil under the pie as it bakes since it might bubble over.
