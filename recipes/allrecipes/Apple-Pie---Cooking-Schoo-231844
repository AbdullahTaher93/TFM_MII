Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Position oven rack to the lower third of the oven. Place bottom crust in a 9-inch pie pan. Combine apples, sugar, flour, lemon juice, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl until well mixed. Whisk egg yolk and water together in a bowl. Pour apple mixture into the prepared pie pan. Top with pieces of butter. Place top crust over apple filling and crimp edges of the crust together. Brush top crust with egg mixture. Cut 3 slits in the top crust for ventilation. Place pie pan on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake pie in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and bake until crust is golden brown and juices are bubbling, 60 to 70 minutes. If edges are getting too brown, cover them with aluminum foil. Allow to cool for 1 hour.
