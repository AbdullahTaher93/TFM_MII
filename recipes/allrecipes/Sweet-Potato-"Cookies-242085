Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Combine sunflower seed oil, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon salt, coriander, and cumin in a bowl; add sweet potatoes and toss to coat. Arrange sweet potatoes on a baking sheet and top with brown sugar, remaining 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Bake in the preheated oven until sweet potatoes are crisp around the edges, about 20 minutes.
