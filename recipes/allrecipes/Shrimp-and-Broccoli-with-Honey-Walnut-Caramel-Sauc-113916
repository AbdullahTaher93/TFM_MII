In a medium saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add the walnuts and cook over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until browned, about 4 minutes. Transfer the walnuts to a plate with a slotted spoon. Add another tablespoon of the oil to the saucepan. Add the garlic, season with pepper and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 4 minutes. Add the 1 tablespoon of the reserved honey; cook over moderate heat, stirring, until deeply browned, 1 minute. Add the soy sauce and simmer until slightly reduced, about 4 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and remove the garlic-caramel sauce from the heat. In a large skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the broccoli, cover and cook over moderate heat for 3 minutes. Uncover, add the shrimp and chiles and cook, stirring a few times, just until the shrimp are pink and curled. Stir in the garlic-caramel sauce, sprinkle the walnuts on top and serve.
