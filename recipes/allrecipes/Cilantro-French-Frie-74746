Heat oil in deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Place 1/3 potatoes in the fryer, and fry for about 5 to 8 minutes, or until almost done. Add 1/3 cilantro, and continue frying for 1 minute. Remove from oil, and drain on paper towels. Skim off any remaining cilantro. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
