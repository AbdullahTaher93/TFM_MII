Combine mayonnaise, lemon juice, lemon zest, and garlic in a bowl; refrigerate for 15 to 30 minutes to blend flavors. Move an oven rack into the middle of oven and place another rack into top third; preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lay asparagus spears in a row onto a baking sheet and spray with cooking spray; sprinkle with sea salt. Drizzle haddock fillets with olive oil and sprinkle with black pepper and rosemary. Wrap each fillet loosely with 3 slices pancetta bacon, wrapping bacon so that ends meet over skinned side of fillets. Place fillets into a 9x13-inch baking dish with bacon ends on the bottom. Pour white wine around the fillets. Place fish onto lower rack of preheated oven and bake for 7 minutes. Place asparagus onto upper rack of oven. Continue baking until pancetta is browned, fish is opaque and flakes easily, and asparagus are lightly browned on the tips, 7 to 8 more minutes. Stir warm water into lemon aioli sauce until sauce is pourable; pour about 2 tablespoons sauce onto each of 4 serving dishes. Arrange haddock fillets onto sauce and spread 1/4 of the roasted asparagus in a fan shape next to each fillet.
