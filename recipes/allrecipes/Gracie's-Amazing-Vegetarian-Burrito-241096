Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion, garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder, 1 teaspoon black pepper, 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and cumin in hot oil until onion softens, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir pinto beans, black beans, corn, and rice together in a bowl. Add bean mixture to skillet 1 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition. Stir remaining chili powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper into beans mixture, reduce heat to medium, cover the skillet with a lid, and cook, stirring as necessary, until heated through and flavors blend, 3 to 5 minutes. Spoon 1/6 of the bean mixture in a line across the middle of 1 tortilla. Fold opposing edges of the tortilla to overlap the filling. Roll 1 of the opposing edges around the filling into a burrito. Repeat with remaining bean mixture and tortillas.
