Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press peppercorns and fennel seeds into both sides of cod fillets. Set aside. In a skillet with an ovenproof handle, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add leeks, scallions, and garlic. Cook stirring frequently, until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute. Stir in wine, broth, and milk. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat. Place cod fillets on top of leek mixture in skillet and bake until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes. Serve cod topped with leek mixture.
