In a large bowl, combine yeast, warm water and 1 teaspoon sugar; set aside. In a saucepan, heat milk, butter, salt and remaining sugar until butter melts. Remove from the heat; stir in potatoes until smooth. Cool to lukewarm; add eggs and mix well. To yeast mixture add the potato mixture and 5 cups flour. Stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours. Punch down and divide in half. For white bread: Shape two loaves and place in greased 8-1/2-in. x 4-1/2-in. x 2-1/2-in. loaf pans. For cinnamon bread: Roll each half into a 16-in. x 8-in. rectangle. Brush with melted butter; combine sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle over butter. Starting at the narrow end, roll up into a loaf, sealing the edges and ends. Place in greased 8-1/2-in. x 4-1/2-in.x 2-1/2-in. loaf pans. For cinnamon rolls: Roll each half into an 18-in. x 12-in. rectangle. Brush with melted butter; sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar. Starting at the narrow end, roll up and seal edges and ends. Cut each into 12 pieces of 1-1/2 in. Place in greased 9-in. round baking pans. To bake: Cover and let rise until doubled. Bake loaves at 375 degrees F for 20 minutes; bake rolls at 375 degrees F for 25 to 30 minutes. Cover with foil if they brown too quickly.
