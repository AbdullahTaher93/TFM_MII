Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt butter in the bottom of an 8x4 inch loaf pan. Sprinkle brown sugar over the butter. Slice pineapple rings in half, and arrange them over the sugar. In a large bowl, mix together the ham, onion, bread crumbs, eggs, and 1/4 cup of juice from the pineapple. Blend in the mustard powder and cayenne pepper. Pack half of the mixture into the pan on top of the pineapple slices. Sprinkle the Swiss cheese over it, then pack the remaining ham mixture on top. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes in the preheated oven. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then turn upside down onto a serving plate. Slice as you would a meatloaf, and serve.
