In a food processor, process the water chestnuts, scallions, garlic, egg white, cornstarch, tamari or soy sauce, sesame oil, and ginger root until a coarse paste forms. Add the shrimp and process until a slightly chunky paste forms. Place a scant teaspoon (5 mL) of the shrimp mixture in the center of each wonton wrapper. Dampen the edges of each wrapper with water, and fold in half diagonally to form a triangle. Press the edges of the skin together to seal the dumpling. Bring the two bottom corners of each triangle together, moisten them, and firmly press them together. Bring a pot of water or, if desired, broth, to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and keep the water at a simmer. Cook the potstickers in the simmering water for 6 to 8 minutes. Or steam them over boiling water for 7 to 9 minutes. Drain and serve.
