Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a small saucepan, add the onion, and cook over medium heat until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the tomatoes, their juice, oregano, and sugar. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Put the pizza crusts on 2 baking sheets. Spread 1 tablespoon of tomato puree over each crust. Spoon the tomato sauce over the pizzas, then add the tuna. Sprinkle with the capers and sliced olives, and drizzle the remaining olive oil over the top. Bake the pizzas until the crusts are crisp and golden, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with torn basil leaves and serve immediately.
