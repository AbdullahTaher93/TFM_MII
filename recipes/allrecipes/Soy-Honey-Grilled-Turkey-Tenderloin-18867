In a shallow, flat dish, combine the soy sauce, sherry, honey, sesame seeds, sesame oil and garlic. Place the tenderloins in the dish and turn to coat thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Grill tenderloins over high heat for about 3 minutes per side, or until internal meat temperature reaches 180 degrees F (80 degrees C).
