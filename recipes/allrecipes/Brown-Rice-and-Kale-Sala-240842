Bring broth and brown rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes. Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion, celery, carrot, and almonds until onion begins to softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook 1 minute more; season with salt. Mix cooked rice into onion mixture until evenly combined. Add kale and cook until completely wilted, about 5 minutes. Serve warm.
