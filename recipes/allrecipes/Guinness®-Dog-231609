Heat 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion in the melted butter until onion is softened and liquid is released, about 10 minutes. Add beer, 1/2 cup butter, garlic powder, and hot sauce to onion; bring to a boil until beer begins to froth. Reduce heat and add hot dogs to beer mixture; simmer until hot dogs are heated through, 5 to 8 minutes.
