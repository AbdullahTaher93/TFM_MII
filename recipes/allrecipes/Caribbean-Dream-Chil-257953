Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic until soft, about 2 minutes. Stir in pork and sirloin; cook and stir until browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease from the pot. Crush tomatoes by hand and add them to the pot with their juices. Pour in beef broth. Stir in black beans, raisins, chili powder, cumin, cinnamon, salt, allspice, and cloves. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, until raisins are soft, about 30 minutes. Stir green olives and almonds into the pot. Simmer until flavors combine, about 30 minutes.
