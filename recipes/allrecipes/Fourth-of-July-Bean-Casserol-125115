In a large skillet, cook bacon, beef and onion until meat is browned and onion is tender; drain. Transfer to a greased 2-1/2-qt. baking dish; add all of the beans and mix well. In a small bowl, combine the remaining ingredients; stir into beef and bean mixture. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes. Uncover; bake 15 minutes longer.
