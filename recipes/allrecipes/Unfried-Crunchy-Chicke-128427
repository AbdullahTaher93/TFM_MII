Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a small bowl, mix garlic, lime juice, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) soy sauce, and 1/4 teaspoon (1.25 mL) pepper. Rub into chicken and refrigerate 30 minutes. In a shallow bowl, combine yogurt, flour, garlic powder, milk, remaining 1 tablespoon (15 mL) soy sauce, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon (1.25 mL) pepper. Spread bread crumbs on waxed paper. Dredge chicken in yogurt mixture, then press into bread crumbs on all sides. Place on the rack of a roasting pan and coat generously with nonstick spray. Bake 45 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted in the thickest portion registers 170 degrees F (75 degrees C) and juices run clear.
