In three shallow bowls, combine flour, salt and pepper; beat egg and water; and combine Parmesan cheese, saltines and basil. Dip steaks in flour mixture and egg mixture, then roll in cheese mixture. In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat. Brown three steaks on both sides. Remove to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Repeat with the remaining steaks, adding additional oil as needed. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 25 minutes. Drain any pan juices. Combine the tomato sauce, sugar, garlic and 1/4 teaspoon of oregano; pour over steaks. Bake 20 minutes longer. Place mozzarella cheese on steaks. Sprinkle with Parmesan and remaining oregano. Return to the oven for 5 minutes or until cheese is melted.
