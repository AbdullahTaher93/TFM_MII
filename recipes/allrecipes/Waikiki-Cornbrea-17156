Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking pan. In a large mixing bowl, combine baking mix, sugar, baking powder and cornmeal. In a separate bowl, combine eggs, milk and melted butter; beat until creamy. Stir in flour mixture until well combined. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean. Serve warm.
