Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; saute onion and garlic until onion is translucent. Stir in broth and tomatoes; sprinkle basil into sauce and season with salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for 15 minutes over medium-low heat. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and place pasta into serving bowls. Place cooked chicken in sauce to heat through; drop in spinach just before serving to cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Spoon sauce over hot pasta and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
