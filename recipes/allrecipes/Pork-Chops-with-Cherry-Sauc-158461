Season pork chops with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large skillet on high heat. Add pork shops; brown well, about 3 minutes per side. Remove to plate. Add onions to skillet; cook until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add chicken broth, dried cherries, orange marmalade, vinegar and red pepper flakes. Bring to a boil; boil rapidly on medium heat until broth is reduced by half. Reduce heat. Add pork chops to pan to heat through, 5 to 6 minutes. (Cook pork chops longer on lower heat, if pork chops are very thick or if they have a bone in them.) Internal temperature of the pork should be about 160 degrees F. Add chicken broth or water, if needed. Serve pork chops with cherry sauce spooned over them.
