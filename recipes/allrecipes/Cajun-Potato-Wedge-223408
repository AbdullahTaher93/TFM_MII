Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Cut each potato into 12 wedges; place in a large bowl. Toss potatoes with olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, onion powder, and paprika. Arrange in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Turn potatoes over and continue baking until golden and crisp, 25 to 30 minutes longer.
