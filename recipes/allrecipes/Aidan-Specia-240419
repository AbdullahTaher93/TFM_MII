Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Spread butter on 1 side of each bread piece and place, butter-side down, into the skillet. Place 2 slices Swiss cheese on each bread slice; cook until cheese melts, 3 to 4 minutes. Place turkey and tomato slices in a separate skillet over medium heat; cook until warmed, 2 to 3 minutes. Layer turkey, bacon, and tomato onto 1 bread slice that will be the bottom of the sandwich. Spread Russian dressing over tomato layer; top with second bread slice creating a sandwich.
