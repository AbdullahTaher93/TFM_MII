Cook the sausage in a 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat until the sausage is well browned, stirring frequently to break up meat. Pour off any fat. Stir in the pasta sauce, olives and garlic powder. Heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes or until the sausage is cooked through. Stir in the cheese and pasta. Serve with additional cheese, if desired.
