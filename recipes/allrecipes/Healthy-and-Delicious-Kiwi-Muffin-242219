Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. Whisk all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, ground quinoa, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Beat honey, coconut oil, almond milk, and egg whites together in another bowl. Pour honey mixture into flour mixture and stir until batter is just combined. Fold chopped kiwi into batter. Divide batter between prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and set, about 20 minutes.
