Crust. In the bowl of a food processor, blend flour, sugar, and salt. Add butter; pulse to form coarse meal. Add 6 tablespoons water and almond extract; pulse until moist clumps form when dough is pinched (add more water as needed). Turn dough onto a work surface, gather into a ball, and divide into 8 even pieces. Shape each piece into a 3/4-inch-thick disk, wrap in plastic; chill until firm enough to roll, at least 30 minutes. Galettes. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each disk into a 6-inch round. Transfer rounds to 2 rimmed, parchment-lined baking sheets. In a small bowl, combine 3 tablespoon sugar and flour; use half the mixture to sprinkle evenly on each disk, leaving a 1-inch border around edges. Divide fruit evenly and arrange on each disk. Fold up dough edges to form a rough lip over fruit, crimping every 1 or 2 inches. Place a few almonds in center of each galette. Brush dough with melted butter, then sprinkle evenly with remaining sugar. Bake in 400 degrees F oven until crust is golden brown (30 minutes). Serve warm or at room temperature.
