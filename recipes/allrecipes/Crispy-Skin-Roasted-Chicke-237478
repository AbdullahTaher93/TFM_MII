Dry chicken completely, inside and out, with paper towels. Gently insert rosemary sprigs and bay leaves between the skin and the breasts and thighs. Salt chicken liberally with kosher salt being careful to cover entire surface. Sprinkle with pepper. Cover loosely and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight. Preheat an oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Remove chicken from refrigerator and uncover. Heat a 12-inch cast iron skillet on stove top over medium heat. Wipe chicken dry with paper towels and place in hot skillet breast side up; it should sizzle. After about 15 seconds, put skillet in oven and roast until skin is blistered and brown, about 20 minutes. Turn chicken over and roast another 10 to 20 minutes. Turn chicken again and roast 5 more minutes to crisp the top.
