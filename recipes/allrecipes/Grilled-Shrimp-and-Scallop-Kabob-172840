Add all ingredients to a bowl and mix well, coating the shrimp and scallops evenly. Thread a metal or water-soaked wooden skewer with shrimp and scallops, alternating every other one. Pre-heat your grill to a medium high heat and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Flip your shrimp and scallop skewers and continue to cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes and remove from the grill. Squeeze a little fresh lemon and/or lime juice on your skewers to top them off. Enjoy!
