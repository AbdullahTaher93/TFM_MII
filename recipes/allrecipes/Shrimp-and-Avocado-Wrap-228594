Mix mayonnaise, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and hot pepper sauce in a bowl. Season with salt and ground black pepper to taste. Add shrimp; mix well. Heat a skillet or grill pan over high heat; pan-fry tortillas one at a time, cooking until softened and browned, about 10 seconds per side. Center a Boston lettuce leaf on each warm tortilla. Add shrimp mixture; top each with 2 avocado wedges. Fold tortillas at the ends to enclose filling, roll up, and cut in half diagonally to serve.
