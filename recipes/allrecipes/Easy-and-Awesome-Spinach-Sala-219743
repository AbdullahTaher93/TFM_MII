Place the bacon into a skillet over medium heat, and cook until browned and crisp, turning often, about 10 minutes. Transfer the bacon to paper towels to absorb excess grease. Crumble the bacon when cool. Place the spinach into a large salad bowl, and sprinkle with the bacon, hard-cooked eggs, and onion. Gently toss the salad. In a bowl, whisk together the sugar, ketchup, vegetable oil, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the dressing over the salad, and toss thoroughly to combine all ingredients.
