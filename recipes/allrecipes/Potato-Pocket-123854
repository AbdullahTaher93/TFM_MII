Divide the potatoes, carrots and onion equally between four pieces of heavy-duty aluminum foil (about 18 in. x 12 in.). Top with butter; sprinkle with salt if desired and pepper. Bring opposite short ends of foil together over vegetables and fold down several times. Fold unsealed ends toward vegetables and crimp tightly. Grill, covered, over medium coals for 20-30 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Remove from grill. Open foil and sprinkle with cheese; reseal for 5 minutes or until the cheese melts.
