Bring water, spread, Knorr(R) Fiesta Sides(TM) - Mexican Rice and chilies to a boil in medium saucepan. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until rice is tender, about 10 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes. Place 5 tortillas on baking sheet. Top tortillas with rice mixture, then cheese and another tortilla. Broil until tortillas are lightly toasted and cheese is melted, turning once. Cut each quesadilla into 4 wedges and serve, if desired, with guacamole, sour cream and/or chopped fresh cilantro.
