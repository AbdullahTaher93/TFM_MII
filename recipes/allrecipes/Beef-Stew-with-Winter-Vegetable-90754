Spread the flour on a large plate. Coat the beef with the flour and shake off the excess. Heat 4 tablespoons olive oil in a large, heavy, nonstick pot over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add the beef and cook until browned on all sides, about 7 minutes. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer the beef to a plate. Add the vinegar to the pot and cook over medium-high heat, scraping up any browned bits from the pot bottom. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and the onions. Saute over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 15 minutes. Add the carrots to the pot and saute until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Add the broth, wine, tomato paste, garlic, bay leaf, parsley sprigs and sage. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the meat is almost tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Add the butternut squash to the stew. Cover and simmer until the squash and meat are tender when pierced with a fork, about 15 minutes. Add the pearl onions and cook until just tender, about 5 minutes longer. Stir in the chopped parsley. Season the stew to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon into bowls and serve.
