Coat a medium nonstick skillet with nonstick spray and place over medium heat. Add the tomatoes, red peppers, scallions, and dill; saute for 7 to 10 minutes, or until soft. Transfer the vegetables to a small bowl. Wipe out the skillet and coat with nonstick spray. Return to the heat. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg whites, eggs, and milk. Season with salt and black pepper. Pour half of the egg mixture into the skillet and cook, occasionally scraping the bottom of the pan, for 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle half of the vegetable mixture over the eggs and top with 2 tablespoons of the Jarlsberg. Continue to cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the Jarlsberg is melted, the bottom is golden brown, and the eggs are set. Using a large spatula, flip the omelette in half and transfer to a plate. Place the plate in a warm oven. Coat the skillet with nonstick spray. Use the remaining egg mixture, vegetables, and Jarlsberg to make another omelette.
