In a medium bowl, toss together the cheeses and seasoning mix. Set aside. In heavy, 4-quart saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the butter. Add the garlic and tomatoes and saute, stirring frequently, until the tomatoes just begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the cheese mixture and stir until the cheese is completely melted. Add the cream and stir until smooth. Transfer to a fondue pot set over an alcohol or sterno flame to keep it warm. Alternatively, transfer to a mini electric slow cooker and keep warm. Serve immediately.
