In a mini food processor or spice grinder, combine the dried thyme with the dried rosemary, marjoram and oregano and blend the herbs until a powder forms. On a work surface, rub the minced garlic cloves all over the hanger steaks and sprinkle them with the sweet paprika. Dust the steaks with the powdered herbs, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Let the steaks stand at room temperature for 1 hour before proceeding. Light a grill. Drizzle the steaks all over with olive oil and season them generously with salt and pepper. Grill the steaks over a medium-high fire until they are charred on the outside and medium-rare on the inside, about 12 minutes per side. Transfer the steaks to a carving board to rest for 15 minutes. Working from both sides and using a sharp knife, slice the steaks against the grain until you reach the strip of gristle in the center. Discard the gristle. Arrange the slices on a platter and serve.
