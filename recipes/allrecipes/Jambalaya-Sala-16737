In a medium saucepan, bring water to a boil. Stir in the rice. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes. While the rice is cooking, place bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until evenly brown. Drain, cool, and crumble. In a large bowl, mix the cooked rice, crumbled bacon, shrimp, ham, bell pepper, celery, onion, and tomatoes. Prepare the dressing by whisking together the salad dressing, thyme, chili powder, garlic, and salt. Pour over rice mixture, and toss to coat. Cover, and chill in the refrigerator until serving.
