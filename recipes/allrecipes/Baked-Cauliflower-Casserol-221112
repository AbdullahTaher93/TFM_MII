Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion in hot oil until browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer onion to a large bowl; add cauliflower, mushrooms, chiles, and olives. Beat eggs with flour in a separate bowl. Stir cottage cheese, Cheddar cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, salt, and black pepper into egg and flour mixture. Combine egg and cheese mixture with the vegetable mixture until well mixed. Spread cauliflower mixture into prepared baking dish; sprinkle with bread crumbs. Bake in the preheated oven until cauliflower is tender and bread crumbs are lightly browned on top, about 1 hour.
