Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray. Mix oats, pumpkin puree, sugar, egg white, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Divide into 2 portions on the greased baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
