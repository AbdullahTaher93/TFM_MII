Season pork medallions with salt. Brush Dijon mustard around the sides of each medallion. Roll in rosemary and thyme until mustard is covered. Heat avocado oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add medallions; cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Flip with tongs. Cook until second side is browned, about 3 minutes more. Reduce heat; arrange mushrooms around medallions. Season with salt and pepper. Whisk bone broth, balsamic vinegar, and cassava flour together in a bowl until smooth. Pour over and around mushrooms; stir with a wooden spoon to distribute evenly. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until pork is no longer pink in the center and sauce thickens up, about 8 minutes.
