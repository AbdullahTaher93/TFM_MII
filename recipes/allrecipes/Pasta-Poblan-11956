Cook the pasta in a large pot of 4 quarts boiling salted water until al dente. Add the poblano pepper to the boiling water when you add the pasta. Drain water from pasta and remove poblano pepper. Using a blender, puree together the poblano pepper, garlic, onion and cream. In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the blended sauce and salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the cooked and drained pasta and grated mozzarella cheese. Cook for 10 minutes. Serve immediately.
