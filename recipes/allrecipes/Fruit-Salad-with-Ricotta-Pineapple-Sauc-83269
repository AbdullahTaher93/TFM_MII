In a large non-metallic serving bowl, stir together the crushed pineapple, sugar, and ricotta cheese until well blended. Stir in the fruit cocktail, pineapple tidbits, strawberries, apples and nectarines. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight. The longer you refrigerate before serving, the better it will taste.
