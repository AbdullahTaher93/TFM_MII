Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease or line 12 muffin cups. In a large bowl, mix together cornmeal, all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar. In a separate bowl, combine buttermilk, eggs and vegetable oil; beat well. Pour buttermilk mixture into flour mixture; stir until blended. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
