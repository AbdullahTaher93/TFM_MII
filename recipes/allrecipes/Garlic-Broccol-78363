Place garlic in a mortar dish or on a cutting board, and sprinkle with salt. Mash with a pestle, or use the flat side of a knife to mash garlic and salt into a paste. Transfer to a medium bowl, and stir in olive oil, vinegar, and mustard. Add the broccoli, and stir to coat. Chill for 3 hours to marinate, stirring occasionally. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese before serving.
