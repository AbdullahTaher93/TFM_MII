In a medium saucepan, bring the water and sugar to a boil, and cook the green beans 10 minutes, or until tender but crisp; drain. Transfer green beans to a medium bowl, and mix with garlic, onion, and mint. In a small container with a lid, mix olive oil, cider vinegar, garlic, basil, mustard, salt, and pepper. Shake until well blended. Toss into the green bean mixture.
