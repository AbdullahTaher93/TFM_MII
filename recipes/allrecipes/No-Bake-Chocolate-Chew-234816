Line two extra-large baking sheets with waxed paper; set aside. In a large saucepan, bring sugar, butter, half-and-half, and corn syrup to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in Ghirardelli(R) 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Chips, vanilla, and, if desired, almond extract. Stir until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth. Stir in oats, coconut, and almonds. Drop the mixture by rounded teaspoons onto the prepared baking sheets. Let stand at room temperature for about 1 hour or until set. Enjoy immediately, refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 1 week, or freeze for up to 3 months.
