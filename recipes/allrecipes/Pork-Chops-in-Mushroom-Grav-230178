Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle pork chops with garlic salt and black pepper. Fry pork chops in the hot oil until browned, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Transfer chops to a plate. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in skillet; cook and stir mushrooms in the hot oil until soft, 5 to 8 minutes. Scrape up and dissolve any browned bits of food into mushrooms as you stir. Pour golden mushroom soup and water into skillet and stir into mushrooms. Place pork chops and accumulated juices into mushroom sauce, spooning sauce over chops. Simmer until meat is no longer pink inside and juices run clear, occasionally spooning more sauce over chops as they cook, 10 to 15 minutes.
