Season the chicken liberally with seasoned salt. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; add chicken and cook until well browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove chicken from pan and set aside. Lower the heat, add the onion, and cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, carrot, and pimento, and cook and stir an additional 3 minutes. Pour the chicken broth into the pan, and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir in the lentils, rosemary, wine, and vinegar. Return the chicken to the pan; simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat; stir the lemon juice into the sauce and serve.
