Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Whisk olive oil, sea salt, garlic, rosemary, and black pepper together in a bowl; brush evenly onto zucchini strips. Cook on preheated grill until brown, 5 to 7 minutes per side; transfer to a serving platter. Drizzle balsamic vinegar over zucchini to serve.
