Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Whisk white sugar, brown sugar, butter, and egg together in a large bowl. Stir flour, baking soda, and salt into sugar mixture until batter is just mixed; fold in chocolate chips. Roll dough into 1-inch balls. Pour graham cracker crumbs into a resealable bag. Place each dough ball, 1 at a time, into the bag and shake until completely coated in graham cracker crumbs. Arrange coated dough balls on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned on the edges and have 'cracks' in the middle, about 10 minutes.
