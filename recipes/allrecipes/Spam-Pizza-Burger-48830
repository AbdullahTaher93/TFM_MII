Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grate the luncheon meat in to a medium bowl using a cheese grater. Stir in the chili and Cheddar cheese. Spread the mixture onto each bun half using a fork, and place them on a baking sheet. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until heated through and buns are nicely toasted on the bottom.
