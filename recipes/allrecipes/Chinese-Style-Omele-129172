Heat the broiler to high. Mix the ground turkey with 1 teaspoon of the soy sauce, rubbing together with your fingers. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet or wok, about 10 1/2 inches in diameter, over high heat. Add the turkey and cook, breaking it up with a spoon until it is lightly brown and crumbly, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the Napa cabbage, bean sprouts, peas, smoked turkey or chicken, water chestnuts, scallions, and cilantro and stir-fry 2 to 3 minutes. Lightly beat the eggs with the garlic, ginger, sherry, and remaining 1 teaspoon of soy sauce. Add to the pan, pouring the egg mixture evenly over the vegetables and turkey. Fry, stirring gently with a wooden spatula and lifting the sides of the omelet to let the uncooked egg mixture run onto the pan, until the omelet is set on the bottom. Slide the pan under the broiler (keeping the handle away from the heat if it isn't flameproof) and cook briefly to set the egg on top. Meanwhile, mix together the sesame oil, bean sauce, balsamic vinegar, and chile sauce. Cut the omelet into wedges. Serve drizzled with the bean-sauce mixture and garnished with cilantro.
