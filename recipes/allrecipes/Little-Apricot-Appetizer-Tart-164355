Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray 24 mini muffin cups with CRISCO(R) Original No-Stick Cooking Spray. Unroll each can of dough into a large rectangle; press perforations to seal. Cut each rectangle crosswise into 12 strips, about 1 inch wide. Place each strip in muffin cup, pressing dough to cover bottom and side, making sure all seams are sealed and forming 1/4-inch rim above cup. Spoon 2 teaspoons cheese into each cup. Top each with 1/2 teaspoon preserves and 1/2 teaspoon pecans. Bake 14 to 20 minutes or until crust is deep golden brown. Cool 5 minutes; remove from pan. Serve warm.
