Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease bottom only of 13x9 inch pan with shortening. Prepare brownies according to package directions. Remove from oven and immediately sprinkle marshmallows over warm brownies. Return to oven and bake 1 to 2 minutes longer, or until marshmallows just begin to puff. Remove from oven and cool while making topping. In 3-quart saucepan, mix brown sugar and corn syrup. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until mixture boils. Remove from heat and stir in peanut butter until well blended. Add cereal, peanuts and candy corn and stir until coated. Spoon warm topping over marshmallow layer immediately and spread to cover. Cool completely, for about 1 hour 15 minutes.
