Crumble turkey into a large skillet over medium heat. Stir onion, bell pepper, and garlic into the turkey. Cook and stir until turkey is completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the kidney beans, black beans, diced tomatoes, water, chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the skillet, and simmer for 10 minutes. Mix Cheddar cheese and Monterey jack cheese together in a bowl. Layer about 3/4 cup of the turkey mixture, 1 tortilla, and 1/2 cup the cheese mixture in the bottom of a 5-quart slow cooker; repeat layers until ingredients are fully used, ending with a cheese layer. Cook on Low until heated through, 5 to 7 hours.
