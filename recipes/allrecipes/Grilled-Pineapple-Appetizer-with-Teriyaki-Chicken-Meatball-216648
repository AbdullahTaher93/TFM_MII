Spray pineapple slices with cooking spray and grill or pan brown, lightly brush both sides with hoisin sauce. Cut rings into bite size pieces about 1 inch wide (just big enough for the meatballs to sit on top of). Prepare a medium skillet with pan spray and brown al fresco all natural Teriyaki Meat Balls over medium high heat on both sides. Add water, cover and fully heat meatballs. Skewer meatballs on top of pineapple and lightly brush with the hoisin sauce to give a glaze. Set-up on a platter, and put remaining hoisin sauce in a small dipping bowl. Garnish with fresh mint. Serve immediately.
