Mix the cream cheese, cranberry sauce, curry powder, and jalapeno peppers in a bowl until slightly lumpy. Lay a few wonton wrappers at a time out on a clean surface. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture onto the center of each one. Pinch the corners together to make a triangle shape. If they don't stick, wet them with a little water using your finger. Set aside on a piece of waxed paper while you assemble the remaining puffs. Heat oil in a large skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cook the wontons a few at a time in the hot oil until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle with green onions to serve.
