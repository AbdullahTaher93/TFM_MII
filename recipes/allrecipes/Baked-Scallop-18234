Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Pour melted butter into a 2 quart oval casserole dish. Distribute butter and scallops evenly inside the dish. Combine the bread crumbs, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, parsley, minced garlic and Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle this mixture over the scallops. Bake in pre-heated oven until scallops are firm, about 20 minutes.
