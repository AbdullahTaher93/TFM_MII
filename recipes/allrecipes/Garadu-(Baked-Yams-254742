Bring salted water to a boil in a pot. Add yams; cook and stir until slightly tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Mix oil, cumin, chaat masala, amchoor, turmeric, chili powder, salt, and pepper together in a container with a lid; add yams. Cover; shake until coated. Marinate 20 minutes to 2 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Transfer yams to a baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until yams are tender, 25 to 30 minutes.
