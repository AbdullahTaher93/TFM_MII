Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease an 8x12-inch baking dish. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir ground beef until crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir in onions, water, tomato sauce, garlic, salt and black pepper; bring to a simmer. Add rice, cover, and cook for 10 minutes. Spread half the shredded cabbage in prepared baking dish; cover with half the beef mixture. Repeat layers. Arrange bacon over final layer of beef. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven until bacon is crisp and cabbage is tender, about 1 1/2 hours.
