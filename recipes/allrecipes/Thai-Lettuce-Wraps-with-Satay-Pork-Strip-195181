Place chops in large self-sealing plastic bag; combine marinade ingredients in small bowl and pour over chops. Seal bag and refrigerate 1 to 4 hours. Remove from refrigerator 30 minutes prior to grilling. Meanwhile, spray cold grill grate with vegetable oil cooking spray. Prepare medium-hot fire in charcoal grill or preheat gas grill to medium-high. Arrange coals or burners so there is a medium zone for finishing chops. When ready to grill, remove chops from marinade (discarding marinade). Grill pork directly over medium-high fire until seared, 3 minutes per side. Slide chops to cooler part of grill, cover, and continue to grill until the internal temperature reaches 155 degrees F, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer to cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing. While pork is resting, soak rice noodles in very hot water for 10 minutes, then drain. Arrange stack of large lettuce leaves attractively on large serving platter. Place carrots, cucumber, rice noodles, and cilantro leaves in small dishes and arrange on serving platter. Combine sauce ingredients and transfer sauce to small bowl or ramekin. Cut pork into thin slices. If desired, lay 3 medium-sized leaves of lettuce on serving platter and arrange pork on lettuce. To assemble, let each guest place a lettuce leaf on an appetizer plate. Mound a bit of rice noodles, carrot, and cucumber on lettuce; top with a few slices of pork. Drizzle with sauce and add a couple cilantro leaves. Fold over the lettuce to form a roll and enjoy.
