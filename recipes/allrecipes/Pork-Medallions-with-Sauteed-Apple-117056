Flatten pork to 1/2-in. thickness. Combine the thyme, paprika, salt and pepper; sprinkle over both sides of pork. Place on a broiler pan. Broil 3-4 in. from the heat for 3-4 minutes on each side or until juices run clear; keep warm. In a nonstick skillet, saute onions and garlic in butter until tender. Add apples; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until crisp-tender. Combine the cornstarch, broth and apple juice until smooth; stir into apple mixture. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until thickened. Serve with pork.
