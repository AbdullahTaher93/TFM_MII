Pour the milk into a bowl; soak the rolls in the milk for about 15 minutes. Place the milk-soaked rolls, beef, pork, eggs, onion, parsley, marjoram, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix with your hands until evenly combined. Divide the mixture into eight portions and roll them into balls. Flatten the balls to make 1-inch thick patties. Melt the butter in a large skillet. Fry each patty in the melted butter until meat has reached an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (72 degrees C), about 6 minutes each side. These can be served either hot or cold.
