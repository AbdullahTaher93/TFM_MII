Add onions, garlic, and ginger; cook and stir until softened and golden, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix tomatoes, remaining turmeric powder, and cayenne pepper into onion mixture; cook for 5 minutes. Season mixture with salt. Add goat meat; cook and stir until goat meat is coated with spice mixture and browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour enough water over mixture to cover goat meat.
