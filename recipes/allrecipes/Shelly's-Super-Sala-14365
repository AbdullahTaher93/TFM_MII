Place eggs in a saucepan and cover completely with cold water. Bring water to a boil. Cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop. In a large salad bowl, combine the lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, red onion, mushrooms, eggs and cucumbers. Pour enough salad dressing to coat; toss and serve with fat-free croutons or melba toast.
