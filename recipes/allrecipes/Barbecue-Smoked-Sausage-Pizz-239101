Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Cut sausage on an angle in 1/4-inch slices. Place crusts on 2 baking sheets; spread 1/3 cup barbecue sauce on each crust. Top each pizza with 1/2 each of sausage, red onion, pepper and mozzarella cheese. Bake 20 minutes or until crust is crispy and cheese is lightly browned. Cut each pizza into 8 slices.
