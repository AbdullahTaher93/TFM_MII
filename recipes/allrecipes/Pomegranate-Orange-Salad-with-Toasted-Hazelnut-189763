Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Pour hazelnuts into a baking pan and bake, stirring occasionally, until nuts are golden beneath skins, 7 to 10 minutes. Pour nuts onto a clean cloth towel. When nuts are cool enough to handle, rub them in towel to remove loosened skins. Finely chop nuts; set aside. Use a sharp knife to remove peel and white pith from oranges. Working over a bowl to catch juice, cut between membranes to release orange segments into bowl. Drain oranges, reserving juice. For the dressing, whisk together 1 tablespoon reserved orange juice (save remaining orange juice for another use), pomegranate juice, vinegar, honey, and mustard. Slowly whisk in olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. To serve, place arugula in a large shallow serving bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons dressing. Scatter hazelnuts, orange segments, and pomegranate seeds over arugula. Serve immediately, serving remaining dressing on the side.
