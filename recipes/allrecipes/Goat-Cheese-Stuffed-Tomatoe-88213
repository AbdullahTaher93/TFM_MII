Preheat the oven broiler. Slice the tops off of the tomatoes and hollow out by removing the seeds. In a bowl, mix the goat cheese and chopped red peppers together. Spoon an equal amount of the cheese mixture into each hollowed out tomato. Place stuffed tomatoes upright in a baking dish. Top each tomato evenly with the bread crumbs and torn basil. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place under broiler for 5 to 10 minutes until bread crumbs are lightly browned.
