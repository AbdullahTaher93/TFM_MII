In a 3-qt. microwave-safe dish, combine crackers, pretzels and peanuts. Add butter mixture and mix lightly. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese; toss to coat. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 7-8 minutes or until mixture begins to toast, carefully stirring every 2 minutes. Cool. Store in an airtight container.
