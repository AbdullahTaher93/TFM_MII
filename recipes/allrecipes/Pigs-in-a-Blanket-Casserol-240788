Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Roll out 1 can of crescent roll dough into the bottom of the prepared baking dish, pinching all seams together. Spread 1 cup Cheddar cheese over dough, top with hot dogs, then spread remaining cheese over the top. Roll remaining crescent roll dough over the top and pinch seams together. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and hot throughout, about 30 minutes.
