Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Simmer artichokes in the boiling water until softened, about 30 minutes. Drain. Mix vinegar, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Whisk in olive oil in a slow, steady stream until vinaigrette is blended. Start by eating the artichoke leaves dipped in the vinaigrette. Discard small leaves and gently scrape fuzzy choke from the hearts. Fill the hearts with vinaigrette and slice.
