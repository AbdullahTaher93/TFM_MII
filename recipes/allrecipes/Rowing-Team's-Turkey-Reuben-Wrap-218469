Combine the cabbage, carrots, 1/2 cup salad dressing, and cider vinegar in a large bowl. Spread each tortilla with 1 tablespoon salad dressing (optional). Line each wrap with one lettuce leaf and arrange 3 ounces of turkey down the center of the lettuce. Place 2 cheese slices on top of the turkey. Top with 3/4 cup of the cabbage mixture. Fold the bottom of the tortilla snugly over the filling, then fold in the left and right edges. Roll the wrap up to the top edge, forming a tight cylinder. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Wrap in paper sandwich wrappers or plastic wrap, and store in refrigerator until serving. Before serving, cut each wrap in half across the middle with a slightly diagonal cut.
