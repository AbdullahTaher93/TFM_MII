Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir the mushrooms with juice, beef consomme, water, rice, and onion together in a glass baking dish with a lid. Arrange the butter atop the rice. Season with the garlic powder. Cover with lid. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the top and return to the oven until the cheese melts slightly, about 5 minutes.
