Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine the chicken soup, mushroom soup, chilies, salsa and sour cream in a bowl. Line the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish with corn tortillas. Follow with a layer of turkey. Pour 1/2 of soup mixture over turkey, sprinkle 1/2 of the cheese. Repeat layers and top with Cheddar cheese. Bake for 30 minutes.
