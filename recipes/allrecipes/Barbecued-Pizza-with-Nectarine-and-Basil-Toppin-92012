On a floured board, divide dough into 4 equal pieces; shape each into a ball. Roll out each ball into a 5- to 6-inch-wide round. Brush tops lightly with about half the olive oil. Place each round, oiled side down, on a 10- by 12-inch piece of foil (you should have 4 pieces of foil total). With your hands, flatten rounds to 1/8 inch thick and 7 to 8 inches wide. Lightly brush with remaining oil. Let stand, uncovered, at room temperature, until slightly puffy, 15 to 25 minutes. Thinly slice nectarines and mix with balsamic vinegar. Lift 1 piece of foil and flip the round of dough over onto a barbecue grill over a solid bed of medium-hot coals or medium-high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 3 to 4 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Peel off and discard foil. Repeat to place remaining rounds of dough slightly apart on grill. Cook until pizza crusts are golden brown on bottom, about 2 minutes. With a wide spatula, transfer crusts to baking sheets, browned sides up. Sprinkle cheeses evenly between the four pizzas. Lay nectarines over cheese. Top each pizza with 1 tablespoon pine nuts. Slide pizzas from baking sheet back onto grill. Cover barbecue (open vents for charcoal), and cook until toppings are hot and pizza bottoms are crisp and brown, 3 to 4 minutes more. Remove from grill. Scatter fresh basil over pizzas; add salt and pepper to taste.
