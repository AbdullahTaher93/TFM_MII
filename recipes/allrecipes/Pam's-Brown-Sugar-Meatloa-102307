Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position, and heat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5 inch loaf pan with vegetable cooking spray. Press brown sugar into prepared pan bottom; spread ketchup over the sugar. In a large bowl, mix ground beef with saltines, milk, eggs, onion, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and ginger. Form meat into a loaf, and press over brown sugar-ketchup mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf registers 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 1 hour and 15 minutes.
