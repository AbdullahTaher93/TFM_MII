In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs and molasses and mix thoroughly. Blend in dry ingredients. Roll into walnut-sized balls. Place on ungreased baking sheets (do not flatten). Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until done (centers will be slightly soft). In a small mixing bowl, beat frosting ingredients until creamy. Frost cookies while warm.
