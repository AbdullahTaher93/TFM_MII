Bring water to a boil in a saucepan. Remove from heat. Add apple and tea bags. Let stand, about 5 minutes. Place cinnamon, peppercorns, allspice, and cloves in the coffee filter. Tie securely with kitchen string and add to the saucepan. Steep until flavors combine, about 10 minutes. Discard apple. Steep tea for 5 minutes more. Strain tea into serving cups. Add 2 tablespoons anisette liqueur and some sweetener to each cup.
