Melt butter in heavy skillet over medium-high heat and quickly brown pork chops on both sides. Remove. Add mushrooms and thyme to pan and saute about 2 minutes allowing the mushrooms to soak up the butter. Return chops to skillet, add beer; bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to lowest setting and simmer 15 minutes. Spoon out the mushrooms (with a bit of liquid) to serve over the chops.
