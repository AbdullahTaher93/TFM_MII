In a sauce pan, add 1 cup of the water and the packet of Jell-O. Bring to a boil, stir well and remove from heat. In a food processor (or a mixing bowl and electric blender) whip the cream cheese. Little by little add some of the Jell-O mixture. Let each batch become fully incorporated before adding more. Scrape down the sides, occasionally. Then add the remaining water, also in batches. Spoon mixture into 4 wine glasses. Cover and refrigerator for 3 hours. Garnish with sliced strawberries
