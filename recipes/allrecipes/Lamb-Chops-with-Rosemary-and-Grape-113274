In a large stainless-steel or nonstick frying pan, heat the oil over moderately high heat. Season the lamb chops with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Put the chops in the pan and sprinkle 1 1/2 tablespoons of the rosemary in the spaces between the chops. Cook the chops for 5 minutes. Turn and sprinkle the garlic in between the chops. Cook the chops until done to your taste, 3 to 5 minutes longer for medium rare. Remove the chops and garlic and keep in a warm spot. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the pan. Add the grapes and the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons rosemary to the pan. Reduce the heat and cook, stirring frequently, until the grapes soften, about 8 minutes. Add the wine to the pan and simmer 2 minutes. Stir in the garlic and any juices from the lamb, the honey, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of pepper. Serve the lamb topped with the grapes and sauce.
