Place cabbage into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until just tender, about 10 minutes. Drain. Heat canola oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir tomatoes into onion mixture, place cover on saucepan, and cook until tomatoes are soft, 10 to 15 minutes. Mix water and tomato paste in a small bowl until smooth; pour into the saucepan. Stir the mixture, replace the cover, and cook another 5 minutes. Add mackerel in tomato sauce; season with red pepper flakes and seasoned salt. Stir drained cabbage into the mixture. Cover saucepan and simmer mixture until mackerel is hot, 10 to 15 minutes.
