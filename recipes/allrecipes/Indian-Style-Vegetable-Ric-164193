Heat the corn oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the onion, garlic, red bell pepper, and whole cloves. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and begun to brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in the rice, and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add 4 cups of water, salt, and cayenne pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, place the broccoli, corn, green beans, carrot, and 1/4 cup water into a microwave-safe bowl. Cover, and cook in the microwave at full power until the vegetables are tender, 2 to 4 minutes depending on the microwave. Once the rice has finished cooking, gently stir the vegetables into the rice along with the turmeric, black pepper, and cashews. Sprinkle with cilantro to serve.
