Stir carrots, wine, margarine, nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger together in a saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, adding more wine as necessary, until carrots are tender, about 30 minutes. Stir raisins and brown sugar into carrot mixture. Bring mixture to a simmer and cook until carrots are glazed and flavors combine, about 15 minutes.
