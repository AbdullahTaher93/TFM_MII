In a medium bowl, mix together cream cheese, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, and sweetened condensed milk. Mix in the coconut and rice cereal to form a workable dough. Roll dough into 1 inch balls, and refrigerate until set, about 1 hour. Melt chocolate over a double boiler, stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat when melted. Use toothpicks to hold the balls while dipping in the chocolate. Set on wax paper to dry.
