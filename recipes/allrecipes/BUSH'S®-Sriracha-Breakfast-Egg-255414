In 10-inch skillet, simmer tomatoes for 5 minutes. With potato masher or back of spoon, crush tomatoes. Add BUSH'S(R) Sriracha Beans and bring up to a simmer. Using back of spoon or bottom of mug, make four wells in bean mixture and crack eggs into individual wells. Cover and cook until egg whites are set, and yolks are still runny, about 5-8 minutes. To serve, plate each egg and top with queso fresco. Serve with tortillas or on top of tostadas.
