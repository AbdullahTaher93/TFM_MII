Trim roots from scallions. Remove bruised outer leaves and trim tops, leaving about 3 inches of dark greens. In a wide skillet, heat butter until foaming. Add scallions and saute, turning once, until slightly golden. Add broth and season with salt and pepper. Cover, lower heat, and cook until scallions are just tender, about 3 minutes. Drizzle with lemon juice before serving.
