In a bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, beat the egg, milk and 3 teaspoons oil; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Heat remaining oil in a heavy 8-in. skillet over low heat. Pour batter into the hot skillet; cover and cook for 4-5 minutes. Turn and cook 4 minutes longer or until golden brown.
