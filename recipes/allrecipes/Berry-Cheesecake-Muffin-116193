In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs; beat well. Combine the flour, baking powder and cinnamon; add to creamed mixture alternately with milk. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups one-third full. For filling, in a small mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar and egg until smooth. Fold in the berries. Drop a rounded tablespoonful into the center of each muffin. For topping, combine the flour, brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl; cut in butter until crumbly. Sprinkle over batter. (Muffin cups will be full.) Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.
