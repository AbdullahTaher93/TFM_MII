Cook couscous according to package directions. Transfer to a large serving bowl to cool. Stir to break up clusters of couscous. When the couscous has cooled to room temperature, mix in tomatoes, olives, bell peppers, cucumber, parsley, and feta. Gradually stir vinaigrette into couscous until you arrive at desired moistness.
