Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. In a large bowl, combine the bacon, broccoli, onion, dried fruit and sunflower seeds. Whisk together the mayonnaise, curry powder, vinegar and sugar. Pour dressing over salad; toss to coat, and marinate over night.
