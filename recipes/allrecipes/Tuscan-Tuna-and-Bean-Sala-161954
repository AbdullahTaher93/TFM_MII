In a small bowl, whisk together oil, vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper; set aside dressing. In a medium bowl, toss beans, onion, mint, cilantro, parsley, and olives, if desired. Add tuna and enough dressing to lightly coat; toss gently (refrigerate leftover dressing, if any, for another use). Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Cover; refrigerate at least 15 minutes (or up to 24 hours). Serve with crostini (toasted Italian bread), if desired.
