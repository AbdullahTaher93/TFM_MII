Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a medium saucepan, combine the Riesling with the carrot, celery, onion, peppercorns, juniper berries, garlic, bay leaf, thyme and oregano and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, coat the bottom of a large ovenproof skillet with the oil. Season the fish with salt and pepper. Skinned side up and starting from the tail end, roll up each fillet and secure with 2 toothpicks. Transfer the trout rolls to the skillet. Pour the Riesling mixture over the trout rolls and bake for 15 minutes, or until the fish flakes. Let rest for 5 minutes, then carefully remove the toothpicks. Transfer the rolls to shallow bowls and spoon the vegetables on top. Remove the bay leaf, herb sprigs and peppercorns from the broth. Whisk the butter into the broth, season with salt and pepper and spoon the broth over the trout. Serve right away.
