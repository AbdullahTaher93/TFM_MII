Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken breasts in hot oil until completely browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Add soup, white wine, tarragon, parsley, garlic powder, and marjoram to the skillet; bring to a boil, place a cover on the skillet, reduce heat to low, and cook until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, 10 to 15 minutes.
