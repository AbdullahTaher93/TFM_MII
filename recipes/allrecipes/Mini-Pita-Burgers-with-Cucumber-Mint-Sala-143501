Whisk mayonnaise, lemon juice, mint, and salt in medium bowl. Add cucumbers and toss. Set aside. Place onion, parsley, cumin, garlic, paprika, coriander, and salt in medium bowl and stir until thoroughly combined. Add beef and blend mixture into meat with your hands. (Don't over-handle meat or burgers will get tough.) Form beef into 16 mini patties and grill until cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. While burgers cook, lightly warm pita in toaster. To serve, stuff pita pocket with 4 or 5 cucumber slices and 2 burgers and drizzle with juices from salad. Serve remaining salad on side.
