Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season pork chops with seasoned salt. Cook pork chops in hot oil until browned completely, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove pork chops to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Mix celery soup, milk, sour cream, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Fold hash brown potatoes, 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese, and about half the French-fried onions into the soup mixture; pour into a 13x9-inch baking dish. Arrange pork chops atop the mixture. Cover the dish with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove foil and top pork chops with 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese and remaining half-can French-fried onions; continue baking until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the pork chops should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
