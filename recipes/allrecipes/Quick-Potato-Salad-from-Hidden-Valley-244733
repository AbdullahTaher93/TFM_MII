In a large pot over a medium high heat, add the potatoes, salt, and enough water to cover. Once boiling, cook the potatoes for 10 to 15 minutes or until tender when pierced with a fork. Drain and set aside to cool slightly. In a large bowl, mix the potatoes and Hidden Valley(R)Bacon Ranch Dressing together until well-coated. Chill covered for at least 1 hour. Overnight is best. Serve garnished with the chives.
