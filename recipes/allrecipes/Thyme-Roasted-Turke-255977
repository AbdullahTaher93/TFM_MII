Place oven rack in lowest position. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Place roasting rack in shallow roasting pan. Mix garlic powder, paprika, thyme, pepper and salt in small bowl. Place turkey, breast-side up, in prepared pan. Brush turkey with oil. Sprinkle seasoning mixture evenly over turkey. Cover loosely with heavy duty foil. Roast 2 hours, adding an extra 15 minutes per pound for larger turkeys. Remove foil. Roast 1 hour longer or until internal temperature in thigh reaches 165 degrees F (175 degrees F in thigh), basting occasionally with pan juices. Remove turkey from oven. Let stand 20 minutes. Transfer to platter or carving board to slice. Reserve pan juices to make gravy or to serve with turkey.
