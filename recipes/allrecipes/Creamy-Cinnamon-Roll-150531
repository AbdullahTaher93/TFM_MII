On a lightly floured surface roll each of the bread dough loaves to a 12x9-inch rectangle. Spread 1/3 cup of the EAGLE BRAND(R) over dough rectangles. Sprinkle with 1 cup pecans and cinnamon. Roll up jelly-roll style starting from a short side cut. Cut each into 6 slices. Generously grease 13x9-inch baking pan. Place rolls, cut sides down, in pan. Cover loosely with greased wax paper and then with plastic wrap. Chill overnight. Cover and chill remaining 1/3 cup EAGLE BRAND(R). To bake let pan of rolls stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until golden brown. Cool in pan 5 minutes; loosen edges and remove rolls from pan. For frosting, in small bowl, combine confectioners' sugar, remaining 1/3 cup EAGLE BRAND(R) and vanilla. Drizzle frosting on warm rolls. Sprinkle with additional chopped pecans (optional).
