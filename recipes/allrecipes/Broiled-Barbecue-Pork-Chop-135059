Cook the brown rice according to directions, adding the vegetables as it cooks. Place the pork chops in a broiler pan. Mix together the garlic powder, mustard, brown sugar, and barbecue sauce, and brush the mixture on the chops. Put the broiler pan on the top oven rack, 4 to 5 inches from the heat source, and broil for 8 to 10 minutes per side. Serve with the rice, vegetables, and applesauce.
