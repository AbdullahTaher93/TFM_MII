Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) and bring a large pot of water to a boil. Toss the tomatoes in 25 ml of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place on a sheet tray. Roast in the oven for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, saute the garlic in 13ml of olive oil for 1 to 2 minutes or until slightly yellow in color. Add the chopped roasted tomatoes. In a blender, combine the cheese and basil, season with salt and pepper, blend well, and add remaining oil while blending; set aside. Cook the pasta according to package directions; drain and toss with the tomato mixture. Drizzle with the basil pesto and toss with the arugula. Top with the crispy prosciutto.
