Mix paprika, mango garlic seasoning, cayenne pepper, dried basil, dried thyme, minced garlic, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt together in a bowl. Brush a light coating of olive oil on both sides of fillets. Dredge fillets in seasoning mixture. Heat remaining olive oil in an electric skillet to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Cook fillets until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 6 minutes per side.
