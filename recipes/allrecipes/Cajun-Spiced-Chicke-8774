Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a shallow plate or bowl, mix together the flour and at least 1 teaspoon of Cajun seasoning (more if you really like the zip of Cajun seasoning!). Pour milk for dipping into a bowl and dip the chicken breasts into it. Dredge the chicken through the flour and seasoning mixture, coating evenly on both sides and around the edges. Place the chicken breasts in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish and bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes.
