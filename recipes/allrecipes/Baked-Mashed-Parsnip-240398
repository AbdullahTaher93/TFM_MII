Place parsnips into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain and cool slightly. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat parsnips, melted butter, sherry, heavy whipping cream, salt, and white sugar together in a bowl until smooth. Spoon into a baking dish and top with bread crumbs; dot with butter pieces. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 25 to 30 minutes.
