In a mixing bowl, combine flour, cinnamon, baking soda and salt. Add oil, eggs and vanilla; mix well (batter will be thick). Toss apples with sugar; fold into batter. Spread into a greased and floured 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. For topping, beat the butter, sugars and cinnamon in a small mixing bowl. Stir in coconut and walnuts; mix well. Sprinkle over the batter. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until the cake tests done.
