Cut the chicken breasts into thin strips. Mix together the polenta, dried minced onion, paprika, cumin seeds, pepper, and salt in a plastic bag. Add the chicken strips, a few at a time, and toss well to coat all over; shake off the excess. Place on a plate while making the tzatziki. Squeeze the grated cucumber, in handfuls, to remove excess moisture, then put into a bowl. Add the sour cream, yogurt, garlic, and mint and stir to mix; set aside. Heat the broiler. Heat a griddle or heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat. Add half the oil, swirling it around the pan until lightly coated. Add half the chicken strips and fry until golden brown all over and cooked through, turning once, 2 to 3 minutes. Keep hot while cooking the remaining chicken strips, using the rest of the oil. Meanwhile, warm the pita breads under the broiler 1 minute on each side. Split down the side of each pita to make a pocket. Fill the pita pockets with the salad leaves. Pile in the chicken strips, spoon the tzatziki over.
