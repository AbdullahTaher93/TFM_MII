Pour 1 1/4 cups water into a blender or food processor. Add raspberries and wine and process for 2 minutes, or until smooth, scraping down sides once. Pour into a medium saucepan and add cranberry-raspberry juice, SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, cinnamon, and cloves. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then immediately remove from heat. Pour mixture through a medium-mesh strainer into a medium bowl. Discard solids. Whisk lemon juice and yogurt into soup, then cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to 2 days. Divide soup among 4 bowls and top each with a generous tablespoon of sour cream.
