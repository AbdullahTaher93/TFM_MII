Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a jelly roll pan or large baking sheet with edges. Whisk flour and baking powder together in a bowl. Stir mozzarella cheese, onions, and bacon bits into flour mixture. Combine quark cheese, milk, and 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon oil in a separate bowl; mix into flour mixture until thoroughly combined using your hands. Roll mixture into 15 even balls. Arrange balls on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
