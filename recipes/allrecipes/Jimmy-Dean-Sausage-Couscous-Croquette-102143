Cover and simmer for 10 minutes on low heat. Remove from heat; cool 5 minutes. Stir in parsley and onion; adjust seasonings to taste. Add beaten egg; stir well. Moisten hands with water and mold cooled sausage mixture into 20 small logs. Roll in breadcrumbs. To cook: in a wok, Dutch oven or fryer, add oil to a depth of 3 inches; heat to 375 F.
