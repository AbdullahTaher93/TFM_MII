Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Using an electric mixer, beat egg whites with salt in a medium bowl at high speed until stiff, moist peaks form; set aside. In another bowl, beat egg yolks with pepper and nutmeg until very thick and lemon colored. Whisk in sour cream. Pour yolk mixture over beaten whites and gently fold together. Place a 10-inch nonstick frying pan with an ovenproof handle over medium heat. Add butter and heat until it is melted and bubbly, tilting to coat bottom and sides of pan. Pour in egg mixture and lightly smooth surface with a flexible spatula. Cook without stirring until omelet is puffy and lightly browned on bottom, 2 to 3 minutes; lift edge carefully to check the color. Transfer pan with omelet to oven; bake until top of omelet is a pale golden brown and a knife inserted in center comes out clean, 6 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle evenly with cheese; then, using a spatula, loosen edge. Carefully tip omelet out of pan, allowing top edge of omelet to fold over. Slide omelet onto a warm platter and serve immediately.
