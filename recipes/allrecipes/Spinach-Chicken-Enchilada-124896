Coat a large skillet with nonstick cooking spray; cook and stir chicken and onion over medium heat for 6-8 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink. Remove from the heat; add spinach and mix well. In a bowl, combine soup, milk, sour cream and seasonings; mix well. Stir 3/4 cup into chicken and spinach mixture. Divide evenly among tortillas. Roll up and place, seam side down, in a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan that has been sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Pour the remaining soup mixture over enchiladas. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes. Uncover and sprinkle with cheese; return to the oven for 15 minutes or until cheese is melted and bubbly. Garnish with parsley.
