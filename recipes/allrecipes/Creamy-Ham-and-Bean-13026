Add beans to boiling water and cook on high. Beans will soak up some water, so you will need to add more water later. As soon as beans can be mashed with fork, add ham and onions, let cook until beans and ham are done. Turn down to medium heat and add soup and cheese. Stir frequently while soup and cheese are mixed into the beans. When cheese is melted turn off heat and serve. Leftovers may be frozen.
