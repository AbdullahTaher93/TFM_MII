In a small bowl, mix together fish sauce, lime juice, and honey. Place tuna in a large, plastic, resealable bag, and pour fish sauce mixture over the tuna. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a wok over high heat. When the oil is very hot, almost smoking, place 1/2 tuna in pan; cook and stir for 1 minute, or until desired doneness. Transfer cooked fish to a large bowl. Repeat with remaining oil and tuna. Toss warm fish with tomatoes, green onion, red chile pepper, cilantro, and basil. Serve.
