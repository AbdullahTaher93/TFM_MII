Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Whisk together the matzo flour, baking soda, baking powder (see Note), and salt in a large mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, white sugar, margarine, vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon of lemon extract, lemon juice, vegetable oil, and food coloring with an electric mixer set on medium speed until smooth; pour the wet ingredients into the flour mixture. Stir until combined into a smooth batter, and pour into the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until set and lightly browned, about 45 minutes. A toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf will come out clean. Cool completely, then remove from the pan. Place 1 cup of confectioners' sugar in a bowl. In a separate small bowl, mix the non-dairy creamer with water, and stir in 1 tablespoon of confectioners' sugar. Stir the creamer mixture into the confectioners' sugar by teaspoons until the mixture forms an even, workable glaze. Mix in 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract. Spread the glaze over the cooled lemon loaf. Allow to set, and serve in 1-inch slices.
