Microwave tortillas on high for about 30 seconds, until slightly warm and softened. Set a large nonstick frying pan or griddle over medium heat. When hot, place tortilla in pan. Sprinkle 1/4 cup Monterey Jack cheese over tortilla, cover with 2 ounces turkey. Heat until cheese melts, about 1 minute. Using a spatula, remove from heat and top with a handful of romaine, 2 tablespoons carrots, and 1 tablespoon dressing. Fold edge of tortilla closest to you up and over fillings. Tuck fillings tightly into tortilla, then fold over opposite edge and secure with a toothpick if necessary. Repeat with remaining tortillas, making 4 wraps total. Serve immediately, passing remaining dressing at the table.
