Lightly beat eggs with milk; add tortilla chips. Let stand for 15 minutes. In a large skillet, saute ham, onion and green pepper in butter. Add egg mixture and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until eggs are set. Remove from the heat; gently stir in cheese and tomato. Serve in the skillet or transfer to a warm serving platter. Top with sour cream and taco sauce.
