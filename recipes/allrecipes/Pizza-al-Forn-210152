Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Combine sauce with ricotta in medium bowl. Arrange pizza crust on ungreased pizza pan or baking sheet. Evenly spread with ricotta mixture, then top with tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. Bake 15 minutes or until ricotta mixture is bubbling. Garnish, if desired, with Parmesan cheese curls and fresh basil leaves.
