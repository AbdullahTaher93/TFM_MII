Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook until well browned on both sides. Remove the beef from the skillet. Pour off any fat. Add the mushrooms to the skillet and cook until tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in the Italian sauce and Worcestershire and heat to a boil. Return the beef to the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Cook until the beef is fork tender. Serve the beef and sauce over the rice. Sprinkle with the parsley.
