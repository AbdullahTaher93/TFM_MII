Get the dressing set up first. In a small jar or bowl add the vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, basil and black pepper. Shake or stir. Add the olive oil. Let this sit at room temp while you prepare the rest of the salad. To toast the pine nuts, simply add them to a dry skillet over medium-high heat and casually stir until they start to take on some color. They can burn easily so keep a close watch. Turn them out on a paper towel to cool. If you are using baby spinach, the leaves can be left whole, otherwise tear into bite-sized pieces. Be sure that the spinach is dry. Place in a large salad bowl. Shred the prosciutto into small pieces. I do this with my hands but you can use a knife. Add to the bowl. When ready to serve, shake or whisk the dressing and drizzle some over the spinach and prosciutto and toss well. Use just enough dressing to lightly wet. Add more as needed. Then toss in the pine nuts and parmesan cheese and serve immediately.
