In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Stir in Hollandaise Sauce Blend. Gradually stir in milk. Cook, stirring constantly, until sauce comes to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring constantly, 1 minute, or until thickened. Add spinach, pimientos, Parmesan cheese and dill. Heat, stirring frequently, until cheese is melted and sauce is well blended. Remove from heat. Add sour cream and stir until smooth. Serving Suggestions: Serve dip in decorative bowl with assorted crackers or in a hollowed-out round bread loaf. Dip may be prepared 1 day ahead, covered and refrigerated, and reheated in a covered 1-quart casserole dish in a 350 degrees F oven 20 minutes, or until heated through.
