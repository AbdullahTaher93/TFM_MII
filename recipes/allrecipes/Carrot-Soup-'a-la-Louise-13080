In a large Dutch oven, heat the margarine, add the onion and the garlic, and saute until light golden. Pour in the chicken stock and add the carrots. Then stir in the dill, marjoram, thyme, parsley and salt and pepper to taste. Reduce heat to low and let simmer until carrots are to desired tenderness. Mix cornstarch with small amount of cold water to dissolve. Add the diluted cornstarch and stir well. Add the cream and let simmer another 15 minutes (do not boil). Bon Appetit!
