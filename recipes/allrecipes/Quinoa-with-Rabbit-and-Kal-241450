Melt coconut oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Saute onion in hot oil until browned and softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add quinoa; saute until fragrant and toasted, about 3 minutes. Stir chicken stock, rabbit meat, coriander, cumin, and cayenne pepper into quinoa mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover the Dutch oven with a lid, and simmer until liquid is almost completely absorbed, about 15 minutes. Stir kale into rabbit mixture and continue simmering until liquid is completely absorbed and quinoa is tender, about 5 minutes more.
