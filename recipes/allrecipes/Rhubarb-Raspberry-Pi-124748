In a large bowl, combine sugar and tapioca. Add the rhubarb, raspberries and lemon juice; mix gently. Let stand for at least 15 minutes or up to 1 hour to soften tapioca; stir gently several times. Line a pie plate with bottom crust. Pour filling into crust. Top with a lattice crust. Bake at 375 degrees F for 45-55 minutes or until the crust is golden and filling is bubbly. Serve warm or at room temperature.
