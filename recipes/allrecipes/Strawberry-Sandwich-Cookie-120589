In a food processor or blender, process almonds until ground; set aside. In a mixing bowl, cream margarine and 1/2 cup sugar. Beat in egg and extract. Combine flour and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture. Stir in the ground almonds. Divide dough in half; cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until easy to handle. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each portion of dough into a 12-in. x 9-in. rectangle. Cut lengthwise into three strips; cut each strip widthwise into six pieces. With a 3/4-in. round cutter, cut out a circle in the center of half of the pieces (discard circles). Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks to cool. For glaze, combine lemon juice and remaining sugar; thinly spread over whole cookies. Top with cutout cookies; fill center with 1/2 teaspoon jam.
