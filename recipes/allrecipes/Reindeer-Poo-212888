Place the white candy coating, German sweet chocolate, chocolate chips, and peanuts into a slow cooker. Set the cooker to Low, cover, and gently heat the candy for 1 1/2 hours without stirring. After 1 1/2 hours, stir the mixture, and spoon out by teaspoons onto waxed paper. Allow to cool and set, about 45 minutes.
