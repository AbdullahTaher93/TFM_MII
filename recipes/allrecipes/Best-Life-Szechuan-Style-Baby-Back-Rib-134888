Combine the sauce ingredients in a bowl and refrigerate at least 1 hour, preferably overnight. Pour the water into a large, ovenproof skillet. (You'll use the same one later to bake the ribs.) Add the ginger, parsley, and cilantro to the liquid, and put the ribs into the pan. Bring to a full boil; then reduce the heat to medium and let a slow, steady, soft boil continue for about 30 minutes. This tenderizes the ribs and imparts flavor. Remove the pan from the stove and drain the liquid. Take the Szechuan sauce and reserve about 1 cup of it; brush the rest gently on the ribs, covering them thoroughly on both sides. If cooking in the oven, broil the ribs for several minutes. Reset the oven to bake at 450 degrees F; then cook the ribs for 15 to 20 minutes, until the meat is tender, brown, and falling off the bone. (Or you can grill the ribs over mesquite wood.) Serve with the reserved sauce on the side for dipping.
