In a wok or 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium heat, frequently shake sesame seeds until golden, about 5 minutes. Pour from pan and save. Turn heat to high; add shelled peas, sugar snap peas, and 3 Tbsp. water to pan; cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until peas are tender to the bite, about 3 minutes. Uncover and add pea greens; stir until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Add sesame seeds and sesame oil; pour into bowl. Add salt to taste. Serve immediately.
