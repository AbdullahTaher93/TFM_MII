Place bread crumbs in a large bowl. Stir with cream. Let stand for 5 minutes until milk soaks into crumbs. Add meats, onion, garlic, egg, parsley, Parmesan, salt, pepper to the bread mixture. Mix well; form twelve 1 1/2-inch (3.5 cm) meatballs. Sauce: Meanwhile in a large wide saucepan, heat butter over medium heat. Add garlic; stir 1 minute. Add tomatoes and seasonings. Use a potato masher to crush tomatoes. Simmer covered for 5 minutes. Add meatballs to simmering tomato sauce. Cook covered, stirring occasionally for 5 minutes. Uncover and turn meatballs; cook until meatballs are cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove meatballs with a slotted spoon. Simmer sauce uncovered, until very thick for about 5 more minutes. Pour in cream; bring to a light boil. Return meatballs to sauce; heat through. Split rolls in half and spoon in three meatballs and some of the sauce in the bottom half of rolls. Top with your favourite toppings. Top with other half of rolls.
