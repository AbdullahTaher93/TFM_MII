Increase the heat to high. Boil for about 7 minutes, or until the wine no longer smells of alcohol. Add the tomatoes and salt. Decrease the heat to medium. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the mussels. Stir. Increase the heat to high. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the mussels open. Discard any mussels that do not open. Spoon the mussels into large bowls and ladle the broth over them. Serve the bread on the side.
