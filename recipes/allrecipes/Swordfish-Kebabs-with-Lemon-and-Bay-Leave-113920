Light a grill. Soak the bay leaves in hot water for 10 minutes, then drain. Alternately thread the swordfish, bay leaves and lemon wedges onto skewers. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the kebabs over high heat, turning occasionally, until the fish is cooked through and the lemons are charred in spots, about 5 minutes. Serve right away.
