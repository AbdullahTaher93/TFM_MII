With a sharp knife, remove the peel and skin from the orange. Working over a large bowl to catch the juice, cut the segments from their surrounding membranes. (Discard membranes, pith and skin.) Add pork, fennel, onion, oil, vinegar, salt and pepper to the bowl; toss to combine. Sprinkle with pepitas.
