Whisk together the soy sauce and cornstarch in a bowl until cornstarch is completely dissolved; set aside. Prepare a skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat; drizzle in the sesame oil. Place the snow peas and carrots in the skillet; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Pour the broth over the vegetables. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce heat to low; simmer until vegetables are slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the soy sauce mixture; continue to cook until the sauce has thickened.
