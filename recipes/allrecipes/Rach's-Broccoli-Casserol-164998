Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl; whisk in the mayonnaise, cream of mushroom soup, broccoli, Cheddar cheese, onion, and butter. Spoon into a 2 quart casserole dish; sprinkle with the crushed crackers. Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbly, 30 to 40 minutes.
