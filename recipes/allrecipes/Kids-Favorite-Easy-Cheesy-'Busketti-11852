Combine the tomato soup with about half a can of milk and about half the cheese in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly. Melt all together. Continue to add the cheese, melting all together. DO NOT BOIL! Continue to add milk until desired consistency is reached. Serve over warm, cooked spaghetti. Cheesy goodness!
