In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the milk and lemon peel. Combine flour and baking powder; gradually add to the creamed mixture and mix well. Stir in currants. Transfer to a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
