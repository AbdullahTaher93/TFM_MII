Scrub beets, leaving on root and 1 inch of stem. Place beets in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer 45 to 60 minutes or until tender. Drain. Remove skins and cut beets into wedges. In a saucepan, combine remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil; simmer until thickened. Add beets and toss.
