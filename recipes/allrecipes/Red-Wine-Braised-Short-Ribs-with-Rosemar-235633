Season the beef with the salt and black pepper. Coat the beef with half the flour. Heat the oil in an 8-quart saucepot over medium-high heat. Add the beef in 2 batches and cook until well browned on all sides. Remove the beef from the saucepot. Add the onions and tomato paste to the saucepot and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the carrots, celery, chopped garlic and rosemary and cook for 3 minutes. Stir in the stock, wine and remaining flour and heat to a boil. Return the beef to the saucepot. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 1 hour 30 minutes or until the beef is fork-tender.
