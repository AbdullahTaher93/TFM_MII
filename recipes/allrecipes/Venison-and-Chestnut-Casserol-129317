Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat half of the olive oil in a large Dutch oven. Add the venison in 1 layer and let it brown on each side for about 5 minutes, turning once. Do this in 2 batches if necessary. Using a slotted spoon, remove the meat from the pan and set it aside on a plate. Add the sliced onions to the Dutch oven and stir well. Cook over a low heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened and just beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, beets, orange zest, and juice. Stir well, then return the venison and its juices to the pan, and add the port and beef stock. Bring to a simmer. Cover the pan and transfer to the oven. Cook until the venison is tender, about 1 hour and 20 minutes, adding the chestnuts in the last 15 minutes of cooking. Meanwhile, place the carrots, ginger, and shallots in a roasting pan, add the remaining oil, and stir until the vegetables are evenly coated. Place in the oven above the Dutch oven and roast for 1 hour, turning the vegetables over halfway through the cooking time. Blend the flour with the milk to make a paste. Move the Dutch oven from the oven to the top of the stove. Place over medium-high heat and add the paste a little at a time, whisking constantly and simmering until the gravy thickens. Season to taste. Serve the venison casserole hot, with the roasted vegetables.
