Combine shrimp, celery, onion, lemon juice, salt, pepper and one cup mayonnaise in a mixing bowl. Refrigerate and chill the shrimp mixture for at least one hour. Cut the tops off of the tomatoes and scoop out their insides; chill until the shrimp mixture is well chilled. Scoop the shrimp mixture into the hollowed out tomatoes. Serve.
