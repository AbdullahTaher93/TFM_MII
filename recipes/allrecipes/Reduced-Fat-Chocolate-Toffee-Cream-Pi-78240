Place chocolate in a small bowl, set aside. Microwave half and half for 1 1/2 minutes on High (100% power). Pour hot cream over chocolate, let stand 5 minutes, then stir until smooth. Using an electric mixer, beat Neufchatel cheese, brown sugar and vanilla in a medium bowl until smooth. Gently beat in chocolate mixture. Fold in 1/2 cup of chocolate covered toffee bits. Pour the filling into crust. Chill in refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight. Before serving, spread 2 cups light whipped topping over pie and top with remaining toffee bits.
