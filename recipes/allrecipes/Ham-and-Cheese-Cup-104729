Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly spray 1 3/4x 1-inch miniature muffin pans with vegetable cooking spray. Press each slice of bread with palm of hand or rolling pin to flatten. Cut star-shape with a 3-inch star cookie cutter from the center of each bread slice. Place each star in muffin pan, pressing in center to form a cup. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes or until lightly browned. Combine cheeses, mayonnaise, and Worcestershire together in a medium bowl. Add ham and onions stirring until mixed. Spoon 1 heaping teaspoonful of ham mixture into each cup. Bake an additional 4 to 6 minutes or until bread is crisp. Sprinkle with paprika and garnish with chives, if desired.
