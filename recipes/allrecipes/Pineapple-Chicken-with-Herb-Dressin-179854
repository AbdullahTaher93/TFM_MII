To make dressing, mix lemon juice, oil, soy sauce, hot sauce, and herbs in a small bowl. Set aside. Cut top and rind from pineapple. Slice fruit into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Remove core with small knife, if desired. Cut slices in half crosswise. Save about 1/4 cup of the juice exuded while cutting. Peel and pit avocados and cut them lengthwise into 1/2-inch slices. Moisten slices with reserved pineapple juice. Mix together lettuce and cabbage; spread out on a large platter or divide among 6 individual plates. Arrange pineapple, avocado, and chicken decoratively on greens. Add dressing and salt to taste.
