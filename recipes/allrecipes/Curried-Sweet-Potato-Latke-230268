Combine flour, curry powder, white sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, cumin, salt, cayenne pepper, and black pepper in a bowl. Whisk together eggs and milk in a separate bowl. Pour into flour mixture and stir until well blended and batter has no lumps. Stir in sweet potatoes until fully combined. Heat enough oil to cover the bottom of a heavy skillet over medium heat. Drop batter by tablespoonfuls into hot oil, using spatula to flatten. Fry until well browned, about 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and serve hot.
