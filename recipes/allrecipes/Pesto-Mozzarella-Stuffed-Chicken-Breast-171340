Prepare a charcoal or gas grill for direct, high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above cooking grate only 3 to 4 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). While grill heats, with a sharp knife, cut a pocket lengthwise in the edge of each chicken breast half, taking care to avoid cutting through to the other side. Season chicken pieces on both sides with pepper. Spread about 1 tablespoon pesto inside each pocket, then fill each with 1/4 of the mozzarella balls and 1/4 of the roasted red pepper slices. Rub remaining pesto over exterior of chicken to coat lightly. Place chicken on oiled cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook, turning once with a wide spatula, until meat is browned and no longer pink in center (cut to test, but do not disturb filling), about 15 minutes total.
