Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 cookie sheets with aluminum foil. With an electric beater, beat egg whites until peaks form. Add sugar into the egg whites 1 teaspoon at a time. Gently stir in vanilla and salt, beat until the egg white are stiff and shiny. Fold in chocolate chips. Drop mixture by teaspoon onto the sheets. Turn off the oven, place the cookies inside the oven and leave them for a few hours or overnight. When you remember to look for them, they'll be ready to eat!
