Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook garlic in the hot oil until golden, about 5 minutes. Stir beans into the oil; season with salt. Cook and stir the beans until hot, about 5 minutes. Stir tomatoes into the beans; cook and stir until the tomatoes soften, about 5 minutes more. Pour broth over the beans mixture; stir. Cook the mixture at a simmer until the liquid reduced in volume by about half, about 15 minutes. Season with pepper.
