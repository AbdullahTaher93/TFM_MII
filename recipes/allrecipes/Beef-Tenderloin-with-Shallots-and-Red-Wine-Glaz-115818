Let tenderloin come to room temperature, about 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F with rack in center. Arrange 7 rosemary sprigs in a medium roasting pan; place tenderloin on top. Arrange shallots around tenderloin. Rub meat and shallots with oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast 25 minutes. Turn shallots for even browning; if roast is dry, baste with more oil or pan juices. Cook until shallots are golden, 10 to 15 minutes more; transfer to a small bowl; reserve. Meat should register 120 degrees F with instant-read thermometer; timing will vary with thickness of meat. Transfer beef to a medium platter. Let sit 20 minutes at room temperature before carving. Meanwhile, chop remaining rosemary into small pieces. Place roasting pan over high heat. Add wine and stock. Cook, scraping bottom of pan to collect any cooked-on bits, until liquid has reduced by half, 6 to 8 minutes. Pass through strainer. Serve beef with gravy and reserved shallots.
