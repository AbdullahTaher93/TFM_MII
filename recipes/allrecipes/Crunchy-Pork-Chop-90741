Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a large resealable plastic bag, combine cornmeal, cheese, sesame seeds, wheat germ, garlic powder, parsley, thyme, sage, salt, and pepper. Shake bag to mix ingredients. Measure 1 cup of the mix into a shallow dish. In a 10- by 15-inch pan, combine butter and oil. Place pan in oven just until butter melts, about 1 minute. Remove from oven. In a shallow dish, beat together eggs and milk until blended. Rinse pork chops and pat dry with a paper towel. Dip each chop in egg mixture; drain briefly, then dip in coating mix, turning to coat thoroughly. Arrange chops in baking pan, turning to coat with butter-oil mixture. Bake, turning chops once, for 30 minutes or until no longer pink in the center (cut to test).
