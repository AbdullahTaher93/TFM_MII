Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat butter in a large pot over medium heat until melted. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Season flour with salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Dredge lamb chops in flour mixture on both sides. Layer lamb chops with onion, carrot, and celery in a casserole dish. Mix stock, plum jam, tomato sauce, and Worcestershire sauce together in a small bowl. Pour over lamb in the casserole dish. Bake in the preheated oven until lamb is tender, about 1 hour 30 minutes.
