Place turkey ham flat-side down over a bed of baby carrots and red potatoes in a slow cooker. Drop the garlic in and place the cabbage wedges over the turkey ham. Pour enough chicken broth to cover. Cook on Low for 8 hours, then stir in the pearl onions, cooking until the onions are tender, about 30 more minutes.
