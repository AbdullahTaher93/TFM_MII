Season the salmon with the salt and black pepper. Spray the grill with the cooking spray and heat the grill to medium-high. Grill the salmon for 6 minutes or until it flakes easily when tested with a fork, turning the salmon over once halfway through the grilling time. Remove the salmon from the grill, cover and keep warm. Heat the oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the fennel and cook for 5 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and cook and stir for 30 seconds. Stir in the soup, water and beans. Increase the heat to medium-high and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 5 minutes. Arrange the spinach on a platter. Spoon the bean mixture over the spinach. Top with the salmon.
