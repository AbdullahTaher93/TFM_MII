Melt 1 tablespoon coconut oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add carrots and onion; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until onion is translucent and carrots begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir peas, garlic, curry powder, garlic powder, turmeric, paprika, oregano, and cumin into the pot; cook until combined, about 2 minutes. Add extra coconut oil as needed. Stir in ground beef; cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Add tomato paste and stir until fully incorporated, about 2 minutes. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and pat dry with paper towels. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine drained cauliflower, butter, and cream cheese in a large bowl. Mash with an immersion blender until smooth. Spread beef mixture evenly in a large casserole dish. Cover with mashed cauliflower. Brush beaten egg lightly on top. Bake in the preheated oven until hot, about 10 minutes. Turn on oven broiler; cook until top is browned in places, about 5 minutes.
