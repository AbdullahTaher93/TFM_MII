Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Blend olive oil, cilantro and garlic in a bowl. Add prawns; toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Spread Diamond Crystal(R) Kosher Salt in even layer on a rimmed baking sheet to at least 1/2 inch thick, large enough to place prawns in a single layer. Bake salt 30 minutes to prepare it for roasting prawns. Remove baking sheet from oven. Place prawns in a single layer on hot salt. Bake 2 minutes. Turn prawns over; bake 2 minutes longer. Brush all salt from prawns (a pastry brush works well) and discard salt. Combine Chardonnay, saffron, remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and peppercorns in medium saucepan over medium heat. Increase heat and bring to a boil. Simmer until sauce is reduced to 2 tablespoons. Discard peppercorns. Stir in honey and remove from heat. Whisk in butter a chunk at a time until blended. Drizzle warm sauce over prawns.
