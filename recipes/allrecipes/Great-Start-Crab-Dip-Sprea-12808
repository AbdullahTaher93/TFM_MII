In a medium sized bowl mix the sour cream, cream cheese, lemon pepper, white pepper (optional), hot sauce, and two cans flaked, undrained crabmeat. Add to taste (approximately 1 cup) your choice of nonfat salad dressing (Catalina, French or Russian) to make the dip a pinkish color. Mix well. Let the dip chill for 4 to 8 hours. This dip is especially tasty the next day!
