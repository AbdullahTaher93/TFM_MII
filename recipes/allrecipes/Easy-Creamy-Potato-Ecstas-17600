Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Place the potatoes and celery in the water and boil for 10 minutes. Then add the cucumber, carrots, garlic, onion, mushrooms and bouillon. Reduce heat to medium and let simmer for 10 more minutes. Transfer mixture to a blender or food processor and puree for 40 seconds, or until smooth.
