Combine soy sauce, vinegar, ginger and 1/4 cup water in a small bowl. Place scallops in a medium bowl with half of the soy sauce mixture; let stand 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Toast sesame seeds 1 minute. Transfer to a plate. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in same skillet. Add vegetables; cook 2 minutes. Stir in remaining soy sauce mixture and cook 3 minutes, until vegetables are tender. Transfer to a plate; cover and keep warm. Wipe out skillet. Heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil over high heat. Add scallops; cook 5 minutes or until golden, turning halfway through. (Scallops should feel firm to the touch.) Divide vegetables between 4 plates; top with scallops and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
