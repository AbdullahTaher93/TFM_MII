Smoothly mix cream cheese with chili sauce to taste. Spread 1/4 of the cheese mixture evenly onto 1 side of each tortilla. Down the center of each tortilla, spoon 1/4 of the lettuce, turkey, onions, cilantro, and olives. Roll tortilla snugly to enclose filling, then cut each roll in half. If desired, stand rolls upright on flat end.
