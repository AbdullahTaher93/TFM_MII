In a bowl, combine flour, brown sugar and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Place 3 cups of mixture in a small bowl; add 1/2 cup pecans. Press gently onto the bottom of two greased 9-in. round baking pans. In a small mixing bowl, combine the egg, sour cream, baking soda, nutmeg and vanilla; mix well. Beat in the remaining flour mixture until well blended. Pour over the crust. Sprinkle with remaining pecans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 33-38 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool in pans on wire racks. Cut into wedges.
