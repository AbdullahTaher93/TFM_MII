Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place pork chops in a foil lined 9x9 inch baking dish and season with salt and pepper to taste. Arrange the sliced apples over and around the chops and brush all liberally with the ketchup. Then sprinkle with the brown sugar. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 to 45 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
