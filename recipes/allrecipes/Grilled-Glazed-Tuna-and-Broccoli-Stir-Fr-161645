Grill the tuna steaks to a temperature of your liking and baste with 1/2 cup of the stir-fry sauce during the last minute of cooking. In a large saute pan, cook the broccoli stir-fry in the oil over MEDIUM heat for 4 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and continue to cook until the vegetables are tender, about 3 minutes. Add the sir-fry sauce, scallions, and toasted sesame seeds and cook for 1 minute more. Serve vegetables over grilled tuna steaks.
