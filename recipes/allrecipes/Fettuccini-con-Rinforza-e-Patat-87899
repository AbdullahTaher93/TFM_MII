Place beef and green onion in a large skillet over medium heat. Season with garlic powder and Old Bay seasoning. Cook, stirring, until browned. Stir in cream of potato soup, milk, and butter. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly; simmer for 15 minutes. If the sauce appears too soupy, whisk in flour to thicken. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil. Add olive oil and pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain. To serve, place fettuccine on plates and ladle sauce over the top.
