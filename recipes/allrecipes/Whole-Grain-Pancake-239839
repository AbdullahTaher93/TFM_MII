Combine buttermilk, flour, oats, amaranth, egg, flax seeds, chia seeds, olive oil, brown sugar, baking powder, vanilla extract, baking soda, and salt in a food processor or blender; blend until smooth. Heat vegetable oil on a griddle or skillet over high heat. Pour batter, about 1/4 cup per pancake, onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
