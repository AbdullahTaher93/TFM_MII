Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Combine green beans, squash, peas, and carrots in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl; cook until tender, 3 to 10 minutes. Rinse vegetables with cold water and drain. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute mushrooms in hot oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Whisk mushroom soup and milk together in a large bowl; add vegetables, mushrooms, tuna, onion, and Cheddar cheese. Mix in Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper. Pour mixture into a casserole dish and top with French fried onions. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 20 minutes.
