Using a the point of a sharp paring knife, carve around the perimeter of the top of each pumpkin. Remove the top. Using a melon baller, hollow out the center of the pumpkins, removing fiber and seeds. Brush the outer rim of the top with 1 egg white. Pour 1/2 cup granulated sugar in a bowl; dip brushed pumpkins in bowl. Place on baking sheet. Into the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add egg yolks, brown sugar, and 1/2 cup granulated sugar. Beat until smooth. Add evaporated milk, and mix on low. Add the pureed pumpkin in batches, scraping down the sides of the bowl. In a small bowl, mix together cinnamon, salt, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, and allspice. Add to pumpkin mixture, and mix to combine. Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add the remaining 4 egg whites. Mix on medium speed until white and foamy. Sprinkle granulated sugar over egg whites. Increase the speed, and beat until soft peaks form, about 1 to 2 minutes. Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Pour a small amount of remaining 4 egg whites into pumpkin mixture. Mix to combine. Then, carefully fold remaining whites into pumpkin mixture. Spoon mixture into the center of hollowed Jack-Be-Littles, until it reaches the top, about 3 to 5 ounces per pumpkin. Sprinkle each with a 1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar. Place in oven for 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F, and continue to cook until the souffles are nicely puffed and golden brown, about 25 minutes. Serve immediately.
