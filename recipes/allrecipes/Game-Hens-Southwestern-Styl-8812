TO PREPARE GAME HENS: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Sprinkle lime juice on hens, then sprinkle on the chili powder, cumin, salt and ground black pepper. Splash olive oil over hens. Place in a 9x13 inch baking dish and bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes; then reduce oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until done and juices run clear, about 45 minutes more. TO MAKE SALSA: Combine the corn, red onion, garlic, red bell pepper, jalapeno pepper, lime juice, lemon juice, cilantro, cumin, salt, ground black pepper and olive oil. Mix well and let sit for at least 30 minutes. Put on a platter and top with the cooked hens. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve.
