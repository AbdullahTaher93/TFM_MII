In medium saucepan combine oil, peanut butter, lime juice, soy sauce, ginger, garlic and sugar. Over low heat stir to dissolve sugar and heat through. In large bowl toss together cucumber, onion, romaine or endive, and watercress. Line plates with radicchio, top with tossed vegetables, ham and orange sections. Drizzle with dressing. Sprinkle with roasted peanuts, if desired.
