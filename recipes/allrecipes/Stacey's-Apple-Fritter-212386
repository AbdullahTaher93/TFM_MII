Stir together the flour, baking powder, brown sugar, salt, and cinnamon in a bowl until thoroughly combined. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, butter, egg, and vanilla extract; stir in the apple. Pour the flour mixture into the apple mixture, and stir just to combine. Pour vegetable oil into a large skillet to a depth of 1/4 inch, and heat over medium heat until the oil shimmers. Drop the batter by rounded teaspoons into the hot oil, and fry on both sides until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Drain the fritters on paper towels, and serve hot with a dusting of confectioners' sugar.
