Cut ends off onions and place in a large pot of water. Bring to boil; remove from water and cool slightly. Slip skins off and return onions to water. Simmer until tender. In a saucepan, melt butter and gradually stir in flour until smooth. Cook over low heat for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. In a separate saucepan, scald half and half, gradually whisk into butter mixture. Add nutmeg, salt and pepper sauce; add onions and cook until thick and smooth.
