Melt ghee with oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute ginger and garlic in the ghee mixture until aromatic and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add onion; continue to saute until the onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes more. Mix curry powder, cumin, coriander, chili powder, garam masala, and turmeric together in a bowl; add to the skillet and stir. Stir enough water into the skillet to get the mixture to be paste-like; cook to let the flavors intensify for about 30 seconds. Stir sweet potato, chickpeas, 1 cup water, and salt into the mixture in the skillet; cook at a simmer until the sweet potato is just tender, about 10 minutes. Thin the mixture with more water if too thick. Stir tomatoes into the sweet potato mixture, bring to a boil, and cook until the liquid reduces to a thick gravy, about 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.
