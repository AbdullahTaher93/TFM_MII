Place 3 tablespoons butter in a small bowl. In another bowl, combine the sugar and cinnamon. Dip 10 frozen dough rolls in butter, then roll in cinnamon-sugar. Place in a greased 10-in. fluted tube pan. Sprinkle with half of the almonds and cherries. Repeat with remaining rolls, almonds and cherries. Combine corn syrup and remaining butter; pour over cherries. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Remove from the refrigerator. Cover and let rise until almost doubled, about 2 hours. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Immediately invert onto a serving plate. Serve warm.
