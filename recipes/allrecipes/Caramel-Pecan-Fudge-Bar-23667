Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine sugar, flour, cocoa and salt in medium bowl. Stir in butter, eggs and vanilla; mix well. Spread batter into greased 13x9-inch baking pan. Arrange pecan halves evenly on batter (6 rows crosswise and 6 rows down). Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Place caramel topping in small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on HIGH until hot and bubbly (1 to 2 minutes). Stir chopped pecans into caramel topping. Spread evenly over hot bars. Place fudge topping in another small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on HIGH until heated through (about 1 minute). Drizzle fudge topping over caramel-pecan mixture. Cool completely. Cut into bars.
