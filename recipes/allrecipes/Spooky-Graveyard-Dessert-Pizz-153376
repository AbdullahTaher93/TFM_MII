Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Press cookie dough onto bottom of greased 12-inch pizza pan. Bake 20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool completely in pan on wire rack. Beat cream cheese and sugar in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Gently stir in 1 cup of the whipped topping. Spread over cooled crust. Decorate with remaining ingredients and remaining whipped topping to resemble a graveyard.
