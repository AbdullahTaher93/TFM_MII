In a skillet, cook beef, mushrooms and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink. Add the soup, horseradish, salt and pepper; mix well. Remove from the heat; set aside. In a bowl, combine the flour, poppy seeds, baking powder and salt. Cut in shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add water, tossing with a fork until a ball forms. Divide dough in half. Roll out one portion into a 15-in. x 10-in. rectangle; transfer to an ungreased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Spoon meat mixture over dough. Roll out the remaining dough into 15-in. x 10-in rectangle; place over filling. Bake at 425&deg: for 25 minutes or until golden brown. Cut into small squares.
