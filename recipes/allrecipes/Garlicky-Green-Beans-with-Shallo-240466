Melt butter with olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook shallot and garlic in the hot butter mixture, stirring frequently, until soft and slightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir green beans with shallot mixture; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir green beans until tender, about 12 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the green beans.
