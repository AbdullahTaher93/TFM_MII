Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Spread about half of the margarine over the whole trout and inside the cavity. Combine the flour, salt and pepper; coat the inside and outside of the trout with the mixture. Melt remaining margarine in a large skillet over medium heat. Lightly saute the fiddleheads until just tender. Season with salt, pepper and tarragon. Add the lemon juice and white wine, and cook for one minute. Transfer the contents of the fiddlehead pan to a bowl, and mix with egg and bread crumbs. Stuff the mixture into the cavity of the trout, and place it on the greased baking sheet. Bake uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the fish flakes easily with a fork. Serve immediately.
