Preheat grill pan or panini machine to medium heat. Spread center of each roll with 1 tablespoon mayonnaise. Assemble sandwiches with remaining ingredients, except butter. Season with salt and pepper. Spread small amount of butter on top and bottom of each roll; place sandwich either in pan on onto panini machine and grill. Cook 5 to 7 minutes. (If using a pan, press sandwich down with a pan lid. Cook sandwiches about 3 to 4 minutes on each side or until bread is toasted.) For mayonnaise: whisk all ingredients together in small bowl. Refrigerate until ready to use.
