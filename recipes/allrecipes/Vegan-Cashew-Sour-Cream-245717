Place cashews in a bowl and cover with water. Soak until soft, at least 4 hours but preferably overnight. Drain and rinse cashews; place in the bowl of a food processor. Add apple cider vinegar, salt, garlic powder, and onion powder. Blend until smooth and creamy, occasionally scraping down bowl sides with a spatula, 3 to 5 minutes.
