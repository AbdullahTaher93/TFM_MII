In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the lemon juice, vanilla and lemon peel. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture. Fold in pecans and raisins. Pour into a greased 10-in. fluted tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar if desired.
