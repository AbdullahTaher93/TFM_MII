Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a mini muffin tin with cooking spray. Combine cake mix, pumpkin pie mix, and cinnamon chips in a large bowl; mix well with a wooden spoon. Scoop mixture into muffin tin, filling each cup 3/4 of the way full. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 17 to 20 minutes.
