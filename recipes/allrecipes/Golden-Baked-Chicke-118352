In a bowl, combine the potato flakes, Parmesan cheese, parsley, paprika, garlic salt, onion powder and pepper. Dip chicken into butter, then into potato flake mixture. Place on two greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pans. Bake at 375 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until chicken juices run clear.
