Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9-inch springform pan with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside. Combine graham cracker crumbs, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and melted butter in a small bowl. Press on bottom and up sides of prepared pan. Bake 10 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack. Beat regular and fat free cream cheese together at high speed with a mixer until creamy; gradually add SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, mixing well. Add eggs, one at a time, beating just until each one is incorporated. Add lime juice and a pinch of salt, beat until smooth. Pour into prepared crust. Bake 50 to 60 minutes or until mixture is almost set, and slightly firm to the touch. Run a knife around edge of pan to release sides, and help prevent cracking. Cool to room temperature on a wire rack; cover and chill at least 8 hours.
