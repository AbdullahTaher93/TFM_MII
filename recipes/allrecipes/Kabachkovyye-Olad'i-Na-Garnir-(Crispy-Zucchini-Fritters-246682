Combine zucchini, spring onions, and dill in a large bowl. Stir in salt. Add egg; stir until well-combined. Stir in flour and garlic until batter comes together. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drop tablespoonfuls of batter into hot oil. Fry until browned and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.
