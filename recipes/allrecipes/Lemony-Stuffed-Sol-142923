Season both sides of fish with salt and pepper. Place 1 fillet on flat surface and spread 2 tablespoons of the squash evenly over top, leaving a 1/2 inch margin on both ends. Starting with one end, roll fillet into a cylinder and secure with wooden pick. Repeat with remaining sole and squash. Heat oil in 12 inch nonstick skillet over medium heat and add sole, seam side up. Cook 2 minutes and add wine. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook 5 minutes longer, until fish is opaque. Transfer sole to a plate and tent loosely with foil. Add butter, lemon juice, and lemon zest to skillet. Remove from heat, swirl until butter melts, and spoon over sole. Sprinkle with parsley. Remove pick before serving.
