Mix the ground pork, apple, onion, bell pepper, teriyaki sauce, apple cider, ground ginger, bread crumbs, black pepper, and soy sauce together in a mixing bowl until evenly combined; shape into 8 patties. Chill the patties in the freezer for 30 minutes so they are not soft when placed on the grill. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Cook the burgers on the preheated grill until firm, hot, and no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
