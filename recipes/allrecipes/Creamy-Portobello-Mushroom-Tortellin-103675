Bring 2 quarts of water and 1 tablespoon of salt to boil in a large soup kettle. Add tortellini, and using package times as a guide, boil, stirring frequently, until just tender. Reserving 1/2 cup of pasta cooking water, drain tortellini and return to kettle. Meanwhile, heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms: saute until tender and golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Add garlic; continue to saute until fragrant, about 1 minute longer. Add white wine; simmer until almost evaporated. Stir in parsley and Alfredo sauce; simmer to heat through. Add to tortellini; toss to coat, adding a little pasta water if sauce needs thinning. Spoon a portion onto each pasta plate, sprinkling with Parmesan cheese.
