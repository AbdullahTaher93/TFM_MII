Mix flour, 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons butter, and nutmeg together in a large bowl until well incorporated. Stir in 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk until dough comes together. Roll dough 1/4-inch thick on a floured work surface and cut into small pieces. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry dough pieces in batches until they turn golden brown and float to the surface, 3 to 5 minutes.
