Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a mini Bundt(R) cake pan with cooking spray. Combine flour, brown sugar, cereal, ground flax seeds, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl. Add apple chunks, egg whites, milk, carrot, raisins, cranberries, walnuts, pecans, orange zest, and orange extract; beat with an electric mixer until batter is blended. Scoop heaping spoonfuls of batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 12 to 15 minutes.
