Heat oil in a large frying pan set over medium-high heat. Saute onions and green pepper for 5 minutes. Add beef to the pan. Cook, stirring until browned, about 5 to 10 minutes. Drain off fat. Stir in ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, salt and pepper. Simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or until slightly thickened. Serve on sandwich buns.
