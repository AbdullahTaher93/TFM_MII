Mix together 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, ginger, garlic, paprika, cinnamon, orange zest, cloves, and cardamom in a bowl to form a paste and rub the pork chops with the spice paste. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large deep skillet and pan-fry the chops over high heat until browned and no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes per side. Pour in 1/4 cup soy sauce and coat the chops with soy sauce. Pour in honey, remaining 1/4 cup soy sauce, and water; mix thoroughly. Reduce heat to medium. Stir in zucchinis, carrots, onion, green bell pepper, and celery; cook and stir vegetables until cooked through but still slightly firm, about 10 more minutes.
