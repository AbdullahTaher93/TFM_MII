Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Toast the pine nuts in the oven until they are golden brown, about 8 minutes. In a large frying pan, cook the pancetta with the oil over moderate heat until beginning to crisp. Add the garlic and red-pepper flakes and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the broccoli rabe until almost done, about 3 minutes. Drain. Add the broccoli rabe to the frying pan along with the salt and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the linguine until just done, about 12 minutes. Drain and toss with the broccoli rabe and pine nuts.
