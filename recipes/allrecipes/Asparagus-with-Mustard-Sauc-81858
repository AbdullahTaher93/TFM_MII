Cut the asparagus in halves or thirds. Mix together the mustard, oil and salt and pepper. In a covered pot, add the asparagus and the water, cover and place on medium-high heat to bring to a boil. Boil for 3 minutes or until tender and the majority of the water has evaporated. Remove from heat, drain off excess liquid (if any) and place asparagus on serving platter. Drizzle the mustard sauce over the asparagus and serve.
