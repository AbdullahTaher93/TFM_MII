Heat oven to 400 degrees F. In a medium bowl, combine rice, olives, pine nuts, cranberries, celery and cheese; mix well. Rinse hens in cold water; pat dry with paper towels. Fill cavities with rice mixture; close and secure with wooden picks. Place hens in a shallow roasting pan or large casserole dish. Brush butter over hens; top with garlic powder and thyme. Season with salt and pepper, if desired. Drizzle orange juice evenly over hens. Bake until hens are golden brown and juices run clear, about 1 hour and 10 minutes.
