Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Lightly beat the eggs in a bowl. Place the bread crumbs on a dish. Insert a cube of feta cheese into each zucchini blossom. Dip the blossoms in the eggs, then dredge in the bread crumbs to lightly coat. Fry zucchini blossoms in the skillet until golden brown.
