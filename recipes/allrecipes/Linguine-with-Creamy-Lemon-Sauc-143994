Cook linguine in boiling salted water until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, warm half-and-half, vodka, lemon zest and nutmeg in a large skillet over very low heat. Season with salt and pepper. Reserve 2 tablespoons pasta-cooking water. Drain linguine and add to sauce. Add lemon juice and reserved pasta-cooking water. Toss over high heat until hot. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Divide between 2 warmed plates and sprinkle with Parmesan and parsley. Serve immediately.
