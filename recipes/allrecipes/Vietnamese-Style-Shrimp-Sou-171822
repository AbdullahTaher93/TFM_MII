Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and ginger; cook and stir 1 minute. Add the spinach and season with salt and pepper. Cover, and cook until the spinach is hot, about 3 minutes. Pour in the chicken stock, shrimp stock, hot pepper sauce, and hoisin sauce. Recover, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Once the soup reaches a simmer, stir in the shrimp and noodles. Cover, and cook 4 minutes, then stir in the green onions, and cook 5 minutes more. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.
