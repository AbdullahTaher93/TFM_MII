Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Unroll dough and separate into 4 rectangles; firmly press perforations to seal. Cut each into 6 squares. Gently press squares into 24 ungreased miniature muffin cups (dough will not completely cover inside of cup; do not press too much). Spoon about 1 teaspoon bean dip into each cup. Top each with 1/2 teaspoon chiles, 1/2 teaspoon bell pepper and about 1 teaspoon cheese. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until edges are deep golden brown. Cool in pan on wire rack 5 minutes; remove from muffin cups. Garnish each with guacamole and olives.
