Sandwich bay leaves, parsley, and thyme between stalks of celery. Tie with cotton string at the two ends and in the middle. Heat oil in a 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat. When oil is hot, add ribs in batches and turn often until well browned, 4 to 5 minutes. As ribs are browned, transfer to a large bowl. When all meat is browned and removed to bowl, pour off all but 1 tablespoon of fat from pan. Add carrots, onion, and garlic and stir often over medium-high heat until vegetables are lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer ribs and any juices back to pan along with bouquet garni, wine, broth, and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat. Then, reduce heat, cover tightly, and simmer until meat is very tender when pierced, 2 to 2 1/4 hours. Remove and discard bouquet garni. With a slotted spoon, place ribs on a platter and sprinkle with about 1/4 cup of vegetables and juices; keep warm. Skim fat from pan juices. Measure pan juices; if more than 1 1/2 cups, boil over high heat until reduced to that amount. Smoothly puree pan juices in a blender or food processor; pour this sauce into a small pitcher. Sprinkle ribs with parsley and offer sauce to add to taste.
