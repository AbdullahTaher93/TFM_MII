Light the grill. In a medium bowl, toss the squid with 1/4 cup of the oil and 3/4 teaspoon of the salt. In a large glass or stainless-steel bowl, combine the lemon juice, vinegar, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and the pepper. Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup oil with a fork. Stir in the basil. Grill the squid quickly over high heat, turning once, until just done, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove. When cool enough to handle, cut the bodies into 1/2-inch rings and cut the tentacles in half. Add the squid, lettuce, pimientos, olives, and scallions to the dressing and toss.
