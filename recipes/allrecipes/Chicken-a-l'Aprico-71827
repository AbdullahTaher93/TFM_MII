Combine the apricot preserves, lime rind, lime juice, and the fresh ginger in a small bowl. Bring grill up to medium heat. Place the chicken on the grill and brush with half the marmalade mixture. Close the lid on the grill and cook for 6 minutes. Flip chicken and apply remaining marmalade, recover, and cook for an additional 6 minutes, or until done.
