Grease a 9x13-inch pan. Spread half the crushed wafers in the prepared pan. Beat confectioners' sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy; add eggs and whipped topping. Beat until fully incorporated. Fold pineapple and pecans into mixture. Pour pineapple mixture over crushed wafers; top with remaining crushed wafers. Refrigerate until set, about 24 hours.
