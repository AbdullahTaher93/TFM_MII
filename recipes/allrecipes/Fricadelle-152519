Heat 2 tablespoons butter in skillet over medium heat. Add chopped onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove onions from skillet with slotted spoon and set aside; cool to room temperature. Reserve butter in the skillet. Mix together chopped meat, bread crumbs, cooled onion, egg, parsley, nutmeg, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Divide mixture into 4 portions, and form into elongated, slightly flattened meatballs. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in skillet over medium heat until butter has melted and begins to bubble. Place fricadelles in skillet and cook until golden brown. Turn and brown other side, about 3 to 5 minutes per side.
