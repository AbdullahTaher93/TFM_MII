Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat, and sprinkle on half the package of taco seasoning. Cook and stir the beef until browned and crumbly, about 8 minutes; discard excess grease. Spread the pizza dough out onto a 12-inch round pan, forming a rim of slightly thickened dough around the edge. Mix together the refried beans with salsa in a bowl; spread evenly over the crust. Mix tomato paste, water, chili powder, cayenne pepper, and the remaining half of the taco seasoning mix together in a bowl, and spread the sauce over the refried beans mixture. Top with the cooked beef, sprinkle the onions over the pizza, and evenly spread the cheese on top. Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is cooked through and the cheese is bubbling and beginning to brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
