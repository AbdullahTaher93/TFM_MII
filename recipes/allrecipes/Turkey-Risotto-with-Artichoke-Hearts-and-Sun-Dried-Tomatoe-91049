Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir 5 minutes, or until tender. Stir in rice; cook and stir 3 minutes, or until rice is golden. Stir in 1/2 cup of the broth. Cook and stir constantly 2 minutes, or until broth has been absorbed. Continue to cook and stir constantly, adding another 3-1/2 cups of the broth, 1/2 cup at a time, until completely absorbed. Stir in turkey, artichokes and tomatoes. Continue adding enough broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring until absorbed and rice is tender, but slightly firm in the center. Stir in 1/2 cup of the cheese, salt and pepper. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese and parsley, if desired.
