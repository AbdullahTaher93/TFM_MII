Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and return pasta to pot. Stir butter and milk into macaroni until sauce is smooth. Mix croutons and mozzarella cheese into macaroni and cheese until cheese is melted.
