Place rhubarb and orange in a blender; blend until pureed and transfer to a saucepan. Add sugar and orange zest. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until marmalade is thickened, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes. Allow marmalade to cool; ladle into jars. Cover jars with lids and refrigerate until ready to use. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange chicken breast halves in a baking dish. Mix 1 cup marmalade, water, curry powder, and salt in a bowl; spoon mixture over chicken breasts. Bake in preheated oven until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, basting occasionally, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve rhubarb sauce over chicken breasts.
