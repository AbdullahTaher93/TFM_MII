Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat; stir cumin and paprika into hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add broth, hominy, chicken, diced tomatoes and juice, water, green onions, lime juice, and hot sauce to seasoned oil; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors have blended, about 15 minutes. Garnish soup with cilantro just before serving.
