Pour about 3 quarts water into a 5- to 6-quart pan, cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Meanwhile, remove ends and any strings from green and yellow beans. Add beans to boiling water. Meanwhile, fill a bowl with ice and water. Cook beans, uncovered, until beans are tender-crisp when pierced, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain, then immerse in ice water until cool, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain again. In a wide salad bowl, stir together vinegar, olive oil, mustard, and chopped chives. Add beans and mix with dressing. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Garnish with whole chives.
