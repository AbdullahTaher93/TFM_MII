Spread 1 side of each bread slice with butter. Place 4 bread slices, butter sides down, in 12-inch skillet or on grill pan. Top with beef, pesto and cheese. Top with remaining bread slices, butter sides up. Cook over medium heat 4 to 5 minutes, turning once, until bread is crisp and cheese is melted. Serve with pasta sauce.
