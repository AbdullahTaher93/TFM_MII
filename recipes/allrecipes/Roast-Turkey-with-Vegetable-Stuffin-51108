Heat oven to 325 degrees F. Melt butter in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook celery and onion in butter, stirring frequently, until onion is tender. Stir in parsley, sage, marjoram, tarragon and salt. Mix bread cubes, carrots, zucchini and mushrooms in large bowl. Add celery mixture; toss. Fill wishbone area of turkey with stuffing first. Fasten neck skin to back with skewer. Fold wings across back with tips touching. Fill body cavity lightly with stuffing. (Place any remaining stuffing in small ungreased baking dish; cover and refrigerate. Place in oven with turkey the last 30 minutes of roasting.) Tuck drumsticks under band of skin at tail, or tie together with heavy string, then tie to tail. Place turkey, breast side up, on rack in shallow roasting pan. Insert meat thermometer so tip is in thickest part of inside thigh muscle or thickest part of breast meat and does not touch bone. Roast uncovered 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours or until thermometer reads 180 degrees F and juice of turkey is no longer pink when center of thigh is cut. When two-thirds done, cut band of skin or string holding legs. Place a tent of aluminum foil loosely over turkey when it begins to turn golden brown. Let turkey stand 20 minutes before carving. Cover and refrigerate any remaining turkey and stuffing separately.
