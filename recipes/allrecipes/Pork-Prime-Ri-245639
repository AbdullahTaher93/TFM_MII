Combine seasoned salt and black pepper in a bowl; rub over entire prime rib. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place prime rib in hot oil and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Spread 1/2 of the sauerkraut into the bottom of a slow cooker; top with potatoes, carrots, apples. Add pork and top with remaining sauerkraut, brown sugar, and caraway seeds. Cook on Low for 8 to 9 hours.
