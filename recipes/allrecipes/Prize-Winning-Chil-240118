Heat olive oil in a large stockpot over medium heat; cook and stir onion and green bell pepper in hot oil until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Add sausage and ground beef to onion mixture; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Mix pinto beans, diced tomatoes, water, chili powder, jalapeno pepper, cayenne pepper, and salt into sausage-beef mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until flavors have blended, about 1 hour.
