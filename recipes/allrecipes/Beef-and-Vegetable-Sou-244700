Season the beef as desired. Heat the oil in a 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook until browned, stirring often. Add the potatoes and carrots to the saucepan and cook for 5 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Add the flour and cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in the broth, tomato paste and thyme and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and cook for 40 minutes or until the beef is tender, adding the green beans and peas for the last 20 minutes of the cooking time. Season as desired.
