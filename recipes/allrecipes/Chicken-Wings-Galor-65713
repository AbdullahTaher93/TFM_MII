Disjoint chicken wings; discard tips. Combine soy sauce, vinegar, garlic powder, basil and olive oil in large bowl. Add chicken; stir to coat all pieces well. Arrange pieces, side by side, on large rack on foil-lined baking sheet. Bake in 400 degrees F oven 25 minutes. Turn pieces over; bake 25 minutes longer, or until chicken is no longer pink near bone.
