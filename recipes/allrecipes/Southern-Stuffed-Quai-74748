Preheat the oven broiler. In a bowl, mix the pork, parsley, carrots, celery, garlic, bread crumbs, and pepper. Arrange the quail in a baking dish. Separate the skin from the breast of each quail, and stuff with equal amounts of the stuffing mixture. Brush with bacon drippings. Broil the quail 7 minutes on each side in the preheated oven, or to a minimum internal temperature of 180 degrees F (85 degrees C).
