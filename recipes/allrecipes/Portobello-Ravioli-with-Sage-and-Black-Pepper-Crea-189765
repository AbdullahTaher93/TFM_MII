In a 5- to 6-quart pan, bring 3 quarts of hot water to a boil over high heat. Add ravioli; cook until pasta is tender to bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and keep warm. While water heats and ravioli cooks, melt butter in a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat. Add sage and stir until bright green, 1 to 2 minutes. With a slotted spoon, quickly transfer sage to a paper towel-lined plate. Reserve 4 large fried sage leaves for garnish. Chop remaining sage and set aside. Whisk flour into remaining butter in pan. Remove pan from heat and whisk in broth and half-and-half until smooth. Stir sauce over high heat until boiling. Stir chopped sage into cream sauce and add pepper to taste. Divide drained ravioli between 4 dinner plates. Spoon sauce equally over each portion and garnish each with a reserved sage leaf.
