Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the inside of a 9x13-inch baking dish with butter. Place halibut in the prepared baking dish. Mix sour cream, green onions, butter, salt, white pepper, and dill in a bowl. Spread sour cream mixture over halibut. Bake halibut in preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove halibut from the oven and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Place oven rack about 6 inches from broiler heat source and turn on oven's broiler. Place under preheated broiler and broil until cheese is lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.
