Layer the potatoes, onion, cheese, salt and pepper into a microwave safe casserole dish. Once finished layering, place 1 teaspoon of margarine on the top of the uppermost layer. Cover and cook in the microwave oven on HIGH for 10 minutes. Remove the dish from the microwave and stir before cooking for another 10 minutes or until done. Stir well and serve.
