Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add kale to the skillet; season with garlic powder, garlic salt, and chipotle pepper powder. Cook and stir kale until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour vegetable broth over kale; add cannellini beans and stir. Cook mixture, stirring often, until beans are softened, 7 to 8 minutes. Stir cooked rotini with kale and beans mixture; cook and stir until pasta is reheated, 1 to 2 minutes. Top with shredded Mexican cheese.
