Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and oil a 9 x 5 x 3-inch loaf pan. Combine flour, salt, and baking powder. Place olive oil in a large mixing bowl. With an electric mixer, slowly mix in sugar, orange juice, and vanilla extract. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, add milk and mix for 2 minutes. Gradually mix in dry ingredients. Pour batter into loaf pan. Bake for 60-75 minutes, or until cake tester comes out clean and cake is golden on top. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then remove from pan and cool completely on a cooling rack.
