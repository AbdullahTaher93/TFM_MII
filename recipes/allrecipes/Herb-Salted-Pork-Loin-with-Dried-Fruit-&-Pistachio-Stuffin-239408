Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place Diamond Crystal(R) Kosher Salt, parsley, thyme, rosemary and garlic in a food processor. Pulse several times until well blended. Mix pistachios, dried cranberries, raisins, garlic, and 1 teaspoon of the herb salt mixture together in a bowl. Unroll the pork roast onto a roasting pan or baking dish. Spread the dried fruit mixture evenly over the roast, leaving a 1-inch margin around the edges. Roll up the roast and tie with kitchen twine at two-inch intervals to hold stuffing in place. Drizzle roast with olive oil; and sprinkle with herb salt and pepper to taste. Save any remaining herb salt for another use.* Roast for 1 hour. Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and roast until golden brown, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Allow roast to sit for 10 minutes prior to serving.
