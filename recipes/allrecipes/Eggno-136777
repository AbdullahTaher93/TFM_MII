Bring milk and nutmeg to a simmer in a heavy medium saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally. Whisk eggs, sugar, flour and salt in a large bowl until smooth. Whisking constantly, gradually add hot milk; return mixture to saucepan. Cook the eggnog over very low heat, stirring constantly, until thick enough to coat the back of the spoon, 10 to 15 minutes. (Temperature must reach 160 degrees F; do not let eggnog come to a simmer.) Remove from the heat and pour through a fine-meshed sieve into a bowl. Whisk in brandy (or bourbon or rum) and vanilla. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the eggnog and refrigerate until chilled, for at least 8 hours or overnight. Just before serving, add cream to eggnog. Ladle into cups and serve garnished with more grated nutmeg.
