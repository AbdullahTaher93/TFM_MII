Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange ribs in a shallow roasting pan; season with salt and black pepper. Bake ribs in preheated oven for 1 hour. Mix molasses, vinegar, mustard, water, Worcestershire sauce, instant coffee granules, and hot pepper sauce together in a bowl. Brush generously over the ribs. Continue baking ribs, basting with sauce every 15 minutes, until the meat pulls away easily from the bone, about 1 additional hour.
