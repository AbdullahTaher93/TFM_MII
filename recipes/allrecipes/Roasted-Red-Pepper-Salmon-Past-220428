Preheat outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Puree roasted red peppers in a food processor; transfer to a cold large skillet. Stir chicken broth, Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup cilantro, cornstarch, jalapeno pepper, and garlic into red pepper puree. Bring red pepper mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Keep warm. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir angel hair and olive oil into the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain. Cook salmon, skin side up, until skin begins to loosen, about 5 minutes. Remove from grill and peel skin. Continue cooking on other side until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes. Divide angel hair pasta among 5 warm plates. Nestle a salmon fillet into each pasta portion. Drizzle red pepper sauce around salmon onto pasta. Garnish with 1 tablespoon cilantro and chives.
