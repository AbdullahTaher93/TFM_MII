Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. In a bowl, mix the sour cream and curry paste. Spread the bottom of each salmon fillet with 1 tablespoon sour cream mixture, and arrange the fillets on the prepared baking sheet. Top fillets with remaining sour cream mixture. Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the salmon flakes easily with a fork.
