Combine milk, sugar, egg yolks, butter and vanilla in a saucepan. Cook on medium heat until thick, approximately 12 minutes. Stir constantly. Remove from heat, and add coconut and macadamia nuts. Continue to stir until cool and thick enough to spread on your cake. Frost. This will cover a 9x13 inch rectangular cake or a two 8 inch layer round cake.
