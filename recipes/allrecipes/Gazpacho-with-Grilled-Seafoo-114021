In a medium saucepan, cook the cranberry beans in boiling water until tender, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a plate. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. In a large bowl, combine the tomato juice with the cucumber, yellow pepper, onion, fennel, jalapeno, scallion and 2 tablespoons of the cilantro. Add the beans, cover and refrigerate overnight. Stir the lime and lemon zest and juice into the soup. Season with salt and pepper and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. Light a grill. Thread the scallops and shrimp on skewers, brush with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill over a medium-hot fire until lightly charred, about 2 minutes per side. Generously brush the bread with olive oil and grill over a medium-hot fire until lightly charred, about 1 minute per side. Rub the bread with the garlic clove. Stir the remaining 2 tablespoons of cilantro into the soup. Serve the gazpacho with the seafood and bread.
