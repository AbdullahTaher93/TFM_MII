Soak raisins in 1 cup warm water in a bowl while you complete remaining steps. Heat olive oil in large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in curry powder, cumin, cilantro, and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in vegetable broth, garbanzo beans, and quinoa. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low heat, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, about 20 minutes. Drain raisins. Lightly toss quinoa mixture with raisins, roasted red peppers, and toasted almonds. Season with salt.
