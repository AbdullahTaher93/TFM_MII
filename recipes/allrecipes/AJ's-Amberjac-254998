Mix bread crumbs, Creole seasoning, and Parmesan cheese together in a shallow bowl. Brush amberjack fillets with butter; dip into the bread crumb mixture to coat. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add coated amberjack; cook until topping is browned and flesh flake easily with a fork, about 5 minutes per side.
