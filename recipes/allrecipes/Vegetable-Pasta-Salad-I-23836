Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine zucchini, eggplant, onion, bell pepper and garlic in a baking dish. Toss with olive oil. Bake for about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and cool. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add rotini pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and rinse with cold water. In a bowl combine vegetable mixture, cooled pasta, tomatoes, Feta cubes, and salad dressing; toss until well mixed.
