Lightly pound the lemongrass stalk with a kitchen mallet. Combine the lemongrass, rice, coconut milk, bay leaves, turmeric, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring occasionally; reduce heat to low and simmer until all liquid is absorbed, about 25 minutes. Remove bay leaves and lemongrass before serving.
