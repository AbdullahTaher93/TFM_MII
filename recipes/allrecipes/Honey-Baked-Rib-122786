Combine the first five ingredients in a bowl. Pour half into a large resealable plastic bag or shallow glass container; add ribs. Cover and refrigerate overnight, turning once. Refrigerate remaining marinade. Remove ribs to a greased roasting pan; discard marinade. Cover and bake at 425 degrees F for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F. Cover and bake 30 minutes longer; drain. Pour reserved marinade over ribs. Bake, uncovered, for 45 minutes or until meat is tender, basting frequently.
