First prepare the salad. Put the lettuce and watercress in a large wide salad bowl. Peel and thickly slice the avocados and toss with the lemon juice to prevent discoloration. Sprinkle the avocados, tomatoes, and red onion on top of the lettuce and watercress; set aside the salad. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and stir around the pan just until soft, about 30 seconds. Toss in the strips of chicken and stir-fry until they change color, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the honey, vinegar, and mustard, and stir to mix well. Add the turkey bacon and stir-fry until they are cooked, but still tender and moist (take care not to overcook or they will be dry), about 1 minute longer. Season to taste. Spoon the chicken mixture over the salad. Toss together, then serve with crusty bread.
