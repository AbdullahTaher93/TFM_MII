Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x10-inch casserole dish. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large pot over medium heat; stir in flour until smooth and let the paste simmer for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Gradually whisk in milk, about 1/2 cup at a time, and bring to a simmer. Whisk constantly until sauce is smooth and thickened, about 5 minutes. Whisk in cream cheese and Swiss cheese until melted; stir in salt and nutmeg. Mix hash brown potatoes and zucchini into the cheese mixture until thoroughly combined. Transfer potato mixture to the prepared casserole dish. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 35 minutes. Mix 1 tablespoon melted butter and bread crumbs together in a bowl. Sprinkle topping over the casserole and return to oven; bake until topping is lightly golden brown, 10 to 15 more minutes.
