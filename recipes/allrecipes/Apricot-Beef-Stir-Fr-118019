Drain apricots, reserving 1/4 cup juice. Cut apricots in quarters and set aside. In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch, broth, soy sauce and reserved apricot juice until smooth; set aside. In a large skillet or wok, stir-fry beef in oil for 3 minutes. Add broccoli and onion; stir-fry 2-3 minutes longer or until vegetables are crisp-tender. Stir sauce and add to the pan. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Add tomatoes and reserved apricots; heat through. Serve over rice.
