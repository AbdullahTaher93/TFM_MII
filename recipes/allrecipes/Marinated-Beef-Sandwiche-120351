In a gallon-size resealable plastic bag, combine the first seven ingredients; add roast. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate overnight, turning occasionally. Transfer roast and marinade to a Dutch oven. Cover and bake at 325 degrees F for 2-1/2 to 3 hours or until meat is tender. Thinly slice; serve beef and juice on rolls.
