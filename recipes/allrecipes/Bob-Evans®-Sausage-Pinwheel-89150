Remove the crescent roll dough from the can. Do not separate rolls. On top of a piece of plastic wrap or aluminum foil, pinch the triangles together and then pinch the rectangles together to form a long rectangle that is about 18 x 4 inches, gently pulling dough as needed. Carefully spread the sausage in an even layer over the dough. Roll the dough lengthwise to form a long roll. Wrap in the plastic wrap or foil. Freeze for 15 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Using a serrated knife, cut dough into 1/2 inch thick slices. Place on ungreased baking sheet. Bake 15-20 minutes, or until the sausage is cooked through. Drain off any juices. Serve hot. Refrigerate leftovers.
