Season chicken with salt and pepper. Grill (or broil) to your liking. In a microwave safe bowl, add the chopped frozen spinach and zap it until it is completely thawed and thoroughly heated. This usually requires it to be stirred one or two times before completely heated through. Drain and squeezed out excess liquid. (See note.) Add to the spinach the parsley, thyme, mustard and mayonnaise. Mix well. Spoon the sauce over the cooked chicken and serve immediately.
