Bring a lightly salted pot of water to a boil. Add soba noodles; cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain. Rinse with cold water to speed up cooling process. Combine dashi, soy sauce, mirin, and white sugar in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature, about 25 minutes. Toss noodles with sesame seeds and divide among 4 serving bowls. Spoon dashi sauce over noodles. Top with green onions and nori.
