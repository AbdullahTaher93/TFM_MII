Cook the macaroni in a large pot of lightly salted boiling water until tender, 6-8 minutes depending on size. Drain, and set aside. Stir the vinegar and mayonnaise together in a bowl until thoroughly blended. Combine the cooked noodles, onions, pimentos, pickles, bell peppers, cheese, olives, and eggs in a large bowl. Add the mayonnaise mixture, and toss gently to coat ingredients. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
