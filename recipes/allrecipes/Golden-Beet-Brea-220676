Stand beets upright in a saucepan. Fill saucepan with about 1-inch of water and bring to a boil. Lower heat to a simmer, cover, and steam beets until tender, about 40 minutes. Carefully remove beets from saucepan, peel, and coarsely chop into chunks. Place beets in a blender and puree until smooth. Measure out 1 cup. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 1 large loaf pan with cooking spray. Mix whole wheat flour, unbleached flour, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl. Stir 1 cup beet puree with 1/2 cup water together in a bowl. Beat sugar and margarine together in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer on low speed until blended. Beat eggs and beet mixture into sugar mixture until combined. Gradually stir flour mixture into wet ingredients, mixing after each small addition, until just combined. Fold walnuts into batter until evenly incorporated. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes.
