Heat 2 1/2 cups broth in a 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat to a boil. Stir in the rice. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 45 minutes or until the rice is tender. Spray a 12-inch skillet with the cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Add the chicken and cook for 15 minutes or until well browned on both sides and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet, cover and keep warm. Add the mango, red pepper, chutney and remaining broth to the skillet. Cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the green onions. Serve the chicken and mango mixture with the rice.
