Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Using sharp knife, score top of ham in a diamond pattern, then stud with cloves. Place ham on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake 40 minutes. Meanwhile, combine mustard, SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend, orange juice, rosemary, cinnamon, allspice, black pepper, and salt. Remove ham from oven and brush a thick layer of glaze all over ham. Return to oven and bake 30 to 45 minutes more, or until an instant-read thermometer registers 135 degrees F, brushing two more times during baking with remaining glaze. Cover ham with foil and let stand 15 minutes before carving.
