Mix sour cream and onion soup mix together in a small bowl; spread over the bean mixture. Top the sour cream layer with salsa. Refrigerate dish until the bean layer firms, about 30 minutes. Layer lettuce atop the salsa. Sprinkle tortilla chips in a layer over the lettuce. Finish with a layer of Cheddar cheese.
