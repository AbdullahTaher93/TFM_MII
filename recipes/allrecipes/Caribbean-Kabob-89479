Cut the bell pepper into 12, 1-inch squares. Cut scallops into 1/2-inch thick pieces. Thread all prawns, scallops, onions and green peppers onto four metal skewers, alternating ingredients. Marinate kabobs in mango curry sauce. Grill over medium heat for 5 to 6 minutes, or until scallops and shrimp are firm but still tender.
