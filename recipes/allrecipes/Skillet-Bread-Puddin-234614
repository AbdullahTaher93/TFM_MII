Heat oven to 350 degrees F (or grill). Add bread, eggs, cream, and apple butter to a large bowl. Mix well. Spray a large cast iron skillet with non-stick cooking spray. Pour in bread pudding. Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until bread pudding is set. Garnish with whipped cream or ice cream, walnuts, and caramel sauce.
