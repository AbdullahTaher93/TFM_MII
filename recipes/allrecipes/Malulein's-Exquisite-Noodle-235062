Stir orange juice, ramen noodles and flavoring from packet, grape leaves, onion, soy sauce, rum, zaatar, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, barbeque sauce, garlic cloves, and bouillon cube together in a saucepan. Pour enough water over the mixture to cover. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until the water reduces to a point where it no longer covers the ingredients, about 10 minutes.
