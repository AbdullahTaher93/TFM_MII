In a mixing bowl, cream butter, shortening and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Combine flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Stir in oats. Divide dough in half. Add melted chocolate to one portion. Roll plain dough into an 8-in. log. Roll chocolate dough between waxed paper into an 8-in. square. Place log at one end of square; roll up. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate for at least 3 hours. Cut into 1/2-in. slices. Place on ungreased baking sheets. To form ears, pinch two triangles on the top of each cookie. Bake at 350 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Immediately place two chocolate chips for eyes, a red-hot for the nose and six pieces of licorice on each for whiskers. Cool on wire racks.
