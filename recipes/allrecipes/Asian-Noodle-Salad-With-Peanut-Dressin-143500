In blender or food processor, puree dressing ingredients until smooth. If mixture is too thick, thin with additional hot water, adding 1 tablespoon at a time. In medium pot, cook noodles in boiling water until tender, about 5 minutes. About 30 seconds before removing noodles, add zucchini and carrots. Drain, rinse briefly with cold water, and drain again. Place cool, drained noodles, zucchini, and carrots in large bowl. Add pepper, snow peas, and scallions. Pour dressing over mixture and toss until well coated. Divide salad among 4 plates and garnish with sprouts and cilantro.
