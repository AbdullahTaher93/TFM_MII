Cook and stir bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on a plate lined with paper towel. Toss broccoli, cranberries, and green onion together in a large bowl. Whisk mayonnaise, honey, and vinegar together in a small bowl. Add bacon to broccoli mixture and toss. Drizzle dressing over the salad; toss to coat. Refrigerate until cold, about 30 minutes.
