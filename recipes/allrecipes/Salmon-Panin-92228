Rub your fingers over salmon pieces to locate any bones and pull them out with tweezers. Rinse fish, pat dry, and rub lightly with oil. Set a 10- to 12-inch ovenproof nonstick frying pan over high heat. When hot, lay salmon pieces side by side in pan. Cook until fish is browned on the bottom (lift a corner with a wide spatula to check), 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer pan to a 400 degree F oven and bake until salmon is opaque but still moist-looking in center of thickest part (cut to test), 4 to 5 minutes. When fish goes into the oven, put bread (cut sides together) on rack alongside fish, and bake until hot, 3 to 5 minutes. Pickled onion : In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over high heat, bring onion, 1/4 cup water, and 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar to a boil; stir often until liquid has evaporated, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour into a small bowl and add salt to taste. With halves still together, cut focaccia into 4 equal rectangles. Spread cut sides equally with Russian dressing. Mound 1/4 of the lettuce on the bottom half of each rectangle and set a piece of salmon on the greens. Top fish equally with pickled onion and season sandwiches to taste with salt. Cover with top half of bread.
