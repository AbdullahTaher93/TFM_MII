Cut chicken crosswise into 3/4-inch-wide strips. Whisk together mustard, orange-juice concentrate, honey, sesame oil and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Add the chicken and toss to combine. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare grill or preheat the broiler. Lightly oil rack or coat with nonstick cooking spray. Remove the chicken strips from the marinade, discarding remaining marinade. Grill or broil for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until no longer pink in the center. Season with salt and serve.
