Rinse chicken and pat dry. Arrange chicken pieces and pineapple slices in a single layer on rack in a 12- by 15-inch broiler pan. In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine mustard, honey, oil, and lime juice. Spoon half of the mixture evenly over chicken and pineapple; set remaining mustard sauce aside. Bake chicken in a 450 degrees F oven until meat in thickest part is no longer pink; cut to test (12 to 15 minutes). Meanwhile, place spinach in a 5-quart pan; sprinkle with 1 tablespoon water. Cook over high heat, stirring often, until leaves are softened (2 to 3 minutes). Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour spinach from pan into a colander, pressing with a spoon to remove excess moisture. Spoon hot spinach onto a warm platter. Microwave remaining mustard sauce, stirring once, on high (100% power) for 30 to 45 seconds or until heated through. Slice chicken crosswise into even slices. Top spinach with chicken and pineapple. Drizzle with sauce, then sprinkle with nuts.
