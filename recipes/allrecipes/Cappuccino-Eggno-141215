In a heavy medium saucepan mix the egg yolks, LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, and sugar. Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture just coats a metal spoon, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Place the pan in a sink or bowl of ice water and stir for 2 minutes. Stir in instant coffee, coffee liqueur (if desired) and vanilla. Cover and chill for 4 to 24 hours. Garnish each serving with orange peel strips.
