With a sharp knife, slice potatoes thinly but not all the way through, leaving slices attached at the bottom. Fan potatoes slightly. Place in an ungreased 8-in. square baking dish. Sprinkle with Italian seasoning and salt. Drizzle with butter. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 50 minutes. Sprinkle with cheeses and parsley; bake 10-15 minutes longer or until lightly browned.
