Follow directions for buttermilk pancake mix and add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Make 8 pancakes, slice each pancake into 4 fingers and set aside. Mix coffee and liqueur together, set aside. Over a double boiler, beat egg yolks and sugar until mixture thickens forms into ribbons and lightens in color. Let this cool before incorporating the mascarpone. Beat egg white to stiff peaks. Fold mascarpone cheese into egg yolk, fold mascarpone mixture into egg whites and set aside. Line pancake fingers around the edges of 6 wine goblets, from the bottom up, with a pastry brush paint the pancake strips with espresso mixture. Fill each wine goblet one third full of mascarpone mixture. Divide broken chocolate and sprinkle over each glass. Lay over two remaining fingers of pancake, paint again with espresso mixture and top with remaining mascarpone mixture. Sprinkle over powdered cocoa and top with shaved chocolate. Refrigerate and serve.
