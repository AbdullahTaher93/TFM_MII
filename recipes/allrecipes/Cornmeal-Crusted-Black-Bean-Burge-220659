Mix black beans, egg, red bell pepper, cilantro, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, and hot sauce in a large bowl with your hands until evenly mixed. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap; refrigerate 8 hours to overnight. Divide mixture into 1/3 cup portions; shape into 3-inch burgers. Spread cornmeal into the bottom of a shallow dish. Press the burgers into the cornmeal to coat both sides. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook burgers in hot oil until the center is hot, about 8 minutes per side.
