Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook broccoli in boiling salted water until tender. Mix cheese and chicken soups in a large bowl. Add 2 cups of croutons; blend together well. Drain broccoli. In a 15x10x2 inch baking pan, place half the cooked broccoli in a layer. Spoon half the soup mixture over the broccoli. Finish with a second layer of broccoli and top vegetable with remaining soup mix. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake for 30 minutes or until bubbling.
