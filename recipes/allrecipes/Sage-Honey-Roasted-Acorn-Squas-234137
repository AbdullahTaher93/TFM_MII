Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut each acorn squash in half lengthwise and, using a metal spoon, scoop out and discard the seeds and any pulp. Pour 1 cup of water into a 4-inch deep oven proof pan; arrange each squash, cut side up, snugly on top. In a small bowl stir together 1/4 cup sage honey, 1 tablespoon of water and salt; brush the cut side of each squash with the honey solution, making sure that all of the honey solution is used. Cover the pan tightly with foil and bake for 30 minutes. While the squash is cooking, make the sage honey butter. Heat a 6-inch saute pan over medium heat until hot; add the butter and swirl until foaming; cook until nutty brown in color. Remove from the heat and immediately add 1/2 cup sage honey and the sage leaves, stirring well. Set aside. Remove the foil from the squash and bake for another 15 minutes or until golden and tender when tested with the tip of a knife. Transfer the squash to a serving platter and spoon the sage-honey butter on top, then sprinkle with Fleur de Sel or Maldon salt.
