In a bowl, combine the flour, Parmesan cheese, salt, baking powder and baking soda. In another bowl, beat the eggs, buttermilk, sugar and butter. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in zucchini and onion. Pour into a greased and floured 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
