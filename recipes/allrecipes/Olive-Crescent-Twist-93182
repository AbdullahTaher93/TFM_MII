Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly grease cookie sheets or spray with cooking spray. In blender or food processor, place olives, oil and garlic powder; cover and blend until finely chopped. Unroll dough and separate into 4 rectangles. Press each to form 7x4-inch rectangle; press perforations to seal. Brush dough rectangles with beaten egg. Evenly spread olive mixture on 2 of the rectangles. Top with remaining 2 rectangles, egg-brushed side down; press down. With thin sharp knife, cut each filled rectangle crosswise into 8 strips. Place strips 1 inch apart on cookie sheets, twisting each 2 or 3 times. Brush tops of strips with beaten egg. Sprinkle strips lightly with cheese. Bake 10 to 13 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm or cool.
