Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish. Fry bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp. Drain on paper towels. In a large bowl, stir together the green beans and salad dressing; pour into the prepared dish. Crumble bacon over the top. Bake uncovered for 30 minutes in the preheated oven.
