In a saucepan, bring milk to a boil. Remove from the heat; stir in potato flakes. Let stand for 2 minutes. Whip with a fork until smooth; cool slightly. Beat in egg, oil and cheese. Combine remaining ingredients; stir in potato mixture just until moistened (batter will be thick). Fill greased muffin cups three-fourths full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes; remove from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm.
