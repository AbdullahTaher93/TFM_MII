Prepare pudding according to package directions; set aside. In a small sauce-pan, sprinkle gelatin over orange juice; let stand for 1 minute. Cook and stir over low heat until gelatin is completely dissolved. Stir into pudding. Add orange peel. Transfer to a large bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until cooled. Cut one angel food cake in half width-wise. Save one half for another use. Cut remaining half into eight slices. Cut second loaf into 16 slices. Arrange half of the cake slices in an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. dish. Fold whipped cream into pudding; spread half over the cake slices. Repeat layers. Cover and refrigerate overnight or until set.
