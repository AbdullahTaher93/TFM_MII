Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Place a 9x13 casserole dish in the oven to heat up while you mix up the batter. Mix together the cornmeal, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Stir in the Cheddar cheese, pepper Jack cheese, onion, and red bell pepper. Add the milk, oil, corn, green chile peppers, and Mexican cooking sauce. Stir well. Carefully remove the hot baking dish from the oven and spray it with non-stick cooking spray. Immediately pour the batter into the hot baking dish, and put it back in the oven. Bake until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Let cool at least 15 minutes before serving.
