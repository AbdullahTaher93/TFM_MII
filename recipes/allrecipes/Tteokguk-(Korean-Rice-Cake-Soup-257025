Combine water and beef strips in a stockpot; bring to a boil. Reduce to medium-high heat and simmer, skimming off any foam from the top. Add onion and garlic; simmer stock until flavors combine, 15 to 20 minutes. Rinse rice cake slices in cold water and drain well. Stir rice cakes and soy sauce into the stock; bring to a gentle boil until rice cake slices start to float, 8 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir eggs and green onions into the stock. Ladle into bowls.
