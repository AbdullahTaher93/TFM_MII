In a medium saucepan, combine the broth, wine, salt, and 1 cup (250 mL) water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low. Meanwhile, warm the oil in a Dutch oven set over medium heat. Add the leek and fennel. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the fennel starts to soften. Add the rice. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute to coat the grains. Add about 1 cup of the broth mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes, or until all the broth is absorbed. Cook, stirring frequently and adding 1/2 cup (125 mL) of the broth mixture at a time, for 20 minutes, or until the rice is almost tender. Add the shrimp and peas. Cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes, or until the shrimp is opaque and the rice is tender. Remove from the heat. Top with the Parmesan.
