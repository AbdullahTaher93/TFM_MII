In a large pot over medium high heat, combine the oil, onion and garlic and saute for 5 minutes. Stir in the lentils and bulgur wheat. Add the broth, tomatoes, chili powder, cumin and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes, or until lentils are tender.
