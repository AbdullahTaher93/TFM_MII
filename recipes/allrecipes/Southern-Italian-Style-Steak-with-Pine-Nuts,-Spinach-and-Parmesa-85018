Cut flank steak almost in half horizontally without cutting all the way through. Open steak to form a rectangle. Combine basil, garlic, pepper and salt. Reserve 1 teaspoon for sauce. In a food processor, combine 1 tablespoon spice blend, spinach, pine nuts, Parmesan, bread crumbs and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Pulse to make a coarse mixture. Spread over steak. Roll steak into a log shape; tie with string in several places to close securely. Sprinkle with remaining spice blend. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Pour 1 tablespoon olive oil into large skillet on medium-high heat. Add steak; sear on all sides until brown. Transfer steak into a 7 X 11-inch baking pan. Cover and bake 1 hour. Warm skillet over medium heat. Pour wine into skillet, scraping bottom of pan to loosen any bits of flavor. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, reserved 1 teaspoon spice blend, and onions; saute 5 minutes. Set aside. Remove steak from oven; cover with foil. Let stand 10 minutes. Add tomatoes to skillet; cook 10 minutes over medium heat. Slice meat. Top with warm sauce.
