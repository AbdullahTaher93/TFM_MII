Select 10 whole Shreddies for each flower pop. If desired, dip one corner of each into a small shallow bowl of melted chocolate, then into small candy sprinkles. Set on tray to cool. Draw 8 circles (2-3/4-inches in diameter) at least 3 inches apart on large sheet of parchment paper. Turn paper upside down. Spoon or pipe chocolate inside 1 circle shape at a time. Insert lollipop stick 1 inch into flower, rotating stick to coat with chocolate. Insert 10 Shreddies around edge of chocolate, fanning Shreddies to form petals. Decorate with candies and/or candy sprinkles. Repeat, working quickly before chocolate hardens, working on 1 at a time to make 8 flowers. Refrigerate until totally hardened. Cut top and bottom ends off of each kiwi and stand up on end. Insert flower into kiwi flower pot.
