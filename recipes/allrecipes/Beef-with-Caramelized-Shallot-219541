Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the beef and cook until well browned, stirring often. Remove the beef from the skillet. Heat the remaining oil in the skillet. Add the shallots and cook for 5 minutes or until lightly browned, stirring occasionally. Stir the wine and vinegar in the skillet and cook for 5 minutes or until the mixture is reduced by half. Stir in the mustard and concentrated broth. Return the beef to the skillet and cook until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Serve the beef mixture with the noodles.
