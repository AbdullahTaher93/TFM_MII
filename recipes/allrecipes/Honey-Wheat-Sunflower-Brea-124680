In a mixing bowl, combine the water, 2 cups all-purpose or bread flour, yeast and sugar. Beat on low speed for 3 minutes. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. (Mixture will be spongy.) Stir in whole wheat flour, oats, milk powder, butter, honey and salt; mix well. Stir in sunflower seeds and as much of the remaining all-purpose or bread flour as you can with a spoon. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Shape into a ball. Place in a grease bowl; turn once. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30-45 minutes. Punch down and divide in half. Cover and let rest 10 minutes. Shape into two loaves; place in two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pan. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20 minutes. Cover with foil; bake 15 minutes longer. Remove from pans and cool on wire racks.
