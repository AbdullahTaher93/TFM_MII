Mix the beef and picante sauce thoroughly in a medium bowl. Shape the beef mixture firmly into 4 (1/2-inch thick) burgers. Lightly oil the grill rack and heat the grill to medium. Grill the burgers for 10 minutes or until desired doneness, turning them over once halfway through grilling and brushing often with additional picante sauce. Serve the burgers on the buns with additional picante sauce.
