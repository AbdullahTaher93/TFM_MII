Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium mixing bowl combine eggs, LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and ginger. Beat until well combined but not foamy. Place six 6-ounce custard cups in a large shallow baking pan on oven rack. Pour egg mixture into custard cups. Pour hot water into pan around custard cups to reach halfway up sides of cups. Bake in 350 degree F oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until a knife inserted near centers comes out clean. Remove cups from water. Cool on a wire rack at least 20 minutes. Meanwhile, for plum sauce, in a medium saucepan combine plums, 1/3 cup sugar, and lemon juice. Bring to boil; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, about 8 minutes or until plums are tender. Stir together water and cornstarch. Stir into plum mixture. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Remove from heat. Stir in the 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. To serve, unmold the custards onto dessert plates. Spoon the plum sauce over custards.
