Stir 1-1/2 cups of the boiling water into red gelatin in large bowl 2 minutes until completely dissolved. Stir in cold water. Reserve 1-1/2 cups gelatin at room temperature. Pour remaining red gelatin into wreath or 5-cup mold sprayed with cooking spray. Refrigerate about 45 minutes or until set but not firm (should stick to finger when touched and should mound). Stir remaining 1 cup boiling water into lime gelatin in medium bowl 2 minutes until completely dissolved. Spoon in ice cream, stirring until ice cream is completely melted and mixture is well blended. Spoon over red layer in mold. Refrigerate about 20 minutes or until set but not firm. Spoon reserved red gelatin over creamy layer in mold. Refrigerate 4 hours or until firm. Unfold. Top with whipped topping. Store leftover gelatin mold in refrigerator.
