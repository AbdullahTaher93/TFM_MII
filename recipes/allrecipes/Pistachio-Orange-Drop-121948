In a mixing bowl, cream butter, sugar and orange peel. Gradually add flour. Set aside 3 tablespoons pistachios for topping; stir remaining pistachios into dough. Roll into 1-in. balls. Place 1-1.2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks. In a saucepan over low heat, melt chocolate chips and shortening; stir until smooth. Dip tops of cooled cookies in chocolate, then in reserved pistachios.
