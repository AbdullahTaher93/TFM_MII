In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs and banana; mix well. Combine flour and baking soda; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Fold in the nuts, chips and cherries. Transfer to four greased 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 32-37 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
