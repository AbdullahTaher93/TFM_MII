Preheat the broiler. Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat it with cooking spray and set aside. Heat oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add onion and garlic and saute until the onion is soft, about 3 minutes. Add mushrooms and saute until they are slightly soft, about 3 more minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Coarsely chop pecans in a food processor (not a blender). Add rice, carrots and the sauteed onion mixture. Pulse a few times until the mixture has a mealy consistency and transfer it to a large bowl. Add breadcrumbs and mix well. Season with salt, pepper and cayenne. Stir in egg. Shape the mixture into 6 patties. Place the patties on the prepared baking sheet. Broil, about 6 inches from the heat, until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
