Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Pierce each potato several times and rub generously with oil. Bake until softened, about 45 to 55 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl combine sour cream, cheese, corn and chiles. When the potatoes are cooked, cut a slit in the top of each one and squeeze or scoop out the flesh, leaving a 1/2 inch thick shell. Combine the potato flesh with the cheese mixture; mix well. Spoon the potato mixture back into the shells, and place them on a baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes, or until cheese is melted and golden brown.
