In 8-inch skillet, heat 1/2 inch oil for frying over medium heat. With pizza cutter, cut corn tortillas into 1/4-inch-wide strips. Fry strips in batches in hot oil 1 to 2 minutes or until golden and crisp. With tongs, place fried tortilla strips on paper towels to drain. On individual plates, evenly layer lettuce, bell pepper, mango, avocado, tomatoes, beans and cheese. Lightly spray 10-inch skillet with cooking spray. Add chicken strips; sprinkle with taco seasoning mix, chipotle chili powder and water. Cook uncovered over medium heat 5 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink in center. Set aside. In food processor or blender, process all dressing ingredients until well blended and cilantro is finely chopped. Arrange chicken evenly over salads. Drizzle about 3 tablespoons dressing over each salad. Top each evenly with tortilla strips.
