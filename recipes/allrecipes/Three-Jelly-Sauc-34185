In a bowl, stir together the apricot preserves, pineapple preserves, apple jelly, horseradish, and mustard powder until well blended. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. To serve, place one or two packages of room temperature cream cheese on a serving dish or platter. Spread preserves mixture evenly over the top, and garnish as desired. Serve with crackers of choice for spreading.
