Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a small bowl combine butter, salt, pepper, parsley, mustard and horseradish; mix well. Spread about 1 tablespoon of mixture evenly over each ear of corn. Wrap tightly in heavy duty aluminum foil; seal well. Place on a baking sheet. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until corn is tender.
