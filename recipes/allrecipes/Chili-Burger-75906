Preheat a grill for high heat. When the grill is hot, lightly oil the grate. In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, Italian sausage, chili sauce, salt and pepper. Form 8 balls out of the meat, and flatten into patties. Grill patties for 5 minutes per side, or until well done. Serve on buns with your favorite toppings.
