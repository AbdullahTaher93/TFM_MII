Soak bean curd sticks in cold water until softened, about 1 hour; drain. Cut into 4-inch sticks. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix nutritional yeast, peanut butter, miso paste, melted margarine, and paprika together in a mixing bowl. Brush on each side of bean curd sticks. Arrange on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until heated through, 20 to 30 minutes. Brush with barbeque sauce. Continue baking 15 minutes more.
