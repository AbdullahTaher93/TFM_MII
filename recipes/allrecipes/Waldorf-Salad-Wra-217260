Whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Slowly whisk in the olive oil until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Combine the chicken, cranberries, blue cheese and walnuts in a large bowl, add a few tablespoons of the dressing, season with salt and pepper and toss to combine. Spread some of the dressing down the center of each wrap and top with some of the arugula. Divide the chicken mixture between the two wraps. Roll each tightly and slice in half.
