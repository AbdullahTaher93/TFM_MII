Preheat oven to 425 degrees (or 400 degrees for dark or nonstick pan). Drain Blueberries; rinse and set aside. Stir Muffin Mix, water, oil and egg in medium bowl just until blended (batter may be lumpy). Gently stir in blueberries. Drop batter by rounded tablespoonfuls about 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 7 to 9 minutes or until edges and tops begin to brown. Cool 1 minute before removing from cookie sheet.
