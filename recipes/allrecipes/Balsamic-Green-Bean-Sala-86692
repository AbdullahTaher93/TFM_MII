Place green beans in a large saucepan. Fill with enough water to cover green beans, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium low, and simmer 10 minutes. Drain, and let cool. In a bowl, stir together shallots, garlic, balsamic vinegar, and oil. Pour over green beans. Cover, and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Serve cold.
