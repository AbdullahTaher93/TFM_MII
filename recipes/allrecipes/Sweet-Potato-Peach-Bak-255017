Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Place Bruce's(R) Yams Cut Sweet Potatoes in a bowl and cut into slightly smaller pieces. Drain the peaches (reserving 4-5 slices for the top of the casserole) and add to the yams along with 1/2 cup peach juice, ground ginger, salt and pepper; stir to mix. Transfer to a 2 quart baking dish; set aside. In a separate bowl, stir together the brown sugar and pecans. Sprinkle over top of casserole and place reserved peach slices in a line down the center. Bake for 35-40 minutes until hot and bubbly.
