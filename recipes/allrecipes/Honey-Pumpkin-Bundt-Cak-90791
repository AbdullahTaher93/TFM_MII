Preheat oven to 350 degree. Stir together flour, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves until blended. In a large bowl, combine butter and honey. Beat with an electric mixer or by hand until creamy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until blended. Then stir in vanilla, pumpkin, dates, nuts, and flour mixture until blended. Pour mixture into a greased and flour-dusted 12-cup fluted bundt or tube-cake pan. Bake for 45 minutes or until a pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool on rack. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Serve or store, wrapped in foil, at room temperature for two days; freeze for longer storage.
