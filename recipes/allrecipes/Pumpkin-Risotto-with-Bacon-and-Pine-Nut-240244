Cook and stir pine nuts in a skillet over medium heat until fragrant and toasted, 2 to 5 minutes. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion in hot oil until soft, 4 to 7 minutes. Add garlic, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir Arborio rice into onion mixture; cook and stir until rice is coated with oil and lightly toasted, 1 to 3 minutes. Pour white wine into rice mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until wine is completely absorbed, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour hot chicken stock into rice mixture 1 ladle-full at a time, stirring until liquid is completely absorbed before adding the next, 3 to 7 minutes per ladle-full. Stir pumpkin, butter, and nutmeg into rice mixture until well-combined; remove from heat. Add Parmesan cheese, bacon, chives, and basil; stir until cheese is melted.
