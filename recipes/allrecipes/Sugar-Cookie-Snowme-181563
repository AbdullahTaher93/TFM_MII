Heat oven to 375 degrees F. In medium bowl, stir cookie mix, flour, butter and egg until soft dough forms. Shape dough into 21 (1 1/4-inch) balls, 21 (1-inch) balls and 21 (3/4-inch) balls. For each snowman, place 3 balls in decreasing sizes with edges just touching on ungreased cookie sheet; flatten balls slightly. Place snowmen about 3 inches apart. Bake 7 to 9 minutes or until edges are light golden brown. Remove from oven; immediately insert pretzel sticks into sides of middle balls for arms. Cool 5 minutes; remove from cookie sheet to cooling rack. Cool completely, about 15 minutes. Frost cookies and decorate with candies.
