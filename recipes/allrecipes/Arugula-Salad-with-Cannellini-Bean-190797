Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook the garlic in the hot oil about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, wine, sage, and thyme; increase the heat to medium-high and simmer 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the cannellini beans and basil. Season with salt and pepper. Continue cooking until beans are heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Arrange the arugula on a serving platter. Spoon the bean mixture over the arugula. Top with the shaved Parmesan cheese if desired.
