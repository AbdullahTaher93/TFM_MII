Preheat a grill to medium heat. Brush steaks on both sides with olive oil, then sprinkle with a mix of cracked pepper and celery seed. Cook steaks to desired doneness on the preheated grill. When done, allow steaks to rest on a plate while continuing with the recipe. Bring the Bloody Mary mix, orange juice concentrate, and vodka to a boil over high heat; then reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 5 minutes. While sauce is cooking, puree the olives, butter, and garlic in a small food processor until almost smooth. To serve, pour a pool of the sauce in the center of each plate. Slice each steak into 4 or 5 slices, and fan out over the sauce. Add a dollop of olive butter, and spoon a little more sauce overtop.
