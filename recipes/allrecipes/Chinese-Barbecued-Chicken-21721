Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line broiler pan with aluminum foil and spray lightly with cooking spray. Mix all ingredients except chicken in a 1 quart saucepan. Cook over medium low heat, stirring occasionally, until preserves are melted. Place chicken, skin side up, on rack in broiler pan. Brush with preserves mixture. Bake uncovered in preheated oven for about 1 hour, brushing occasionally with preserves mixture, until juice of chicken is no longer pink when centers of thickest pieces are cut. Discard any remaining preserves mixture.
