Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon; drain off fat, reserving 3 tablespoons in pan. Season chicken with salt and pepper; cook in hot skillet, turning once, until golden brown and cooked through, about 8 minutes. Transfer to serving dish and place in preheated oven to keep warm. Add garlic and spinach to the hot skillet; cook until spinach wilts, 1 to 2 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk cream and tomato paste together and pour over spinach; simmer for about 30 seconds to warm through. Spoon sauce over chicken, top with bacon bits and serve.
