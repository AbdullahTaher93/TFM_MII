Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. In a large bowl, toss tomatoes with garlic and olive oil. Place on a sheet pan and roast in preheated oven for 20 minutes or until tender. Remove from oven and mash with a fork. Heat oil in large skillet, over medium heat. Add garlic and Italian seasoning; cook for 1-2 minutes or until garlic begins to sizzle. Turn off heat and stir in roasted tomato mixture, capers and Parmesan cheese. Toss with pasta, and serve with extra Parmesan cheese.
