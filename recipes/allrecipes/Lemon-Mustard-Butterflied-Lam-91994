Trim and discard fat from surface of lamb. Make lengthwise cuts through the center of the thickest parts of the meat, leaving about 1 inch uncut, and lay meat open to create a butterfly shape. With your palms, press meat to flatten evenly. Thread 3 metal skewers through the flattened butterfly in a triangle. Place lamb in a close-fitting dish. In a small bowl, stir together lemon juice, mustard, sugar, Worcestershire, garlic, and oil; rub mixture all over lamb. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or until next day, turning lamb several times. Lift lamb from marinade and drain briefly (reserve marinade), then place on a lightly oiled grill 4 to 6 inches above a solid bed of medium coals, or over medium heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level for about 5 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning as needed and brushing occasionally with marinade, until a meat thermometer inserted in thickest part of lamb registers 135 degrees to 140 degrees F (about 35 to 40 minutes). Thickest portions of meat will be rare; thinner sections will be medium to well done. To serve, place lamb on a board and let stand for 10 minutes; then cut across the grain into thin slices. Garnish with lemon slices and cilantro sprigs.
