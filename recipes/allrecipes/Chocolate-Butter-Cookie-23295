Combine sugar and butter in large bowl. Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until creamy (1 to 2 minutes). Add egg and almond extract; continue beating until well mixed (1 minute). Reduce speed to low; beat, gradually adding flour and cocoa and scraping bowl often, until well mixed (1 to 2 minutes). Divide dough into thirds. Wrap each third in plastic food wrap; refrigerate until firm (2 hours or overnight). Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Shape dough with floured hands, one-third at a time (keep remaining dough refrigerated), into 1-inch balls. Form balls into desired shapes (balls, squares, logs, etc.). Place 1 inch apart onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 7 to 9 minutes or until set (surface may crack slightly). Cool completely. Decorate as desired.
