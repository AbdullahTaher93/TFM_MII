Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Rub lamb chops with one of the garlic halves, then brush the chops lightly with oil and season with salt and pepper. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the lamb chops and brown well on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the chops to a small ovenproof dish and roast until desired doneness, about 10 minutes for medium-rare. Meanwhile, pour beef broth and 1 cup of the beer into the pan; stir in molasses and the remaining garlic. Bring to a boil and cook over medium-high heat until the liquid has reduced by half, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove garlic and stir in mustard. Combine cornstarch and 2 tablespoons beer (the rest of the beer is for the cook) in a small bowl. Add to the sauce in the pan and whisk until slightly thickened. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
