Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cut stems off beets and place whole on a baking sheet. Roast until fork tender, about 45 minutes. Allow to cool; peel and dice beets into large bite-sized pieces. Toss with 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar in a bowl; season with salt and black pepper. Toss diced avocado with 2 tablespoons olive oil in a separate bowl; season with salt. To serve, divide salad greens between serving plates. Top each serving with 1/4 of the beets and avocado. Sprinkle each serving with shelled pistachios, dried cherries, and shredded Parmesan cheese. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar. Season with salt and ground black pepper to taste.
