Cook beets in a large Dutch oven over medium heat about 40 minutes or until tender. Drain and peel. If beets are too large to fit in jars, cut into wedges. Wash jars and lids in hot soapy water; rinse with warm water. Fill boiling-water canner half full with water; add jars and water to cover. Bring water to a boil, reduce heat and simmer. Place lids in water to cover in a small saucepan; bring water to a simmer. Simmer until ready to use. Remove and drain jars and lids, one at a time, as needed for filling. Combine vinegar, water, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, mustard seeds, cloves, allspice, celery seeds, and cinnamon stick in a large Dutch oven; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the beets, lemons, and onion, and return to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium low; cover and simmer 15 minutes. Remove and discard cinnamon stick. PACK beet mixture immediately into prepared jars using a slotted spoon, filling to within 1/4-inch of tops. Ladle pickling liquid into jars, filling to within 1/4-inch of tops. Wipe jar rims and threads. Cover with 2-piece lids. Screw bands tightly. Place jars on rack in canner. (Water must cover jars by 1 to 2 inches. Add boiling water, if necessary.) Cover; bring water to gentle boil. Process 15 minutes. Remove jars and place upright on towel to cool completely. After jars cool, check seals by pressing center of lid with finger. (If lid springs back, lid is not sealed and refrigeration is necessary.) Store in a cool, dark place for up to 1 year. Once opened, store refrigerated.
