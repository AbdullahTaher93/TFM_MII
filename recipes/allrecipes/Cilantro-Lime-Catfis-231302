Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir cilantro and garlic into the melted butter; cook about 1 minute. Season catfish fillets with salt and black pepper; lay gently into the butter mixture. Place a cover on the skillet. Cook fillets 10 minutes, turn, and continue cooking until the fish flakes easily with a fork and is lightly browned, about 10 minutes more. Squeeze lemon juice and lime juice over the fillets to serve.
