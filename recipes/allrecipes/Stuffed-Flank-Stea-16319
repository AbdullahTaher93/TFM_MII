Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, combine the stuffing mix, water and butter or margarine. Mix well and let stand for 5 minutes. Spoon the stuffing onto the steak, leaving a 1 inch border. Add the green onions and the red bell pepper. Roll from the long edge of the steak and secure with wooden toothpicks. Place steak seam side down in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a separate small bowl, combine the gravy, wine OR apple juice, garlic and cheese. Mix well and pour over the steak. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour, remove from oven and let stand before slicing.
