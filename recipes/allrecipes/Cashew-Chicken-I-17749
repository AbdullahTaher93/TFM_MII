Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Saute chicken until it turns white, then season with salt and pepper and add broth, soy sauce, celery, bamboo shoots and water chestnuts. Cover skillet, reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Beat cornstarch and water together in a small bowl, then blend into skillet mixture and heat through until thick and bubbly. Sprinkle with cashews and serve.
