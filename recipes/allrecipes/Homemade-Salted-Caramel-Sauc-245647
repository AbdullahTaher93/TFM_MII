Pour sugar and water into a small saucepan; swirl gently to combine. Heat over medium-low heat until little bubbles form on the side. Increase heat to high and boil until sugar turns amber, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and carefully whisk in heavy cream. Add butter and salt, stirring to combine. Pour caramel into a glass container; let cool.
