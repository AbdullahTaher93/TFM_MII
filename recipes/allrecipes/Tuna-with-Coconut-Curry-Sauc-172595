In a shallow bowl, mix cilantro, coconut milk, tamarind concentrate, and curry paste. Rinse fish, pat dry, and turn it in coconut milk mixture to coat; lift out and set aside. Pour coconut milk mixture into a small pan and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring. Remove from heat and keep warm. Place fish on a lightly greased grill 4 to 6 inches above a solid bed of hot coals (you can hold your hand at grill level for only 1 to 2 seconds) or over high heat on a gas grill. Close lid on gas grill. Cook until bottom of fish is paler in color to a depth of about 1/4 inch into fish; cut to test (about 2 minutes; fish will be red in center). Then turn fish with a wide spatula and continue to cook until side of fish on grill is the same color as top of fish and center is still pink to red; cut to test (about 1 more minute). Stir cashews into rice, then spoon onto 2 warm plates. Top each portion of rice with a tuna steak. Sprinkle with basil. Serve with warm coconut-curry sauce; season to taste with salt.
