In a large bowl, mix flour and salt. Cut shortening into the flour until it is the size of peas. In a 2 cup measuring cup, beat the egg lightly. Add vinegar, then fill to 1 1/2 cups with cold water. Add just enough liquid to flour mixture to hold the dough together. It should be approximately 4 tablespoons. Reserve remaining liquid for your next batch of dough. Handle dough as little as possible. Roll out and use as desired.
