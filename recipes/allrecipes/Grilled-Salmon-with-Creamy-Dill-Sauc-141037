Cover and cook 8 to 10 minutes or until salmon flakes easily with a fork. Meanwhile, stir together remaining ingredients in a small microwaveable dish. Cover and cook on High 1 to 2 minutes, stirring once, until sauce is hot. Serve cut into serving size pieces with sauce spooned over salmon. Garnish with fresh dill, if you have some.
