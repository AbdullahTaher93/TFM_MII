Heat the broiler or heat a ridged, cast-iron grill pan until very hot. Put the olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, and chopped oregano in a bowl and stir to mix together. Add the cubes of lamb and turn until very well coated. Thread the cubes onto 4 metal skewers. Cook the lamb under the broiler or on the grill pan until tender, turning frequently, 7 to 8 minutes. Toward the end of cooking, warm the pita bread under the broiler or on the grill pan. Meanwhile, make the salad. Put all the ingredients in a salad bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste; toss together gently. Serve the kabobs with the salad, pita bread, and, if required, yogurt.
