In a medium-size bowl, whisk together LACTAID(R) Fat Free Milk, margarine, egg and lemon peel. In a separate bowl stir together the flours, baking soda and cinnamon, mix well. Whisk the LACTAID(R) Fat Free Milk mixture into the dry ingredients, and stir until the batter is smooth, it will be a thin batter. Lightly coat a 10-inch nonstick fry pan or griddle with nonstick spray. Place over medium heat and let stand for 3 to 4 minutes, or until hot. Using a measuring cup, spoon a scant 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake onto the fry pan. Sprinkle each pancake with 2 tablespoons of strawberries. Cook, without turning, until the pancakes are firm at the edges and bubbles form in the batter, about 3 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook until golden brown, about 2 more minutes. Optional sprinkle with confectioner's sugar and serve immediately.
