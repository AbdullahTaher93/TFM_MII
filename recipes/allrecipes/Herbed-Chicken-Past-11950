Cook pasta in about 4 quarts of boiling salted water until al dente. Drain. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium high heat until hot. Add mushrooms, onions, and garlic; saute 2 minutes. Add chicken, salt, basil, and pepper; saute 5 minutes, or until chicken is done. Add chopped tomato, and saute an additional 2 minutes. Serve chicken herb sauce over pasta. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
