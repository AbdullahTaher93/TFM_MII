In a large resealable plastic bag, mix the paprika, coriander, cumin, garlic salt, and pepper. Place steak in the bag, and shake to coat. Allow to sit 20 minutes in the refrigerator. Preheat the oven broiler. Lightly grease a baking sheet. Arrange steak on the baking sheet, and broil 5 minutes on each side, or to desired doneness. Serve with Ranch dressing for dipping.
