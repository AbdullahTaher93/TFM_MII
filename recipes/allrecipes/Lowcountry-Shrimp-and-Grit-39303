In a medium saucepan, bring the milk to a boil. Stir in the grits, and reduce heat to low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until silky, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onions until tender, then toss in shrimp. Season with salt and pepper, and cook 4 to 5 minutes, or until shrimp turn pink. Stir shrimp mixture into grits, and continue cooking for 10 to 15 minutes. Serve hot.
