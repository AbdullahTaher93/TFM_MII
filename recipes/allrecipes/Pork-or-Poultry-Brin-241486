Fill a large pot with water to about 3/4-full; add carrots, celery, onions, kosher salt, brown sugar, lemon slices, bell pepper, and garlic. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer mixture for 10 minutes. Let the brine cool at room temperature for 10 minutes before refrigerating to chill completely, at least 1 hour more. Strain brine into a separate food-safe container.
