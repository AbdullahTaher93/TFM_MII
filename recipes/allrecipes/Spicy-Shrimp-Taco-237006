In a small mixing bowl, combine the ranch dressing and Sriracha. Reserve refrigerated. In a separate mixing bowl, combine shrimp, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and lime juice. Toss to combine. Heat a saute pan over medium high heat until hot. Add olive oil, then the shrimp, and saute until pink and cooked through (about 2 to 3 minutes), turning often to cook evenly. To assemble tacos, place about 4 warm shrimp into each tortilla and top with 1 tbsp. diced mango and 1 tbsp. diced onions. Drizzle with Sriracha ranch dressing and sprinkle with chopped cilantro. Serve with lime wedges to be squeezed over top.
