In a colander, rinse frozen peas in cold water until thawed. Drain, and transfer to a large salad bowl. Add water chestnuts, tomatoes, onion, and sweet pickles; mix well. In a small bowl, mix together mayonnaise and a little pickle or lemon juice. Do not make the mixture to soupy. Pour over vegetables, and gently stir to coat.
