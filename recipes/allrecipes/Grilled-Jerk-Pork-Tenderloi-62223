Combine habanero peppers, onion, green onions, ginger, and garlic, in a blender or food processor. Blend until quite fine. Add cider, white vinegar, soy sauce, olive oil, and sugar. Season with mustard seed, salt, pepper, thyme, allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Continue to blend until smooth. Place the pork tenderloin in a shallow casserole dish. Spread mixture on all sides of the meat (wear gloves or use a spatula). Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours. Preheat grill for medium-high heat. Lightly oil grate. Add soaked wood chips to coals, if using. Grill slabs of tenderloin, turning as needed, about 6 to 7 minutes on each side, or until the internal temperature has reached 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove meat from grill; allow to rest for 5 minutes. Slice thinly and serve.
