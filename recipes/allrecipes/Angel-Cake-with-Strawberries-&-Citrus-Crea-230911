In a chilled bowl, whip cream until thick. Beat in icing sugar just until soft peaks. Beat in orange and lemon zest and vanilla just until stiff peaks. (Cream can be covered and refrigerated for up to 8 hours. Whisk lightly before serving). Preheat broiler. Place cake slices on a baking sheet. Toast under the broiler or on the barbecue, turning once and rotating baking sheet as necessary, for 1 to 2 min per side or just until golden. Place 1 slice of cake on each serving plate. Top with a dollop of the whipped cream; spoon strawberries on top. Top with another slice of cake, remaining cream and then strawberries. Garnish with strips of orange zest, if desired.
