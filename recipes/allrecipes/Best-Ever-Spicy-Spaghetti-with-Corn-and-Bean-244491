Pour whole box of pasta into a large skillet (approximately 12 inches in diameter). Pour 3 cups of cold water into the pan, ensuring that the water covers the pasta. Turn the burner to high, then set your timer for 10 minutes (optional: add a bit of salt to taste). Cook on high, stirring occasionally, until almost all of the liquid has evaporated. Add sauce, corn, black beans and chili flakes stir to combine and gently heat through. Remove the skillet from heat, season with salt and serve immediately.
