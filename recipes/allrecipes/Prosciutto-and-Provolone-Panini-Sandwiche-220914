Heat a panini grill or waffle iron. Brush oil over bread slices. Turn 4 slices over; spread pesto evenly over bread. Top with half of the cheese, tearing to fit if necessary, all of the prosciutto and pepper strips and remaining cheese. Close sandwiches with remaining bread oiled sides up. Cook (in batches) in panini maker* or waffle iron 3 to 4 minutes or until golden brown and cheese is melted.
