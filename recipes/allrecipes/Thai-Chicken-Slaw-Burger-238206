Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Arrange hamburger buns, cut-sides facing up, in a single layer on a baking sheet. Toast buns under the preheated broiler until toasted, 30 to 60 seconds. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, tomato paste, and garlic in hot butter until onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Stir chili sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and sugar into onion mixture. Stir chicken and olive oil into the skillet; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes. Whisk relish, lemon juice, and honey together in a large bowl; add coleslaw blend and toss to coat. Spoon chicken mixture into toasted buns and top with coleslaw.
