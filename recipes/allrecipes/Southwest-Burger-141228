On a clean cutting board, wash and chop cilantro and onions separately. In a large bowl combine sausage, salsa, onions, cilantro and seasonings. Form into 4 to 5 long oval patties, depending on size desired. Over medium heat on grill, cook burgers on each side until done (no longer pink in the center), about 10-15 minutes** (depending on size). Melt cheese if desired over top before serving. Serve with rolls, salsa or favorite condiments and tortilla chips. Refrigerate leftovers.
