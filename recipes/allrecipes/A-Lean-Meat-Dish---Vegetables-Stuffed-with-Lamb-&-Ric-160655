Soak rice in water 1 hour and drain. Bring vegetables to room temperature. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Combine rice and remaining stuffing ingredients in large bowl. Prepare vegetables: Slice off ends of zucchini and cut in half lengthwise. With a spoon, scrape out seeds. Remove tops of tomatoes and peppers. Remove and discard seeds and pulp from tomatoes. Cut out seeds and white membranes from peppers. Whisk together dressing ingredients in small bowl. Assemble the dish: Stuff each vegetable three-quarters full with stuffing. Place in single layer in lightly oiled large baking dish. Drizzle dressing over top (go lightly over tomatoes and peppers). Cover and bake until rice and veggies are tender, about 1 hour. Uncover and broil a few minutes to brown edges. Serve warm.
