Combine lemon pepper, paprika, garlic salt, rosemary and cayenne pepper; rub over roast. Place roast with fat side up in a large roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F until roast reaches desired doneness. Allow 25-27 minutes per pound for medium-rare (145 degrees F on thermometer), 27-30 minutes for medium (160 degrees F) and 32-35 minutes for well done (170 degrees F). Remove to serving platter and keep warm. Let stand 15 minutes before carving. Pour meat juices from roasting pan into a glass measuring cup; skim off fat. Add boiling water and bouillon to roasting pan and stir to remove drippings. Stir in meat juices. Serve with the roast.
