In a large skillet cook chicken thighs in hot oil over medium heat about 10 minutes or until chicken is lightly browned, turning to brown evenly. Remove chicken; set aside. Add mushrooms, onion, and garlic to skillet; cook until vegetables are tender. Reduce heat to low. Add curry powder, salt, and cinnamon; cook and stir for 1 minute. Carefully add chicken broth and chopped apple. Return chicken to skillet. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer about 15 minutes or until chicken is tender and no longer pink. (Internal temperature should reach 180 degrees F with an instant-read thermometer.) Transfer chicken to a serving platter; keep warm. For sauce, combine LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk and flour; stir into pan juices. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 1 minute more. Spoon some of the sauce over chicken. Serve with rice and, if desired, assorted condiments. Pass remaining sauce.
