Rub chicken with salt and pepper. Combine chicken, giblets, and butter in a 5-quart pot over medium heat. Add onion, cloves, cardamom, and bay leaf. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until moisture has evaporated. Cook chicken until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in enough water to just cover the chicken. Simmer until flavors combine, about 20 minutes.
