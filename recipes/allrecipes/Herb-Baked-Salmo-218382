Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Spray a shallow baking dish with no-stick cooking spray. Arrange salmon fillets in prepared pan. Season both sides of fish with salt and pepper. Whisk together oil, tarragon, fennel seeds, lemon peel and lemon juice in small bowl. Spoon mixture over salmon. Bake salmon just until cooked through, about 12 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges.
