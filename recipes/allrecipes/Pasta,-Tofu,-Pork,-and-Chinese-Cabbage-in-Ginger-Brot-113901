In a medium stainless-steel saucepan, combine the broth, soy sauce, vinegar, mirin, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, sugar, and salt. Bring just to a simmer, stirring occasionally. In a large pot of boiling, salted water cook the spaghettini until almost done, about 8 minutes. Drain. Return the pasta to the pot. Add the hot ginger broth to the pasta along with the cabbage and tofu. Bring back to a simmer and cook for 1 minute. Add the pork and scallions. Remove from the heat and let sit until the pork is just done, about 1 minute.
