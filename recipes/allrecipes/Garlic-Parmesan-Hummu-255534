Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place the garlic head on a piece of aluminum foil. Drizzle olive oil over garlic and season with salt and pepper. Wrap foil around garlic to fully enclose and place on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until roasted and tender, about 40 minutes. Remove garlic from aluminum foil and cool for 20 minutes. Remove garlic cloves from the peels. Combine roasted garlic, chickpeas, tahini, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, cumin, and salt in a food processor or blender until smooth.
