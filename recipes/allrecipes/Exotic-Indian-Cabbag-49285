Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Sautee the ginger and serrano pepper for about one minute until soft. Season with caraway, cumin, fennel, mustard, fenugreek, turmeric, and asafoetida; cook until fragrant, about 20 to 30 seconds. Stir in the cardamom pods and cabbage. Season with salt and mix well. Pour in the water and lime juice, bring to a simmer, and cook, covered for 5 minutes. Pour the beans over the cabbage, cover, and cook an additional 2 minutes to reheat. Remove the lid and simmer until the liquid is absorbed, about 1 to 2 minutes.
