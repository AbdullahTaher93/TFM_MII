Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Thaw fish fillets, if frozen. Rinse fish and pat dry with paper towels. Cut fish fillets crosswise into 1-inch slices. Place fish in single layer in a greased shallow pan. Combine margarine, bouillon, cumin and garlic powder. Brush over fish. Bake for 4-6 minutes or until fish flakes easily when pierced with a fork. Meanwhile, combine mayonnaise, sour cream and lime juice. Add coleslaw mixture; toss to coat. Spoon coleslaw mixture onto each warm tortilla. Top with fish. If desired, serve with salsa.
