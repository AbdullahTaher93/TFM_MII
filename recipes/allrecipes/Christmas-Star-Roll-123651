Prepare hot roll mix according to package directions. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Cover and let rest for 5 minutes. Divide dough in half. Roll each half into a 1/4-in. thick rectangle. Brush with butter. Combine sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over dough. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting at a long end; pinch edges to seal seam. Cut each roll into eight equal pieces and set aside. Arrange pecans and cherries in two greased 8-in. round pans or 6-cup ring molds. Combine glaze ingredients in a medium saucepan; cook and stir over low heat until the butter is melted and the mixture is well blended. Pour glaze over pecans and cherries; top with rolls. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30-45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Immediately invert pans onto platters and let glaze drizzle over rolls.
