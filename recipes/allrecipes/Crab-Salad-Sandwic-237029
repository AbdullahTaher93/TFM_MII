Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Mix crab meat and mayonnaise together in a bowl; spread onto each English muffin half. Sprinkle each crab meat layer with sea salt and Cheddar cheese. Place English muffins on a baking sheet. Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, 3 to 5 minutes.
