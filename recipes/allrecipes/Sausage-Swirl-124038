In a large bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder and salt. Stir in oil until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually stir in enough milk to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead lightly for 30 seconds. Roll into two 16-in. x 10-in. rectangles. Crumble uncooked sausage over dough to within 1/2 in. on all sides. Carefully roll up from 16-in. end. Wrap in foil; chill for at least 1 hour. Cut into 1/2-in. slices; place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until lightly browned. Serve warm or cold. Store in the refrigerator.
