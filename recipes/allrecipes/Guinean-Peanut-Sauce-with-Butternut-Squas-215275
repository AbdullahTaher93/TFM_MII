Place the butternut squash in a saucepan with water to cover. Bring to a boil and then simmer, covered, until the squash is tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, reserving the cooking liquid. Combine the peanut butter, tomato, and warm water in a bowl. The authentic way to prepare this is to squish it together by hand -- but a food processor works, too. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the onion slices and cook for 2 minutes. Add the peanut butter mixture, the minced garlic, the bay leaf, black pepper, and about 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir to combine, then bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the peanut sauce, adding the reserved cooking liquid as needed, for 15 minutes. The consistency should be similar to a thick soup. Stir in the butternut squash and simmer for an additional 15 minutes. Add the lemon juice, and taste to adjust the seasoning.
