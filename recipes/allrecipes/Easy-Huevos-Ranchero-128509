Preheat the broiler. Lightly coat a baking sheet with nonstick spray. In a medium skillet or saucepan, heat 1 1/2 inches (3.75 cm) water to boiling. Reduce heat to low. Gently break the eggs into the simmering water. Cook 3 to 5 minutes, or until whites are wet. Meanwhile, place tortillas on the prepared baking sheet and heat under the broiler 1 minute, or until slightly crisp but not brown. Flip tortillas and spread untoasted sides with refried beans. Return to the broiler and cook 1 minute, or just until heated through. Top each tortilla with a poached egg, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) salsa, and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) cheese. Return to the broiler and cook 30 seconds, or just until the cheese melts.
