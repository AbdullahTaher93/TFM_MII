Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook until it's well browned, stirring often. Add the onion and oregano and cook until the onion is tender. Pour off any fat. Stir in the cheese. Arrange the peppers in a 13x9x2-inch baking dish. Spoon the sausage mixture into the peppers. Pour the sauce over the filled peppers. Cover the dish. Bake at 400 degrees F for 40 minutes or until the peppers are tender.
