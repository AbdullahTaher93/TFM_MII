PREP: Heat oven to 400 degrees F. CLEAN: Wash hands. Rinse fresh chicken under cold water, or remove protective ice glaze from frozen chicken by holding under lukewarm running water for 1 to 2 minutes. Pat dry with paper towels. Lightly coat chicken with flour, if desired (it helps keep stuffing mix on chicken). Place buttermilk in shallow dish; place stuffing in second dish. Dip chicken breasts in buttermilk, then in stuffing; press stuffing onto chicken. Place in shallow pan; drizzle with melted butter. CLEAN: Wash hands. COOK: Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until internal juices of chicken run clear. (Or insert instant-read meat thermometer in thickest part of chicken. Temperature should read 170 degrees F.) Meanwhile, place rice mixture, contents of seasoning packet, water and butter in 2-quart casserole; cover. Bake 25 minutes; stir in peas and onions. Continue baking until liquid is absorbed, about 5 to 8 minutes. SERVE: Serve chicken with rice mixture and a tossed salad, if desired. CHILL: Refrigerate leftovers immediately.
