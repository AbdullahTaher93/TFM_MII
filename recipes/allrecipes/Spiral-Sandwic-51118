Cover bread evenly with spreadable cheese. Layer turkey, tomato, Swiss cheese and spinach on bread, leaving about 4 inches at one side covered with spreadable cheese only. Beginning at the side layered with turkey, roll up bread. Trim each end with serrated knife to make even; cut bread roll into 1-inch slices.
