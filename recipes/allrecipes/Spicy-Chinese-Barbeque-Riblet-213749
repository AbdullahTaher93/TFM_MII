Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine the hoisin sauce, white wine, soy sauce, sugar, tomato paste, garlic, and hot sauce in large bowl; mix well. Place the riblets in a large roasting pan and bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, for 45 minutes. Pour sauce over riblets and toss to coat. Return the pan to the oven; bake, stirring often, until ribs are tender and sauce has thickened, about 45 minutes.
