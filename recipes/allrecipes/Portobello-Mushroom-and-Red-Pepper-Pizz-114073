Heat the oven to 450 degrees F. In a large frying pan, heat 3 tablespoons of the oil over moderately high heat. Put the peppers in the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Add the mushrooms and the salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are golden, about 10 minutes more. Meanwhile, oil a 14-inch pizza pan or large baking sheet. Press the pizza dough onto the pan in an approximately 14-inch round or 9-by-13-inch rectangle. Spread the peppers and mushrooms on the pizza crust. Bake for 12 minutes. Sprinkle on the garlic, black pepper, and basil. Top with the mozzarella and then with the Parmesan. Drizzle with the remaining 3 tablespoons oil. Bake until the cheese is bubbling and beginning to brown, about 10 to 15 minutes longer.
