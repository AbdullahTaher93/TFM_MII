Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir rice, onion, and bell pepper in hot oil until the vegetables are slightly tender and rice is lightly browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir diced tomatoes, vegetable juice, tomato sauce, water, sugar, lemon juice, salt, and pepper into the rice mixture. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes more.
