Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium casserole dish. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the zucchini and onion, and cook 5 minutes, or until onion is golden brown. In the prepared casserole dish, mix the zucchini, onion, tomatoes, and green pepper. Season with Italian seasoning, and top with cheese. Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
