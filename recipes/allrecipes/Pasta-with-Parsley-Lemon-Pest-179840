Fill a 4- to 5- quart pan two-thirds full with water and place over high heat. Add salt, if desired. When water boils, add pasta and cook according to package directions, or until tender to bite, about 12 to 14 minutes. Meanwhile, use a vegetable peeler to remove peel from lemon in large strips. In a food processor or blender, whirl lemon peel, parsley, garlic, and cheese until finely minced. Drain pasta and place in a medium bowl. Add parsley mixture and oil; mix well to coat. Season to taste with pepper.
