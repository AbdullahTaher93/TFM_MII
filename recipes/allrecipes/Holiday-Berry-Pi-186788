Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Prepare pie crust as directed on package for an unfilled crust, using a deep-dish 9-inch pie plate. Bake 9 to 11 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool completely. Meanwhile, beat softened cream cheese, sweetened condensed milk, lemon juice and vanilla in medium bowl with electric mixer until fluffy. Spread cream cheese mixture in baked crust. Mix cherry pie filling and 2 cups of the fresh berries in medium bowl. Gently spoon over filling. Top with remaining berries. Carefully cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours before serving.
