Heat salsa to boiling in large skillet. Reduce heat to a simmer. Crack eggs, one at a time, into salsa. Cover and cook over low heat 4 to 5 minutes or until whites are set. To serve, spoon eggs onto warm tortillas. Top as you like with warm salsa, a spoonful of sour cream, some shredded cheese and chopped cilantro.
