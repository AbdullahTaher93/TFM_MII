Combine broth, pomegranate (or cranberry) juice and salt in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat, stir in bulgur, cover and let stand until most of the liquid is absorbed, about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add eggplant, cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned, 9 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Add lamb to the pan and cook, stirring often, until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and garam masala, and cook, stirring often, until the lamb is cooked through, about 3 minutes more. Reduce heat to medium. Add figs, olives, the bulgur and eggplant to the pan; cook, stirring often, until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a large serving bowl or platter and garnish with almonds and mint, if desired.
