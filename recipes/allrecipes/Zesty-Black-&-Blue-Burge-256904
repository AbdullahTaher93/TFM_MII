Preheat grill to medium heat. Whisk eggs in a bowl and stir in Worcestershire sauce, bacon, green onion, garlic, and blue cheese. In a large bowl, mix beef and egg mixture with a fork. Shape into eight burger patties. Whisk blackening spice ingredients together and dust onto patties. Be sure to lightly rub the blackening spice onto each side and let rest in the refrigerator for ten minutes. Then place burgers on the grill and cook to desired temperature. Once cooked, place each burger into a warmed bun and add your favorite toppings.
