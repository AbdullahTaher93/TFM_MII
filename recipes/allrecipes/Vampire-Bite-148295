Knead 2/3 cup of flour into cookie dough. Add food coloring to tint dough bright red. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours. Preheat oven as directed, and line cookie sheet pans with parchment paper. Take 1 tablespoon of dough and form into lips. Transfer to prepared cookie sheets. Repeat until all dough is used. Sprinkle cookies with red sugar and bake as directed. Remove from the oven, and immediately press a chocolate-covered caramel piece into each cookie center. Cool completely. Use vanilla frosting to pipe fangs over the candy.
