Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 8x8 inch baking pan. Place the honey, mashed bananas, canola oil, milk and vanilla into a blender or food processor; puree until smooth. Sift together cornmeal, whole wheat flour, baking powder, soda and cinnamon. Stir flour mixture into banana mixture until blended. Fold in walnuts and sliced bananas. Pour into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until brown on top.
