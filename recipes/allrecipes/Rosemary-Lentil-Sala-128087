In a small bowl, combine the oil, vinegar, mustard, rosemary, coriander, and garlic. Set aside. In a 2-quart (2-L) saucepan, combine the broth, lentils, onion, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer until the lentils are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain the lentils and discard the bay leaf and any remaining broth. Transfer the lentils to a large bowl; add the pepper and celery. Toss gently. Whisk the dressing and pour over the lentils. Toss lightly. Chill, if desired. Line 4 serving plates with the lettuce. Divide the lentils, beets, carrots, zucchini, and radishes among the plates.
