In a large bowl combine tomatoes, onions, bell peppers and salt. Let stand overnight. Drain the tomato/pepper mixture and add the hot chile peppers, vinegar, sugar, and horseradish. Wrap the cinnamon, allspice, and cloves in cheesecloth or a porous bag, and add to tomato/pepper mixture. Boil for 15 minutes, or until tender. Pack tightly in sterilized jars and seal.
