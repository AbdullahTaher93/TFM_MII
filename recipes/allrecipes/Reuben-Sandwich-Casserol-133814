Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a bowl, mix the Thousand Island Dressing, sour cream, and onion. Arrange the dark rye and Sara Lee(R) Soft and Smooth 100% Whole Wheat Bread cubes in the bottom of the prepared baking dish, reserving about 1/2 cup each for topping. Layer the bread with sauerkraut and corned beef. Spread the dressing mixture over the corned beef. Spread Swiss cheese evenly over casserole. In a small bowl, toss remaining bread cubes with olive oil; sprinkle over cheese. Cover, and bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Uncover, and continue baking 10 minutes, or until bubbly and lightly browned.
