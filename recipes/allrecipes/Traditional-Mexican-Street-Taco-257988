Place a paper towel on a microwave-safe plate and top with tortillas; heat in the microwave for 10 seconds. Place chicken in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in the microwave until heated through, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Layer chicken, cilantro, onion, and guacamole, in that order, onto each tortilla. Squeeze lime juice over each taco.
