Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour one 10 inch tube or Bundt pan. Combine the cake mix, pudding mix, eggs, water, rum and oil. Mix until smooth and pour into prepared pan. Bake for 1 hour or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool for 25 minutes in pan before removing; remove and allow to cool completely. Prepare the frosting by blending together the frosting and rum. Ice the cake and sprinkle 1/2 cup chopped pecans over the top. Seal in airtight container.
