Combine flour, 1 1/4 cups SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a large bowl. In a small bowl, beat together eggs, buttermilk, and applesauce; pour into dry ingredients, and stir until moistened. Do not beat. Stir in bananas, vanilla, pineapple, and pecans. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until done. Cool on a wire rack. Beat together cream cheese, light butter, 3/4 cup SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, and 1 teaspoon banana flavoring until light and fluffy. Spread over the top of the cooled cake.
