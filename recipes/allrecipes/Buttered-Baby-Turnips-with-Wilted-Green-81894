In a large deep skillet, melt 1 Tbsp butter with all the herbs over medium heat. Add the shallots and the turnips. Stir until well coated, then cover. Cook for about 3 or 4 minutes. Stir occasionally. Meanwhile, rinse the turnip greens; be sure to discard any leaves that are turning yellow or are badly bruised. Cut out most of the stem. Leave them wet and coarsely chop. Also melt the remaining butter in a microwave. After the turnips have cooked through, add the greens. Cover for about 30 seconds to allow the water on the leaves to turn to steam. Then stir until evenly wilted. Remove to a serving bowl, pour over the melted butter, toss and serve at once.
