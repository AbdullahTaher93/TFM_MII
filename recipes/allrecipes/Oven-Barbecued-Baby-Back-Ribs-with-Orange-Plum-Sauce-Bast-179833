Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. In a 2- to 3-quart pan, combine plum sauce, orange juice, wine, tomato paste, orange peel, cinnamon, pepper, and ginger, if using. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring often, until reduced to 1 cup, about 7 minutes. Cool slightly. Meanwhile, line an 11- by 17-inch roasting pan with foil. Arrange ribs in pan in a single layer. Bake until lightly browned, about 20 minutes; turn ribs once during baking. Baste with plum sauce mixture. Bake until meat between bones is no longer pink (cut to test) and sauce is browned and bubbling, 15 to 20 minutes longer.
