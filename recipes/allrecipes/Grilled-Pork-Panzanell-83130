Combine Italian dressing and balsamic vinegar; place 1/3 cup dressing mixture in self-sealing bag along with pork chops; seal bag and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or as long as overnight. Cover and reserve remaining dressing. Prepare grill with medium-hot fire. Remove chops from marinade (discarding marinade) and grill over direct heat for 5 minutes per side, until nicely browned. Remove from grill and keep warm. Grill bread slices 2-3 minutes per side until nicely toasted. Remove bread from grill and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Meanwhile, combine lettuce, beans and tomato in large bowl. Add bread pieces and reserved dressing mixture; toss to coat all ingredients. Evenly distribute lettuce mixture on 4 plates. Slice pork chops and fan one pork chop over each salad. Garnish with black pepper, Parmesan cheese and fresh basil.
