Trim the tops of the scallions to remove any bruised ends. Cut off the top 1/3 of the green part, mince and set aside for a garnish. Mince the rest of the scallions and the garlic. Dice the celery and the bell peppers. Cut sausage and chicken into bite sized pieces. In a large heavy pot over medium heat, cook the sausage until brown (about 5 minutes); transfer to a bowl. Add the chicken to the pot and sear on all sides (about 3 minutes), transfer to the bowl. Pour off the fat, except for about 1 Tbsp worth. Add the celery, the white part of the scallions, the garlic and the bell peppers. Saute for about 5 minutes. Add the chicken stock, the chicken, sausage, rice and Cajun seasoning. Bring to a boil, stir, reduce heat to a simmer, cover and cook for 30 minutes. Check tenderness of the rice. If it is still too crunchy, cook a little longer (adding more stock if needed).
