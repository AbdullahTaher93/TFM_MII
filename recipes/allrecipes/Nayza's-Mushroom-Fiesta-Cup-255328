Mix corn, cilantro, lime juice, jalapeno, 2 tablespoons cumin, 1 tablespoon onion powder, 1 tablespoon oregano, chopped garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon Himalayan salt together in a bowl until salsa is well mixed. Mix olive oil and liquid smoke together in a separate bowl; rub onto mushrooms. Season mushrooms with 2 teaspoons cumin, 2 teaspoons oregano, 2 teaspoons garlic powder, 2 teaspoons onion powder, 1 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon sea salt. Place seasoned mushrooms onto a grill pan with the flat side down. (A grill pan for a countertop induction oven can also be used.) Place grill pan in the oven and heat oven to 445 degrees F (230 degrees C). (Or turn on a countertop induction oven to Combo 1.) Cook in the oven until tender, 9 to 10 minutes. Mix refried beans, 1 tablespoon cumin, 1 tablespoon oregano, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, 1 tablespoon onion powder, 1 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove grill pan from oven and spoon bean mixture into mushrooms; top with Cheddar cheese. Return grill pan with mushrooms to oven. Set oven to broil and cook mushrooms until cheese is melted, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Spoon salsa over mushrooms and top with avocado and tomatoes.
