Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the butter, cream cheese, egg, sugar, orange peel, and orange extract for 3 minutes, or until light. The mixture will appear curdled. Beat in the flour mixture, a little at a time, until well-blended. Drop by teaspoonfuls about 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake for 10 minutes, or until the edges are golden. Remove, with the paper, to a rack. Let cool for 10 minutes and peel off the paper.
