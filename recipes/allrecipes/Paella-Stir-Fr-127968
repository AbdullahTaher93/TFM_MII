Prepare yellow rice according to package directions, but omit butter and oil; use only 1/4 cups water (the rice should be slightly al dente when cooked). Remove pan from heat and stir in the frozen peas; cover and set aside. Meanwhile, heat 2 teaspoons oil in a wok (or 12-inch nonstick skillet) over medium-high heat. Stir-fry sausage until browned. Transfer to a plate. Add onion, bell pepper, garlic, and remaining oil to wok; stir-fry until onions are soft, about 3 minutes. Add paprika and stir-fry 1 minute. Return sausage to skillet along with tomatoes and shrimp. Stir-fry until shrimp are just cooked through and pink, about 2 minutes. Add rice and peas to wok and cook, stirring, until ingredients are combined. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Top with parsley and serve.
