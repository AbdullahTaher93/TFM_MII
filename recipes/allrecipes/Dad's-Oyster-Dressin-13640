Cook rice in boiling salted water till tender, about 40 minutes. Drain, and place in shallow pan. Place pan in a 275 degree F(135 degree C) oven to dry out for a few minutes. Saute pork in skillet over medium heat. Remove pork from pan using a slotted spoon. Drain off all but a couple of tablespoons grease. Saute onions and celery. Add into this a small amount of oyster water from the can if onions and celery get too dry. Add in oysters with remaining liqueur. Cook 7 - 10 minutes, until oysters curl on edges. Drain this mixture in a colander. Combine oyster mixture, rice, sausage, chopped parsley, and seasonings to taste. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) till heated through.
