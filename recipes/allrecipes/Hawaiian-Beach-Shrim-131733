In a large bowl, or large zip-top bag, mix together the sugar, lemon pepper, parsley, garlic, oyster sauce, and mayonnaise. Add the shrimp, and toss well to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour to overnight. Preheat a grill for medium-high heat. Soak skewers in water. Thread shrimp onto skewers, and grill until they are pink and firm, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
