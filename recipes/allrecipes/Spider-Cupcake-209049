Prepare the cake mix according to the package instructions. Fold in the chopped SNICKERS Bars or MILKY WAY Bars into the batter, before transferring it to the paper-lined cupcake pans. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F for 18 to 21 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack, and cool completely. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the chocolate frosting in a re-sealable plastic bag. Spread the tops of the cupcakes with the remaining frosting. Then coat the tops with the chocolate sprinkles. Cut the marshmallows in half crosswise. Using the reserved frosting, attach two marshmallow pieces to each cupcake as eyes. Dot the center of each marshmallow piece with frosting, and attach M&M'S. Then, attach another marshmallow piece with frosting, and attach M&M'S for the mouth. Cut each licorice lace into four equal pieces. Press 4 holes into 2 sides of each cupcake using the toothpick. Insert a licorice piece into each hole for each spider's legs, 8 pieces per cupcake.
