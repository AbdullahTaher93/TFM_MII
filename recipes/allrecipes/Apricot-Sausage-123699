In a medium skillet, brown sausages on all sides. Add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook for 10 minutes. Drain. Add juice and preserves. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 30 minutes, turning sausages occasionally. Serve with a slotted spoon. Garnish with orange slices if desired.
