Bring Herman Starter to room temperature. Stir together flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Stir flour mixture and oil into Herman Starter. It will form a soft dough. On a lightly floured surface knead dough until smooth. Pinch off small pieces of dough and shape into balls OR roll dough out and cut with a biscuit cutter. Place biscuits onto a greased baking sheet, cover and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake in biscuits in the preheat oven for about 30 minutes or until golden. Serve warm.
