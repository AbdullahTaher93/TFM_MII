Boil 1/2 cup water, and pour into a bowl. Mix in soy chunks. Blend in peanut butter, cream of coconut, chile, green onion, and cilantro. Keep warm while the quinoa cooks. Bring quinoa and remaining 1 cup water to a boil in a pot. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 15 minutes, until quinoa is fluffy. Stir in the soy chunks and peanut butter sauce, and season with salt and pepper to serve.
