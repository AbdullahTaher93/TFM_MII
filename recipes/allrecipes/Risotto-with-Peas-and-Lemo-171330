Pour broth into a 1-quart glass measure. Microwave, uncovered, on full power (100%) for 6 to 8 minutes or until beginning to boil. Meanwhile, melt butter in a 2- to 3-quart pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until soft (about 4 minutes). Add rice and stir until opaque and well coated with butter (2 to 3 minutes). Stir in lemon peel and lemon juice. Add 1/2 cup of the hot broth and cook, stirring, until absorbed. Continue to cook, adding remaining broth 1/2 cup at a time, until rice is just tender to bite but not starchy tasting (about 20 more minutes); after each addition, stir constantly until broth is absorbed. Stir in peas. Remove from heat and stir in cheese; let stand, uncovered, for 2 minutes, then spoon into warm wide bowls or deep plates.
