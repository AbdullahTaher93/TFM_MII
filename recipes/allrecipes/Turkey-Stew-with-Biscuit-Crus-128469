Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (215 degrees C). Coat a 2-quart (30 x 19-cm) baking dish with cooking spray. Set aside. To make the biscuits: In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Using a pastry blender, cut in the butter until the mixture forms crumbs. Add the buttermilk and sour cream. Mix and gather into a ball. Turn onto a sheet of plastic wrap and flatten into a round. Wrap and refrigerate. To make the stew: Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. In a medium bowl, combine the cornstarch, thyme, and sage. Whisk in the broth. Add to the onion mixture. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring, for 1 minute or until thickened. Remove from the heat. Add the peas, carrots, cauliflower, turkey, and pepper. Place in the prepared baking dish. Cut the biscuit dough into 4 equal parts. Arrange on the turkey mixture. Bake for 30 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden and the stew is bubbling.
