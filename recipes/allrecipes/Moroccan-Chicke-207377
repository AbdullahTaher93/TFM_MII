Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and brown on one side. Turn and add the onion; continue cooking until the onion and chicken are browned. Drain the excess fat. Stir in the tomatoes, juice, dried plums, allspice, salt and pepper, to taste. Cover and cook 5 minutes over medium heat. Uncover and simmer about 10 minutes, until the sauce thickens and the chicken is done; turning the chicken and stirring the sauce occasionally. Meanwhile combine the boiling water and the tabbouleh. Cover and rest for 5 minutes. Add the parsley to the tabbouleh, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve the chicken and sauce on a bed of the tabbouleh.
