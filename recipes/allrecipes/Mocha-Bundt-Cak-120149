In a microwave, melt butter and chocolate; stir until smooth. Transfer to a large mixing bowl. Beat in sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the coffee and extracts. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; gradually add to the chocolate mixture. Pour into a greased and floured 10-in. fluted tube pan. Bake at 325 degrees F for 55-65 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar. Serve with whipped cream if desired.
