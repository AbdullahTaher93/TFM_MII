Preheat the broiler in your oven. Cook the peppers and onions in a large saute pan with oil over MEDIUM-HIGH heat until wilted and starting to brown, about 8 minutes. If using mushrooms, add them now and cook for an additional 4 minutes. Remove from pan. Add the beef and cook until cooked through, about 4 minutes. Add the vegetables to the pan and mix. Season with salt and pepper. Spread butter on the rolls and toast under the broiler. Add the meat and vegetable mix to the rolls, top with the cheese and broil for 30 seconds to melt the cheese.
