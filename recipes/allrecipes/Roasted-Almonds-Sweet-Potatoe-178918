Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, combine all ingredients except the sliced almonds and toss. Arrange potato slices into a single layer on a heavyweight rimmed baking sheet or in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place on the top rack of the oven and roast until tender and slightly browned, about 40 minutes. Stir together sweet potatoes and roasted almonds in a serving bowl and garnish with thyme sprigs. Serve warm.
