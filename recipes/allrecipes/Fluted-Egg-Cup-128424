Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). With a rolling pin, slightly flatten the bread slices. Using a 3-inch (7-cm) round cookie cutter, cut 12 bread circles. Coat a 12-cup min-muffin pan with nonstick spray and line each cup with a bread round. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the edges are golden. Warm the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the scallions, basil, and parsley; cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the scallions are softened. Add the egg whites. Season with the salt and pepper. Cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until almost set. Add the Cheddar and cook until the cheese has melted and the eggs are set. Preheat the broiler. Spoon 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of the egg mixture into each bread cup and top evenly with the Parmesan and paprika. Broil 4 inches (11 cm) from the heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until hot and lightly browned.
