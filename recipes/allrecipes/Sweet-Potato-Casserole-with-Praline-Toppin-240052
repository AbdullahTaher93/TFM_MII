Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 2-quart casserole dish with cooking spray. Mix flour, brown sugar, pecans, margarine, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Put potatoes into a Dutch oven with enough water to cover by a few inches; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Drain water from potatoes and put potatoes into a large bowl. Mash sweet potatoes with a potato masher. Stir evaporated milk, white sugar, egg, and vanilla extract with the mashed sweet potato until smooth; add about 2/3 of the praline topping, stir, and spread the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Top with remaining praline topping. Bake in preheated oven until browning around the edges, about 45 minutes.
