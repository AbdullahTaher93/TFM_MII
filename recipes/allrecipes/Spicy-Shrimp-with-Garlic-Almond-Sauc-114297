Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the garlic, jalapenos and tomato halves on a rimmed baking sheet and bake for about 30 minutes, or until the garlic is golden brown and just tender. Spread the almonds in a pie plate and bake for 7 minutes, or until golden brown. Let the almonds cool and coarsely chop them. In a food processor, coarsely puree the garlic with the jalapenos, tomato and almonds. With the machine on, gradually add 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, and then the vinegar. Scrape the sauce into a bowl and season with salt, black pepper and cayenne. In a large skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper and toss with the ancho chile powder. Add the shrimp to the skillet and cook over moderately high heat until barely white throughout, about 1 minute per side. Add the wine and simmer, shaking the skillet, until the shrimp are cooked, about 30 seconds longer. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the shrimp to a platter. Simmer the pan juices until thickened, about 30 seconds, then pour them over the shrimp and toss to coat. Serve the shrimp with the garlic-almond sauce.
