Cut ribs into serving-size pieces; place with bone side down on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Cover and bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour or until ribs are tender; drain. Combine remaining ingredients; brush some of the sauce over ribs. Grill over medium heat, uncovered, for 30 minutes, brushing occasionally with sauce.
