Preheat the oven broiler. Arrange lamb meat on a medium baking sheet, and broil 8 to 12 minutes, turning once, to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove from heat, and cool. In a large bowl, toss cooked lamb with romaine lettuce, garbanzo beans, red onion, and Caesar salad dressing. Top with feta cheese.
