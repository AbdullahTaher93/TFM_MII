In a food processor, puree the peppers and garlic with the lemon juice. Add the cream cheese and sour cream. Mix until smooth, scrapping down the side occasionally. Add salt & pepper to taste. Transfer to a serving bowl. Consider a fresh green herb garnish such as cilantro, basil, chives or flat parsley.
