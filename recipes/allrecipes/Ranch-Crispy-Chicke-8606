Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine dressing mix and bread crumbs in a plastic bag. Add chicken and shake until coated. Place coated chicken pieces on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Serve with rice or potatoes, if desired.
