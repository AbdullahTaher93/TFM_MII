Heat wine, broth and most of the cream (reserve a little) in a medium saucepan over medium low heat. Thicken flour with reserved cream, enough to make a thin paste. Add this to saucepan, stirring constantly until sauce has thickened. Stir in mushrooms and onions. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F(165 degrees C). Place chicken in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour sauce over chicken and top with almonds. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours.
