In a large bowl, mix together the ground turkey, ginger, salt, sage, cayenne pepper, and black pepper until well blended. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat, and coat with nonstick cooking spray. Form the turkey sausage into patties, and fry until browned on both sides, and no longer pink in the center. This should take about 15 minutes.
