Place Canadian bacon in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish; top with Swiss cheese. Carefully bread an egg over each piece of cheese. Pour cream over eggs and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until eggs reach desired doneness. Let stand for 5 minutes. Cut between each egg; serve on toast if desired.
