Combine oil and nuts in a medium bowl; set aside. In a small saucepan, melt SMUCKER'S(R) jelly over medium heat. Add paprika and cumin. Cook the mixture to the hard ball stage, 260 degrees F measured on a candy thermometer (or you can test for the hard ball stage by dropping a teaspoon of the mixture into a glass of iced water; the mixture will harden instantly if it has reached the proper temperature). Immediately pour the mixture over the nuts. Stir with a wooden spoon to evenly coat the nut mixture. Cool for five minutes. Combine brown sugar, paprika and cumin in a small bowl. Once cool enough to handle, sprinkle nuts with the brown sugar mixture. Stir to combine. Let cool completely, then pack into decorative, airtight tins.
