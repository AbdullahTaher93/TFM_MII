In medium saucepan, combine sweetened condensed milk, egg yolks, lemon juice, lemon peel (optional) and food coloring (optional). Over medium heat, cook and stir until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Chill. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare and bake cake mix as package directs. Pour batter into two well-greased and floured 9-inch round layer cake pans. Bake 30 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from pans; cool thoroughly. With sharp knife, remove crust from top of each cake layer. Split layers. Spread equal portions of lemon mixture between layers and on top to within 1 inch of edge. Frost side and 1-inch rim on top of cake with whipped topping. Coat side of cake with coconut; garnish as desired. Store leftovers covered in refrigerator.
