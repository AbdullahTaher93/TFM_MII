In a 2-qt. microwave-safe bowl, combine sugar, corn syrup and salt. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 4 minutes. Stir. Microwave 3 minutes longer. Stir in butter and pistachios. Microwave on high for 30-60 seconds or until mixture turns a light amber (it will be very hot). Quickly stir in baking soda and vanilla until light and foamy. Immediately pour onto a greased baking sheet and spread out. Refrigerate for 20 minutes or until firm; break into small pieces. Store in an airtight container.
