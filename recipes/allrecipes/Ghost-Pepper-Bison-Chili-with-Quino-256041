Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add bison, onion, and green bell pepper; cook 5 to 7 minutes or until bison is crumbled and no longer pink, stirring occasionally. Drain. Stir broth and quinoa into the saucepan. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 15 minutes or until quinoa is tender. Stir black beans, tomato sauce, undrained tomatoes, corn, and chili seasoning mix into the saucepan; simmer uncovered 15 minutes more, stirring occasionally. Top each serving evenly with avocado, sour cream, and Cheddar cheese.
