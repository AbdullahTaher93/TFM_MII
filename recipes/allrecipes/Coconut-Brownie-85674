Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan. In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt the chocolate and butter together. Remove pan from heat and mix in sugar, eggs, vanilla, and BACARDI(R) COCO(TM) Rum. Stir in flour, baking powder, salt and 1 cup coconut. Spread in prepared pan and sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup of coconut on top of brownies. Bake 25-30 minutes or until batter starts to pull away from the sides of pan. Cool.
