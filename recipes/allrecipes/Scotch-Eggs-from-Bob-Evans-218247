Preheat oven to 400 F. Mix sausage and asparagus until well blended. Divide into 8 portions. Flatten each piece in your palm and wrap around one egg to cover. Dip into beaten egg, then roll in cornflakes. Repeat for remaining eggs. Bake eggs on a rack set on a baking sheet for 25 to 30 minutes or until sausage is cooked through.
