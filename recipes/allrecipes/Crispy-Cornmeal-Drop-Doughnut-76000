Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal mix, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. In a separate bowl, beat the egg together with the buttermilk. Gradually add the egg mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring with a fork or whisk until only slightly lumpy. Be careful not to overmix. Carefully drop batter by the rounded teaspoonful into hot oil, and fry until golden brown. Drain and cool on a paper towel-lined plate. Roll balls in a small amount of cinnamon mixed with sugar, if desired, or just enjoy plain!
