Preheat oven to 315 degrees F (157 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Stir oats, almonds, cranberries, apricots, walnuts, and raisins together in a bowl. Whisk honey and butter together in a bowl. Drizzle honey mixture over oat mixture; toss to coat. Spread oat mixture in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake granola in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes; cool in pan and break into pieces.
