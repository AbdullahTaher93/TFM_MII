Add bratwurst and potatoes to 4 quarts boiling water. Cook for 10 minutes, and then remove bratwurst. Continue cooking potatoes until tender, about 10 additional minutes. Meanwhile, cook bratwurst in a skillet over medium heat until browned and cooked through, about 6 minutes. Thinly slice bratwurst. In a large serving bowl, combine vinegar, oil, onion, cucumber, chives, mustard, garlic, salt, pepper and hot sauce. Gently stir in potatoes and bratwurst. Serve warm or cold. Refrigerate leftovers.
