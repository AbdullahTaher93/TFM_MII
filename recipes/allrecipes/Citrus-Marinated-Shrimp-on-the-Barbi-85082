Combine orange juice, olive oil, coriander, cumin, garlic, cilantro and salt in a self-closing plastic bag or glass bowl. Add shrimp and toss to coat. Refrigerate 30 minutes, or longer for stronger flavor. Skewer the shrimp alternately with the vegetables. Grill kabobs 7-8 minutes, turning frequently and basting with marinade, until shrimp are cooked through and vegetables are tender.
