Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cook the beef in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat. Stir in the sauce, tomato and Worcestershire and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes. Spoon the beef mixture into a 1 1/2-quart casserole. Sprinkle with the cheese, if desired. Arrange the biscuits on the beef mixture. Bake for 10 minutes or until the biscuits are golden brown.
