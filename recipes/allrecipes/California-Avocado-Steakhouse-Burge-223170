In a bowl mix together the onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, steak sauce and lean ground beef. Mix very thoroughly with your hands to combine all ingredients. Divide the mixture into equal portions. With your hands press each portion into a ball and then shape into a patty. In a saute pan or on a flat griddle over medium low heat place the patties and grill for about 4 minutes, flip and grill an additional 4 minutes or until meat is thoroughly cooked. While beef and veggie burgers are grilling toast the buns. Top each bun base with the beef and veggie burger, then drizzle each with 1/2 tsp. steak sauce. Top with the lettuce, tomato, Fresh California Avocado and bun top. Optional: serve with Steakhouse Lite Ranch Sauce for dipping.
