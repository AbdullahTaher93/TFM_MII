Combine boiling water and baking soda together in a large bowl. Let cool slightly. Stir flour, buttermilk, bran cereal, bran flakes, walnuts, sugar, oil, butter, eggs, cinnamon, salt, ginger, and nutmeg into water-baking soda mixture until just combined. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate muffin batter for at least 8 hours or overnight. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 60 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups 1/2 full. Bake muffins in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 20 minutes.
