Whisk together the lemon zest and juice, oregano, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the lamb chops, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Set aside to marinate. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Bring the pomegranate juice and port wine to a simmer in a small saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue simmering until the liquid has reduced to half of its original volume, about 45 minutes. Stir in the pomegranate seeds and set aside. Remove the lamb from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Cook the chops on the preheated grill until they start to firm, and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 4 minutes per side for medium rare. Serve the chops drizzled with the pomegranate-port reduction.
