First prepare the salad and pita breads. Combine the salad leaves, red onion, and cucumber in a bowl. Sprinkle the lemon juice over, season with salt and pepper to taste, and toss together. Using a sharp knife, split the pita breads open down one side to make pouches; set the salad and pitas aside. Heat the broiler to high. Heat a wok or heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat until really hot. Add the oil and swirl to coat the wok. Add the lamb, garlic and ginger, and stir-fry until lightly brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the harissa and stir-fry 2 minutes longer. Reduce the heat to very low and keep the lamb warm. Place the pita breads on the rack of the broiler pan and broil until warm, about 1 minute on each side. Meanwhile, increase the heat under the lamb, add the mint or cilantro and toss together. Divide the lamb and salad between the warm pita pouches, and top each with 1 tablespoon yogurt.
