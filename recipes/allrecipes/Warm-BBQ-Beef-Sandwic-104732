Place roast beef and barbecue sauce in a medium skillet. Heat 1 to 2 minutes or until warm, turning meat over once. Combine mayonnaise and horseradish in a small bowl. Spread mayonnaise mixture onto bread slices. Top with barbecue roast beef mixture, coleslaw, onions, and remaining bread slice. Cut in half, if desired and serve.
