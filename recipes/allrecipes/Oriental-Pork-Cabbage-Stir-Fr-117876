In a large nonstick skillet or wok, stir-fry cabbage in 1 teaspoon hot oil for 1-2 minutes. Add carrots; stir-fry 3-4 minutes longer or until carrots are crisp-tender. Remove and keep warm. Stir-fry the pork in remaining oil for 2 minutes. Add ginger and stir-fry for 2 minutes or until pork is lightly browned. Stir in 3/4 cup broth and soy sauce. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 3 minutes or until meat juices run clear. Combine cornstarch and remaining broth until smooth. Gradually stir into pan. Return cabbage and carrots to skillet. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2-3 minutes or until thickened. Serve over rice if desired.
