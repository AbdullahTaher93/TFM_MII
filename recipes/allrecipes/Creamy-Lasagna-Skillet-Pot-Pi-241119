Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Cook and drain pasta as directed on package. Meanwhile, in 11- or 12-inch ovenproof skillet, cook sausage over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until no longer pink; drain. Add pasta, marinara sauce, soup, water and cinnamon; stir until well mixed. Heat to simmering. Separate dough into 8 biscuits. Separate each biscuit into 2 layers. Arrange layers on top of mixture in skillet. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until biscuits are deep golden brown and mixture is bubbly, topping with the Parmesan cheese the last 4 minutes of baking.
