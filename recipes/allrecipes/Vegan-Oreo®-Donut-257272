Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a doughnut pan with cooking spray. Mix flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Stir in water, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract until batter is smooth. Pour batter into the doughnut pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 10 to 12 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack and let cool, about 10 minutes. Combine confectioners' sugar, vegan margarine, shortening, and coconut milk in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until frosting is fluffy and smooth. Spread frosting over donuts; sprinkle cookie crumbs on top.
