Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Finely crush 37 of the wafers. Mix wafer crumbs, coconut, almonds and butter until well blended. Press firmly onto bottom of 13x9-inch baking pan. Bake 8 to 10 min. or until lightly browned; cool. Spread layers of each of the different flavored sherbets over cooled crust, freezing each layer until firm before adding the next layer. Freeze at least 4 hours. Remove from freezer about 10 min. before serving; let stand at room temperature to soften slightly. Cut into 24 squares. Top each with 1 of the remaining 24 wafers just before serving. Store leftover dessert in freezer.
