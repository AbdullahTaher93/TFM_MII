Gently dip zucchini blossoms in beaten egg and shake off the excess. Press into flour; coat with bread crumbs. Place breaded blossoms on a plate; do not stack. Heat olive oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Fry blossoms, working in batches, until both sides are golden brown, about 5 minutes each side. Season with salt and black pepper.
