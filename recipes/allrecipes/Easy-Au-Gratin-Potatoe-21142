Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x12 inch glass or ceramic dish with olive oil. Layer potatoes on the bottom of the dish. Pour 1/3 of the buttermilk over the potatoes and sprinkle with 1/3 of the salt, pepper and cheese. Repeat 2 more times, ending with cheese on top. Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until hot, bubbly and golden brown.
