Combine the broth and water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the leek or onion and garlic. Cook, stirring, for 4 minutes. Add the barley, tarragon, and pepper; stir until the barley is coated. Begin adding the hot broth mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring frequently after each addition and cooking until the liquid is nearly evaporated. Continue adding the broth mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, until all has been added and the barley is very tender and creamy, about 55 minutes. Stir in the peas, cheese, and chives, if using. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until heated through.
