Cook pasta in boiling salted water until al dente. Drain, and rinse in cold water. Transfer noodles to a large bowl. In a separate bowl, mix together sour cream, milk, dill, vinegar, and salt and pepper. Set dressing aside. Mix cucumbers and tomatoes into the pasta. Pour in dressing, and mix thoroughly. Cover, and refrigerate at least 1 hour and preferably overnight. Stir just before serving.
