Combine the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter in a mixing bowl. Mix until evenly moistened. Melt the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch. Stir the melted chocolate into the graham cracker mixture, you may need to use your hands to make sure it is evenly combined. Shape into 1 inch balls and roll them in the coconut. Store in an airtight container.
