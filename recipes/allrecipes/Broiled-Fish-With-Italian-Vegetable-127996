Coat a large no-stick skillet with no-stick spray. Add the oil and warm over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic. Cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the zucchini and cook for 5 minutes. Add the red peppers, olives, capers, basil, parsley. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes, or until the zucchini is soft and the mixture is well-blended. Season with the salt and black pepper. Preheat the broiler. Coat a broiler pan with no-stick spray. Place the fish on the pan and sprinkle with the lemon juice. Broil 4 inches from the heat for 10 minutes per 1-inch thickness of fish, or until the fish flakes easily when tested with a fork (if using firm-fleshed fish, turn the fish over halfway through the cooking time). Serve with the vegetable mixture spooned over the top.
