Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a large frying pan over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook 2 minutes longer. Stir in 1 teaspoon. salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and broccoli; cook until heated through. Remove from heat; let cool. In a medium bowl, combine ricotta, Parmesan, egg, and 1 teaspoon. salt. Add broccoli mixture and stir to combine. Divide each tube of pizza dough into 2 pieces. On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece of dough into an 8-in. round. Divide broccoli-cheese mixture evenly among 4 rounds of dough. Gently pull half of dough over filling to make a half-moon shape. Fold bottom edge over top edge and pinch firmly to seal. Brush calzone tops lightly with olive oil, and sprinkle with remaining salt. Transfer to a large, foil-lined baking sheet. Bake calzones until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve with warm marinara sauce for dipping.
