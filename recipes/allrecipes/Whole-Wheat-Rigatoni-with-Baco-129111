Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Salt the water, add the pasta and cook until al dente. Drain, reserving a ladle of the pasta cooking water. While the pasta cooks, heat a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Add the EVOO, 3 turns of the pan, and the bacon and cook until the bacon renders fat and crisps at the edges. Add the bay leaves and onion and season with a little salt and a healthy dose of pepper. Cook until the onion is tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the broth and cook until reduced by half, about 1 minute. Stir in the tomatoes, bring to a boil, then simmer to let the flavors combine. Add the reserved pasta cooking water, the pasta and parsley to the sauce and toss. Transfer the rigatoni to a serving platter, discard the bay leaves and pass grated cheese around the table.
