In heavy saucepan, over low heat, melt chocolate with EAGLE BRAND(R) and salt. Remove from heat; stir in vanilla and nuts. Spread evenly into wax paper lined 8- or 9-inch square pan. Chill 2 hours or until firm. Turn fudge onto cutting board, peel off paper and cut into squares. Store leftovers tightly covered at room temperature.
