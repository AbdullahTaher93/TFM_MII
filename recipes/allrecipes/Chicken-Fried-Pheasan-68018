In a shallow bowl, mix the milk and vinegar. Dip the pheasant slices in the milk and vinegar mixture, then press both side in the cracker crumbs to coat. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the pheasant in the hot oil about 5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
