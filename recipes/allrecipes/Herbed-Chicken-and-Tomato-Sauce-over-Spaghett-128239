Heat oil in a skillet, then saute chicken, garlic, basil, thyme, fennel seeds, black pepper, and red pepper flakes until chicken is golden and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in crushed tomatoes and tomato paste. Bring to a boil, stirring to loosen browned bits in bottom of pan. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring often, until sauce has thickened slightly, about 10 minutes. Stir in basil. Pour sauce over hot spaghetti and top with ricotta.
