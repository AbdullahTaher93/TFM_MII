In a small bowl, combine onions, celery, green pepper and olives. In another bowl, whisk together oil, vinegar, mustard, salt and pepper. Pour over vegetables and refrigerate several hours or overnight. Just before serving, place lettuce in a large salad bowl; add the cheese and dressing with vegetables. Toss lightly.
