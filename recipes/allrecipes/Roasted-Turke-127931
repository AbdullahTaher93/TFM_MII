Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Rinse the turkey and pat dry, then place on a rack in a roasting pan. Cut the orange in half and squeeze juice all over the turkey. Place the squeezed halves in the turkey's cavity. Rub the turkey with the butter, then sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Tie the legs together with kitchen string. Roast the turkey breast side up on the second-from-lowest rack in the oven, until a thermometer stuck in thickest part of the turkey's thigh reads 165 degrees F. The turkey will turn a burnished mahogany. If it browns too fast, cover loosely with foil. Start checking for doneness after 2 1/2 hours.
