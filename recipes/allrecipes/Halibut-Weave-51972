Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place halibut in a baking dish. In a medium bowl, mix together mayonnaise, shredded Cheddar cheese, shredded Jack cheese, dill, and mustard. Spread cheese mixture over halibut. Sprinkle more dill on top if you like. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until fish is done, and cheese is golden brown and bubbly.
