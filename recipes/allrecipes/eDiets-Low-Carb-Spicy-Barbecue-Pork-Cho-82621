Rinse and pat dry the pork chop. Blend the barbecue sauce, chili powder, hot sauce and vinegar in a shallow dish. Coat the pork and marinate for about 30 minutes in the refrigerator. Heat a nonstick skillet to medium high heat, drain the pork, but reserve the marinade; brown both sides for about 3 minutes each. Add the marinade, bring to a boil, reduce heat; cover and cook for about 3-4 minutes more until the pork is cooked through. Serve immediately.
