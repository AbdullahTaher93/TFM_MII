Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Mix spinach, cottage cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella, peppers, egg white and oregano until well blended; spoon into shells, adding about 1 heaping Tbsp. to each shell. Spread half the sauce onto bottom of 13x9-inch baking dish. Arrange shells, filled-sides up, in baking dish; top with remaining sauce and mozzarella. Cover with foil. Bake 40 min. or until heated through, removing foil after 30 min.
