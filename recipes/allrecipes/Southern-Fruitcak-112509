Grease and flour two 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Line the bottoms with waxed paper; grease and flour the paper. Set aside. Combine the pecans, pineapple, peaches, raisins and 1/2 cup flour; set aside. In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar; add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add 1/2 cup peach nectar, honey and milk; beat well (mixture will appear curdled). Combine cinnamon, baking powder, salt, allspice and remaining flour; add to the creamed mixture and mix well. Add pecan mixture; stir well. Pour into prepared pans. Bake at 325 for 1-1/2 hours or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes. With a skewer, poke holes in the loaves. Spoon remaining nectar over loaves. Let stand for 10 minutes; remove from pans to a wire rack to cool completely. Wrap tightly and store in a cool place. Slice and bring to room temperature before serving.
