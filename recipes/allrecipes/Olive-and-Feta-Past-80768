Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and saute the garlic 2 minutes. Mix in mushrooms and zucchini. Season with oregano, salt, and pepper. Stir in olives, and cook until heated through. Place pasta in the skillet, toss to coat, and continue cooking about 2 minutes. Top with feta cheese to serve.
