Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Refrigerate quinoa in a large bowl until cool, about 30 minutes. Stir feta cheese, cucumber, tomato, lemon juice, vinegar, olive oil, dill weed, salt, and black pepper into quinoa.
