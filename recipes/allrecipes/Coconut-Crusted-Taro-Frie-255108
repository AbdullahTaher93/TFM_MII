Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix coconut milk, coconut oil, and salt together in a bowl. Add taro root and toss until coated. Place coated taro root onto a baking sheet. Sprinkle with coconut flakes; mix well with your hands. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes; flip and continue baking until coconut is golden and crispy, about 15 minutes.
