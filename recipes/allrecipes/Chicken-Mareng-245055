Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Season chicken with paprika, black pepper, and salt to taste. Cook chicken in hot oil until browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate, reserving oil in the skillet. Drain mushroom liquid into the same skillet; add onion, green bell pepper, and garlic. Cover skillet and cook for 5 minutes. Mix chicken, tomatoes, white wine, 3/4 teaspoon salt, marjoram, and bay leaf into onion mixture; simmer over low heat until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 40 minutes. Remove bay leaf and garlic. Serve chicken over rice.
