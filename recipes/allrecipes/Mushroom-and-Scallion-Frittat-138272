Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Heat olive oil in a medium ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add scallions, mushrooms, and 1/2 teaspoon salt; cover, and cook until the vegetables are very soft, about 15 minutes. (The vegetables start out piled high, but they cook down quickly.) In a large bowl, whisk together eggs and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Pour egg mixture over the vegetables, stir for 2 minutes, then cook for 3 to 4 minutes more. Sprinkle cheese over the frittata, and bake in the oven for 15 minutes.
