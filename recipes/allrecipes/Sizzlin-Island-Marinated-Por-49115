Place pork chops in a large self-closing plastic bag or shallow dish. Combine remaining ingredients in a blender until smooth. Reserve 3/4 cup marinade. Pour remaining marinade over pork chops, turning to coat well. Marinate in refrigerator 30 minutes. Remove pork chops from marinade. Grill over medium direct heat for 20 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F; turn pork chops every 5 minutes. Heat reserved marinade in a small saucepan over low heat. Serve pork chops with additional sauce if desired.
