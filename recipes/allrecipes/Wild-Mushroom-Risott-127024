In a medium-size heavy saucepan, heat the peanut oil. Over medium-high heat, saute the onion and garlic just to soften, stirring constantly, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the rice and continue to stir, using a wooden spoon, coating the rice with the oil and onion. Deglaze with the white wine and cook until the liquid is absorbed, stirring often. Pour in enough hot vegetable or chicken stock to cover, about 3 cups, and cook, stirring often, until the liquid is absorbed. Meanwhile, in a medium skillet, heat the olive oil. If the mushrooms are large, cut them into bite-size pieces and saute over medium-high heat just to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour 3 cups of hot vegetable or chicken stock into the rice, turn the flame to high, and stir in the tomatoes. Stir until almost al dente. Stir in the mushrooms and the remaining 1 cup stock, as necessary. Remember, the risotto should be creamy, not runny. Remove from the flame and vigorously beat in the chilled butter and the Parmesan cheese until completely dissolved. Stir in the parsley, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
