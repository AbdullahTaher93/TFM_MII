Mix tuna, 1/4 cup mayonnaise, and Dijon mustard together in a small bowl. Stir in pickle and red onion. Spread tuna mixture on 2 slices of bread. Top each with 2 slices of Cheddar cheese. Spread 1 tablespoon cream cheese on each of the remaining 2 slices of bread. Place on top of the Cheddar cheese. Place crushed chips in a shallow bowl. Spread top side of each tuna melt with 1 1/2 teaspoon mayonnaise and press into the chips. Repeat on other side. Heat a dry grill pan over medium-high heat. Toast tuna melts until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.
