If necessary pound cutlets to 1/4-inch thickness; season with salt and pepper. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in large nonstick skillet; add pork and saute, 3-4 minutes on each side until cooked through. Remove cutlets to plate, cover with foil to keep warm. Heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil, add orange slices, rosemary and 2 tablespoons water. Cover and cook 2-3 minutes, until orange is tender. Add jam and a tablespoon of water, cook over medium heat, stirring, until sauce is of desired consistency. Pour sauce over cutlets, garnish with slivered orange peel if desired, and serve.
