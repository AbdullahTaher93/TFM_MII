Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef and Italian sausage; cook, stirring to crumble, until no longer pink. Drain off grease. Stir in the pizza sauce. Make a layer of hamburger bun halves in the bottom of a 9 inch square baking dish. Top with half of the meat sauce and half of the cheese. Arrange half of the pepperoni slices on top of the layer. Repeat the layers, ending up with cheese and pepperoni on top. Bake uncovered for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the cheese is starting to brown.
