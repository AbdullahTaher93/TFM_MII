Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Heat olive oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Saute onion and bell pepper until onion is soft and translucent. Add Italian seasoning and kalamata olives. Stir in lemon juice, and cook 10 minutes, or until liquid is reduced. Stir in salmon, sour cream, yogurt and blue cheese. Toss with cooked pasta until evenly coated.
