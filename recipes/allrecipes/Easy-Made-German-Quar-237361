Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Line a colander with cheese cloth and place over a large pot in the sink. Gently mix buttermilk and cream together in a 2-quart ceramic casserole dish. Cook in the preheated oven for 2 hours and 15 minutes. Pour buttermilk mixture into the prepared colander; drain for 45 to 60 minutes. Transfer drained cheese to a bowl and beat with an electric hand mixer until smooth and creamy. Store in the refrigerator.
