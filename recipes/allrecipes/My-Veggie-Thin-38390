Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute the onions, green onion, and garlic until tender. Mix in the bouillon cubes and soy sauce until the cubes are dissolved. Stir in the tomato, peppers, mushrooms, broccoli, and cooked rice. Cook, stirring constantly until the broccoli is cooked through. Season with salt and pepper before serving.
