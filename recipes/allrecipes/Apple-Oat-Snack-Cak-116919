In a bowl, combine boiling water and oats; set aside. In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. In a mixing bowl, combine the sugars and applesauce; beat well. Add the egg, vanilla and oat mixture; mix well. Stir into dry ingredients just until combined. Fold in apple. Pour into an 8-in. square baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. For the topping, combine the oats, flour, brown sugar and cinnamon. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; sprinkle over batter. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
