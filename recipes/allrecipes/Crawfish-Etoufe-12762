In a heavy saucepan, melt butter or margarine over medium heat.. Add celery, bell pepper, and onion; saute for about 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Stir in condensed soups and canned tomatoes. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes. The mixture will look very thick and curdled at first, but will become smooth with cooking. Do not add water. Add the crawfish; cook for about five minutes more. Serve.
