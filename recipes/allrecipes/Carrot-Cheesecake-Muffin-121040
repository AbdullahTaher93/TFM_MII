In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar and orange peel until smooth; set aside. In another mixing bowl, cream butter and brown sugar. Add eggs, milk and orange juice. Fold in the carrots, raisins and walnuts. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and cinnamon; stir into creamed mixture just until moistened. Fill greased muffin cups with 2 tablespoons batter. Top each with 2 teaspoons filling; top with remaining batter. Bake at 350 degrees F for 23-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Store in the refrigerator.
