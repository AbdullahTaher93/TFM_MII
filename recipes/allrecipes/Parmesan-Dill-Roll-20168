Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. In a small saucepan, heat butter, milk, water and salt over medium-high heat. When butter has melted, pour mixture into a large bowl. Add flour and stir well. Mix in eggs, dill and Parmesan cheese. Stir until a loose batter is formed. Drop large spoonfuls of batter onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until golden, about 18 to 20 minutes.
