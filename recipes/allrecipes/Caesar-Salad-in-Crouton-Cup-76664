Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 12-muffin tin with CRISCO(R) Butter Flavor No-stick Cooking Spray. Trim crusts off bread; spray both sides of bread with CRISCO(R) Butter Flavor No-stick Cooking Spray. In a small bowl, mix together the garlic powder, thyme, rosemary and cracked black pepper. Lightly sprinkle mixture over both sides of bread. Use a rolling pin to slightly flatten bread and embed the spice mixture. Press each slice into a muffin cup, allowing edges to hang over cup. Bake for 12 -15 minutes or until golden brown and crisp. Remove from oven and cool. Toss lettuce and green onions with dressing. Spoon salad into Crouton Cups. Garnish with shredded Parmesan and green onion slices. Serve immediately.
