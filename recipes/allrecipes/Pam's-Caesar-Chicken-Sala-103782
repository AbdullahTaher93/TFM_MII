In a small bowl, stir together the pressed garlic, mayonnaise, anchovies, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, lemon juice and half of the Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the quartered garlic cloves; cook and stir until golden and fragrant. Add the bread cubes to the skillet and stir to coat with the oil. Transfer to a baking sheet and place in the preheated oven. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring frequently, until toasted and golden brown in color. Set aside to cool. In a large bowl, toss the romaine lettuce with the dressing and croutons. Stir in the remaining Parmesan cheese and chicken strips. Season with additional ground black pepper and serve immediately.
