Blend 1 cup olive oil, lemon juice, shallot, Dijon mustard, honey, and kosher salt together in a blender until dressing is smooth and creamy. Bring water and chicken bouillon to a boil in a saucepan; add quinoa, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Fluff quinoa with a fork and transfer to a large bowl. Heat remaining olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; saute onion and garlic in hot oil until golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir kale into onion mixture; saute until kale is tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir kale mixture into quinoa. Pour dressing over the top and add pine nuts and avocado; toss to coat. Serve warm or cold.
