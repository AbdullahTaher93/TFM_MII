Heat the cooking oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the ginger, garlic, serrano pepper, and chicken in the hot oil about 5 minutes. Add the curry paste, curry powder, vinegar, fish sauce, sugar, chicken broth, coconut milk, pineapple, and rice; stir. Allow the soup to simmer until it thickens, about 15 minutes more.
