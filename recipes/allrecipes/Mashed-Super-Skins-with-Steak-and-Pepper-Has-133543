Cut the unpeeled potatoes into large chunks. Place the potatoes in a pot and cover with cold water. Cover the pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Uncover the pot, add salt to season and continue cooking the potatoes until they're fork-tender, about 12 to 15 minutes. Place a small saucepan over low heat and add about 1 tablespoon of the oil (eyeball it), the butter, garlic and scallions. Let the mixture melt together and infuse. Cook over low heat for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and let stand. Heat a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Season the steak with salt and pepper, then add a tablespoon of oil (1 turn of the pan). The oil will smoke--don't freak out; just add the meat and start searing it. Brown the strips on all sides, then hit the steak with some Worcestershire sauce. Push the meat off to one side of the skillet and add another tablespoon of the oil, then the peppers and onion. Season the veggies with salt and pepper and toss them until the edges sear, another 1 to 2 minutes. Stir the meat and veggies together. Add the thyme and cook another 2 to 3 minutes, keeping everything moving around like a stir-fry. Turn off the heat and squeeze the juice from the lime wedges over the steak and veggies. Taste and season. Drain the potatoes, then return them to the hot pot to evaporate some of the liquid. Add the reserved garlic and scallion mixture to the potatoes along with the sour cream and start smashing away with a masher. Add 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup of milk to get the potatoes to the desired consistency, then mash in the cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Pile up the mashed super skins in a bowl and top with steak hash. Yum-O!
