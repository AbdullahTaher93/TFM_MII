Season short ribs with sugar and steak seasoning; rub over both sides. Whisk soy sauce, vinegar, maple syrup, 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, sesame oil, ginger, and red pepper flakes together in a small bowl to make marinade. Pour marinade into a large resealable plastic bag. Add short ribs. Seal and let marinate in the refrigerator, 1 to 4 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove short ribs from marinade; discard marinade. Grill short ribs until well-browned, about 3 minutes per side.
