Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Coat a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray. In a large bowl, mix together the potato rounds, tomato, cilantro, black beans, sour cream, shredded cheese, picante sauce, chili powder and cayenne pepper. Spoon about 1/3 cup of the mixture into each tortilla, and roll up. Place filled tortillas seam side down in the prepared baking dish. Spray the tops of the tortilla rolls with cooking spray. Cover the dish with aluminum foil. Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, remove foil, and continue baking for another 15 minutes, or until golden. Let stand for 5 minutes to set before serving.
