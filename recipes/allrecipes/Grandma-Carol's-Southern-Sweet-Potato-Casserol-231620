Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir mashed sweet potatoes, white sugar, 1/2 cup butter, milk, eggs, cinnamon, and vanilla together in a large bowl until smooth; transfer to a casserole dish. Mix brown sugar, pecans, coconut, and 1/2 cup butter in a bowl; spread atop the filling. Bake casserole in preheated oven until topping is golden brown, about 30 minutes.
