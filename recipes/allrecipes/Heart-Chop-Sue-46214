Roll the strips of beef heart in flour to coat. Reserve flour. Melt the butter in a large heavy skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown the beef lightly in the butter. Add the onion, and saute for about 5 minutes, then add celery and just enough beef broth to cover the ingredients in the pan. Cover the pan, and simmer for one hour over low heat. Mix the reserved flour with water to make a paste. Stir into the meat mixture. Season with salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce. Cook until sauce is thickened, then serve hot over rice or noodles.
