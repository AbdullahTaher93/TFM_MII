Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Roll out pastry sheet following package directions on a baking sheet. Place stuffing in center of the pastry sheet about 1 inch thick. Top with gravy, mashed potatoes (our choice for Turkey Day is Idahoan(R) Buttery Homestyle Flavored Mashed), and turkey. CAREFULLY bring the corners of the pastry sheet up and gently tie with kitchen string. Take the corners of the pastry sheet and fold down and brush the entire bag with the egg wash (1 egg mixed thoroughly with 1 Tbsp water). Bake for about 20 minutes or until it's a beautiful golden brown. Serve with a side of the cranberry sauce.
