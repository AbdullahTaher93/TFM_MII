In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook ground beef until brown, drain excess fat. Reduce heat to medium and add tomatoes, chili powder, garlic and cumin. Cook for 2 minutes, blending well. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Fill each tortilla with a layer of refried beans, a sprinkling of green chili peppers, a heaping tablespoon of tomato sauce and a small portion of ground beef. Roll up, burrito-style and place seam side down in a 13x9x2-inch baking dish. When tortillas are filled, sprinkle with Monterey Jack cheese. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly. Serve immediately with shredded lettuce, mashed avocados, sour cream and black olives.
