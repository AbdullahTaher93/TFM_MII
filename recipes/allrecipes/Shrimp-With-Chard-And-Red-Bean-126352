In a medium bowl, combine the garlic, paprika, thyme, black pepper, salt, and red pepper. Remove about half of the mixture to a small bowl. Add the shrimp to the medium bowl and toss to coat well. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large saucepot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the celery, onion, and bell pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, for 6 minutes, or until tender-crisp. Add the reserved spice mixture and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes. Add 1/4 cup of the broth. Cover and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes. Add the chard and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes, or until wilted. Stir in the beans, shrimp, and the remaining 1/2 cup broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 4 minutes, or until the shrimp are opaque.
