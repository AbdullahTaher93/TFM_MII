Heat a large heavy-bottomed pan or wok over high heat; add the oil and wait 1 minute more. Mix garlic into the hot oil and cook until it just turns golden brown, about 1 minute. Add clams and chile paste; stir until clams are coated. Stir fish sauce, chiles, and sugar into clams; cook and stir until the clams have opened, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix basil into clam mixture and cook until wilted, about 1 minute.
