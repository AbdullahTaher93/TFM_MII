Heat oven to 400 degrees F. In blender container or food processor bowl with metal blade, combine basil, thyme, garlic, salt, pepper and oil. Cover; blend until finely chopped, scraping down sides of container, if necessary. Separate dough into 10 biscuits. On ungreased cookie sheets, press or roll each biscuit to a 3-inch circle. Make several indentations with fingers in tops of biscuits. Spread about 1 teaspoon basil mixture evenly over each biscuit. Sprinkle each biscuit evenly with 1 teaspoon pine nuts; press gently. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10 to 12 minutes or until biscuits are golden brown. Serve warm.
