In a small pan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Stir in mustard and sherry; remove from heat, then set aside. Rinse salmon fillets and pat dry. Place on a flat surface, skinned sides down. Brush with some of the butter mixture (reserve remaining butter mixture). Starting at narrowest end, roll up each fillet pinwheel fashion. Cut each roll crosswise into slices about 1 inch thick. Divide pinwheel slices among 4 skewers, piercing pinwheels along their diameter to secure them on the skewers. Brush salmon with some of the remaining butter mixture. Place salmon skewers on an oiled grill 4 to 6 inches above a solid bed of medium coals or over medium heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 4 to 5 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning once with a wide spatula and brushing again with remaining butter mixture, until salmon is opaque but moist-looking in thickest part; cut to test (8 to 10 minutes). While salmon is cooking, blend vinegar, shallot, and oil; season to taste with salt and pepper. Mix dressing lightly with lettuce; arrange on individual plates. Top each plate with a salmon skewer.
