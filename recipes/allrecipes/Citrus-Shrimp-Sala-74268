To make the dressing, whisk dressing ingredients together. Set aside in refrigerator to chill. Using a zester or vegetable peeler, zest one of the oranges. Chop the zest very finely and place it in a large bowl. Using a sharp knife, remove the rest of the peel from the first orange, and all the peel from the remaining oranges. Working over the bowl to catch the juice, carefully cut the segments out of the fruit. Add shrimp, Mann's Stringless Sugar Snap Peas, cucumber, mint and tarragon. With chilled dressing, gently toss ingredients to taste. Cut ends off of Mann's Romaine Hearts. Separate leaves from the hearts and wash well with cold water. Pat dry with paper towels. To serve, arrange romaine leaves on plates. Divide salad evenly among plates. Serve immediately.
