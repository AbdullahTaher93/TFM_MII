In a small saucepan over medium heat, cook and stir almonds and sugar until almonds are coated and lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Spread the almonds on heavy-duty foil to cool; gently bread apart. In a large salad bowl, combine romaine, oranges, celery and onions. Top with almonds. In a jar with tight-fitting lid, combine the dressing ingredients; shake well. Pour over the salad and toss gently.
