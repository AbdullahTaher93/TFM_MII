In a 4- to 5-quart pan, bring about 2 quarts water to a boil over high heat; stir in pasta and cook, uncovered, until just tender to bite (8 to 10 minutes). Or cook pasta according to package directions. 2. Meanwhile, in a wide frying pan, combine prosciutto and oil. Stir over medium-high heat until prosciutto is lightly browned (about 3 minutes). Add onions and stir until soft (about 2 more minutes). Add olives and tomatoes; cook, shaking pan often, until olives are hot (about 2 more minutes). Drain pasta well and return to cooking pan. Pour prosciutto mixture over pasta and toss to mix, using 2 spoons. Pour onto a platter or individual plates; offer cheese to add to taste.
