Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place potatoes, chicken, chourico, beer, carrots, onion, parsley, sofrito, cooking wine, sazon seasoning, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a large Dutch oven; mix well to combine. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) and vegetables are tender, about 2 1/2 hours.
