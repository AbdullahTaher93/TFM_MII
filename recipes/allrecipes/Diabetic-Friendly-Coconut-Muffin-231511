Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 12 muffin cups with cooking spray. Stir flour, sugar, coconut, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl and make a well in the center. Whisk yogurt, egg, egg white, vegetable oil, and coconut extract together in a separate bowl until thoroughly combined. Pour egg mixture into well in dry ingredients and stir just until moistened. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups, filling them 3/4 full. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Remove muffins from pan immediately.
