Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray two 9X5 inch loaf pans with butter-flavored cooking spray. Set aside. Blend yogurt, sour cream, pumpkin, eggs and vegetable oil in a large mixing bowl. Add flour, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, baking powder and pumpkin pie spice. Stir well. Add raisins and walnuts. Stir until just blended. Spread batter into prepared pans. Bake 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool and cut each loaf into eight thick slices.
