In medium saucepan, heat 1 teaspoon oil over medium-high heat. Add shallots and pepper flakes; saute until shallots are softened (about 2-3 minutes). Add in olives, wine and capers; reduce heat and allow to simmer until wine is reduced by half. Stir in pasta sauce and parsley; simmer until heated through. Meanwhile, salt and pepper halibut to taste. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over high heat. Sear halibut on both sides; reduce heat and pour Puttanesca sauce over fish. Continue cooking until fish flakes easily with a fork. Remove fish from pan and serve with sauce.
