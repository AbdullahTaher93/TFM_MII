In a small saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until tender but not browned, about 6 minutes. Stir in the curry powder. Add the wine, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Whisk in 2 tablespoons of peanut butter until smooth. Stir in the coconut milk and simmer until thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove the peanut butter-curry sauce from the heat and stir in the lime juice. Season with salt to taste. Keep warm over low heat. In a small bowl, whisk the remaining 2 tablespoons peanut butter with 3 tablespoons warm water until smooth. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper and brush with the thinned peanut butter. Combine the coconut and kataifi on a baking sheet, roll the shrimp around in the mixture, pressing gently to coat, and refrigerate. In a medium skillet, warm 1 tablespoon oil over high heat. add the bok choy and the tomatoes, season with salt and pepper and cook over high heat until the bok choy is slightly wilted and the skin on the tomatoes begins to pucker, 2 to 3 minutes. Keep warm. In a large nonstick skillet, warm 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat and add the shrimp, frying until the kataifi crust on the bottom is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Using tongs, gently turn each shrimp over; drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon oil around the edge of the skillet. Lower the heat and fry until the crust is golden, about 1 more minute. Spoon the reserved sauce into the center of 4 serving plates. Divide the bok choy mixture among the plates and top each serving with 3 shrimp.
