Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Combine 1 cup flour, cornmeal, undissolved yeast and salt in a large bowl. Add very warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Dough should form a ball and will be slightly sticky. Knead** on a floured surface, adding additional flour if necessary, until smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Cover and let rest on floured surface while preparing toppings. (If using RapidRise Yeast, let dough rest at this point for at least 10 minutes.) Combine chicken, process cheese, diced tomatoes and chiles, 1 cup crushed tortilla chips and 1/3 cup salsa in a medium mixing bowl. Roll dough into 12-inch circle; place in greased pizza pan; sprinkle with additional cornmeal, if desired. OR, pat dough with floured hands, pressing gently to fill greased pizza pan or baking sheet. Form a rim by pinching the edge of the dough; prick surface with fork. Spread chicken mixture evenly over crust. Bake on lowest oven rack 12 to 15 minutes until center is set and crust is golden brown. Top with remaining chips and salsa, lettuce and sour cream.
