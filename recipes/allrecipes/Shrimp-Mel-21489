In a medium saucepan, melt butter and saute onions and shrimp over medium heat until shrimp are pink. Stir in flour and Old Bay seasoning to make a roux. Slowly pour in milk, stirring constantly. Allow to thicken. Stir in celery and cook until celery is soft. Preheat oven on broiler setting. Spoon mixture over toasted English muffins, top each with a slice of tomato and provolone cheese.
