Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Trim stems and remove wilted leaves from Brussels sprouts; rinse under cold water. In a large bowl, combine the water, salt, sugar, and soy sauce, stirring until all of the sugar and salt have dissolved. Add sprouts to the brine mixture (make sure they are submerged). Brine for 1 hour. Drain the Brussels sprouts, do not rinse. Toss the sprouts with olive oil and black pepper. Bake in an uncovered baking dish for 35 to 40 minutes, until crisp on the outside and tender on the inside, or desired doneness.
