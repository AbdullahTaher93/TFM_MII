In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Add the milk, mayonnaise and egg; mix just until combined. Fold in the cheese and onions. Spoon into a greased 9-in. round baking pan. Bake at 425 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Refrigerate any leftovers.
