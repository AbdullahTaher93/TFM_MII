Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in seashell pasta, and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Place green onions and lettuce in a large bowl. Add pasta, tuna, peas, and grated Cheddar cheese; mix well. Stir in dressing; toss to coat.
