Rinse beans and place in a large pot. Cover with water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, until beans are tender, about 1 hour; add more water as necessary to prevent drying out and scorching. When beans are tender, add spaghetti and cook until al dente. Season with salt to taste.
