In a medium bowl, combine apple, onion, bread crumbs, sage and pepper. Add sausage; mix well. Spoon into squash halves; place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Cover and bake at 375 degrees F for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake 10 minutes more or until sausage is no longer pink and squash is tender.
