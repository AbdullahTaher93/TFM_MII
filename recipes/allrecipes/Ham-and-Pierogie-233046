Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan with aluminum foil; spray with cooking spray. Arrange pierogies on the prepared pan; spray pierogies with cooking spray. Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 10 minutes; flip pierogies and continue baking until lightly golden, 9 to 10 more minutes. Melt butter in a large frying pan over medium heat; cook and stir ham, mushrooms, green onions, and garlic in the melted butter until ham and mushrooms are lightly brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir pierogies into ham mixture; cook until flavors have blended, about 5 minutes. Mix mushroom soup, sour cream, and milk together in a bowl; season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Pour soup mixture over ham-pierogie mixture. Cook and stir until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.
