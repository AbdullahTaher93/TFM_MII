Combine coleslaw mix and cilantro in a serving bowl. Whisk olive oil, lime juice, cumin, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a separate bowl until the oil emulsifies; pour over the coleslaw mixture. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours. Garnish with sliced almonds to serve.
