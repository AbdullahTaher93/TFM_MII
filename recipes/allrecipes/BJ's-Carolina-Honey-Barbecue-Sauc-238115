Stir hot water and chicken bouillon granules together in a 2-quart stock pot to dissolve the granules completely; add tomato sauce, vinegar, barbeque sauce, honey, ketchup, brown sugar, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, and mustard. Stir mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the sauce is thickened, about 1 hour.
