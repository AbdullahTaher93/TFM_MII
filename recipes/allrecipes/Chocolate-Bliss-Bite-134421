Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with foil. In small bowl, sift together cocoa, salt, and 1/4 cup of the sugar. In large bowl, with electric mixer at medium-low speed, beat egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Beat in remaining 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 tablespoon at a time, until meringue is glossy and stiff peaks form. Fold in cocoa mixture and vanilla extract. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls about 1-inch apart onto prepared baking sheets. Bake 25 minutes for soft chewy cookies or 40 minutes for crisp ones. Dust cooled cookies with confectioners' sugar.
