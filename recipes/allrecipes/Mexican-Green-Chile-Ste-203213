Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the beef and pork until evenly browned on all sides. Remove the meat using a slotted spoon and place in a bowl, then set aside. Cook and stir the bell pepper and garlic in the same skillet until tender. Remove from heat. Combine the tomatoes, green chiles, parsley, sugar, clove, cumin, and red wine in a large pot, breaking up the tomatoes using a spoon. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Stir in the browned beef and pork along with their juice, then add the cooked green pepper and garlic. Cover and continue to cook over low heat for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Remove lid and allow to simmer until sauce is reduced, about 45 minutes.
