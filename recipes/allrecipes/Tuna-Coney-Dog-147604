Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). In a medium bowl, combine the cheese, eggs, tuna, bell pepper, onion, olives and sweet pickles. Stir in mayonnaise until everything is evenly coated. Spoon generously into the hot dog buns, and wrap each sandwich in aluminum foil. Bake the Coneys in the preheated oven until filling is heated through and cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.
