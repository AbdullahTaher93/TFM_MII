Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly spray two 9-inch cake pans with baking spray. Set aside. Make cake. Sift flour into a large mixing bowl. Add SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, flour, baking powder, baking soda and sugar. Mix with an electric mixer on low speed until ingredients are blended. Add softened butter. Mix on low speed until butter is very finely distributed (approx. 2-3 minutes). Add egg whites. Mix on low speed until incorporated. Scrape sides of bowl. Mix on medium-high speed 1-2 minutes or until batter is light and well blended. Scrape sides of bowl. Add buttermilk and extracts. Mix on medium speed until blended. Pour cake batter into prepared pans. Bake in preheated 350 degrees F oven for 20-25 minutes or until edges of cake appear slightly dry. Allow cake to cool in pans for10-15 minutes. Remove from pans and cool on wire racks until ready to ice. Prepare Icing: Beat softened butter and SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener briefly in a medium mixing bowl, until SPLENDA(R) is just incorporated. Add cream cheese. Mix until lump free, approx. 1 min. Scrape sides of bowl and add vanilla. Mix well. Assemble cake. Slice cooled cake layers in half. Using a serrated knife slice cakes in half horizontally, to create 4 cake layers. Place 1 cake layer on cake stand or plate. Spread 1/3 of the preserves over the cake layer. Top with 1/3 of the strawberries. Repeat process until all layers are assembled.* Ice cake.*Decorating Tip: Professionals create flat cake tops by using the bottom layer of a cake for the top tier. This creates a nice flat surface for icing. The remaining cake bottom can be used as the first layer of the cake and the remaining 2 cake layers can be placed in the middle (top side down).
