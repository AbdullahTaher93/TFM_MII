Cook the pasta according to the package directions. In a medium bowl, mix flour and salt with just enough milk to form a paste. Slowly add the remaining milk, stirring it as you do and making sure to remove any lumps. Place a medium, nonstick saucepan over medium heat. Pour milk into the saucepan. Add cheese and continue to stir mixture with a wooden spoon until cheese is completely melted and mixture thickens. When mixture is smooth, stir in cooked elbows until well incorporated. Serve immediately.
