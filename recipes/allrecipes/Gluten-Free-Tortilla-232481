Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Cut shortening into flour mixture until mixture resembles corn meal. Stir in hot water, 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time, until mixture forms into a ball. Knead dough until evenly combined. Cut dough into 8 pieces; roll each piece into a ball. Press each ball into a flat tortilla-shape. Heat a griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook each tortilla in the hot griddle until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side.
