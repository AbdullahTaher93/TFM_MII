Combine peanut butter, graham cracker crumbs, and confectioners' sugar in a bowl or a food processor until smooth. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Roll teaspoonfuls of peanut butter mixture into balls. Refrigerate until ready to dip in melted chocolate. Melt chocolate chips and shortening together in the top of a double boiler until very liquid. Using a fork or a skewer, dip each ball into chocolate leaving just the very top of the ball exposed. Set on a greased cookie sheet, setting each ball on the peanut butter end. Refrigerate until the chocolate is firm.
