Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place chicken in a 9x13 inch baking dish and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover each chicken breast with a slice of cheese. In a medium bowl mix together the soup, sherry and sour cream, and pour mixture over chicken. Soften dill in melted butter; toss croutons in butter, and sprinkle them on top of chicken. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through.
