In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. In another bowl, combine eggs, oil, strawberries and food coloring if desired. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. For filling, beat cream cheese. Add the egg, sugar, flour and extract; beat well. Spoon a fourth of the batter into two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Spread half of the filling over each. Top with the remaining batter. Bake at 350 degrees F for 70-80 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cover loosely with foil if top browns to quickly. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. Store in the refrigerator.
