In a large mixing bowl (large enough to hold the mixed salad greens), whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil and salt & pepper. Set aside about 2 Tbsps in a small cup. Toss the salad greens in the large bowl with the dressing and then divide the greens onto four salad plates. Slice the two tomatoes into four thick slices. (The end slices can be discarded or used in another recipe). Place one slice in the center of each of the four plates. Returned the saved dressing to the large bowl. Cut the avocado in half and remove pit. Score the flesh in 1/2 inch squares. Turn the peel inside out and remove the cubes into the large bowl. Gently toss to coat. Then place 1/4 of the avocado onto of each tomato and serve.
