Pour grapeseed oil into an electric pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Add carrots, leeks, shiitake mushrooms, and onion; cook and stir on the Saute setting until softened, about 5 minutes. Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper; add to the cooker. Pour in chicken broth. Seal and cook on the Soup setting for 7 minutes. Release pressure naturally for 10 minutes according to manufacturer's instructions. Cover the vent with a dishtowel and release remaining pressure with the quick-release method. Remove chicken thighs and shred with 2 forks on a cutting board. Return to the cooker with the miso paste, garlic, soy sauce, ginger, and sriracha sauce. Cook and stir on the Saute setting until miso paste dissolves, about 5 minutes. Stir in cabbage and bok choy pieces; cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
