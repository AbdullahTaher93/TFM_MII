To make wonton cups, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat two 6-cup muffin pans with non-stick cooking spray and press one wonton square into each cup. Lightly coat squares with cooking spray again. Bake 7 minutes or until lightly brown. Cool in pan; remove and set aside. Combine chicken cubes, onion, soy sauce, lemon juice, olive oil and spices in medium bowl. Cover and marinate in refrigerator 15 minutes. Heat large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken mixture with marinade and cook 7 to 10 minutes or until chicken is done. Stir in spinach and cook 1 minute. Drain liquid from pan. Fill baked wonton cups with chicken mixture. Set aside. To prepare vanilla sauce, combine all ingredients in a small bowl. Stir and microwave 25 seconds or until warm. Top chicken cups with a dollop of sauce.
