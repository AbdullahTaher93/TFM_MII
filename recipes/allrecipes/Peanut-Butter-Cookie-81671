Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl. Add the Splenda and the whey protein powder and mix. Add the peanut butter and mix well. Since peanut butter is not so easy to measure just estimate it. Set your measuring cup near the mixing bowl and just guess at a cup's worth. Use a nonstick cookie sheet or better yet, line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Spoon out a rounded Tbsp worth and roll it into a ball. Then flatten it out on the cookie sheet. After 12 cookies have been made, take a fork and score the top of each cookie (this is for decoration only). Bake for 12 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool before eating.
