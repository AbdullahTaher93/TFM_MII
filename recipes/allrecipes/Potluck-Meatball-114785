In a bowl, combine the first six ingredients; add beef and mix well. Shape into 1-1/4-in. balls. In a skillet over medium heat, brown meatballs; drain. Transfer to a greased 1-1/2-qt. baking dish. Combine the cornstarch and consomme until smooth; add to skillet. Bring to a boil, stirring to loosen browned bits from pan. Boil for 2 minutes or until thickened. Pour over the meatballs. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until no longer pink.
