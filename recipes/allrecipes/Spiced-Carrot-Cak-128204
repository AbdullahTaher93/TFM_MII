Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Spray a 9-inch (1.5-L) round cake pan with nonstick spray. Line the bottom with a circle of waxed paper and spray again. For the cake, in a large bowl, combine the carrots and lemon juice. In a medium bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, ginger, salt, cloves, nutmeg, and ground black pepper, and whisk until well blended. In a small bowl, combine the honey, yogurt, oil, and egg. Add the honey mixture to the carrot mixture and stir well. Add the flour mixture and the raisins, and stir until well combined. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and spread evenly. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let the cake cool for 10 minutes. Turn the cake onto the rack to cool completely. When cooled, transfer the cake to a serving plate. For the topping, in a small bowl, combine the confectioners' sugar, cinnamon, and ginger. Place the sugar mixture in a small strainer and sprinkle over the top of the cake (in a pattern, if desired).
