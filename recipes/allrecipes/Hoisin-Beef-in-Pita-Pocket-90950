Combine beef, onion, and garlic in a wide frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring often, until meat is well browned (10 to 12 minutes). Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir together cornstarch, sherry, and chicken broth; set aside. To beef mixture add cilantro, hoisin sauce, and broth mixture. Cook, stirring, until sauce boils; spoon beef into a warm bowl and keep warm. To eat, divide lettuce into pita pockets, then top with beef. Serve immediately.
