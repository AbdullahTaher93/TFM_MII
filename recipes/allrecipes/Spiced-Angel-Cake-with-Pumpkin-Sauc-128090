Whisk cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves with cake mix. Follow package directions to prepare, bake, and cool cake. Meanwhile, combine milk and flour in a saucepan. Stir in pumpkin and brown sugar. Cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat until mixture boils and thickens. Pour into bowl. Place plastic wrap directly on pumpkin sauce. Refrigerate until well chilled, about 3 hours. Fold in whipped topping and vanilla. Garnish cake with cranberries and powdered sugar. Cut it into 12 slices and serve each with 1/4 cup (50 mL) of pumpkin sauce.
