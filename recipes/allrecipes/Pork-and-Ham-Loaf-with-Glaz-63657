Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Saute onion and bell pepper in the butter. Cover and cook until vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Cool mixture completely. Mix ground pork, ham, bread crumbs, Savory Market Flavors, milk, eggs, pepper, salt and cooled onion mixture in large bowl; combine thoroughly. Transfer pork mixture to shallow baking pan. Shape into 9 x4 x 2 1/2-inch loaf. Using long knife, make shallow crisscross (diamond) pattern in top of loaf. Bake loaf 30 minutes. Meanwhile, blend orange marmalade, Dijon mustard and brown sugar in small bowl for glaze. Drizzle 1/3 cup glaze over loaf; bake 15 minutes. Drizzle another 1/3 cup glaze over loaf; bake 15 minutes. Drizzle remaining glaze over loaf and bake until thermometer inserted into center of loaf registers 165 degrees F, about 20 minutes longer. Transfer loaf to platter; let stand 10 minutes. Pour pan juices into small bowl; whisk to blend. Cut loaf crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Serve with pan juices.
