In a medium skillet, toast the pine nuts over medium heat for 3 minutes; transfer to a medium bowl. Add 1 tablespoon butter and the onion to the pan and cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes; add to the pine nuts. Stir in the cornbread pieces, chicken broth, currants and cinnamon until combined. Slice each pork chop in half horizontally, up to the bone. Spread the chops open and season with salt and pepper. Form the stuffing into 4 patties. Place 1 patty inside each pork chop and close the meat around the stuffing. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in the skillet over medium heat. Add the chops, cover and cook for 5 minutes on each side. Transfer to a plate, cover loosely with foil and let stand for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in the skillet, cook the baby spinach until just wilted. Stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and season with salt and pepper. Divide the spinach among 4 plates and top with the pork chops; drizzle any juices on top.
