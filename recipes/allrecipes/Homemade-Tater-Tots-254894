Place potatoes in a pot; add cold water until potatoes are covered by 1 inch. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Simmer until potatoes are softened, about 10 minutes; drain. Cool until easily handled, 10 to 15 minutes. Shred potatoes into thin strips with a box grater; drain excess water. Place shredded potato into a large mixing bowl. Stir parsley, flour, salt, seasoned pepper, and onion powder into the potatoes until combined. Shape potato mixture into potato nuggets. Heat peanut oil in a deep-fryer or large stockpot to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place potato nuggets in the fryer, 5 to 10 at a time. Cook until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel lined plate.
