Place poppy seeds and buttermilk in a bowl; soak for 2 hours. In a large mixing bowl, cream butter until fluffy. Add sugar and egg yolks; beat well. Combine remaining dry ingredients; add alternately with poppy seeds/buttermilk to creamed mixture. In another bowl, beat egg whites until stiff. Fold into batter; set aside. Combine filling ingredients; sprinkle one-third into bottom of a greased and floured 10-in. bundt pan. Pour in half of batter; "swirl" in half of remaining filling. Add remaining batter and filling; again swirling together. Bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour. Turn out immediately onto wire rack to cool.
