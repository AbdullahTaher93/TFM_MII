Place rack in center of oven and preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Pour oil into a 10- by 15- by 1-inch pan (often called a jelly-roll pan) and place pan in oven while preheating. In a medium bowl, whisk eggs and salt until blended. Whisk in sugar and flour until smooth. Whisk in milk. Remove pan from oven and tilt to coat evenly with oil. Pour batter into hot pan. Bake 15 minutes or until puffy and golden. Remove from oven and immediately spread with softened cream cheese. Spread jam over cheese. Beginning with a 10-inch end, roll up like a jelly roll. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and cut into thick slices; serve immediately.
