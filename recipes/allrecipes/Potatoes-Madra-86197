Warm oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in potatoes, cauliflower, onion, and garlic; cook until the garlic begins to brown. Stir in the curry powder and ginger, and cook about 3 minutes. Stir in lentils, tomatoes, vegetable stock, vinegar, and chutney. Season with salt and pepper. Cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the lentils are tender, about 20 minutes. Top with parsley.
