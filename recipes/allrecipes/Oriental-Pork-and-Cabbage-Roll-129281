Place the pork in a bowl and add the water chestnuts, five-spice powder, ginger, scallions, soy sauce, garlic, and egg. Mix thoroughly with your hands or a fork until the ingredients are well blended; divide into 8 equal portions. Using a small, sharp knife, cut the tough stem from the bottom of each cabbage leaf. Place a portion of the pork mixture in the middle of each cabbage leaf; wrap the leaf around the filling to enclose it. Pour the stock into the bottom section of a large steamer. Arrange the cabbage rolls, seam side down, in one layer in the top section. Cover and steam until the cabbage is tender and the rolls are firm when pressed, about 15 minutes. Remove the top section from the steamer and keep the cabbage rolls hot. Mix the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water, then stir this mixture into the stock in the steamer. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened. Add the chile sauce. Serve the cabbage rolls with the sauce spooned over and sprinkled with scallion curls.
