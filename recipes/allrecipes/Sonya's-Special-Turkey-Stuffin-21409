In a large skillet over medium heat, combine the fat free butter flavored granules and 1 cup chicken broth. Heat until boiling. Mix in the celery, onion and mushrooms. Slowly cook and stir 5 minutes, or until vegetables are soft. Place the Italian-style bread crumbs and regular bread crumbs in a large bowl. Blend in the chicken broth mixture. Pour in remaining chicken broth and salt-free herb and spice blend. Mix thoroughly. Stuff the Thanksgiving bird or bake in a cake pan at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for approximately 15 minutes.
