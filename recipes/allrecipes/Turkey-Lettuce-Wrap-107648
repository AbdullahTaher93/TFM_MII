Rinse under cold water and pat Bibb lettuce dry with a paper towel. Lay lettuce on a clean surface and drizzle each leaf with a small amount of ranch dressing. Layer each leaf with turkey, tomato, onion, cucumber and alfalfa sprouts. Drizzle more ranch dressing, if desired. Roll up leaves tightly, and secure each with a toothpick.
