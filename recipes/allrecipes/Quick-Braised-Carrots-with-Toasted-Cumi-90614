Rinse carrots, peel, cut into 2- to 21/2-inch lengths, then cut each piece into 1/4-inch-thick sticks. In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium heat, stir cumin seed until fragrant, about 2 minutes; pour into a small bowl. Melt butter with oil in the pan over medium heat. Add carrots and salt; cook, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. Add cumin, broth, and lemon juice to carrots. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until carrots are tender-crisp to bite and liquid has evaporated, 5 to 6 minutes. Pour carrots onto a platter or spoon onto plates, sprinkle with parsley, and serve.
