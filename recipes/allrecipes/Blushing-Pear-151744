Mix gelatin and water in 3- to 4-quart saucepot. Bring to boil on medium-high heat, stirring frequently until gelatin is completely dissolved. Add pears; partially cover saucepot with lid. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer 20 minutes or just until pears are tender, stirring gently every 10 minutes. Remove pears from liquid; reserve liquid for another use (see Tip below) or discard. Serve pears warm or cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight. Top each pear with 2 Tbsp. whipped topping.
