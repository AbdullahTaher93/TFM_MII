In a large mixing bowl, combine 1-1/4 cups flour, sugar, yeast and salt. In a saucepan, heat the sour cream and water to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat until blended. Beat in eggs until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; roll out to 1/2-in. thickness. Cut with a floured 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter. Using the dull edge of a table knife, make an off-center crease in each roll. Fold along crease so the small half is on the top; press among folded edge. Place in a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan, allowing edges to touch. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 25 minutes. brush tops with butter. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.
