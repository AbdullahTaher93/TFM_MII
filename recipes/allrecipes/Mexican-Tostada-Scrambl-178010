Melt butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion, and chilies; cook, uncovered, until mushrooms are limp and liquid has evaporated (about 5 minutes). Meanwhile, arrange tortillas on a baking sheet; sprinkle evenly with cheese and place in a 350 degrees F oven until cheese is melted and tortillas are crisp (about 4 minutes). Beat eggs and salt until blended; pour into mushroom mixture and cook, lifting cooked portion with a wide spatula to allow uncooked egg to flow underneath. Cook until done to your liking. Spoon eggs over cheese-topped tortillas; top with avocado slices. Offer salsa and taco sauce for topping individual servings.
