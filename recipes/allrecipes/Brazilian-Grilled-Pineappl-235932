Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Whisk brown sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl. Pour sugar mixture into a large resealable plastic bag. Place pineapple wedges in bag and shake to coat each wedge. Grill pineapple wedges on the preheated grill until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
