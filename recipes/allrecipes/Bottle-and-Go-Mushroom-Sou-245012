Saute mushrooms, chives, and butter together in a large skillet over medium-high heat until mushrooms are browned, about 10 minutes. Stir water, red potatoes, chicken bouillon, dried oregano, dried dill weed, dried basil, dried thyme, and garlic salt into mushroom mixture. Bring soup to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer until potatoes are fork-tender, about 20 minutes. Pour soup into a blender or food processor and puree. Transfer soup into canning jars and refrigerate.
