Preheat grill to medium. Spray one side of each tortilla lightly with cooking spray. Place tortilla, spray side down, on board. Spoon 1/4 cup of beans on half of the tortilla. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup of cheese and 1 tablespoon cilantro. Fold remaining tortilla half over filling (half-moon shape). Grill over medium heat until tortillas are lightly browned and crisp on bottom, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Remove from grill and cut each quesadilla in half. Serve with sour cream, sliced cherry tomatoes and jalapeno slices.
