Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir leeks, onion, shallots, and garlic until translucent, 7 to 8 minutes. Add carrots, celery, and beet; cook and stir until starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Pour beef broth, water, and white wine into the pot. Simmer sauce until carrots and beet are tender, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Stir in soy sauce, umeboshi paste, and tamarind paste. Blend sauce with an immersion blender until consistency is slightly chunky.
