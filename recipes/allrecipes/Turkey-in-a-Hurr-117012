In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine the first five ingredients. Cover and microwave on high for 45 seconds or until butter is melted. Cut tenderloin into four portions; flatten to 1/4-in. thickness. Broil turkey 4-6 in. from the heat until lightly browned. Brush with some of the butter mixture. Turn turkey over; broil until second side is lightly browned. Brush with butter mixture. Broil 6-8 minutes longer or until meat is no longer pink, brushing often with remaining butter mixture.
