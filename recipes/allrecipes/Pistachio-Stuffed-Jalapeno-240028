Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Combine Neufchatel cheese, pistachio nuts, Cheddar cheese, and bacon seasoning in a bowl. Spoon cheese mixture into each jalapeno pepper half. Wrap each stuffed pepper with a bacon slice, securing with a toothpick. Arrange peppers on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crisp, about 30 minutes. Cool peppers for a few minutes before serving.
