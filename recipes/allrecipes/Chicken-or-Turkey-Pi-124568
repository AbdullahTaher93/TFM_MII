In a skillet, melt butter; saute celery, carrots and onion until soft. Stir in flour and salt. Gradually add milk and broth, stirring constantly until sauce thickens. Fold in mushroom soup and chicken or turkey. Spoon mixture into 9-in. x 13-in. baking pan; set aside. For crust, combine flour, baking powder and salt. Cut butter into flour mixture. Add milk and mix to form soft dough. Roll out to a 12-in. x 10-in. rectangle. Sprinkle with cheese and roll up, jelly-roll style, starting from long side. Slice into 1/2-in wheels and place on chicken mixture. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until crust is lightly browned.
