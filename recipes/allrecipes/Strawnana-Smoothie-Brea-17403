Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Place yogurt, strawberries, milk, bananas and orange juice in blender or food processor; puree until smooth. Mix in sugar, nutmeg and vanilla. In a medium bowl sift together flour, baking powder and baking soda. Stir flour mixture to the smoothie mixture until batter is smooth. Pour into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted into center of loaf comes out clean.
