Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread French fries out on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, warm the sliced turkey in a skillet set over medium heat. Divide turkey between two slices of bread. Place the slices of cheese in a microwave-safe dish and heat in the microwave until melted, about 3 minutes. Top the turkey with French fries then pour melted cheese over them. Top with the remaining slices of bread and serve immediately.
