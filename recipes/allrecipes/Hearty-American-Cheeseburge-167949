Preheat grill to medium-hot heat. Mix 1/4 cup of the steak sauce and relish until well blended. Set aside. Shape meat into 6 (1/4-inch-thick) patties. Grill or broil burgers and onion slices 5 to 7 minutes on each side or until burgers are cooked through and onion slices are tender, occasionally brushing with remaining 1/4 cup steak sauce. Top burgers with Singles; continue grilling or broiling until Singles begin to melt. Cover bottom halves of rolls with lettuce; top with cheeseburgers, onion, tomato, relish mixture and tops of rolls.
