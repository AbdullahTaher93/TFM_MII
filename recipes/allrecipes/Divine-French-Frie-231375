Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Spread potato strips evenly onto the prepared baking sheet. Spray potatoes with cooking spray; season with salt and pepper. Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes. Transfer fries to a large bowl. Add truffle oil, parsley, and salt to fries; toss to coat.
