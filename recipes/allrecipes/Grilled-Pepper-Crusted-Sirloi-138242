Heat grill to medium-high. Season both sides of steak with salt and pepper. Lightly oil grates and place steak on grill; cover grill and cook to desired doneness (about 10 minutes per side or 135 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer for medium-rare). Remove from grill; cover with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes.
