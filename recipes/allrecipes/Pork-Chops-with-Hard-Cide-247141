Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Rub each pork chop on both sides with halved garlic. Add 2 pork chops to the skillet; cook until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a 4-quart casserole dish. Repeat with remaining 2 pork chops. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the same skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Add to pork chops in the casserole dish. Spread rice and apples on top. Combine chicken broth, hard cider, cloves, bay leaf, salt, and black pepper in a 1-quart saucepan; bring to a boil. Pour broth mixture over apples in the casserole dish. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the pork chops reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 45 minutes.
