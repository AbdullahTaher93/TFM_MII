In a large bowl with a lid, stir together the pepperoncini peppers, sweet pepper rings, pimentos, pepperoni, Provolone, Swiss, Cheddar, mushrooms, olives, garlic, oregano, canola oil and olive oil until evenly coated. Cover tightly with the lid and let stand in fridge for 3 days. Shake the bowl often. This can be served cold, but is better when you let it come to room temperature!
