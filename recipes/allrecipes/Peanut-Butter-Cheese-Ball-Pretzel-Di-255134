Combine peanut butter, cream cheese, and butter in a bowl; beat together with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in vanilla extract. Mix in confectioners' sugar, 1/2 cup at a time, until incorporated. Fold in chocolate chips. Pour chocolate sprinkles onto a plate. Shape peanut butter mixture into a ball and roll in chocolate sprinkles until completely coated. Transfer to a serving dish. Arrange pretzel crackers on the dish around the ball. Chill until firm, at least 1 hour.
