Place chicken breasts in a gallon-size zipper-lock bag. Add teriyaki sauce, ginger and green onions. Seal bag, squeezing as much air out of the bag as possible. Leave to marinate. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. While grill preheats, bring sugar, soy sauce, Worcestershire, pineapple and butter to boil in a small saucepan. Simmer to blend flavors, about 5 minutes. Whisk in cornstarch; simmer until sauce thickens slightly; cover and set aside. Place chicken on hot grill rack. Cover and cook until impressive grill marks appear on one side of the chicken, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the chicken and continue to grill, covered, until it is firm to touch and just opaque throughout, 4 to 5 minutes longer, depending on their thickness. Transfer to plates, spoon sauce over chicken and serve.
