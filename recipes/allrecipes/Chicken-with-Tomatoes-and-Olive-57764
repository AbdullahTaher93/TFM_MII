Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Using a meat tenderizing hammer, pound each breast to about 1/2 inch thick. In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Briefly cook chicken breasts in oil, turning to lightly brown both sides. Add garlic and rosemary, and continue cooking until garlic is soft. Pour wine into pan, and cover pan with lid. Bring to a boil, and simmer for about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and olives to the pan; continue cooking, covered, for approximately 10 minutes
