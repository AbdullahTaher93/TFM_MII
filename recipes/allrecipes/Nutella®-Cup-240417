Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press 2 crescent roll triangles into each muffin cup; fill each with 1 to 2 banana slices. Spoon chocolate-hazelnut spread over bananas. Bake in the preheated oven until crescent rolls are golden brown, 11 to 13 minutes. Sprinkle confectioners' sugar over each cup.
