Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray. Combine ground turkey, egg, parsley, bread crumbs, adobo, and salt and pepper in a large bowl. Mix well. Press half of the turkey mixture into the bottom of the prepared loaf pan. Sprinkle the 1/2 cup cheese in a mound down the center of the pan; top with the remaining meat to form a loaf. Bake meatloaf in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, about one hour. If desired, sprinkle with the optional 1/4 cup cheese during the last 5 minutes of baking. Allow cooked meatloaf to rest for at least 5 minutes before slicing.
