In large bowl, stir together EAGLE BRAND(R) coconut, pecans, bread crumbs and mini chocolate chips; let stand at room temperature 30 minutes. Shape mixture with lightly greased hands into 1-inch balls. (Mixture will be moist.) Place on wax paper; cover with wax paper and let stand 8 hours. Melt chocolate chips and shortening in a large saucepan. Spoon chocolate mixture evenly over coconut balls covering top and sides completely and allowing excess to drip. Place on wax paper and chill until firm. Store leftovers covered in refrigerator.
