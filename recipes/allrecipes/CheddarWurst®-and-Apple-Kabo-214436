Cut each sausage into 3 pieces. Thread sausage, apples, peppers and onion onto 6 skewers, leaving a small space between each item. Melt apricot preserves in small saucepan over low heat. Add mustard, mixing until well blended. Grill kabobs over medium heat, turning frequently for 10 minutes. Brush kabobs with apricot preserves mixture and grill 2 minutes longer, or until apple and vegetables are crisp-tender.
