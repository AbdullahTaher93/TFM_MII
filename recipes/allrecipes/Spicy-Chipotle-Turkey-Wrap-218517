Combine mayonnaise, chipotle chile, and adobo sauce in a small bowl. Spread the mixture evenly on the tortillas. Divide the turkey, Monterey jack cheese, avocado, and romaine lettuce onto each tortilla. Fold the bottom of the tortilla snugly over the filling, then fold in the left and right edges. Roll the tortilla up to the top edge, forming a tight cylinder. Cut the wrap in half before serving.
