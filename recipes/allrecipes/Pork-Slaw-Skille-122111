In a large skillet, cook pork in oil over medium heat for 2-3 minutes on each side or until juices run clear. Season with salt and pepper. Remove and keep warm. In a bowl, combine the flour and water until smooth. Stir in the vinegar, sugar, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, salt, celery seed and pepper; pour into the skillet. Add vegetables. Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture comes to a boil. Cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened and vegetables are crisp-tender. Top with pork; cover and heat through.
