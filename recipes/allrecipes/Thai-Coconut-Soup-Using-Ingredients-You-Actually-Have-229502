Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking dish. Arrange chicken tenders in the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes. Dice chicken. Heat oil in a pot over medium heat; cook and stir yellow onion in the hot oil until onion is slightly browned, about 10 to 15 minutes. Pour in chicken stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer; add carrot, red bell pepper, and bamboo shoots. Slice the white part of green onions in half lengthwise and add to soup. Stir in diced chicken, coconut milk, lemon juice, curry powder, red pepper flakes, turmeric, ginger, paprika, and garlic powder. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until vegetables are tender and flavors have combined, about 10 minutes. Slice the green part of green onion; add to soup. Remove from heat and serve.
