Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook and stir bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Mix bacon, baked beans, kidney beans, pinto beans, chili beans, brown sugar, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce together in a bowl. Pour into a large baking dish; top with Parmesan cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and cheese is melted, about 45 minutes. Set aside to cool for 20 minutes before serving.
