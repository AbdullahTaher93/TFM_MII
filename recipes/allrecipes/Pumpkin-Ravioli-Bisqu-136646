Bring a pot of lightly-salted water to a boil; cook the ravioli in the boiling water until tender, about 5 minutes; drain. Prepare a skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Cook the onion and garlic in the hot skillet until brown. Stir in the sage, thyme, cayenne pepper, chicken broth, and pumpkin pie filling; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 10 minutes. Ladle over drained ravioli to serve.
