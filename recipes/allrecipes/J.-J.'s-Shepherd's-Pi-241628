Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir cream-style corn and corn niblets together in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes. Spread ground beef out in the bottom of a casserole dish. Top with 8 slices American cheese, corn mixture, remaining cheese slices, and mashed potatoes, respectively. Bake in the preheated oven until corn mixture bubbles along the edges of the dish, about 30 minutes. Cool briefly before slicing.
