In a medium pot with a lid, blend together mustard, sugar, soy sauce, white vinegar, ketchup and water in the order listed. Bring the sauce to a boil. Add the chicken pieces, and turn down the heat. Place the lid slightly ajar on the pot. Simmer for approximately 45 minutes, or till the chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear.
