Sprinkle shrimp with salt and cayenne pepper. Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the red onion and cook for 1 minute. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 30 seconds. Add the lime juice and shrimp and cook until shrimp turn pink, about 1 minute per side. Transfer shrimp to a small bowl. Pour diced tomatoes, mushrooms, chicken broth, and crushed red pepper into the pan. Cook until mushrooms begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the coconut milk, curry powder, fish sauce, and Thai basil. Cook until mixture has heated through. Transfer shrimp back to the pan, and cook for 1 minute more. Serve with a lime wedge and garnish with cilantro, if desired.
