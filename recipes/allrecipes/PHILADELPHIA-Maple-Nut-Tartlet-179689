heat oven to 350 degrees F. Stack 3 of the phyllo sheets on cutting board, brushing melted butter between each layer. Cut into 6 squares. Place 1 square in each of 6 large muffin cups, pressing pastry onto bottom and up side of each cup. Repeat with remaining sheets phyllo. Bake 10 minutes or until golden brown; cool 10 minutes. Beat cream cheese, sugar and 1/4 cup of the syrup in medium bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Gently stir in whipped topping. Fill each cup evenly with the cream cheese mixture. Cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours or overnight. Top evenly with the remaining 1 tablespoon maple syrup and pecans just before serving. Store leftover tartlets in refrigerator.
