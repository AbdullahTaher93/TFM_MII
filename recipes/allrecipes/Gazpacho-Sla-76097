In a bowl, mix the cabbage, cucumber, tomato, yellow bell pepper, green onions, and celery. In a separate bowl, whisk together the tomato-vegetable juice cocktail, red wine vinegar, sugar, olive oil, salsa, and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the dressing over the vegetables, and toss to coat. Cover, and refrigerate 2 hours before serving.
