In a 10- to 12-inch ovenproof, nonstick frying pan, combine bacon, potatoes, onion, and garlic over medium heat. Stir often until bacon is crisp and potatoes are browned, about 20 minutes. Spoon mixture into a bowl and keep warm. While bacon mixture cooks, beat eggs in a large bowl until blended. When bacon mixture is done, transfer to bowl and pour eggs into frying pan. Cook on medium-low heat until eggs on bottom begin to set; push aside or lift cooked egg to let liquid egg flow to pan bottom. Repeat until eggs are softly set but still creamy-looking on top, about 7 minutes total. Sprinkle eggs with half of the cheese. Top with bacon mixture and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Broil omelet 6 inches from heat until cheese is melted, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley. Cut into wedges to serve. Season and garnish to taste with pepper and sour cream, if desired.
