In a medium saute pan, melt butter or margarine over medium heat. Add onions and garlic; cook and stir until translucent. Spread broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, lima beans, yellow wax beans, and zucchini in a large baking dish. Sprinkle with walnuts and shredded cheese. Arrange sauteed onions over cheese. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) until vegetables are tender and cheese melts, approximately 30 minutes.
