Cook ground chicken and onion in a heavy pot over medium heat until no longer pink and onions begin to turn translucent, about 6 minutes. Drain excess fat. Stir in garlic and chili powder until chicken is coated and fragrant, 1 minute. Transfer chicken and onion mixture to a bowl. Prepare the Knorr(R) Rice Sides(TM) - Creamy Chicken (using the same pot) as directed on package instructions. When the rice is cooked and tender, add the ground chicken, diced tomatoes and green chilies, and refried bean to the rice. Stir until heated through, about 4 minutes. Serve with chopped cilantro and onion and/or shredded cheese.
