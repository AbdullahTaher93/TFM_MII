In a heavy skillet over medium heat, melt 1/4 cup of butter. Saute the chestnuts in butter until heated through; set aside. Melt remaining 1/4 cup butter in a large pot, and stir in the carrot, parsnip, and celery root. Cook and stir until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Add the stock, chestnuts, and wine. Bring to a boil, and reduce the heat to simmer. Simmer for 15 minutes; season with nutmeg, salt and pepper and fresh parsley. Puree the soup in a food processor or blender a little at a time, or use an immersion blender. Garnish each serving with sour cream, if desired, and a dash of cayenne pepper.
