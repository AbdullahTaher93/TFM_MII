Mix mashed potatoes, luncheon meat, pancake mix, and eggs together gently in a bowl. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Spoon potato mixture into hot oil and press with a spatula to flatten evenly. Cook, covered, until bottom is crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until second side is golden and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes more.
