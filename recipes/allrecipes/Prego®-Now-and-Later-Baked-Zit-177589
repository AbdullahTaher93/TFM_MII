Cook the beef and onion in an 8-quart saucepot over medium high heat until the beef is well browned, stirring often. Pour off any fat. Stir the sauce, ziti and 2 cups mozzarella cheese in the saucepot. Spoon the beef mixture into 2 (12 1/2 x 8 1/2 x 2-inch) disposable foil pans. Top with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes or until the beef mixture is hot.
