Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place the beaten egg in a shallow dish. Measure the panko crumbs into a separate dish. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Dip each piece in the egg to coat, then press into the panko crumbs to coat. When the oil is hot, add the coated chicken breasts. Fry on each side until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to serving plates and serve with tonkatsu sauce. To make the tonkatsu sauce, stir together the Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, soy sauce and sesame seeds in a small bowl.
