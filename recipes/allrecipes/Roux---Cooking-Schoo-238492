Melt butter in a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-low heat. Gradually whisk flour into melted butter until fully incorporated. For a white roux, cook and stir butter-flour mixture with a wooden spoon until pale golden and thick, about 4 minutes. For a blonde roux, cook and stir butter-flour mixture with a wooden spoon until golden and thick, 6 to 8 minutes. For a brown roux, cook and stir butter-flour mixture with a wooden spoon until dark golden and thick, 10 to 15 minutes.
