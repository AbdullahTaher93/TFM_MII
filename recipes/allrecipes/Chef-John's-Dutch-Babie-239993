Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Blend milk, flour, eggs, vanilla extract, and salt together in a blender until batter is smooth. Melt clarified butter in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over high heat until bubbling; pour batter into the center of the skillet. Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Brush with 1 tablespoon butter, drizzle lemon juice over the top, and dust with confectioners' sugar.
