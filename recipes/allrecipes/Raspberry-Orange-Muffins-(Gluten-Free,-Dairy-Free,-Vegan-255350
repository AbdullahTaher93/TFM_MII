Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin with cooking spray. Whisk water and flaxseed meal together in a small bowl to make flax "eggs". Let stand until thickened, about 5 minutes. Place raspberries in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave until thawed, 10 to 15 seconds. Stir in flax eggs, maple syrup, orange zest, orange juice, coconut oil, and vanilla extract. Whisk baking mix, oat flour, baking soda, baking powder, xanthan gum, and salt together in a bowl. Add raspberry mixture; mix quickly with a spatula until batter is combined. Scoop batter into the muffin tin, filling each cup 3/4 full. Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 15 minutes.
