Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add peas and cook until bright green, 30 seconds. Drain in a colander and rinse with cold water until cool. Transfer to a large bowl, add watercress and toss to combine. Heat a medium nonstick skillet over low heat; swirl in the peanut (or canola) oil, add shallots, and cook very slowly, stirring frequently, until sweet and caramelized, about 15 minutes. Stir in vinegar, sesame oil and salt; cook until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Pour the warm dressing over the peas and watercress; toss well. Top with cheese and serve.
