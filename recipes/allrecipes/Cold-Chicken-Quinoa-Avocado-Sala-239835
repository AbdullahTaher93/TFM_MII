Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool quinoa to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Mix mashed avocado, cilantro, lime juice, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until dressing is smooth. Combine quinoa, chicken, tomatoes, and scallions in a bowl; add avocado dressing and toss to coat.
