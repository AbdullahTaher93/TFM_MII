Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil. Pierce the potatoes a few times with a fork. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until easily pierced with a fork. Remove and allow to cool slightly. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the Parmesan, parsley, basil, garlic powder, and salt. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, quarter them lengthwise. Scoop out the flesh, leaving a 1/4-inch-thick shell. Reserve the flesh for another use. Cut the strips in half crosswise. You should have 24 wedges. Place on the foil-lined baking sheet. Coat both sides with nonstick spray. Sprinkle with the Parmesan mixture. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown. To serve, top with dollops of sour cream. Sprinkle with the chives or scallions.
