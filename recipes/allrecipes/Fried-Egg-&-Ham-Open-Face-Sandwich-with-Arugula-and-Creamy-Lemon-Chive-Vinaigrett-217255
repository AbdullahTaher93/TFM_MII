Whisk together lemon juice, zest, mustard, mayonnaise, chives, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl. Whisk in the olive oil until combined. Brush the cut side of the bottom half of the bread with 2 tablespoons of the canola oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill on a grill pan, oil-side down, over high heat until lightly golden brown, about 20 seconds; or place the bread on a sheet pan, oil-side up and toast under the broiler until lightly golden brown, about 45-60 seconds. Reserve the remaining half for later use. Heat the remaining tablespoon of canola oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ham and cook until just warmed through on both sides, about 30 seconds per side. Gently crack the eggs onto the ham, season with salt and pepper and cook until the white is set and the yellow is slightly firm, about 2 minutes. The yolk should still be slightly runny. Place the toasted bread on a flat surface and spread with a few tablespoons of the dressing. Top the bread with the ham/eggs and then top the eggs with the arugula. Drizzle with more of the lemon-chive dressing and serve immediately.
