In a large bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa and salt. Stir in applesauce, egg substitute and vanilla; mix well. Pour about half of the batter into a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. In a mixing bowl, combine the filling ingredients; beat until smooth. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto batter. Spoon remaining batter over the top; cut through batter with a knife to swirl peanut butter mixture. Bake at 325 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until edges are firm and center is almost set. Cool on a wire rack. In a small bowl, combine the frosting ingredients until smooth. Spread over brownies.
