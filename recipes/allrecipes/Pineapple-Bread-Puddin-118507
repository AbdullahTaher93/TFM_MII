Place bread on a baking sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F for 4 minutes; turn over and bake 4 minutes longer or until very light brown. Cut toasted bread into 1-in. cubes. Toss with melted butter; set aside. In a bowl, beat eggs until thick and lemon-colored. Add the pineapple, currants, sugar and vanilla; mix well. Fold in bread cubes. Pour into a greased 2-1/2-qt. baking dish. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until bubbly and golden brown. Serve warm with whipped cream if desired.
