Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place pasta in the pot, and cook for 6 minutes. Mix in peas. Continue cooking 4 to 6 minutes, until pasta is al dente. Drain, and return to pot. Heat the oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in green onions and garlic. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Cook and stir until green onions are tender. Mix in salami, and continue cooking until heated through. Transfer to the pot with the cooked pasta. Add Parmesan cheese, and gently toss.
