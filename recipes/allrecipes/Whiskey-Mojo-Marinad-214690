To make the marinade, whisk together the canola oil, garlic, whiskey, orange juice, lime juice, cumin, and soy sauce. To use the marinade, pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add up to two pounds of meat, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour, preferably overnight.
