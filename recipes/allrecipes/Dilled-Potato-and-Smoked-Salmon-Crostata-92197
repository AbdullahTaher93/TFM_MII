Melt butter in a 10-inch frying pan over medium heat; add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and lightly browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. Meanwhile, peel potatoes and slice very thinly. Carefully unfold the 2 pastry crusts onto two 12- by 15-inch baking sheets. Stir the chopped dill into onions, then spoon half of the onion mixture into the center of each pastry; spread onions out, leaving a 2-inch border around the edge. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Arrange potato slices in overlapping concentric circles over onions; sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Fold in edges of dough over potatoes. Drizzle 2 tablespoons cream over potatoes in each crostata. Bake in a 375 degrees F oven, switching position of baking sheets midway through baking time, until pastry is golden brown and potatoes are tender when pierced, about 35 minutes. Arrange half the smoked salmon slices over the top of each hot crostata, garnish with dill sprigs, then cut into wedges to serve.
