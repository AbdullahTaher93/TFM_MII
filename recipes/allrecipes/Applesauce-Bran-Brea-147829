In large electric mixer bowl, mix together 1/2 cup of the flour, Kellogg's(R) All-Bran(R) cereal, sugar, salt and yeast. Set aside. Combine applesauce, milk and margarine in small saucepan. Heat until very warm (120 to 130 F). Margarine does not need to melt. On low speed, gradually add to cereal mixture and beat 2 minutes on medium speed, scraping bowl occasionally. Add egg and 1/2 cup flour. Beat 2 minutes on high speed, scraping bowl occasionally. Stir in enough remaining flour (1 3/4 cup) to make stiff, sticky dough. Cover loosely. Let rise in warm place until double in volume. Stir down dough. Spoon into 1-quart round casserole dish coated with cooking spray. Cover and let rise in warm place until double in volume. Bake at 375 degrees F about 35 minutes or until done. To prevent over-browning, cover loosely with foil during last few minutes of baking time. Remove from casserole. Cool on wire rack.
