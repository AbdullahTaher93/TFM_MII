In a large bowl, combine flours, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and salt. In another bowl, beat egg, milk and butter. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in apples. Coat jumbo muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray; fill half full. For topping, combine the cereal, walnuts, brown sugar, cinnamon and milk. Sprinkle over muffins. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm.
