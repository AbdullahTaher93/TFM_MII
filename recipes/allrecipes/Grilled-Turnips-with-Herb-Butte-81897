Select a mix of herbs that you like whether fresh or dried or a combination. I like using fresh rosemary, oregano, thyme and flat leaf parsley. Perhaps you might like dill, cilantro and marjoram. Another combination is the ground seeds of cumin, coriander and mustard. Your selection will greatly influence the tenor of the entire dish so look for herbs that compliment your main course. If using fresh herbs, be sure they are dry and minced finely before adding them to the butter. Heat the butter in a small sauce pan or in the microwave just until melted. Remove from heat and stir in the herbs and 1/2 of the garlic (1 clove worth). Let the butter sit at room temperature for at least 10 minute before refrigerating. Stir well just prior to refrigeration. Trim off and discard both the root and leaf ends of the turnips. Slice turnips about 1/4 inch thick (or slightly thicker). In a small bowl or cup, mix the olive oil and 1/2 of the garlic with a dash of salt and pepper. Coat both sides of each turnip slice with the olive oil mixture. You can use a brush or pour the oil on a plate and dredge each slice through it. Place slices on the grill with medium-high heat. Turn once it starts to take on some color (usually about 2-3 minutes) and grill for another 2-3 minutes, just until it starts to turns brown. Alternatively you can pop them under the broiler for about 2 minutes, turn and broil another minute or two. Transfer the turnips to a serving platter and place a dab of the herb butter here and there. Or serve the butter in a decorative cup and place it on the platter so each person can choose the amount of butter they desire (since some people are trying to limit their fat intake).
