Pound chicken to 1/2-inch thickness. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Put flour on waxed paper. Beat eggs with Parmesan in pie plate. Coat chicken with flour, shaking off excess. Heat oil heat in large nonstick skillet over medium. Dip 2 pieces of chicken in egg mixture; cook 5 minutes, or until golden on bottom. Turn; cook until juices run clear when thickest part of chicken is pierced. Transfer to plate; keep warm. Repeat with remaining chicken. Serve with tomato sauce, if desired. (Refrigerate leftovers.)
