Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Mix ground beef, potatoes, carrots, onion, rutabaga, water, salt, and pepper together in a casserole dish; top with butter. Cover dish with an oven-safe cover or aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; stir and add more water if needed. Continue baking until vegetables are tender, about 1 more hour.
