Place the wheat berries or spelt in a sieve and rinse until the water runs clear. Place in a bowl with 2 cups of the water. Let stand for 8 hours or overnight. Drain. Place the remaining 1 1/2 cups water and broth in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the wheat berries or spelt and return to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes, or until tender, adding the broccoli during the last 5 minutes. Drain and place in a large bowl. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and herb and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, corn, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 minutes, or until the tomatoes begin to collapse. Serve over the wheat berries or spelt.
