Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir chicken, 1 packet sazon seasoning, and 1 teaspoon garlic salt, shredding chicken as it cooks until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 8 to 10 minutes. Bring rice and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir black beans, 1 packet sazon seasoning, and teaspoon garlic salt together in a microwave-safe bowl. Cook in microwave until heated through, about 2 minutes. Add black bean mixture to rice. Place each tortilla on a work surface; layer half of each tortilla with bean-rice mixture, Mexican cheese, shredded chicken, and more Mexican cheese. Fold each tortilla in half. Spread a thin layer of softened butter atop each quesadilla. Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook each quesadilla, butter-side down, until cheese is melted and outside is crisp and brown, about 5 minutes per side. Cut into wedges.
