Add a splash of creme de menthe to each of 4 tall glasses (pilsner beer glasses work great), then a few berries and a few small scoops of ice cream. Layer in another splash of liqueur, some berries and more ice cream and finish with a last splash per glass. Top the parfaits with a whipped cream swirl and add a berry or two. Place an iced-tea spoon inside each glass.
