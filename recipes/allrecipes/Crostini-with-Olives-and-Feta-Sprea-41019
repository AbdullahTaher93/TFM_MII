For crostini, partially freeze bread. Cut bread into forty 1/4-inch-thick slices; arrange on cookie sheets. Drain tomatoes, reserving oil. Lightly brush one side of each slice with some oil. Bake in a 300 degree F oven for 6 minutes. Turn slices over; bake 6 minutes more or until golden brown. Finely chop tomatoes. Stir in olives and garlic. Set aside. Beat cream cheese in a small mixing bowl until softened. Beat in feta and milk until smooth. Spread feta mixture on oiled side of crostini. Top with a small dollop of tomato mixture. Garnish crostini with shredded basil.
