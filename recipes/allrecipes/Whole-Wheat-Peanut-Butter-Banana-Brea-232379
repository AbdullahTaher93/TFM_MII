Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Beat bananas, honey, oil, eggs, peanut butter, and vanilla extract in a bowl until smooth. Combine pastry flour, bread flour, wheat germ, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl; make a well in the flour mixture. Pour banana mixture into well and stir wet ingredients into dry ingredients until batter is just moistened. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
