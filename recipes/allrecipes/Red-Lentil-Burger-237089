Combine water and lentils in a saucepan; bring to a boil and cook until the water is completely absorbed and the lentils tender yet holding form, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer lentils to a large bowl and let cool. Stir onion, cilantro, garlic, mustard, cumin, parsley, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes into the lentils; add flour as needed to help absorb excess moisture and bind ingredients together. Shape lentil mixture into 4 patties. Prepare a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Cook burgers in the hot skillet until firm and hot in the center, 4 to 7 minutes per side.
