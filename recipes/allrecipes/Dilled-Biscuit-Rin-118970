Separate each tube of biscuits into 10 biscuits. Cut each biscuit in half; set aside. In a small bowl, combine the remaining ingredients; drizzle half into a greased 10-in. fluted tube pan. Place half of the biscuits in pan; drizzle with the remaining butter mixture. Top with remaining biscuits. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan. Serve warm.
