Melt lard in a large pot over high heat. Stir in cubed pork and coriander seeds. Cook until the pork has browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in the onions, potatoes, carrots, garlic, tomatillos, green chiles, jalapeno peppers, nopalitos, and hominy. Season with oregano and cumin seed. Add water if the mixture seems too dry. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the pork is tender, about 45 minutes. To serve, ladle the stew into serving bowls and sprinkle with crumbled cheese and chopped cilantro.
