Melt the butter with the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the mushrooms and basil in the mixture until the mushrooms are warm. Pour the rum and sherry over the mushrooms and continue to cook until the mushrooms soften. Stir in the lemon juice, sour cream, and Parmesan cheese; simmer until heated through. Season with salt to serve.
