Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Sift together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the butter, cream, and milk; stir until a spongy dough has formed. Turn the dough out onto a lightly-floured surface. Pat the dough into a rectangle about 3/4 inch thick and 7 inches wide. Cut into 6 triangles. Arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 13 minutes.
