In a large skillet over medium heat, cook ground beef until evenly browned. Drain fat and set aside to cool. In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes, onion, Cheddar cheese, Jack cheese and kidney beans. Cover and chill for at least an hour. Right before serving, add the dressing and corn chips and toss until evenly coated.
