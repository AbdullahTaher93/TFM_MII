Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for direct heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is directly under the food). For charcoal grill: Before you put the grill over the hot coals, brush it with a light coat of oil. For gas grill: When hot, brush grill with a light coat of oil. In a small bowl, mix jam and orange juice. Halve and pit fruit; for cling pit fruit, with a short sharp knife, cut around pit to remove. Lay peach or nectarine halves cut side down on lightly oiled grill over a solid bed of medium hot coals or medium high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand just above grill level for only 3 to 4 seconds). Keep charcoal grill uncovered; close lid on gas grill. Cook until cut edges begin to brown, 2 to 4 minutes, then turn peaches over with tongs. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the jam mixture into hollow of each half and continue to cook until fruit is hot, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Spoon a scoop of ice cream into each of 4 dessert bowls and, with tongs, set peach halves in each bowl. Drizzle fruit equally with remaining jam mixture and serve.
