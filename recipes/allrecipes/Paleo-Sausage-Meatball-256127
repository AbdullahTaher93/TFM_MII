Combine apple, onion, sage, rosemary, and sea salt in a food processor; pulse until well mixed. Add sausage; pulse 3 or 4 times until combined. Roll sausage mixture into meatballs. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook meatballs in batches, covered, until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
