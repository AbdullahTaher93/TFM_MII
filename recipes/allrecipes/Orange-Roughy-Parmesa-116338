Place fish in a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Brush fillet with butter. Sprinkle with salt if desired and garlic powder. In a shallow bowl, combine bread crumbs and Parmesan. Coat fish with bread crumb mixture and transfer to prepared pan. Bake at 425 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
