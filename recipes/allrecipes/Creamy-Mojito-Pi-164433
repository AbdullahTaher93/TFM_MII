Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Make pie crust as directed on box for One-Crust Baked Shell using 9-inch glass pie plate. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until light golden brown. Cool completely on cooling rack, about 15 minutes. In large bowl, beat cream cheese with electric mixer on low speed until creamy. Add remaining filling ingredients; beat on low speed about 30 seconds or until blended. Beat on medium speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally, until thickened and creamy. Spoon filling evenly into pie crust; refrigerate while making topping. In same bowl, beat topping ingredients on medium speed until until stiff peaks form. Spread topping evenly over filling. Refrigerate about 1 hour or until set. Garnish pie with mint sprigs and lime slices. Cover and refrigerate any remaining pie.
