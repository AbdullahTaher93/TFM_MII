Heat oil in a large saute pan. Add the peppers and onions and cook on MEDIUM-HIGH heat for 8 to 10 minutes until vegetables are soft and caramelized. Add the corn, black beans, salsa, and cumin and cook for 4 minutes more. Lay out tortillas and divide the ingredients between them on the bottom half of the tortilla. Top with the cheese and chicken if used and fold over the top half of the tortilla. In batches, brown the tortillas on both sides using a saute pan and 1 tablespoon oil on MEDIUM heat.
