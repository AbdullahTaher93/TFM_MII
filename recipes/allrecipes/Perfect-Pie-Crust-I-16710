Place flour in a large bowl. Cut in shortening and butter until mixture is crumbly. In a separate bowl, mix together egg, sugar, salt, and lemon juice. Make a well in the center of flour mixture. Pour in all of egg mixture and half of ice water. Stir gently with a fork, adding more water as needed, just until mixture forms a ball. Turn dough onto a floured surface and cut into 4 equal portions. Knead each piece briefly and shape into a disc. Chill 1 hour before rolling out.
