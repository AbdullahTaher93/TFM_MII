In a 3- to 4-quart pan, melt butter over medium heat. Set aside 1/2 cup of the endive. Add carrots, onion, and remaining endive to pan; stir until onion is limp, 8 to 10 minutes. Add flour; stir until it coats vegetables. Stir in broth. Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer until carrots are tender when pierced, 10 to 15 minutes. In a blender, smoothly puree soup, a portion at a time. Return soup to pan. Stir over medium heat until hot. Add salt and pepper to taste. Ladle into a tureen or bowls. Offer remaining endive to sprinkle onto each portion.
