Halve melon; scoop out pulp. Process in batches in blender container or food processor. Line a large colander with a double thickness of 100%-cotton cheesecloth. Strain pulp through cheesecloth, pressing out as much juice as possible. Discard pulp. Measure 6 cups juice. (If there are fewer than 6 cups juice, add water to equal 6 cups.) Add sugar to taste, if desired. Cover and refrigerate soup until ready to serve. Meanwhile, cook vegetables in a small amount of lightly salted boiling water for 2 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl of ice water to cool. Drain and wrap in plastic wrap; chill in refrigerator until ready to serve. To serve, stir balsamic vinegar into juice mixture. Ladle into bowls. Float strips of vegetables on top.
