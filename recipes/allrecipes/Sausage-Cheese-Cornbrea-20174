Place sausage and onion in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain well and set aside. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking pan or casserole. In a large bowl, combine green pepper, cornmeal, eggs and creamed corn. Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle batter with sausage, onions and cheese. Pour on remaining batter. Bake in preheated oven until brown, about 35 to 45 minutes.
