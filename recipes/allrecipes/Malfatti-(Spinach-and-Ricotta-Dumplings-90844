In a 5- to 6-quart pan, bring about 3 inches of water to boiling over high heat. Pour pasta sauce into a 1- to 2-quart pan and place over low heat, stirring occasionally, until hot; keep warm. While water heats, place spinach in a colander; press with back of a spoon to remove excess liquid. In a large bowl, mix together the spinach, ricotta, 1/4 cup parmesan, bread crumbs, onions, basil, eggs, garlic, and nutmeg until well blended. Divide mixture into 16 equal portions. With your hands, form spinach mixture, a portion at a time, into smooth 3-inch-long logs. Roll each log lightly in the flour and place them, slightly apart, on a baking sheet or large plate. When water boils, reduce heat to a simmer and add logs. Simmer, uncovered, until dumplings look dry in centers (cut to test), about 8 minutes. With a slotted spoon, divide dumplings among 4 wide, individual serving bowls. Spoon warm pasta sauce equally over each serving. Offer additional parmesan and pepper to add to taste.
