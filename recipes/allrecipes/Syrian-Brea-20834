Place ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select Dough cycle; press Start. Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Once the dough has risen, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into eight equal pieces and form into rounds. Cover the rounds with a damp cloth and let rest. Roll dough into thin flat circles, about 8 inches in diameter. Cook two at a time on preheated baking sheets or a baking stone until puffed up and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Repeat for remaining loaves.
