Soak 8 long bamboo skewers in cold water for 30 minutes. Preheat the grill to medium-high and grease the grate. Stir the marinade with the ketchup, oregano and lemon juice until well combined. Toss half of this mixture with the pork and the vegetables; let stand for 15 minutes. Thread 2 pieces each of pork, zucchini and cherry tomatoes alternately onto each skewer. Grill the skewers; turn as needed and baste occasionally with remaining marinade mixture for 10 to 12 minutes or until pork is cooked through
