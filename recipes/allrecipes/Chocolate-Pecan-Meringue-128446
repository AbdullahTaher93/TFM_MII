Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or foil. In a large bowl, beat egg whites until frothy. Add cream of tartar and beat until stiff. In a small bowl, combine sugar and cocoa. Gradually beat into egg whites. Fold in pecans. Spoon meringue into 1 1/2-inch (3.75-cm) mounds on the prepared baking sheet. Using the back of a spoon, depress the centers and build up the sides of each meringue to form a shallow cup. Bake 1 hour. Do not open the oven door. Turn off the oven and let meringues cool in the oven. Store in an airtight container. When ready to serve, fill each with preserves.
