Working from center, gently pound pork with flat side of meat mallet or rolling pin until about 1/4 inch thick; remove wrap. Sprinkle pork with 1 teaspoon salt and pepper. Melt butter in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork; cook 8 minutes or until browned, turning once. Remove pork from skillet.
