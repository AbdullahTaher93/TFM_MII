Combine the first five ingredients; mix well. Pat into a greased 9-in. square baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-17 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool to room temperature. Combine the peanut butter, corn syrup and honey; carefully spread half over crust. Spread with half the ice cream. Drop remaining peanut butter mixture over ice cream. Sprinkle with half the nuts. Top with remaining ice cream and nuts. Freeze until firm, 3-4 hours. Let stand 5-10 minutes before serving.
