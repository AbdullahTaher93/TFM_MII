Combine flour, baking powder, anise seed, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg; set aside. In a separate bowl, cream butter and 3/4 cup sugar until fluffy. Beat in vanilla and eggs. Stir in almonds and flour mixture. Line a baking pan with foil. Divide the dough in half and mold into two 12-in. x 2-in. rectangles on the foil. Smooth the surface of each rectangle, then brush with milk and sprinkle with remaining sugar. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20 minutes or until golden brown and firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and reduce heat to 300 degrees F. Lift rectangles with foil onto a wire racks; cool 15 minutes. Place rectangles on a cutting board; slice 1/2 in. thick crosswise on the diagonal. Place slices, cut side down, on baking sheets. Bake 10-12 minutes longer. Turn oven off, leaving cookies in oven to cool with door ajar. Store cookies in airtight containers.
