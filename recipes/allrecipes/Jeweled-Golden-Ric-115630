Combine rice, broth, water, curry powder, turmeric and saffron in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, stir once, cover with a tight-fitting lid, reduce heat to a simmer and cook until the liquid is absorbed, about 35 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes more. Fluff with a fork. Combine oil, lemon juice, honey, orange zest, ginger and salt in a large, non-reactive bowl (see Note). Stir in the cooked rice, celery, dried cherries and 1/4 cup scallions (or chives). Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days. To serve, fold fresh cherries and 1/2 cup mixed nuts into the rice mixture. Serve at room temperature, garnished with the remaining 1/4 cup scallions (or chives) and mixed nuts.
