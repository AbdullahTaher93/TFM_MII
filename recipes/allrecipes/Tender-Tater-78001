Place potatoes into a slow cooker, and sprinkle with black pepper. Stir together the gravy mix and water in a measuring cup until well blended. Pour this over the potatoes, then pour in the evaporated mink. Stir to blend. Cover, and cook for 4 hours on Low. When finished, drain any excess liquid. Mash potatoes with a potato masher, and stir in the butter.
