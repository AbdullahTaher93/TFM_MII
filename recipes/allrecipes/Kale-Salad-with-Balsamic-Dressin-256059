Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble into small pieces. Whisk 1/4 cup olive oil, balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, and garlic together in a bowl until dressing is evenly mixed. Transfer kale to a bowl; add dressing and toss to coat. Top salad with bacon and sunflower seeds.
