Combine flour, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, baking powder and nutmeg; set aside. In a mixing bowl, lightly beat eggs; stir in sugar, oil and vanilla. Add dry ingredients; stir just until moistened. Fold in zucchini and nuts; mix well (batter will be stiff). Pour into two greased and floured 8-1/2-in. x 4-1/2-in. x 2-1/2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until bread tests done. Cool in pans 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack.
