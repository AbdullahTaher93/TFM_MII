Combine the rice, salt, and water in a large, heavy saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium high heat. Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer until the water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Add the LACTAID(R) EggNog and nutmeg. Cover and simmer over low to medium heat, stirring continuously, for about 30 minutes. The pudding is done when it has thickened. Do not overcook the pudding or it will become gummy. Remove from heat and stir in dried fruit. Cover. Allow pudding to sit for 10 minutes. Stir well, then spoon mixture into dessert dishes and refrigerate. The pudding may be served warm or cold.
