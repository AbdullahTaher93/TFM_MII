Arrange bread slices on a work surface. Place Cheddar cheese slices on top of 1 bread slice. Layer broccoli, zucchini, green bell pepper, and jalapeno pepper on top of cheese. Place the second piece of bread on top of vegetables, creating a sandwich. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in the hot skillet. Add sandwich to skillet, cover with a lid, and cook until bread is golden, about 45 seconds. Flip sandwich, add remaining butter, and cook until bottom is golden, about 45 seconds more.
