Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Set aside salted caramel pouch. Combine brownie mix, eggs, and oil in a large bowl until well incorporated and dough forms. Mix crushed pretzels into dough until combined. Divide dough into 40 pieces and round into small balls and flatten slightly onto cookie sheet. Bake cookies 12-14 minutes. Press one pretzel stick into the centre of each cookie while the cookie is warm. Drizzle each cookie lollipop with salted caramel.
