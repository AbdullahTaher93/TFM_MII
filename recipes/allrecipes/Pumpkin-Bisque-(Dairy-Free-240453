Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot oil until soft and translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in pumpkin puree and coconut milk; add broth until desired consistency is reached. Stir thyme, salt, paprika, garlic powder, and herbes de Provence into pumpkin mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until flavors combine, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
