Cut rounded edges from tortilla to form a square. Spread peanut butter on one half of the tortilla; spread cream cheese on remaining half. Place kiwi slices in a single layer over cream cheese. Starting with the cream cheese end, gently roll up the tortilla to form a log shape. Serve as a wrap or sliced into thick rounds.
