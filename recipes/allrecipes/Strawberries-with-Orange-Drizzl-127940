Rinse the strawberries, remove the hulls, and cut into halves or quarters. In a large bowl, toss the berries with 1 tablespoon of the sugar and the Cointreau. Cover and transfer to the refrigerator to chill, stirring from time to time, at least 1 hour or up to 4 hours. In a medium saucepan, combine the orange juice, 1/2 cup sugar, and the orange zest. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-high, and simmer until thick, syrupy, and reduced to 1/2 cup, about 20 minutes. Set a small bowl inside of a larger bowl filled with half ice and half cold water. Strain the reduced orange juice into the small bowl and stir until chilled. Spoon the strawberries into serving dishes and drizzle liberally with the orange syrup. Sprinkle with pistachios and serve.
