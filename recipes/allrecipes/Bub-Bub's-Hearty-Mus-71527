In a medium pot, bring the rice and water to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 25 minutes. Cut the kielbasa slices in half, and place in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook 5 minutes, until heated through, and season with cayenne pepper, garlic salt, seasoned salt, salt, and pepper. Mix in the vegetables and butter. Cover, and continue cooking about 10 minutes. Serve over the cooked rice.
