Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Arrange fish sticks in a single layer on a baking sheet, and bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until crisp and golden brown. Remove from heat and cut into thirds. Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the tortillas until soft. Drain on paper towels. Fill the heated tortillas with fish stick portions, cabbage, tartar sauce, and salsa to serve.
