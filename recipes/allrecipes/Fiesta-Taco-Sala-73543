Cook meat in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crumbled and no longer pink; drain. Add seasoning mix, tomatoes, and corn. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and cook, uncovered, 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Place 3 cups of greens on each serving dish. Top with meat mixture. Arrange tortilla chips around lettuce. Garnish with olives, onions, cheese, and/or sour cream, if desired.
