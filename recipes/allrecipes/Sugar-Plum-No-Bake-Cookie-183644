Pour the milk into a mixing bowl, and sprinkle 1 package of strawberry gelatin overtop. Stir to dissolve the gelatin, then stir in the coconut and graham cracker crumbs until a stiff dough forms. You may need to use additional graham cracker crumbs to make a firm dough. Roll the dough into approximately 30 - 1 inch balls. Pour the remaining strawberry gelatin into a small bowl, and roll the cookies in the gelatin to coat. Place the cookies onto a serving tray, and press a whole clove into each to form a stem.
