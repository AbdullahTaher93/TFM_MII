Heat olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add onions; cook and stir until onions begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken and continue cooking and stirring, about 5 more minutes. Place a large soup pot on the stove and add chicken and onion mixture, chile cooking sauce, water, corn, black beans, diced tomatoes, chicken bouillon, and V-8 juice. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Ten minutes before soup is ready, lay tortilla strips on a baking sheet and bake in pre-heated oven for 10 minutes, or until nice and crispy. Ladle soup into bowls, add additional toppings if desired, and add a few tortilla strips.
