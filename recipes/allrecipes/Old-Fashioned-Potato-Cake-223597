Mix mashed potatoes, flour, onion, egg, black pepper, and salt together in a bowl until batter consistency. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Drop 4-inch circles of batter into hot oil. Cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining batter.
