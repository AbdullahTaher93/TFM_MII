Remove all unpopped kernels from popcorn. Place popcorn and nuts in a large bowl; mix well. In a saucepan, combine sugar, butter and corn syrup; bring to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat; add vanilla. Pour over popcorn mixture; stir to coat. Place on two greased baking sheets to dry, about 1 hour. Store in an airtight container.
