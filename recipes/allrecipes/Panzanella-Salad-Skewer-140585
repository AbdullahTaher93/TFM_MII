Thread onto each skewer in the following order: bread, tomato, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, bread. Repeat 1 more time adding an additional piece of bread on the end of each skewer. Let sit for 15 to 20 minutes. Lightly brush skewers on each side with olive oil and season to taste with salt and pepper. Place skewers on a preheated medium-high grill and cook until vegetables are cooked crisp/tender, and bread is lightly browned about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Arrange one skewer on to each romaine leaf. Sprinkle each skewer with some of the diced mozzarella cheese and then drizzle with basil pesto.
