Light the grill or heat the broiler. Put the tomatoes in a blender or food processor and add 4 tablespoons of the oil, the lemon juice, cumin, paprika, oregano, ginger, 3/4 teaspoon of the salt, 1/8 teaspoon of the pepper, and the parsley. Blend just until the mixture becomes a coarse puree. Coat the swordfish with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Grill or broil the fish for 4 minutes. Turn and cook until golden brown and just done, about 4 minutes longer. Serve the sauce alongside.
