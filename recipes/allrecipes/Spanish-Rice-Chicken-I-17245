Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium high heat until hot, not smoking. Add chicken pieces and saute until browned, about 5 minutes each side. Remove chicken from skillet and set aside. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in skillet, then add onion and bell pepper and saute, stirring frequently, until onion is translucent (about 5 minutes). Add rice and saute about 2 minutes, stirring, to coat the rice with the oil. Then add the reserved chicken, tomatoes with liquid, chicken broth, bay leaf, paprika and ground black pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove bay leaf and serve.
