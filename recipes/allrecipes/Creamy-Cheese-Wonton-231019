Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix cream cheese, feta cheese, carrot, garlic powder, egg yolk, basil, and parsley together in a bowl. Place a wonton wrapper on a work surface and wet the corners of the wrapper with a moist finger. Spoon 1 teaspoon of filling in the center of the wrapper; fold wrapper over the filling, sealing the edges shut. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling. Place wontons on a baking sheet and brush with soy sauce. Bake in the preheated oven until corners of wontons are brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
