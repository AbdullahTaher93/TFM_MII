Sprinkle 2/3 cup pecans each into three greased 9-in. round baking pans; set aside. In a mixing bowl, cream butter, shortening and sugar. Add egg yolks, one at at time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Combine flour and baking soda; add to creamed mixture alternately with buttermilk. Stir in remaining pecans. In a small mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form; fold into batter. Pour into prepared pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. Brush with corn syrup; cool completely. For filling, in a heavy sauce, combine the brown sugar, cornstarch and salt. Gradually stir in cream until smooth. Add the corn syrup. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from heat. Stir a small amount of hot filling into egg yolks; return all to the pan, stirring constantly. Bring to a gentle boil; cook and stir for 3 minutes. remove from the heat; stir in butter and vanilla. Cover and refrigerate until cool, about 4 hours. Place one cake layer, pecan side up, on a serving plate; spread with about 2/3 cup of filling. Repeat layers twice. Sprinkle with chopped pecans. Refrigerate leftovers.
