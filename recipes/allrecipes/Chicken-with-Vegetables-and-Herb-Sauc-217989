Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place the onion, garlic, thyme, rosemary, sage, and marjoram into a large roasting pan. Mix with the chicken breast pieces, red potatoes, asparagus spears, zucchini, and summer squash, and drizzle with melted butter and olive oil. Sprinkle with salt, black pepper, and hot sauce, and stir the chicken and vegetables to coat with butter, olive oil, and herbs. Cover the roasting pan. Roast in the preheated oven until the chicken and vegetables are cooked through, chicken juices run clear, and vegetables are beginning to brown, about 45 minutes; stir after about 20 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley to serve.
