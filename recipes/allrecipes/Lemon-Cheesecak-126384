Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 9 inch springform pan with cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine the cracker crumbs, pecans, 1/4 cup of the sugar, and butter. Lightly beat 1 of the egg whites in a cup. Add half of the egg white to the bowl; reserve the remainder for another use or discard. Mix well. Press the mixture into the bottom and 1 inch up the sides of the prepared pan. Bake for 10 minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool on a rack. Meanwhile, place the fat-free cream cheese and reduced-fat cream cheese in a food processor. Process for 1 minute, or until smooth. Add the flour and 1 1/2 cups of the remaining sugar. Process for 3 minutes, or until light and fluffy; stop and scrape the sides of the bowl as necessary. Add the lemon juice and process briefly. Add the eggs and the remaining 2 egg whites, one at a time, and process until just incorporated. Place the mixture in the prepared crust. Bake for 1 hour. Remove from the oven; do not turn off the oven. In a small bowl, combine the sour cream and the remaining 1/2 cup sugar. Spread over the hot cheesecake. Bake for 10 minutes. Place on a rack and let cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours.
