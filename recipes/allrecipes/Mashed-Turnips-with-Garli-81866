Rinse and trim the turnips. If they are from late in the season then you may want to peel them unless you ready love that horseradish taste like I do. Cut the turnips into 1 or 2 inch cubes. In a pan over medium-high heat, bring the water to a boil. Add the turnips, reduce to medium heat, cover, stir occasionally and cook for 6-10 minutes or until they fall apart with the poke of a fork. Pour off most of the water (I pour it into a bowl and see if I need any of this liquid in the next step). Add the butter, cream, garlic and salt and pepper. Mash with a potato masher until creamy (or use a food processor). If more liquid is needed add some of the water they were boiled in (there are some vitamins and flavor in there) for no extra carbs. Or add more cream or butter as you like. Taste test and add salt and pepper, as needed. Serve right away or cover and put in a warm oven until ready to serve.
