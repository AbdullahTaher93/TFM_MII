Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking sheet. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter and mix with Dijon-style mustard, rosemary, basil and hot pepper sauce. Dip biscuit dough piece by piece into the butter mixture, and arrange pieces on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown.
