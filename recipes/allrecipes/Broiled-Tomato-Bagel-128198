Line a baking sheet with foil. Place the bagel halves, cut side up, on the sheet. Spread each half with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of the cream cheese and top each with some of the sprouts or spinach, tomatoes, and onion slices. Broil 4 inches (10 cm) from the heat until the bagels begin to brown and are heated through, about 5 minutes.
