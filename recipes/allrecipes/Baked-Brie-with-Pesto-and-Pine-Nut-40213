Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Using a sharp knife, trim the white rind off top of the Brie (top part only, leaving the sides and bottom intact). Place Brie in an 8- or 9-inch pie plate or ovenproof dish. Mix pesto seasoning with olive oil, pine nuts, and garlic, if desired. Spread mixture evenly over the top of the Brie round (where white rind was trimmed off). Sprinkle with black pepper to taste, if desired. Bake 10 minutes or until Brie is warmed through. Serve immediately; surround with assorted crackers.
