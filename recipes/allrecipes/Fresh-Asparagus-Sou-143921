Prepare asparagus by cutting off and discarding the lower 1/3 of the stalk. Cut off the tips, cook for 5 minutes in water, and save for garnishing. Chop up the stalks. In a 2 1/2 quart saucepan, saute chopped asparagus stalks with onion in olive oil for 15 minutes. Sprinkle in the flour, lower heat, and continue to stir while cooking for 10 more minutes. Slowly pour in broth and water, and continue to stir until the broth thickens, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and add LACTAID(R) Fat Free Milk. Using either an immersion blender or a regular blender, process mixture until smooth. Add tarragon, dill, ginger, salt and pepper and mix for 1 minute. Return to low heat and cook until soup is warm. Garnish with asparagus tips.
