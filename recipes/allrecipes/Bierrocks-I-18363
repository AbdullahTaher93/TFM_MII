Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet, cook meat over medium heat until it is browned. Stir in onions and cabbage; cover and cook for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in salt, pepper and cheese; let cool. Roll dough until it is about 1/4 inch thick. Cut into 6 squares and put meat filling on each square. Pinch dough together and place seam side down on cookie sheets. Let dough rise for 20 minutes, then bake in oven for 20 minutes or until brown.
