In a food processor or blender, process undrained peppers with chicken broth, garlic, oregano, and basil until smooth. Transfer liquid to a saucepan, and heat over medium-low heat. Simmer for 5 minutes. Slowly whisk in cream, and heat through. Serve in soup bowls over crumbled feta cheese. Sprinkle additional feta cheese and oregano on top for garnish.
