Fry the bacon in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat until browned. Remove bacon, and set aside while reserving the grease in the pan. Stir the sugar, vinegar and onion into the bacon grease, and reduce the heat to medium. Add the beans, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes or until the beans have reached your desired doneness. Crumble the bacon over the top before serving.
