Place the cashews, orange bell pepper, Cashewmilk, chili powder, and nutritional yeast in a high-powered blender and puree, about 2 to 3 minutes. In a large saucepan, heat the minced onion, taco seasoning, black beans and fresh salsa. Stir constantly until thoroughly heated. Add in the cheese mixture and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt/pepper and garnish with cilantro and/or sliced green onions before serving. Enjoy with your favorite chips or raw vegetables!
