In a medium bowl, combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper. Dredge the meat in the crumbs. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place the breaded meat in the oil, and saute for 5 to 10 minutes, or until well browned on both sides. Drain excess oil, and pour in the spaghetti sauce. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes.
