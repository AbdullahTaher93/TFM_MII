Prepare pasta per package directions without adding salt. Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat while pasta cooks. Add tomatoes and garlic and cook 1 to 2 minutes. Raise heat to high and add wine, salmon, basil, oregano, and capers and cook until salmon is just opaque, about 4 minutes. Drain pasta and add to skillet. Toss with tomatoes and salmon to combine. Divide equally among 4 bowls. Sprinkle with additional basil and oregano, if desired.
