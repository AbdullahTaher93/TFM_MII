In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the milk, sugar, butter, eggs, salt, orange peel, cardamom, mace and 2 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, for filling, in a small mixing bowl, combine the butter, sugar, extract and orange peel; set aside. Toss the fruit and almonds with flour; set aside. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 30-in. x 9-in. rectangle. Spread filling to within 1/2 in. of edges; sprinkle with fruit mixture. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch seam to seal. With a sharp knife, cut roll in half lengthwise. Place on a greased baking sheet; gently twist the ropes together cut side up. Coil into a circle; tuck ends under. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 325 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack to cool. In a mixing bowl, combine orange butter ingredients. Refrigerate until serving.
