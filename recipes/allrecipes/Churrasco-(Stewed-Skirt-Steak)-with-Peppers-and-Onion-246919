Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Sprinkle sazon seasoning and black pepper over steaks; rub in lightly with your fingers. Arrange steaks close together, but not overlapping, in a large casserole dish. Mix green bell peppers, red bell peppers, onion, and garlic together in a large bowl. Spoon over steaks in the casserole dish. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until peppers are soft and steaks are cooked through, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
