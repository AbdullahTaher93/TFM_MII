Line unpricked pastry shell with a double thickness of heavy-duty foil. Bake at 425 degrees F for 10 minutes or until edges begin to brown. Remove foil; set the crust aside. In a skillet, saute mushrooms in butter. Remove with a slotted spoon; set aside. In a bowl, toss cheese with flour; add eggs, milk, savory, salt and pepper. Stir in mushrooms. Pour into crust. Bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand 10 minutes before cutting.
