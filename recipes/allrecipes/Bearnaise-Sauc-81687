In a sauce pan, add the tarragon vinegar, tarragon, lemon pepper and the pinch of paprika. Boil it down until it reduces to about 2 Tbsps. Set aside and let cool to room temp. Then strain into a cup. In a microwave safe bowl, add the butter and zap until completely melted. In the blender, put the egg yolks, minced shallots, mustard and pulse a few times. Scrape down the sides. With the blender on lowest speed, very slowly pour in the melted butter. Continue to blend for about 30 seconds to 1 minute allowing the butter to cook the egg yolk. Then pour in the vinegar mixture. Taste and add salt if needed. Place in a ceramic container in a warm oven until ready to use.
