Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Brown the bratwurst slices in a skillet over medium heat, 10 to 12 minutes, stirring often; drain excess grease and set the sausage aside. Melt the butter with olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook the onions in the butter and oil mixture, stirring often, until soft and brown, about 20 minutes. Set aside. Spread the tortilla chips onto a baking sheet in an even layer. Spread the bratwurst slices, caramelized onions, dollops of refried beans, jalapeno pepper slices, and Mexican cheese blend over the chips. Sprinkle with chili powder, cayenne pepper, and onion powder. Bake the nachos in the preheated oven until hot and the cheese is melted, 10 to 15 minutes. Watch carefully to avoid burning.
