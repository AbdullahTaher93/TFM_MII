In a large deep frying pan, heat the oil over moderate heat. Add the sausage and cook, turning, until browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Remove. When the sausage is cool enough to handle, cut it into slices. Put the garlic and the broth in the pan and bring to a simmer. Add the escarole, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes. Gently stir in the sausage, beans, Parmesan, salt, and pepper and simmer 1 minute longer. Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the pasta until just done, about 14 minutes. Drain and toss with the sauce. Serve with additional Parmesan.
