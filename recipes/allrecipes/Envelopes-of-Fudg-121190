In a mixing bowl, cream butter and cream cheese. Gradually add the flour. On a lightly floured surface, knead until smooth, about 3 minutes. Cover and refrigerate for 1-2 hours or until easy to handle. For filling, combine the sugar, cocoa, butter, yolk, vanilla and salt. Stir in walnuts; set aside. On a lightly floured surface, roll into a 12-1/2-in. square; cut into 2-1/2-in. squares. Place a rounded teaspoonful of filling in center of each square. Bring two opposite corners to center. Moisten edges with water and pinch together. Place 1 in. apart on lightly greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-22 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.
