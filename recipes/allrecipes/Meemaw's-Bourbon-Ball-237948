Grind cookies in a food processor into fine crumbs; transfer to a large mixing bowl. Grind pecans in the food processor; add to cookie crumbs. Stir 1 cup confectioners' sugar, bourbon whiskey, cocoa powder, and corn syrup with the cookies and pecans until the mixture holds together; roll into 3/4-inch balls. Spread coconut onto a plate and 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar onto a separate plate. Roll balls in coconut and sugar to coat. Arrange balls onto a platter, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until hardened, at least 1 hour.
