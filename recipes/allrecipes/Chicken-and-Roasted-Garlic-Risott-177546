Season the chicken as desired. Heat the butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for 10 minutes or until it's well browned on both sides. Remove the chicken and set aside. Stir the soups and water into the skillet. Heat to a boil. Stir in the rice and vegetables. Return the chicken to the skillet and reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Remove from the heat. Let stand for 5 minutes.
