Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Unroll dough; divide into 2 equal sections along center perforation. Press each section to form 8x6-inch rectangle; press perforations to seal. Spread pesto on each dough rectangle. Top each with salami. Carefully spread cream cheese spread and tapenade over salami. Place roasted pepper strips on one long side of each dough rectangle. Starting with roasted pepper-topped long side, roll up loosely; pinch edges to seal. Place, seam side down, in ungreased 15x10x1-inch baking pan. Spread each roll with Parmesan spread from container. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool 10 minutes. Cut each loaf into 10 slices.
