In a large bowl, combine ground beef, eggs, onion, bell pepper, jalapeno peppers, celery, carrots and black beans. Season to taste with Worcestershire sauce, cumin, oregano, basil, salt and pepper. Mix well with hands. Shape into 8 patties. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate. Cook hamburger patties on preheated grill until browned on both sides, to your desired doneness.
