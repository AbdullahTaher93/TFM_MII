In a medium bowl, combine all ingredients except the salmon. Stir to create a paste. Rub the paste to evenly cover the salmon fillets. Place on a plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 5 minutes to 2 hours. Preheat a 10-inch nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Spray with oil and add salmon. Cook 2 minutes per side, then lower heat to medium. Continue cooking until inside is no longer translucent, about 3 minutes per side.
