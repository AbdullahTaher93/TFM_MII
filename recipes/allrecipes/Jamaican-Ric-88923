Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and red apple; cook and stir until onion is transparent. Season with curry powder, and stir in the water. Add the rice and molasses, cover, and cook over low heat until the rice is tender, and water has been absorbed, about 30 minutes. Mix in the banana, then sprinkle the coconut on top. Heat through for a moment over low heat before serving.
