Place zucchini in a medium bowl with Italian-style salad dressing. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator approximately 6 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate. Grill zucchini slices about 2 minutes per side, until browned and tender. Arrange grilled zucchini slices on a medium serving platter. Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese, Pepper Jack cheese and Italian-style seasoning. Microwave on high 90 seconds, or until cheeses are melted. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, and serve hot.
