Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 20 muffin cups with cooking spray. Mix ground turkey, ground sausage, crackers, eggs, soy milk, onion, 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, Italian seasoning, and garlic salt together in a bowl. Fill each muffin cup 3/4-full with turkey mixture. Combine ketchup, brown sugar blend, and 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce together in a bowl until smooth; spoon over each muffin cup; top with Parmesan cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are cooked through, 45 to 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
