Coat three 9-in. round baking pans with nonstick cooking spray and sprinkle with flour; set aside. In a mixing bowl, beat butter and sugar until crumbly, about 2 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Combine the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with buttermilk. Add water; mix well. Pour into prepared pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. cool for 10 minutes; remove from pans to wire racks to cool completely. For frosting, in a heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, egg whites, water, corn syrup and cream of tartar. With a portable mixer, beat mixture on low speed for 1 minute. Continue beating on low over low heat until a candy thermometer reads 160 degrees F, about 5 minutes. Pour into a large mixing bowl; add extract. Beat on high until stiff peaks form, about 7 minutes. Spread frosting between layers and over top and sides of cake.
