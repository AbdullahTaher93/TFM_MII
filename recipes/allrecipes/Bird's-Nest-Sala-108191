Place the egg into a saucepan, and fill with water to cover the egg by 1 inch. Cover the saucepan and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, remove from the heat and let the egg stand in the hot water for 15 minutes. Pour out the hot water, then cool the egg under cold running water in the sink. Peel and slice once cold. Place the lettuce into a salad bowl, and sprinkle evenly with the bell pepper and onion; pour the dressing over top. Pull the sprouts apart , then place on top of the salad into a nest-like shape. Season the egg slices with salt and pepper to taste, and arrange in the center of the nest with the honey-glazed almonds.
