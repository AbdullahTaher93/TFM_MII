Cut fish into 2-inch sticks; season with salt and pepper. Place Ranch, flour, egg and breadcrumbs in separate bowls. Lightly coat each fish stick with dressing and dredge in flour. Dip in egg and then dredge in breadcrumbs until completely covered. Heat oil in large saute pan. Carefully place fish into the pan and saute until golden brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Serve with Ranch dressing for dipping.
