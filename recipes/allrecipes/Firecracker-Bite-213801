Beat cream cheese in large bowl with mixer until creamy. Gradually beat in milk. Add dry pudding mix; beat 2 min. Whisk in 1 cup COOL WHIP. Spoon about 1-1/2 Tbsp. pudding mixture onto each of half the wafers; cover with remaining wafers to make sandwiches. Freeze 2 hours or until filling is firm. Spread tops of wafer sandwiches with remaining COOL WHIP. Dip in sprinkles. Insert licorice piece in top of each for the fuse. Freeze until ready to serve.
