Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine cubed squash, 1 tablespoon oil, red pepper flakes, and garlic in a large bowl; mix to coat. Spread out on a baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven until squash is tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven. Combine black beans, cumin, chili powder, and salt in a small saucepan. Heat over medium-low heat until flavors combine, about 10 minutes. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and red bell pepper; cook and stir until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Place 2 tortillas in the skillet and cook until heated through, about 1 minute per side. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Top tortillas with baked squash, black beans, and onion-red pepper mixture. Garnish with green onions, cilantro, and lime.
