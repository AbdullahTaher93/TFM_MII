Blend garbanzo beans, tahini, red peppers, 1/2 of the lemon juice, vinegar, garlic, and salt together in a blender or food processor until hummus is smooth, adding more lemon juice as necessary to reach desired consistency. Pour hummus into a serving bowl; drizzle with olive oil and a pinch of paprika.
