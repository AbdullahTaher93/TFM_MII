In a small saucepan, bring 1 cup broth, 1 cup water and the butter to a boil. Stir in the rice, cover and cook over medium-low heat for 15 minutes. Stir in the peas and cook for 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and fluff with a fork. Stir in the scallions, almonds and half of the parsley. Place a rack 6 inches from the flame and preheat the broiler to high. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat with the EVOO, 3 turns of the pan. Add the bacon and cook until just crisp, about 3 minutes, then move to the side. Add the mushrooms and bay leaf and cook for 7 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes; season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in the flour and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the wine, scraping up all the browned bits, and boil to reduce by half, about 4 minutes. Stir in the remaining 1 1/2 cups beef broth and the onions and simmer for 5 minutes. Discard the bay leaf and adjust the seasonings. Meanwhile, place the steaks in a broiler pan and drizzle with a little EVOO. Broil the steaks for 5 minutes on the first side and 3 minutes on the second side for medium doneness. Brush with a little Worcestershire sauce and season with salt and pepper. Let rest for a few minutes, then slice against the grain on the diagonal. Serve the steak with the Burgundy sauce, the remaining parsley and the rice alongside.
