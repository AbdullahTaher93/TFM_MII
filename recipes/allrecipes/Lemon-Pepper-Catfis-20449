Combine flour, cornmeal and lemon pepper spice; set aside. In a separate bowl, lightly beat eggs. In a large frying pan, melt margarine over medium-high heat. Working one at a time, dip filets in egg and dredge in flour until well coated. Cook in hot margarine, turning once, until brown on both sides. Drain briefly on paper towels and serve.
