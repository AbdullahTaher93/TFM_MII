Place turkey carcass in a large pot over high heat. Add the carrots, celery, onion, garlic, parsley sprigs, peppercorns, bay leaves, thyme, chicken bouillon granules, water and enough water to cover all. Bring to a boil, uncovered, then reduce heat to medium low and let simmer for 1 1/2 hours. Remove the turkey carcass and allow it to cool. Remove any meat from the carcass, cut into bite-sized pieces and set aside. Strain the stock through a sieve OR a colander covered with cheesecloth into another large pot. Discard the unstrained ingredients. Place the turkey meat into the pot, cover and refrigerate overnight. The next day, use a slotted spoon to remove the fat that has solidified on top of the stock. Return the stock to a large pot over high heat, add the turnip, parsnips and carrots and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for one hour, or until vegetables are tender. Add the green beans, peas and beans and allow to heat through, about 15 minutes. Finally add the chopped parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste.
