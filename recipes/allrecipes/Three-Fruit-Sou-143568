In a large bowl, soak the barley in the water overnight; do not drain. In a large saucepan over low heat, simmer the barley for one hour. Then add SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, raspberries and raisins and simmer for another 30 minutes. Add cherries and simmer for another 15 minutes, or until the soup becomes relatively thick. Allow to chill in the refrigerator and serve cold.
