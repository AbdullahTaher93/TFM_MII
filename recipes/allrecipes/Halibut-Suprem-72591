Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. In a bowl, mix the Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream, flour, lemon juice, onion, and cayenne pepper. Arrange the halibut steaks in the prepared baking dish, and cover with the Cheddar cheese mixture. Bake 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and continue baking 15 minutes, or until fish is easily flaked with a fork.
