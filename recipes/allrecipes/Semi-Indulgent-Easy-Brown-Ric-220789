Pour chicken broth into measuring cup with butter and lemon juice to measure a total of 1 cup. Stir chicken broth mixture into rice mixture until all ingredients are moistened. Cover with microwave-safe lid. Heat in the microwave oven until rice is tender and has absorbed the liquid, about 7 minutes. Remove and let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff with fork before serving.
