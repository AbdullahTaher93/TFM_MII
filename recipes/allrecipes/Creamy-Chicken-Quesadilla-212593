Heat the oven to 425 degrees F. Stir the soup, chicken, cheese and picante sauce in a medium bowl. Place the tortillas on 2 baking sheets. Spread about 1/4 cup chicken mixture onto half of each tortilla to within 1/2-inch of the edge. Brush the edges of the tortillas with water. Fold the tortillas over the filling and press the edges to seal. Bake for 5 minutes or until the filling is hot. Serve with additional picante sauce.
