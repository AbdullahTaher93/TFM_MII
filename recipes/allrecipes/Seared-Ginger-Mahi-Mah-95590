Combine honey, soy, vinegar, broth, ginger and garlic in a shallow glass dish; set aside. Season fillets with pepper and place skin side down in marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Remove fillets from dish and reserve marinade. Add fish to skillet flesh side down and cook for 5 minutes. Turn fillets over and continue to cook until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork, about 5 minutes. Transfer fish to a platter, cover and keep warm. Pour reserved marinade into the hot pan; boil and cook until mixture reduces to a glaze, about 2 minutes. Whisk in butter and spoon sauce over fish. Serve immediately.
