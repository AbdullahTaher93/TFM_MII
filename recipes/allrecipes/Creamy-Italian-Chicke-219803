Place the chicken breast pieces into the bottom of a slow cooker. Pour in water, and stir in the salad dressing mix. Cover the cooker, set on low, and cook 3 or more hours (see note). With an electric mixer, beat the soup, cream cheese, and mushrooms in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Mix with the chicken and any juices in the slow cooker. Cover and cook 1 more hour.
