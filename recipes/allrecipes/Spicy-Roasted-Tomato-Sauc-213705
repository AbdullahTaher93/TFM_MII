Cover a large griddle or skillet with aluminum foil and heat on the stove over medium-high heat. Roast the garlic, serrano peppers, onion, and tomatoes on the hot griddle, turning frequently, until lightly blackened, but not burned, about 5 minutes for the garlic, 10 minutes for the peppers and onions, and 15 minutes for the tomatoes. Set the vegetables aside to cool. Blend the garlic, peppers, onion, tomatoes, and salt in a blender or food processor until smooth. Store covered in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
