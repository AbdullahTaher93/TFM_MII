In a heatproof bowl, pour boiling water over bulgur. Let stand 1 hour at room temperature. In a small bowl, beat together oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Pour over bulgur; and mix with a fork. Place bulgur in the bottom of a nice glass serving bowl. Layer vegetables and garbanzo beans in this order on top of the bulgur: green onions, garbanzo beans, parsley, and carrots on top. Cover, and refrigerate. Toss salad just before serving.
