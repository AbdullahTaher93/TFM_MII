Dissolve the kosher salt in 1 gallon of water in a large pot. Add the shrimp, and refrigerate 2 to 4 hours. Drain and pat shrimp dry with paper towels. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the angel hair pasta, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through but is still firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Meanwhile, melt the butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the shrimp, white wine, lemon juice, and red pepper flakes. Cook and stir until the shrimp is no longer translucent in the center, about 6 minutes. Stir in the black pepper, parsley, and lemon zest before tossing with the angel hair pasta.
