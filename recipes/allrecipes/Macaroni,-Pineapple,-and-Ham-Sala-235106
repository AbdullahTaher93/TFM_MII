Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain. Transfer hot macaroni to a large bowl. Pour Italian-style salad dressing and crushed pineapple over the macaroni; stir. Add ham, celery, tomatoes, eggs, and onion; stir. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.
