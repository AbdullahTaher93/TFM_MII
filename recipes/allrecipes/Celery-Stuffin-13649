Melt butter in saucepan. Saute onion in melted butter until soft, but not brown. Add celery and stir well. Add 2 cups chicken broth. Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Place bread cubes into large mixing bowl. Add eggs, salt, pepper, sage, thyme, and marjoram. Add onion-celery mixture; combine thoroughly. If still too dry, add more chicken broth. Makes enough to stuff a 10 to 15 pound turkey.
