For topping, in a medium bowl stir together whole wheat pastry flour, baking powder, the 1/4 teaspoon ginger, and the kosher salt. Using a pastry blender, cut in oil until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Set aside. For filling, in a large saucepan stir together the water and cornstarch until combined. Stir in sugar substitute. Add peach slices. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Stir in raspberries and/or blueberries. Cook, stirring gently, until bubbly. Cover and keep filling hot while finishing topping. To finish topping, in a small bowl stir together yogurt and egg. Add yogurt mixture to flour mixture, stirring just until moistened. Divide filling among eight 6-ounce custard cups or four 10- to 12-ounce casseroles.* Drop the topping from a spoon onto hot filling. Drop 1 mound into each custard cup or 2 mounds into each casserole. Place custard cups or casseroles on a baking sheet. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into topping comes out clean. Cool slightly. If desired, sprinkle with additional ginger. Serve warm.
