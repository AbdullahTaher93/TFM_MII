Pour all garbanzo beans into the bowl of a food processor; pulse several times to slightly break some of the beans. Add garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, cumin, basil, salt, cayenne pepper, and ground black pepper; blend until the beans are beginning to look like large crumbs, about 1 minute. With the food processor running, gradually stream reserved liquid from garbanzo beans, olive oil, and sesame oil into the beans mixture; continue to blend until all liquids are integrated with the garbanzo bean mixture into a smooth hummus.
