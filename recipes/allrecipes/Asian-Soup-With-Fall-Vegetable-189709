In a medium stockpot over high heat, combine 7 1/2 cups chicken broth, onions, and rice blend (including seasoning packet). Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until rice is tender, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm olive oil. Add squash and cook, stirring occasionally, until starting to brown, about 6 minutes. Add turkey, mushrooms, thyme, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender, about 4 minutes. Stir in remaining 2 1/2 cups stock, scraping up any browned bits in skillet. Transfer mixture to a bowl or plate; set aside until rice is tender. Add vegetable mixture to rice mixture, stirring until ingredients are heated through.
