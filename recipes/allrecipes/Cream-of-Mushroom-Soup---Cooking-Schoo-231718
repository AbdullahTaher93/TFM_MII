Melt butter in a soup pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in the melted butter until golden brown, about 7 minutes. Add mushrooms to the onion mixture; cook and stir until softened, 5 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle flour over the mushroom mixture and stir until no longer lumpy and aromatic, 2 to 3 minutes. Slowly pour beef broth over mushroom mixture and stir to combine. Bring broth to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer mushroom mixture, stirring frequently, until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the cream into the mushroom mixture and cook until soup is thickened, 5 to 10 minutes more. Stir parsley into soup.
