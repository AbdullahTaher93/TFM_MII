Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain well. Combine the sausage, onion, and garlic in a saucepan over medium heat; cook until sausage is completely browned and onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir together the pumpkin puree, cream, ginger, salt, and pepper in a saucepan over medium-low heat; add the sausage mixture and stir. Simmer until heated through, about 3 minutes. Toss with drained pasta to serve.
