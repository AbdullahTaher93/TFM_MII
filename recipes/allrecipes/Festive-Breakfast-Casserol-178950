Cook the sausage in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently to break up meat. Pour off any fat. Arrange sausage in a 2-quart shallow baking dish. Top with bread cubes and cheese. Mix picante sauce, eggs and milk and pour over all. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight. Bake uncovered at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
