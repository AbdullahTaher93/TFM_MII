Cut baguette in half horizontally; remove bread from center of each half, leaving 1 inch thick shells. Reserve removed bread for another use. Mix cream cheese spread and pesto until well blended. Spread evenly on bottom of both baguette halves. Top bottom half of baguette with tomatoes, artichokes, Parmesan cheese and spinach. Cover with second baguette half; press together firmly. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to serve or up to 24 hours. Cut into 25 slices to serve.
