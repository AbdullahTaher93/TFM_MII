Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. In a medium bowl, combine chicken, celery, tomatoes, zucchini, raisins, parsley, and mint, and set aside. In a small bowl, whisk together stock, ginger, garlic, curry powder, chutney, 3/4 teaspoon salt, red pepper, and cornstarch. Pour over chicken-vegetable mixture, and toss to combine. Meanwhile, bring 1/2 cup water and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt to a boil in a small saucepan. Stir in couscous, and remove from heat. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork, cover again, and set aside until ready to serve. Fold two 24-inch lengths of aluminum foil in half crosswise, and unfold. Place half the chicken-vegetable mixture on one of the pieces of foil, 2 to 3 inches from the fold. Refold along the crease, enclosing mixture, and make a double 1/2-inch fold along the 3 open sides. Repeat process to make the second packet. Place both packets on a baking sheet, and bake for 18 minutes. Divide couscous between two bowls. Open packets, arrange contents over couscous, and serve immediately.
