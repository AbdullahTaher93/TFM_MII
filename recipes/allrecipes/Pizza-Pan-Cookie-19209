Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease two 12 inch pizza pans. In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar and white sugar, until smooth. Beat in the cream cheese, then the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; gradually stir into the creamed mixture. Fold in the chocolate chips and walnuts. Divide the dough in half and press each half onto a prepared pizza pan. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden at the edges. Cool completely in pans on wire racks. Cut into wedges like a pizza and serve.
