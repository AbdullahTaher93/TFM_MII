Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Drizzle melted butter over bread cubes in a large bowl; toss until butter is completely soaked into bread. Spread bread cubes onto a baking sheet. Sprinkle garlic salt evenly over the cubes. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool completely before storing in an airtight container.
