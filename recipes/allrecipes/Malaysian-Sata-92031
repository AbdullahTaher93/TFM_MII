In a blender or food processor, combine garlic, onion, cumin, coriander, sugar, turmeric, lemon grass, and oil. Whirl until smooth; then transfer to a large bowl. Cut beef into 1-inch cubes; add to marinade and mix to coat well. Then thread beef on five 14-inch-long metal or bamboo skewers (if using bamboo, soak them first in warm water). Place skewers on a lightly oiled grill 4 to 6 inches above a solid bed of very hot coals (you can hold your hand at grill level for only 1 to 2 seconds) or over very high heat on a gas grill. Close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning as needed to brown evenly, until beef is done to your liking; cut to test (5 to 7 minutes for medium). Serve beef on or off skewers; season to taste with salt.
