Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. In a baking pan, toss the garlic with the oats, butter and honey and season lightly with salt. Spread the oats in an even layer and bake for about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned. Spread the crunch on a plate and let cool completely, until crisp. Meanwhile, in a blender, combine the goat cheese, parsley, thyme, vinegar, scallion, skim milk and olive oil and blend until smooth. Scrape the dressing into a bowl and season with salt and pepper. In a large bowl, toss the lettuce and tomatoes with 1/2 cup of the dressing. Sprinkle some of the crunch over the salad and serve. Reserve the remaining dressing and crunch for another use.
