In a bowl, combine tomato juice, egg, bread crumbs, dried tomato, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, celery salt, and hot sauce. Add ground beef and gently mix with a fork just until ingredients are evenly blended. Divide meat mixture into 4 equal portions. With your hands, shape burgers into 3/4inch thick patties. If making ahead of time, lay patties side by side on a plate, cover airtight, and chill up to 24 hours. Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for direct heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is directly under the food). For charcoal grill: Before you put the grill over the hot coals, brush it with a generous coat of oil. For gas grill: When hot, brush grill with a generous coat of oil. In a small bowl, with a fork, mix mayonnaise and horseradish to blend. Lay patties on well oiled grill over a solid bed of medium hot coals or medium high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand just above grill level only 3 to 4 seconds). Keep charcoal grill uncovered; close lid on gas grill. Cook 5 minutes, then turn burgers with a wide spatula. Continue to cook cooking until meat is no longer pink in center (cut to test), about 5 minutes longer. Spread hamburger buns with horseradish mayonnaise. Transfer burgers to buns and garnish to taste.
