Preheat grill to high. Oil grill rack (see Tip). Mash together avocado and mayonnaise in a small bowl with a fork. Rub blackening (or Cajun) seasoning on both sides of salmon. Grill until just cooked through, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. To assemble the sandwiches, spread the avocado mixture on the bottom halves of each roll. Top with the salmon, arugula, tomato and onion.
