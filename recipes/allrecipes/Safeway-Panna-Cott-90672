In a 1 1/2- to 2-quart pan, use a heavy spoon to rub the pared strip of lemon peel with sugar to release peel oils (don't mash the peel). Stir in the gelatin, then add 1/2 cup water. Slit vanilla bean lengthwise but do not cut apart (if using extract, save for Step 4). Add to pan. Heat, stirring, until mixture simmers and is clear. Beat half-and-half with egg yolks to blend, and stir into pan. Stir on low heat for 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat and lift out lemon peel and vanilla bean. Discard peel. Scrape seeds from vanilla pod and return seeds to pan (or add vanilla extract). Whisk cooked mixture into sour cream, then return to pan. Nest pan in ice water and stir often until mixture just begins to thicken, 6 to 8 minutes. Pour into straight-sided 1/2-cup molds (use metal if unmolding). Cover and chill until firm, at least 3 hours. Serve from molds or, to unmold, quickly dip pans, one at a time, to the rim in very hot water just until dessert loosens slightly at rim. Dry mold, then invert onto serving plate (you may need to slip a thin knife between dessert and pan to release suction). Garnish portions with thin strands of lemon peel.
