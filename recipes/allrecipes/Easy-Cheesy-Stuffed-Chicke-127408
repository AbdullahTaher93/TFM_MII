Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Melt butter in medium saucepan on medium heat. Add zucchini and onions; cook and stir 2 min. or until tender. Remove from heat. Stir in stuffing mix and cheese until well blended. Insert fingers carefully between the meat and skin of each chicken quarter to form a pocket. Fill pockets evenly with stuffing mixture. Place, skin sides up, in large roasting pan. Bake 45 min. or until chicken is cooked through. Brush with barbecue sauce. Bake an additional 5 to 10 min. or until heated through.
