Make the slaw by mixing together the cabbage, 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, the vinegar, sugar, adobo seasoning, and black pepper until thoroughly combined. Cover and refrigerate. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cut the potatoes into 1/4-inch thick fries, and fry until they float and are golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Set the fries aside. Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Place the bread on a baking sheet, and toast to a light brown in the preheated oven, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove half the bread slices. Place 1/4 of the pastrami on the remaining 4 bread slices, and top with provolone cheese. Return to the oven until the pastrami is hot and the cheese is melted, about 5 more minutes. To assemble, top the melted cheese of each sandwich with French fries, cole slaw, 2 tomato slices, and the top pieces of bread.
