Beat eggs, mayonnaise, parsley, chives, seafood seasoning, mustard, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl until smooth. Gently stir crabmeat into the egg mixture. Fold crushed crackers into the crab mixture in small amounts just until the mixture holds together. Divide the mixture into 3-ounce patties. Heat a small amount of oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in hot oil until browned and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side.
