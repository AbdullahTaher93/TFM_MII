Heat the oil in a sauce pan over medium heat. Cook and stir the carrots, oil, onion, and garlic in the hot oil until soft, about 5 minutes; transfer to a blender. Add the whole habanero peppers, water, lime juice, white vinegar, and tomato to blender; blend until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer mixture to a saucepan, and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. This gives the sauce a more liquid consistency.
