Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk eggs, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Place panko bread crumbs in another bowl. Dip each cauliflower floret in egg mixture to coat, then dip each floret into bread crumbs to coat; place on prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until tender and lightly browned, turning once, about 25 minutes.
