Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet. Wash eggplant and slice into 1/4 to 1/2 inch slices. In a medium bowl, stir together the egg and sour cream until well blended. Toss the eggplant slices with the flour to coat. Dip one slice at a time into the batter then coat with the seasoned bread crumbs. Place coated eggplant onto the prepared cookie sheet and spray the tops with cooking spray. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, then turn the slices over and continue to cook for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, or until both sides are brown and crisp.
