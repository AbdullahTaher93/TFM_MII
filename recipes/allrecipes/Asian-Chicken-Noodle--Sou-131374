Heat oil in a stockpot over medium heat. Add garlic and ginger to pan; saute 2 minutes, stirring often (do not brown). Add chicken, sambal oelek, and fish sauce; cook 2 minutes, stirring often. Stir in broth and water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat; stir in lime juice. Meanwhile, place noodles in a large bowl; cover with boiling water. Let stand 10 minutes or until noodles are tender; drain. Divide noodles evenly among four soup bowls; ladle about 2 cups soup over each serving. Sprinkle with chopped peanuts, if desired.
