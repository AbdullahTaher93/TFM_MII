Coat a cookie sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside. Place the caramels in a bowl, and heat in the microwave for about 2 minutes, or until melted and bubbly. Some microwaves may take longer. Stir in the peanuts, and pour out onto the prepared baking sheet. Press as thinly as you can. Cool completely, then break into pieces.
