In a large saucepan, combine the rhubarb, sugar and water and bring to a boil. Cover and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the rhubarb breaks down, about 10 minutes. Uncover and cook, stirring frequently, until the liquid has evaporated and the rhubarb is thick and jammy, about 10 minutes longer. Transfer the rhubarb to a bowl and refrigerate until chilled. Stir in the rose syrup and lemon juice. In a medium bowl, beat the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Spoon half of the rhubarb into 10 wine or parfait glasses and top with half of the sliced strawberries and half of the whipped cream. Repeat with the remaining rhubarb, strawberries and cream. Garnish with the rose petals and serve.
