Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place cream cheese and butter in a 8x8-inch casserole dish. Heat in microwave in 2-minute intervals until melted; stir until smooth. Mix black beans, tomatoes, Mexican-style corn, and white corn into the cream cheese mixture. Bake casserole in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 20 minutes. Stir 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese into casserole until incorporated; top with jalapeno peppers and remaining 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese. Bake until cheese topping is melted and bubbling, 3 to 5 more minutes.
