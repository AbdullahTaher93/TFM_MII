Brush 1 tablespoon oil over 4 of the tortillas. Place oiled sides down on cookie sheet. Combine cheese, shrimp, green chilies and cilantro; spoon evenly over tortillas, spreading to edges. Top with remaining tortillas, pressing down to compact filling. Brush remaining 1 tablespoon oil over tops of tortillas. Bake in a preheated 450 degrees F oven for 6 minutes or until golden brown on bottom. Use a large spatula to turn quesadillas over. Continue baking until tops are golden brown, about 2 minutes longer. While quesadillas are baking, prepare guacamole by mashing avocado with salsa and garlic salt. Cut quesadillas into quarters; serve with guacamole and, if desired, additional salsa.
