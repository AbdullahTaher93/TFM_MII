Arrange pocket breads slightly apart on a 14- by 17-inch baking sheet. Spread 1/4 of the beans evenly on each round. Top beans equally with chicken, onion, chilies, and cheese. Bake in a 425 degree regular or convection oven until pocket breads are crisp and cheese is melted, about 8 minutes (6 minutes in a convection oven). Transfer each round to a plate. Mound cabbage equally on rounds and top with cilantro. Serve tostadas with salsa and salt and pepper to add to taste.
