Simmer wine and shallots in small saucepan over medium heat until liquid evaporates completely, 35 to 40 minutes. Place butter in medium-size mixing bowl. Add red wine-shallot mixture, salt and pepper. With wire whisk or wooden spoon, mix well. Place in refrigerator to harden for at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Rinse chicken with water and pat dry with paper towels. Rub inside and out with salt and pepper to taste. Without tearing or puncturing the skin, slip your fingers between skin and flesh to detach (but not remove) skin. Rub half of red wine-shallot butter all over chicken under the loosened skin. Reheat remaining half of butter mixture and toss with bread cubes. Mix in raisins. Fill cavity of chicken with raisin-bread stuffing. Truss chicken with kitchen string by tying legs together and then tying legs and wings tightly against the body. Place in a roasting pan and smear additional butter over all. Roast for 20 minutes. Add 1 cup water to the pan. Continue to roast, basting occasionally until the juices run clear when thigh is pierced with a sharp knife, about 40 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to cutting board. Snip trussing stings and discard them. Remove stuffing from cavity and arrange around edge of serving platter or spoon into bowl. Carve the chicken and place pieces in center of platter. Serve immediately.
