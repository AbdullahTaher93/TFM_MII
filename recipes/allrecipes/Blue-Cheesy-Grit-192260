Combine the chicken broth and milk in a saucepan, and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Gradually stir in the grits. Cover the pan and simmer over low heat for about 5 minutes, until the grits are thickened and tender. Remove the grits from the heat, and stir in the blue cheese, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well to combine, and serve hot.
