In a medium skillet over medium heat, heat oil until hot. Cook pounded turkey slices for 1 to 2 minutes per side or until no longer pink. Set aside. Heat broiler; arrange bread on a baking sheet and broil until lightly toasted. Mix yogurt, horseradish and mustard; spread half of mixture on bread slices. Lay a slice of cooked turkey on each piece of bread. Layer tomato and avocado on turkey. Drizzle each sandwich with remaining yogurt mixture. Top with onion and cheese. Serve immediately or broil until cheese melts, about 2 minutes. Garnish with fresh greens or basil, if desired.
