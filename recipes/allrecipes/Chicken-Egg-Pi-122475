Unroll crescent dough; separate into triangles. Arrange in a greased 9-in. pie plate, forming a crust; seal seams and perforations. Sprinkle with 1 cup cheese, bacon and ham. In a bowl, beat eggs, milk, salt and pepper. Pour over the ham. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Cover edges of crust loosely with foil. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes. Remove foil. Bake 20 minutes longer or until knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
