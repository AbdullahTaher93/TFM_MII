Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken breasts skin-side up in an 11x17 inch baking dish. In a medium bowl combine soup, mushrooms with liquid, sour cream and sherry. Mix well and pour mixture over chicken. Sprinkle with paprika. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 1 1/4 hours, or until chicken is cooked through and tender, and juices run clear.
