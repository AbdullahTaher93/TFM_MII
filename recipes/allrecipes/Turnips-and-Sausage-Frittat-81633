In a small bowl, beat the eggs with the milk, mustard, thyme, sage, salt and pepper. Slice the sausage links about 1/4 inch thick; set aside. If you are only so-so with turnips you can peel them to reduce that distinctive flavor and make them more like potatoes. Cut into cubes about the same size as the sausage; set aside. Dice the red and green pepper and mince the scallions, set aside. Measure out the cheese and set aside. Prepare broiler, set rack as close as it can go and preheat. In a skillet over medium heat, melt the butter and saute the sausage and turnips for about 1 minute. Add the peppers and saute another minute. Add the scallions and saute another minute. Carefully pour off the fat (use a paper towel to wipe it down even more if desired). Reduce heat to medium, add the egg mixture and started scraping it up from the bottom and sides (just a bit more gently then you would for scrambled eggs). When it is about 1/2 way set (still quite runny) fold in about 1/2 of the cheese and remove from heat. Smooth out top with your spatula and sprinkle the remaining cheese evenly over the top. Put under the broiler with the skillet handle propping open the door. Broil until the cheese starts to turn brown. Be sure to use a towel or pot holder to remove the skillet. If you used a non-stick skillet it will slide out easily onto a plate where it can be cut into pie wedges to be served.
