In a large saute pan, cook the broccoli stir fry on MEDIUM heat with the oil until vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 30 seconds more. Add the picked chicken, stir fry sauce and sesame seeds and cook for 2 minutes more until heated through. Divide the mixture between the four wraps and carefully roll burrito style. Slice and serve. For ease, they can be secured with a toothpick.
