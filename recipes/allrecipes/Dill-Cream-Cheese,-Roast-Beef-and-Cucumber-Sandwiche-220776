Wrap grated cucumber in a clean kitchen towel; squeeze to release liquid from cucumber. Transfer grated cucumber to a bowl. Mix cream cheese, dill, salt, and black pepper into grated cucumber. Spread cream cheese mixture over bread slices. Divide roast beef and cucumber slices on 5 slices bread and place another slice of bread spread-side down on top to make 5 sandwiches.
