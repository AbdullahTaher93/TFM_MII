Bring 2 quarts of water and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil in a large soup kettle. Add pasta; using package directions as a guide, boil until just tender. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking liquid, drain and return pasta to kettle. Meanwhile, heat oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Add onions; cook until tender, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add mushrooms; cook until they start to brown, about 5 minutes. Add olives, tomatoes and oregano; simmer to heat through and blend flavors, 2 to 3 minutes. Add contents of skillet, 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking liquid and the cheese to the pasta; toss to coat, adding more water if necessary to keep pasta moist. Top pasta with pepper; serve with extra Romano cheese passed separately
