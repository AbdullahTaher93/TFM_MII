Sprinkle 1/4 cup bread crumbs into a greased 8-in. square baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F for 3-5 minutes or until golden brown. In a bowl, combine the spinach, cottage cheese, Romano cheese, three eggs and remaining crumbs. Spread over the baked crumbs. Beat remaining eggs; pour over spinach mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand for 5-10 minutes before serving.
