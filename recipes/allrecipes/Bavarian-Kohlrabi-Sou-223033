Combine kohlrabi, cabbage, carrots, red bell peppers, green bell peppers, green beans, and parsley in a stockpot. Pour enough chicken broth over the vegetables to cover; bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Season with sugar, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Top with sour cream and horseradish.
