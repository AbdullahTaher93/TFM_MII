In a bowl, combine the first five ingredients; set aside. In a heavy saucepan over low heat, melt butter and 2/3 cup butterscotch chips. Remove from the heat. Stir in the dry ingredients and egg; mix well. Spread into an ungreased 15-n. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Sprinkle with peanuts and remaining chips. Bake at 300 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until lightly browned. Immediately cut into bars and remove from pan. Cool on wire racks. Store in an airtight container.
