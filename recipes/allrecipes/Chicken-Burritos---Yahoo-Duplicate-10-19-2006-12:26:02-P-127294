Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spoon 1/4 cup beans down center of each tortilla; top with 1 Tbsp. of the salsa. Sprinkle evenly with chicken breast strips. Fold in sides of tortillas; roll up tightly from bottom. Place, seam sides down, in 13x9-inch baking dish; top with remaining salsa. Sprinkle with cheese; cover. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until burritos are heated through and cheese is melted.
