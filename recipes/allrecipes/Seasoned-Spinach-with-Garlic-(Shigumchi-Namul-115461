Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add spinach and cook, stirring, just until it turns bright green, about 30 seconds. Drain and rinse immediately with cold water. Squeeze out excess water. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Remove from the heat, add the spinach, scallion, sesame seeds and salt; stir to combine. Let stand for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to seep into the spinach. Serve warm or cold, sprinkled with additional toasted sesame seeds.
