Place the shredded sweet potatoes into a colander and rinse with cold water; allow to dry. Whisk together the eggs, brown sugar, flour, and vanilla in a large bowl. Stir in the sweet potatoes; mix well. Form into small patties. Heat oil in a large skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry patties in batches until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Spread with butter; sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve hot.
