Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat, and saute the onions and mushrooms until tender. Mix in the wine, and continue cooking about 5 minutes, until heated through. In a large bowl, mix the Ranch dressing, garlic powder, oregano, Cajun seasoning, and cayenne pepper. Stir the skillet mixture into the bowl. Mix in remaining 2 tablespoons butter, eggs, and crackers. Dip the chicken breasts in the Ranch dressing mixture to coat. Arrange chicken in a medium baking dish. Cover with the remaining dressing mixture. Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
