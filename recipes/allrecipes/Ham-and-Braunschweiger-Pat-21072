In a medium bowl, blend the braunschweiger liverwurst, ham spread, dry mustard, pepper, thyme, hot sauce and beer. In small bowl, soften the gelatin in the water. Bring the beef broth to a boil in a small saucepan. Mix in the gelatin, allowing it to dissolve. Remove from heat and cool 5 minutes. Blend the gelatinized beef broth with the braunschweiger liverwurst mixture. Transfer the mixture to a 4 cup mold and chill a minimum of 2 hours. Transfer the chilled mixture to a platter, and sprinkle with parsley before serving.
