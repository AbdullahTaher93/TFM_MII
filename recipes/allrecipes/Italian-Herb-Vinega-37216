PLACE chopped herbs, shallots, and peppercorns in a large glass container. BRING vinegar to a boil, and pour over herb mixture. Cover and let stand at room temperature 2 weeks. POUR mixture through a wire-mesh strainer into decorative bottles, discarding solids. Add sprigs of fresh rosemary, oregano, and thyme, if desired, and seal. Store bottles in a cool, dry place up to 6 months.
