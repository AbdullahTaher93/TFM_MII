Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Cook asparagus in hot oil, turning regularly, until slightly tender, about 5 minutes; add bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder. Turn asparagus with a spatula to coat evenly with the mixture. Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking until the asparagus is completely tender, about 8 minutes. Season with sea salt.
