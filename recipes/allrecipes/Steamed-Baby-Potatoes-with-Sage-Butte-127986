Steam the potatoes 20 to 25 minutes, until just tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from heat and keep covered until ready to serve. Meanwhile, heat the butter, oil, garlic, and sage in a small skillet over low heat; cook 1 to 2 minutes, until garlic is just softened but not browned. Transfer potatoes to a serving bowl; drizzle the butter over the top. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Serve piping hot.
