Place each chicken piece between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. Pound lightly with the flat side of a meat mallet into a rectangle about 1/8 inch thick. Remove plastic wrap. Top chicken with the tomato, Parmesan cheese, the 1/4 teaspoon herb, and the pepper. Fold in long sides of chicken; roll into a spiral. Secure with wooden toothpicks. Spray a 2-quart square baking dish with nonstick coating. Set aside. In a shallow dish combine the egg white and water. In another shallow dish combine the cornflake crumbs and the 1/2 teaspoon herb. Dip each roll into the egg mixture, then roll in crumb mixture to coat. Place rolls in prepared dish. Bake in a 400 degree F. oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until chicken is tender and no longer pink. Remove toothpicks. If desired, slice rolls; serve with Classico(R) Tomato and Basil pasta sauce over pasta.
