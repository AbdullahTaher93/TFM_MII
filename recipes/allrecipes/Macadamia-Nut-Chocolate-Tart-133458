In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat 10 tablespoons of the butter with the granulated sugar until creamy. Add 1 of the eggs, 1 teaspoon of the vanilla and the salt and beat until combined. Add the flour and mix well, then shape the dough into a flat disk, wrap in plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the brown sugar, corn syrup and the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter and 1 teaspoon of the vanilla to a simmer. In a small bowl, whisk the remaining 2 eggs, then add a few tablespoons of the hot syrup to warm the eggs. Remove the syrup from the heat and whisk the warmed eggs into the syrup. Strain the filling into a bowl and chill for 1 hour. Divide the chilled dough into 6 equal parts and roll out, 1 piece at a time, on a floured surface into 6-inch rounds. Press each piece of dough into a 4-inch tart pan (about 3/4 inch deep) or ring mold and trim around the rim. Refrigerate for at least 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350. Divide the nuts and chocolate evenly among the unbaked tart shells and place them on a baking sheet. Pour in the filling and bake for 30 minutes. Cool the tarts on a rack for 10 to 15 minutes before removing them from the pans. Serve with vanilla ice cream.
