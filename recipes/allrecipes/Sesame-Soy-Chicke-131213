In a small bowl, stir together first seven ingredients. Pour into a large zip-top plastic bag, add chicken breasts, and shake to coat. Marinate in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours. Remove chicken from bag, and pat dry. Reserve excess marinade. In a skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Saute chicken until golden brown on one side. Turn chicken, pour in marinade and water. Cover pan, lower heat, and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 10 to 12 minutes. Plate chicken, and spoon sauce over it. Garnish with scallion greens. Serve with scallion pancakes if desired.
