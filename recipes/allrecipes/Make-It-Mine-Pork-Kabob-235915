In a self-sealing plastic bag combine cubed pork, soy sauce, vinegar, ginger and Dijon-style mustard (or Chinese Five Spice); seal bag and refrigerate for 1 to 4 hours. Prepare medium-hot fire with charcoal or preheat gas to medium high. Remove pork from marinade; discard marinade. Thread pork, sweet peppers, mushrooms, and zucchini alternately onto 8 skewers. Grill kabobs directly over fire, turning to brown evenly, for 5 minutes. Brush kabobs with the melted jelly. Continue to grill for 3 to 10 minutes more or until tender. Let rest 3 minutes before serving.
