Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Toss sugar snap peas with olive oil in a bowl and in a single layer on a baking sheet. Drizzle more olive oil on top; season with salt and pepper. Combine cinnamon and sugar together in a small bowl; sprinkle onto sugar snap peas. Cook in the preheated oven until sugar snap peas are lightly browned and sugar has caramelized, 4 to 5 minutes.
