Combine 1/2 cup water and reserved pineapple juice in a saucepan over medium-low heat; bring to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Stir couscous into the liquid to coat. Set aside until the liquid is absorbed and the couscous is tender, about 5 minutes; fluff with a fork. Divide onto 2 plates. Stir pineapple chunks and black beans together in a skillet over medium heat. Mix 1/3 cup warm water and taco seasoning mix in a small bowl; pour over the black bean mixture. Cook and stir the mixture until hot, 5 to 7 minutes. Spoon over couscous to serve.
