Puree cucumber in small food processor or blender. Combine cucumber, creme fraiche, and dill weed in small bowl. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour. Place shrimp and seasoning in self-closing plastic bag. Shake to distribute seasoning evenly over shrimp. Melt butter in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp; sautee about 2 minutes per side (without stirring), or until shrimp loses translucency. Serve shrimp on toasted baguette slices with Cucumber Dill Creme Fraiche and a sprig of fresh dill, if desired.
