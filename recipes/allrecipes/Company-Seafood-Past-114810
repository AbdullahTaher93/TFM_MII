In a saucepan, whisk flour and sour cream. Stir in cheese and butter; bring to a boil over medium-low heat, stirring frequently. Cook and stir for 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in crab and pepper; set aside and keep warm. Place the scallops in a saucepan with a small amount of water. Cover and cook over medium heat for 5-7 minutes or just until opaque. Meanwhile, cook pasta according to package directions. Drain scallops; add to crab mixture. Stir in shrimp; cook over low heat just until heated through, about 3 minutes. Drain pasta; top with seafood mixture. Garnish with parsley if desired.
