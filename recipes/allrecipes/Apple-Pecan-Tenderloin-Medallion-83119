Trim fat from pork. Cut pork into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it sizzles. Reduce heat to medium. Arrange pork slices in skillet. Cook for 2 minutes; turn slices. Spoon apples over pork. Sprinkle with brown sugar and pecans. Cover and cook for 4 to 6 minutes more.
