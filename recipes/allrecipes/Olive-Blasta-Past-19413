Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook chicken until brown and juices run clear, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in green onions, basil, olives, olive oil, garlic, Parmesan, sun-dried tomatoes and parsley; cook 5 minutes, or until garlic is golden and whites of onions are translucent. Toss chicken mixture with pasta; serve.
