In a wide nonstick frying pan, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp. Remove bacon and crumble. Discard all but 2 teaspoons drippings. Reduce heat to medium-low and add onion and potato. Cook, stirring, until potato is fork-tender and slightly browned. Remove from pan; keep warm. Melt butter in a 7-inch omelet pan over medium-high heat until foam begins to sub-side. Break eggs into a small bowl, add salt and pepper, and beat just until mixed. Pour egg mixture into pan. As edges begin to set, lift with a spatula or tilt pan to let uncooked eggs flow underneath. When the omelet top is still moist (3 to 4 minutes) sprinkle eggs with bacon, potato-onion mixture, cheese, and parsley. Remove from heat. Spoon sour cream onto omelet. Cut into wedges.
