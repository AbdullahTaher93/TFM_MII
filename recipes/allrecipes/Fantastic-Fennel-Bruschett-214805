In a bowl, mix together the tomatoes, onion, garlic, fennel seed, basil, 1/3 cup olive oil, salt, and pepper. Chill for at least 1 hour to blend the flavors. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush both sides of bread slices with some of the 1/4 cup of olive oil; place slices onto a baking sheet. Toast the bread until golden brown and crunchy on the outside, about 3 minutes per side. To serve, spoon the tomato mixture onto the toasted bruschetta and arrange on a serving platter.
