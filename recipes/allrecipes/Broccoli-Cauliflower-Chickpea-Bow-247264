Place cashews in a bowl and top with water; soak until softened, 3 to 4 hours. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or spray with cooking spray. Spread broccoli and cauliflower onto 1 baking sheet and season with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Spread chickpeas onto the other baking sheet and season with salt and pepper. Roast in the preheated oven until broccoli, cauliflower, and chickpeas are softened and cooked through, about 30 minutes. Drain cashews. Combine cashews, lemon juice, tahini, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender or food processor; blend until dressing is smooth. Transfer broccoli, cauliflower, and chickpeas to serving bowl. Drizzle dressing over vegetables and chickpeas.
