Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Using olive oil, grease a baking sheet. With a fork, mix together the flour, baking powder, parsley, thyme, salt, sugar, Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, and white Cheddar cheese together in a bowl. Cut the butter into the flour mixture in coarse chunks, then use the fork to further cut the butter into the flour-cheese mixture until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Lightly stir in the milk just until the dough holds together. Drop the batter by heaping 1/8-cup measuring cup onto the prepared baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven until risen and golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.
