Cover the cranberry beans with water and let soak overnight; drain. In a pot, cover the beans with 2 inches of cold water and bring to a boil. Skim the beans and add the onion, garlic, bay leaf and thyme sprigs, then simmer over moderate heat until the beans are just tender, about 1 hour. Add 2 tablespoons of salt to the beans and cook for 5 minutes longer. Drain the beans and discard the onion, garlic, thyme sprigs and bay leaf. Stir in the olive oil, vinegar, parsley, sage, chopped thyme and sliced scallions. Season with salt and pepper and serve.
