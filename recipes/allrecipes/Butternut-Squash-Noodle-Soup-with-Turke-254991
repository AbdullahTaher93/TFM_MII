Combine chicken broth, celery, onion, garlic, Mexican oregano, and ground chipotle in a large pot; bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat; simmer until vegetables are softened, about 20 minutes. Stir butternut squash and turkey into the broth mixture; simmer until turkey is heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.
