Heat oven to 375 degrees F. If feta cheese is packed in brine, drain well and pat dry; set aside. In large bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups flour, sugar, undissolved yeast and salt. Heat milk, water and oil until very warm (120 degrees to 130 degrees F); stir into dry ingredients. Stir in cheese, olives and enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 4 to 6 minutes. Cover; let rest 10 minutes. Roll dough to 12- x 8-inch rectangle. Beginning at short end, roll up tightly. Pinch seam and ends to seal. Place, seam side down, in greased 9- x 5-inch loaf pan. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until done. Remove from pan; cool on wire rack.
