Rinse quinoa and combine with garbanzo beans, coconut milk, water and curry paste in a medium saucepan; stir well. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 20 minutes. Uncover and top quinoa with green beans and carrots (do not stir). Cover and let stand 5 to 10 minutes until most of liquid is absorbed. Stir gently and serve with lime juice and choice of toppings. Or, portion evenly into 4 microwaveable storage containers and refrigerate. Reheat in microwave, loosely covered, about 2 minutes or until hot. Top as desired.
