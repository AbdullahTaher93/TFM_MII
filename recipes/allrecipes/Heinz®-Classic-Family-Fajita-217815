Heat half the oil over medium-high heat. Add onions, peppers and half of the salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until tender. Reserve. Add remaining oil to pan. Crumble in turkey, add garlic, chili powder and remaining salt and pepper. Saute until brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in half the chili sauce and all of the ketchup. Bring to a simmer. Serve meat and vegetable mixtures with tortillas and bowls of remaining chili sauce, cheese, lettuce and sour cream to make your own fajitas.
