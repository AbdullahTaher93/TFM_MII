Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups. Combine flour and baking soda together in a large bowl. Whisk eggs, butter, and apple cider together in a small bowl. Pour egg mixture over flour mixture and mix until smooth batter forms. Scoop batter into muffin cups, filling each 2/3 of the way full. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Transfer to wire rack to cool completely, about 45 minutes. Frost muffins with whipped cream. Sprinkle cinnamon on top.
