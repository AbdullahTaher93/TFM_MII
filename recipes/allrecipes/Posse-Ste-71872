In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook ground beef until evenly browned, stirring frequently to crumble. Drain grease, and transfer to a soup pot. Pour in the hominy, stewed tomatoes, corn, kidney beans, ranch-style beans, and add the onion and green chilies. Cover, and cook over medium heat for 1 hour.
