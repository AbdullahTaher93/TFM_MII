Heat oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a small bowl, stir together marmalade, horseradish and mustard; set aside. Combine 3/4 cup flour, baking powder, paprika, curry powder, salt and cayenne. Stir in beer. Dredge shrimp in 1/4 cup flour, dip in beer batter and roll in coconut. Fry shrimp in hot oil until golden on both sides. Drain briefly and serve with reserved dipping sauce.
