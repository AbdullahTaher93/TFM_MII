In a medium bowl combine apples, blueberries, sugar substitute, and the 1/4 teaspoon apple pie spice; set aside. In another medium bowl stir together whole wheat pastry flour, kosher salt, and the 1/8 teaspoon apple pie spice. Add oil and milk all at once to flour mixture. Stir lightly with a fork until dough comes together. Divide dough into 6 portions. Using six 3 1/2- to 4-inch individual tart pans with removable bottoms, press one dough portion on the bottom and up the side of each tart pan. Divide fruit mixture among pastry-lined pans. Place tart pans on a large baking sheet. Place a large piece of foil over tart pans; press down lightly around the edges to seal. Bake in a 375 degrees F oven for 20 minutes; remove foil. Bake about 20 minutes more or until fruit is tender. Let cool in tart pans on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Carefully remove sides of tart pans. Serve warm or cool.
