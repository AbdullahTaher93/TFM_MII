Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork and cook until well browned on both sides. Remove the pork from the skillet. Add the garlic and onions to the skillet and cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in the soup, pineapple juice and teriyaki sauce and heat to a boil. Cook for 5 minutes or until the soup mixture is slightly reduced. Return the pork to the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Stir in the pineapple. Cook for 5 minutes or until the pork is cooked through. Serve the pork and sauce with the rice. Sprinkle with additional sliced green onion, if desired.
