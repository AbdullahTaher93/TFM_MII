Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a shallow baking dish. In a small bowl, stir together the honey, Dijon mustard, melted butter and pepper. Place chicken in the greased baking dish, and pour the honey mustard sauce over it. Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, basting frequently with the sauce, until chicken is firm and juices run clear.
