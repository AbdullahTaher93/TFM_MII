Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir asparagus and grape tomatoes into the garlic and drizzle with lemon juice. Continue to cook and stir until asparagus are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Wrap 3 asparagus spears with 1 slice of bacon. Repeat with remaining asparagus and bacon, making 4 bundles. Arrange wrapped asparagus on a baking sheet. Scatter cooked grape tomatoes around the wrapped asparagus. Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes, then scatter Taleggio cheese atop asparagus; return baking sheet to the oven. Continue baking until bacon is crisp, 5 to 7 minutes more.
