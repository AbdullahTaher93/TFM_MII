COMBINE first 5 ingredients in a shallow dish; add salmon. Cover and chill 30 minutes, turning once. REMOVE salmon from marinade, reserving marinade. Bring marinade to a boil in a small saucepan. GRILL salmon, covered with grill lid, over medium-high heat (350 degrees to 400 degrees) about 6 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork, basting frequently with reserved marinade. ARRANGE salmon over rice; drizzle with any remaining marinade. Serve with lemon slices, and garnish, if desired.
