Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a pizza pan. Mix amaranth flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, sugar, salt, oregano, basil, sage, and thyme together in a large bowl. Pour in sparkling water and olive oil; mix until a sticky dough forms. Spread dough over the prepared pan, using moistened hands to keep from sticking. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 20 minutes.
