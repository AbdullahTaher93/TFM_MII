In a food processor or blender, combine mayonnaise, spinach, parsley, tarragon leaves, lemon juice, shallot, and anchovies. Whirl until very smooth. Pour into a small bowl and chill until serving time. Remove and discard outer, wilted leaves on lettuce and radicchio. Cut lettuce and radicchio lengthwise through core into 4 equal wedges. Remove and discard tough core from radicchio wedges. Arrange one lettuce wedge and one radicchio wedge on each dinner plate. Place 1 artichoke bottom, cup side up, beside lettuce on each plate. Mound shrimp equally in artichokes, letting shrimp spill over edges. Arrange tomatoes alongside. Spoon about half the dressing equally over salads. Garnish with tarragon sprigs and red onion slices. Offer remaining dressing to add to taste.
