Preheat oven broiler. Arrange eggplant slices in a single layer on a nonstick broiler pan; brush tops with 1 tablespoon of the oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Turn slices over; brush with 1 tablespoon of oil and season to taste with salt and pepper. Broil eggplant about 6 inches from heat until tops are well browned, about 7 minutes. While eggplant broils, cut each focaccia in half crosswise. Then cut pieces in half horizontally. Arrange focaccia, cut side up, in a single layer on a 12- by 15-inch baking sheet. When eggplant is browned on top, turn slices. Put focaccia in the oven on a rack below the eggplant; broil until eggplant is browned on second side and bread is lightly toasted, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove focaccia and eggplant from oven; leave focaccia on baking sheet. Combine basil with remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Spread this mixture equally over cut sides of focaccia. Top each equally with spinach, eggplant slices, peppers, onion, and cheese. Broil sandwiches 6 inches away from heat until cheese is browned and bubbling, about 4 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
