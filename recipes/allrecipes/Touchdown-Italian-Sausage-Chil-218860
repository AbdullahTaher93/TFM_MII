Grill Italian sausage according to package directions; cut into half moon slices and set aside. In a soup kettle, saute the onion, celery, sweet peppers and garlic in oil until tender. Add sausage and the remaining ingredients; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until flavors are blended. Sprinkle chili with grated Asiago, Romano or Parmesan cheese.
