Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Line 24 regular-size muffin cups with foil baking cups. Break 8 granola bars into pieces; place in gallon-size resealable food-storage plastic bag or in food processor; seal bag and crush with rolling pin or meat mallet or process until fine crumbs form. In medium bowl, mix crumbs and melted butter until well combined. Place scant tablespoon crumb mixture in each foil-lined muffin cup; press in bottom of cup to form crust. In large bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar with electric mixer on medium speed until creamy. Beat in vanilla and eggs until well combined. Cut or break remaining 4 granola bars, into 1/2-inch pieces; stir into cream cheese mixture. Spoon scant 1/4 cup mixture over crust in each cup. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes or until set. Cool in pans on wire rack 15 minutes. Top each cheesecake with 1 tablespoon apple pie filling. Refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour. To serve, remove cheesecakes from muffin pans. Store in refrigerator.
