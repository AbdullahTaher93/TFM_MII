In a saucepan, combine the rice, coconut milk and water. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the rice has absorbed all of the liquid. Set aside to cool down. In a small bowl, stir together the lime juice, peanut butter, sesame oil, fish sauce, curry paste and garlic. Taste, and adjust the flavor of the dressing to your liking. When the rice has cooled, stir in the dressing along with the coconut, raisins and almonds. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, and up to one day.
