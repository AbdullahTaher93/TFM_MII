In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, sherry or broth, sugar, ginger, and garlic. Stir to blend. Divide the marinade into two medium, shallow bowls. Place the steaks in one bowl and the pineapple and bell pepper in the other. Turn the tuna, pineapple, and bell pepper to coat both sides. Cover and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Coat a grill rack or broiler pan with nonstick spray. Preheat the grill or broiler. Arrange the tuna, pineapple, and bell pepper on the rack or pan. Discard the marinade from the tuna bowl. Grill or broil, basting occasionally with the marinade from the pineapple bowl, for 4 to 5 minutes per side, or until the tuna is just opaque and the pineapple and bell pepper are heated through and glazed.
