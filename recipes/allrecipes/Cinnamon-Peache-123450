Drain peaches, reserving 1/4 cup juice (discard remaining juice or save for another use). Place peaches with cut side down in an ungreased shallow 1-qt. baking dish. Cut a slit in each. Break cinnamon stick into pieces; place in slits. Combine the lemon juice and reserved peach juice; pour over peaches. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until heated through.
