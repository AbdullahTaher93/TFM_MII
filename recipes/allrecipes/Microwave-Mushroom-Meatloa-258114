Mix ground beef, egg, mushrooms, onion, whole-wheat crackers, and salt together in a bowl. Mold into a ring on a microwave-safe dish. Spread ketchup on top. Cover with parchment paper. Cook in the microwave until beef is no longer pink in the center, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain off any fat. Cover and let sit for 5 minutes before serving.
