Fill a large saucepan with water; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in the macaroni; cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until tender. Drain the macaroni in a colander and set aside. Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Mix in flour. Cook and stir for 5 minutes, until golden brown. Pour in the milk a little at a time to make a white sauce. Whisk between additions to prevent lumps, until all the milk is added and the white sauce is hot and thickened, about 5 minutes. Drop the cubed processed cheese into the white sauce and cook and stir 1 to 2 minutes, until all the cheese has melted. Season with pepper. Pour the hot, cooked macaroni into the cheese sauce, stir lightly to mix well, and serve.
