Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Place wafers in a food processor; process until finely ground. Add sugar, margarine, and egg white; pulse 2 times or just until combined. Press crumb mixture into bottom and up sides of a 9-inch round tart pan coated with cooking spray. Bake at 325 degrees for 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack. Combine grated lemon rind, juices, eggs, and milk in a bowl, stirring with a whisk until blended. Pour mixture into prepared crust. Bake at 325 degrees for 30 minutes or until filling is set. Cool completely. Top with whipped topping. Garnish with lemon rind strips and mint, if desired.
