Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll bread slices flat on a work surface using a rolling pin. Brush 1 side of each flattened bread slice with melted butter. Fit bread slices into muffin cups, butter-side up. Bake in the preheated oven until cups are lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool completely. Heat olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion and green bell pepper until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and gradually stir cream of mushroom soup and milk into onion mixture until smooth; add Italian seasoning, sage, salt, and pepper. Stir turkey into soup mixture; cook and stir until bubbling, about 5 minutes. Place 2 or 3 bread cups on each place. Ladle soup mixture into each cup; top with parsley.
