In a mixing bowl, combine flours, oats, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. Combine buttermilk, eggs and oil; stir into dry ingredients just until blended. Fold in blueberries if desired. Combine topping ingredients; sprinkle about 1 teaspoon for each pancake onto a lightly greased hot griddle; pour 1/4 cup of batter over topping. Immediately sprinkle with another teaspoonful of topping; turn when bubbles form on top of pancake. Cook until second side is golden brown.
