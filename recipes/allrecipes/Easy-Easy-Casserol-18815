Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet over medium-high heat, place the turkey and saute for 5 to 10 minutes, or until browned. Place the sliced potatoes in the bottom of a lightly greased 2-quart casserole dish, cover with butter and season with salt and pepper to taste. Then layer the cream-style corn over the potatoes, top with the browned turkey meat, and then top with the tomato soup. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 60 minutes.
