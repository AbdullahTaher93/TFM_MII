Flatten bread with a rolling pin. Spread cream cheese on one side of half of the slices; top with remaining bread. Cut each into four squares. Spritz both sides with butter-flavored spray. In a small bowl, combine sugar and cinnamon; add bread squares and turn to coat both sides. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until puffed and golden. Serve immediately.
