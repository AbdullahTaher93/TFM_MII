Fire up your grill to medium-hot. In a big bowl, mix everything but the meat and grilling blend. Cover and refrigerate the mixture until after you've grilled the steak. Coat the meat all over with cooking spray. Press the grilling blend into both sides. Slap the beef onto the grill and close the lid (with the vents open). Grill, turning once, until it's done the way you like. That's 5 to 7 minutes per side for medium-rare (145 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer) or 6 to 8 minutes per side for medium (160 degrees F). Allow the meat to rest on a cutting board for 10 minutes so the juices seep back in. Thinly slice across the grain. Slop on some bean-corn mix.
