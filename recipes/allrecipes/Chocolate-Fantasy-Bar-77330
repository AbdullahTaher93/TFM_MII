Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In large bowl, with mixer on medium speed, beat cake mix, oil and egg until crumbly. Stir in nuts. Set aside 1 cup of the crumb mixture. Firmly press remaining crumb mixture on bottom of greased 13x9-inch baking pan. In small saucepan, melt chips with sweetened condensed milk, vanilla and salt. Pour evenly over prepared crust. Sprinkle reserved crumb mixture evenly over top. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until edges are firm. Cool. Cut into bars. Drizzle with icing (optional). Store at room temperature.
