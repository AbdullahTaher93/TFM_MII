Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Remove bacon from skillet, leaving grease. Crumble and set aside. Stir onion into bacon grease, and cook over medium heat until tender; drain. In a medium baking dish, mix bacon, onion, green beans, brown sugar, dry mustard and chili sauce. Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until heated through.
