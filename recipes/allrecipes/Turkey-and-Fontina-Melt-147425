Position rack in the upper third of the oven; preheat broiler. Sprinkle both sides of turkey with flour. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a medium ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the turkey and cook until golden, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the turkey to a plate. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon oil and shallot to the pan; cook, stirring constantly, until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Add sherry and spinach; cook, stirring constantly, until the spinach is wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Carefully mound equal portions of the spinach on top of the turkey. Transfer the spinach-topped turkey and any accumulated juices to the pan. Top the spinach with cheese and transfer to the oven. Broil until the cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the melts to 2 plates. Add the butter to the pan and whisk into the juices over medium-high heat until melted, about 30 seconds. Drizzle over the melts.
