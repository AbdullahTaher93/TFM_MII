Combine curry powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Rub mixture into chicken breasts. Set aside. In a large, non-stick skillet, combine chicken broth, water, and wine with rice. Stir in brown sugar, dried parsley, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Stir in mango. Arrange chicken pieces on top of rice, and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat. Let stand, covered, until all liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes.
