Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Grease and flour a tube pan. In a large bowl, combine sugar, flour, soda, cinnamon, cloves, allspice and nutmeg. Add eggs, lemon rind, vanilla, and 1/2 cup brandy. Mix thoroughly. Stir in fruit, nuts, and melted butter. Pour into prepared pan. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. Wrap cooled cake in foil. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons brandy over the cake everyday for 2 weeks.
