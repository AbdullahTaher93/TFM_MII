Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, combine cake mix, gelatin and pudding mix. Blend in eggs, oil and hot water; stir until mixture is smooth. Fold in poppy seeds. Pour into prepared loaf pan. Bake in preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Remove bread from pan and let cool on a wire rack.
