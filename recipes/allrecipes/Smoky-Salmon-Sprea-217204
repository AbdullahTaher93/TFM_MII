Drain and flake the salmon into a bowl; reserve 1 teaspoon of the salmon liquid. In another bowl, mash the cream cheese, liquid smoke flavor, and the reserved salmon liquid until thoroughly combined; stir in the green onion and horseradish. Gently mix with the flaked salmon, and refrigerate at least 2 hours. If desired, form the spread into a ball, and roll in chopped parsley.
