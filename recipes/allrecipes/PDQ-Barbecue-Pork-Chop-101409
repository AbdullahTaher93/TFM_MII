For sauce, mix all ingredients except pork chops together in a small bowl. Place pork chops over direct heat above medium-hot coals. Grill chops for about 4-5 minute, until nicely browned on one side; turn and brush liberally with sauce. Grill for 4-5 minutes more; turn and brush with more sauce. Grill for a few minutes more, turning and brushing with sauce. Discard any leftover sauce. Serve chops immediately.
