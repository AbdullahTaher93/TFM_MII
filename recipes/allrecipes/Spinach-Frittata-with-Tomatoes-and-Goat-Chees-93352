Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Heat oil in a 10-inch oven-safe skillet. Add tomatoes; fry, turning once until golden brown, about 4 minutes total. Add garlic during the last minute. Meanwhile, whisk eggs, spinach, cheeses, oregano, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and pepper to taste; pour over tomatoes. Transfer pan to oven and bake until just set, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven and let stand a few minutes. Loosen frittata around pan perimeter. Invert onto a plate, then invert onto another plate. Cut into wedges and serve.
