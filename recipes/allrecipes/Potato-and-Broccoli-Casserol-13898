Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 3 quart casserole dish. In a large bowl, mix together cream soups, cheddar cheese, sour cream, and mustard. Stir in potatoes and broccoli. Spoon into prepared casserole dish. Top with crushed crackers. Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until potatoes are tender.
