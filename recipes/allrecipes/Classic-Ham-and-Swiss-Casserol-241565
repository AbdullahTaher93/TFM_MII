Spread the bread cubes into a shallow pan and let the bread sit until the cut surfaces are somewhat dried with the insides remaining soft, 2 to 3 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish. Put bread cubes into a large bowl. Pour honey mustard over the bread and mix to coat. Layer about half the bread cubes into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle 2/3 cup Swiss cheese over the bread cubes; top with 1 cup ham. Spread relish in a layer over everything. Layer remaining ham, 2/3 cup Swiss cheese, and remaining bread cubes, respectively, atop the relish layer. Finish by topping with the remaining Swiss cheese. Cover entire dish with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven until hot in the center, about 30 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before cutting to serve.
