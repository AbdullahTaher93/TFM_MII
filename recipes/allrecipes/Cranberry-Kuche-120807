In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in a warm water. Add the milk, butter, sugar, salt, egg and 2 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Do not knead. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. For cranberry sauce, in a saucepan, bring water and sugar to a boil. Add cranberries. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat; set aside. For egg mixture, in a bowl, combine the eggs, evaporated milk and sugar; beat well. Divide half of the egg mixture between two greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pans; set remaining egg mixture aside. Punch dough down. Divide in half. Pat each portion over egg mixture in pans. Spoon cranberry sauce over dough. Drizzle with remaining egg mixture. For topping, combine flour and sugar in a bowl. Cut in butter until crumbly; sprinkle over the top. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack. Serve warm.
