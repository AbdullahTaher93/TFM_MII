Place pork chops in a casserole dish. Peel, seed and section the clementines. Place half the clementine sections in a small bowl (chop the other half, reserve and refrigerate for later use in salsa). Use a fork to press half the sections into small pieces. Add orange juice and soy sauce then mix together well. Pour mixture over pork chops, being sure that the chops are completely covered with marinade. Cover the dish and refrigerate 4-6 hours or overnight. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. In a small dish, blend onion powder, salt substitute seasoning and chili powder. Remove chops from marinade and season both sides with spice mix. Bake in oven for 22-28 minutes, depending on the thickness of the pork chops. Combine the cucumber, grape tomatoes, bell pepper and lime juice with the remaining clementines to make a fruit and vegetable salsa. Prepare brown rice and spinach according to directions on package. Serve each pork chop with equal amounts of clementine salsa, 1/2 cup of brown rice and 1/2 cup of spinach.
