Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion and celery in hot butter until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir rice, broccoli, chicken soup, cheese spread, and evaporated milk into the onion mixture; season with salt and pepper. Transfer mixture to a baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until rice is tender and sauce is bubbly, about 30 minutes.
