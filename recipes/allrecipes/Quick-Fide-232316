Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, 1 tablespoon dried onion, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, salt, and black pepper in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Transfer beef to a bowl. Heat canola oil in the same skillet over medium heat; cook and stir fideo noodles in the hot oil until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add ground beef and enough hot water to cover the noodles; stir in tomato sauce, 2 tablespoons dried onion, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, cumin, onion powder, beef bouillon, green bell pepper, salt, and black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
