In a medium bowl, beat egg yolks and lemon juice with a wooden spoon. Beat in vegetable oil a few drops at a time, beating well after each addition until the mixture begins to emulsify. When all of the oil has been incorporated, stir in the miso, salt, white pepper and grated yuzu. Refrigerate in a squeeze bottle for convenient application.
