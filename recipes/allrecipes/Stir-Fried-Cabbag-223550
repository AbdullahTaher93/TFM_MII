Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until tender, about 10 minutes. Cook and stir cabbage into onion mixture until slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; add soy sauce, sugar, and black pepper. Cook and stir until cabbage is tender, 3 to 5 more minutes.
