Place 1-1/2 cups apples in a greased 9-in. round baking pan. Separate biscuits into 10 pieces; cut each biscuit into quarters. Place over apples with point side up. Top with remaining apples. In a mixing bowl, combine egg, corn syrup, brown sugar, butter and cinnamon. Stir in pecans. Spoon over apples. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until biscuits are browned. For glaze, combine confectioners' sugar, vanilla and enough milk to achieve desired consistency. Drizzle over warm coffee cake. Serve immediately.
