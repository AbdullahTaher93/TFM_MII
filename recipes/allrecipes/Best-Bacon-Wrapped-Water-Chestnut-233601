Soak water chestnuts in a bowl with soy sauce for at least 3 hours; drain. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Wrap each water chestnut with a piece of bacon; secure with a toothpick and arrange on a shallow baking dish. Repeat with remaining water chestnuts. Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crisp, 25 to 35 minutes. Meanwhile, mix brown sugar, mayonnaise, and chili sauce in a bowl until dipping sauce is smooth. Serve bacon-wrapped water chestnuts with dipping sauce.
