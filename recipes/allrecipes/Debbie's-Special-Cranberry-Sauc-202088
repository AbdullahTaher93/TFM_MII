Combine the cranberries, prunes, water, raspberry jam, sugar, vinegar, salt, and cinnamon stick in a 3-quart saucepan; bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until thick and most of the cranberries have burst, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Transfer to a container with a lid; cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours before serving.
