In a large saucepan, heat the oil over moderate heat. Add the onion, carrots, fennel, eggplant, garlic, and jalapeno. Cook, covered, until the vegetables start to soften, about 10 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, coriander, caraway seeds, 2 teaspoons of the salt, and the black pepper. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add 3 1/2 cups of the water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, until the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Add the chickpeas and simmer 2 minutes longer. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, bring the remaining 2 cups of water to a boil. Add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and the couscous. Cover. Remove the pot from the heat and let the couscous stand for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Serve the stew with its broth over the couscous.
