Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Pastry: Combine flour and salt in large mixing bowl. Cut room temperature shortening into flour with pastry blender or 2 knives until mixture is uniform and shortening resembles large peas. Beat egg, water and vinegar together. Pour all liquid evenly over flour mixture. Stir with fork until all of the mixture is moistened. Divide dough in half and shape each into a ball. Flatten each into a circle about 4" (10 cm). Wrap and chill 15 minutes for easier rolling. Roll half the dough on a lightly floured surface into a circle 2" (5 cm) wider than 9" (23cm) pie plate. Transfer into pie plate. Trim pastry at edges of plate. Roll out remaining dough and set aside. Filling: Place filling ingredients in a large bowl. Toss gently until well combined. Fill pastry-lined pie plate with fruit mixture. Top with remaining pastry. Seal and flute edges. Cut slits on top of pastry. Brush top of pie with beaten egg and sprinkle with sugar. Place on a baking sheet lined with foil. Bake in preheated oven, on bottom rack, for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and continue baking for 60 to 70 minutes or until pastry is golden and fruit is tender. Cool on wire cooling rack.
