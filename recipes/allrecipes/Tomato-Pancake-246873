Mix flour, tomato juice, milk, sugar, oregano, basil, and black pepper together in a bowl until batter is smooth. Combine ham and Gouda cheese together in a separate bowl. Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter, 1 ladle per pancake, onto the griddle and cook until bottom is browned, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer pancake to a serving plate. Sprinkle ham-cheese mixture over pancake. Roll pancake around the filling. Repeat cooking with remaining batter and filling.
