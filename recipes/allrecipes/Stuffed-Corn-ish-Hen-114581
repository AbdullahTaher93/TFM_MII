In a saucepan, saute rice, mushrooms, almonds and onion in butter for 5 minutes or until rice is lightly browned. Stir in water, bouillon, parsley, lemon juice, salt and bay leaf; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 25 minutes or until liquid is absorbed. Discard bay leaf. Spoon about 3/4 cup rice mixture into each hen. Place breast side up in a large roasting pan; tie drumsticks together. Place two bacon pieces over each hen. Cover and bake at 375 degrees F for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake 45 minutes longer or until meat thermometer reads 185 degrees F for hens and 165 degrees F for the stuffing.
