Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add butternut squash, parsnip, and onion; cook and stir until starting to brown, about 3 minutes. Stir in 2 cloves garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Pour water into the saucepan. Add coriander, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, cayenne powder, and Chinese five-spice powder. Simmer until butternut squash is very soft, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat; drain excess liquid. Let cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir butter into butternut squash mixture. Puree with an immersion blender until smooth. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Toss kale, walnuts, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper together on a rimmed baking sheet. Broil in the preheated oven until kale starts to brown, about 5 minutes. Cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Combine kale mixture, 1/2 cup light olive oil, lemon juice, 3 cloves garlic, agave nectar, and red pepper flakes in a food processor; blend into a chunky paste. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Combine 2 tablespoons olive oil, rosemary, and thyme in a large oven-proof skillet; heat over medium-high heat until lightly smoking. Season veal chops with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Cook in the hot oil until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer skillet to the preheated oven; roast chops until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), about 10 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board; let rest for 10 minutes. Divide butternut squash puree between 2 large serving plates. Place 1 chop on each place; top with a heaping tablespoon of kale pesto.
