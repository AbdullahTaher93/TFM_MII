Season fish with salt and pepper and then dust in flour. Shake off excess flour and brown on each side (about 2 minutes on each side) in a heavy fry pan on medium heat. Remove fish from pan and pour off any oil and burnt flour. Add garlic and capers and cook for a minute or two. Pour wine and lemon juice into pan and turn up the heat. Reduce liquid by half turn down heat and add the butter and parsley. Return the fish to the pan to warm. Taste sauce and add salt and pepper if needed. Serve fish with the sauce over the top.
