In a salad bowl, combine spinach, potatoes, eggs and mushrooms. In a skillet, cook bacon until crisp. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. In the drippings, saute onion until tender. Combine cornstarch, apple juice, vinegar, sweetener and pepper until smooth; stir into skillet. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until slightly thickened and bubbly. Pour over spinach mixture. Add bacon and toss. Serve immediately.
