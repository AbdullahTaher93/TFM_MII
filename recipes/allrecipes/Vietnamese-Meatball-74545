Preheat the oven's broiler. In a large bowl, mix together the ground chicken, garlic, egg white, rice wine, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, fish sauce, sugar, salt, pepper, cornstarch and sesame oil. Form the mixture into small balls, and thread onto skewers 3 or 4 at a time. Place on a baking sheet or broiling rack. Broil for 15 to 20 minutes, turning occasionally, until cooked through.
