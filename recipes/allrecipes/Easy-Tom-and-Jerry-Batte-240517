Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks. Beat salt into egg whites. Beat egg yolks in another bowl until light, 3 to 5 minutes. Blend confectioners' sugar and butter together in separate large bowl until crumbly; add egg yolks and vanilla extract and beat well. Mix in nutmeg and allspice. Beat egg whites into egg yolk mixture until well-blended. Transfer to a sealable container and store in the freezer.
