In a large saucepan, combine the broth, milk, butter and pepper; bring to a boil. Remove from the heat; stir in potato flakes. Let stand for 30 seconds; fluff with a fork. Transfer to a greased 1-qt. baking dish. Top with cheeses. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes or until cheese is melted. Sprinkle with chives. Serve with sour cream if desired.
