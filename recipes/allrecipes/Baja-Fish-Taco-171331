Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, medium-high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above cooking grate only 3 to 4 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). While grill heats, in a gallon-size resealable plastic bag, combine fish, lime juice, olive oil, and garlic. Press bag to seal and turn over several times to coat fish evenly with marinade. Set aside to marinate for 15 minutes. In a large bowl, whisk together taco sauce and sour cream until smooth. Add cabbage and mix to coat evenly; set aside. Arrange tortillas in a stack and seal in foil. Lift fish from marinade and discard marinade. Place fish and tortilla packet on well-oiled cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook, turning fish and tortillas once with a wide spatula, until fish is barely opaque in thickest part (cut to test) and tortillas are warmed through, 8 to 12 minutes total. Transfer tortillas to a serving basket and fish to a bowl. Discard any fish bones and skin; break the hot fish into chunks. Wrap pieces of fish and cabbage mixture in warm tortillas. Add salt and cilantro to taste.
