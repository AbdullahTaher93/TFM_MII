In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add onions and garlic and saute about 3 to 5 minutes until onions are translucent. Add mushrooms, basil, salt and pepper and saute an additional 5 to 10 minutes until mushrooms are soft and cooked to desired texture. Remove the pan from the heat and blend in flour. Gradually add milk, stirring constantly. Return the pan to the heat and cook over medium heat until the sauce thickens and comes to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for an additional 2 or 3 minutes.
