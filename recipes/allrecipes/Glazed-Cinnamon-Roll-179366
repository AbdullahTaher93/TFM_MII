Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease bottom and sides of 13x9-inch pan. In small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons sugar and the cinnamon; set aside. In medium bowl, stir Bisquick mix, 2/3 cup milk and 2 tablespoons sugar until dough forms. If dough is too sticky, gradually mix in enough Bisquick mix (up to 1/4 cup) to make dough easy to handle. Turn dough onto surface well dusted with Bisquick mix; gently roll dough in Bisquick mix to coat. Shape into ball; knead 10 times. Roll dough into 15x9-inch rectangle; spread with butter. Sprinkle evenly with sugar mixture and raisins. Roll up tightly, beginning at 15-inch side. Seal well by pinching edge of dough into roll. Cut into 1 1/4-inch slices; place cut sides down in pan. Bake 23 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool 5 minutes. Remove from pan. In medium bowl, mix powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons milk until smooth. Spread glaze over warm rolls.
