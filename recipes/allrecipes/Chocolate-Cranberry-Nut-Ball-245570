Place teff in a large skillet over medium heat and toast until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Stir in coconut, chia seeds, and milled flax seed. Chop walnuts, almonds, chocolate chips, dates, cranberries, and pumpkin seeds in a food processor, in batches if necessary, until finely chopped and the consistency of coarse breadcrumbs. Add nut mixture to teff mixture and mix thoroughly. Pour peanut butter and honey over nut and teff mixture; mix until evenly distributed. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll the teff mixture into bite-size balls and arrange on baking sheets. Wrap sheets well with plastic wrap. Freeze until balls are firm, 8 hours to overnight.
