In a large saucepan place the rice, consomme and water. Bring to a boil and boil for 5 minutes. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in butter. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place half of rice in large baking dish. Cover with oysters seasoned with salt, pepper, and hot sauce to taste. Top with remaining rice. Heat mushroom soup, half and half, onion powder, thyme, and curry powder. Pour over rice and oyster mixture. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Garnish with parsley.
