In a bowl, combine the salad dressing, barbecue sauce and chili powder; mix well. Pour 1/2 cup marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add the pork chops. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade. Drain and discard marinade from pork. In a large skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, brown chops on both sides over medium heat; drain. Add reserved marinade. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5-7 minutes or until a meat thermometer reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
