Heat broiler. Spray broiler pan with nonstick cooking spray. Place ham on broiler pan. Stir remaining ingredients in small bowl; mix well. Spread 1/2 of mixture evenly over top sides of steaks. Broil about 6-inches from heat for 3 to 4 minutes or until glaze begins to bubble. Turn steaks and spread with remaining glaze. Broil an additional 3 to 4 minutes or until glaze bubbles. Sprinkle with chopped chives before serving.
