Combine all of the ingredients in a heat-proof baking pan, making sure to coat the chicken well. Place the chicken, skin side up, in a single layer. Cover with foil and refrigerate for 2 to 6 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Roast the chicken, uncovered, until the juices run clear when the meat is pierced, 50 to 60 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate and cover loosely with foil. Transfer the pan to the stove top. Simmer the sauce in the pan over medium heat until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Strain the sauce over the chicken. Serve with rice if desired.
