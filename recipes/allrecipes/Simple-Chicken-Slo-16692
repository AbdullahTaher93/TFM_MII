Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the chicken, soup, cheese, milk, salt, pepper and butter. Mix together and pour mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 5 to 10 minutes or until cheese is melted and bubbly, and casserole is hot in the center.
