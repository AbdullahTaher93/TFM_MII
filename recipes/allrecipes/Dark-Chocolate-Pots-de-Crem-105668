Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Place chopped chocolate in a medium bowl. In small heavy saucepan, bring milk, half-and-half, and espresso powder just to a simmer. Remove from heat; pour mixture over chocolate. Whisk until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth. In separate medium bowl, whisk yolks, sugar substitute, and salt. Add chocolate mixture in a steady stream, whisking constantly. Pour mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a large glass measuring cup. Line bottom of a baking pan (large enough to hold four custard cups) with a folded kitchen towel. Divide custard among four custard cups; arrange cups on towel. Add enough hot tap water to baking pan to come halfway up sides of cups. Tightly cover entire pan with foil. Bake 30 minutes, until custards are set around edges but still slightly wobbly in center. Remove cups from water bath. Cool, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold. Serve cups cold, garnished with whipped topping and raspberries.
