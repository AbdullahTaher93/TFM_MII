Scoop out egg yolks. Place 2 yolks in a small bowl and reserve the rest for another use. Chop egg whites and reserve. Mash the yolks with a fork and stir in sour cream (or yogurt), mayonnaise and mustard. Add chopped egg whites and scallions and season with salt and pepper. Arrange watercress on 4 bread slices. Top with the egg salad and cover with the remaining bread slices.
