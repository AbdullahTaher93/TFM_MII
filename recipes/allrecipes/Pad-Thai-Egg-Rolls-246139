Place tofu on several layers of paper towels. Cover with more paper towels. Let drain, pressing down occasionally, about 30 minutes. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat; spray with cooking spray. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl. Cook and stir onion and green onions until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir into garlic in the bowl. Cook red cabbage until slightly tender, about 3 minutes. Add to garlic and onion mixture. Cook eggs, stirring frequently, until scrambled, about 3 minutes. Stir into bowl. Stir 1/4 cup peanut butter, chili sesame oil, lime juice, soy sauce, chili-garlic sauce, tamarind paste, and lime zest into bowl; toss until vegetable and egg mixture is evenly coated. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spoon a small amount of filling into the middle of an egg roll wrapper. Fold over bottom and sides to enclose filling. Roll wrapper upwards to a form a neat roll shape. Use a pea-sized dot of peanut butter on the flap to seal. Repeat with remaining filling and wrappers. Arrange rolls on a baking sheet. Lightly spray all sides with cooking spray. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are slightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.
