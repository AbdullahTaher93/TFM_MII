Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin with cooking spray. Mix cooked quinoa, oat flour, almond milk, maple syrup, raisins, egg white, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt together in a large bowl. Fill each muffin cup to the top with quinoa mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool muffins completely in the tin, about 20 minutes, before removing.
