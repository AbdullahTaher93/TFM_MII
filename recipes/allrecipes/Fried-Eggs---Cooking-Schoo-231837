Melt butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Crack egg and gently slip it into the melted butter. Cook, spooning melted butter from the skillet over the yolk, until the egg white is set, about 2 minutes. For an over easy egg, flip egg and cook for 30 seconds. Alternatively, flip the egg, add 1 teaspoon water to the skillet, cover the skillet, and cook for 30 seconds. For an over medium egg, flip egg and cook for 60 seconds, or until egg reaches desired doneness.
