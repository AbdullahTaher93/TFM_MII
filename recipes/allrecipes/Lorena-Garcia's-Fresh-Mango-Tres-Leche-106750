Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare a 9-inch spring form cake pan with nonstick cooking spray. Blend the flour, SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, and baking soda together in a bowl and set aside. Blend the 4 egg yolks and vanilla extract in a mixing bowl. Mix at medium high speed until eggs are pale in color. Blend the 6 egg whites until soft peak. Mix all of the ingredients together. Pour mixture into the pan and place in the oven for 35 to 45 minutes or until the cake tests clean. Set aside and let cool. Make Cream: blend the evaporated milk, condensed milk, half-and-half, and orange juice in a mixing bowl. Place the mango slices at the bottom of a deep container. Place the cake on top and add the cream mixture over. Leave the cake submerged for at least 30 minutes until the liquid is absorbed in the refrigerator. The servings should have mango slices at the bottom; about half the liquid will remain in the container. Decorate the Tres Leches with the whipped cream and coconut shavings. Serve immediately.
