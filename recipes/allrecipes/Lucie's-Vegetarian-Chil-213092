Heat the olive oil in a large pot over high heat. Stir in the onion, celery, green bell pepper, carrot, garlic, mushrooms, red pepper flakes, cumin, chili powder, basil, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until the vegetables begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Stir in the tomato juice, bulgur wheat, chopped tomatoes, kidney beans, hot pepper sauce, lemon juice, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, red wine, and green chile peppers. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, uncovered, 20 minutes before serving.
