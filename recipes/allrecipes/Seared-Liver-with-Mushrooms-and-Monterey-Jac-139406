Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion and mushrooms; cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from skillet with a slotted spoon; set aside. In the same skillet, cook liver over medium heat until brown on both sides. Add sherry, rosemary, basil, and sauteed onion and mushrooms. Top each liver piece with a strip of cheese. Cover and simmer 10 minutes.
