Preheat an outdoor grill for low heat. Pour oil into a large, resealable plastic bag. Add lavender, rosemary, and thyme; let stand for 10 minutes. Place steaks in bag with marinade, and marinate for 5 minutes. Lightly oil grate. Remove steaks from marinade, and arrange on grill. Cook, turning once or twice, for 20 to 30 minutes, or until done.
