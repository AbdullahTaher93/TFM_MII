Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Set the beets in a medium roasting pan and drizzle with olive oil. Cover with foil. Bake the beets for 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until tender. Let cool slightly. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk the sour cream, horseradish and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Peel the beets and cut them into wedges. Transfer to a bowl, drizzle with half of the horseradish cream and sprinkle with the parsley. Serve the remaining horseradish cream on the side.
