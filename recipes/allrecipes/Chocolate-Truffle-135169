Empty the chocolate chips and evaporated milk into a microwave safe bowl and microwave on medium heat for 5 minutes. Add a pinch of salt and coffee creamer to the bowl and place in the fridge for one hour. Using a melon baler take one tablespoon spoonfuls out of the chocolate and roll into balls. Dust with coco powder and serve!
