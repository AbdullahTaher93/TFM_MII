Place cream cheese, apple butter, vanilla, and cinnamon in the container of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Process until just smooth, about 20 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the container and process again until combined, if necessary. Scrape the spread into a small bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until slightly firm, about 30 minutes.
