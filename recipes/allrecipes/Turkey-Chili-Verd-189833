In a 5- to 6-quart stockpot over medium-high heat, warm olive oil. Add peppers and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and starting to brown, about 8 minutes. Add turkey, garlic, oregano, salt, coriander, cumin, and pepper, and cook for 2 minutes. Drain one can of beans; add beans plus beans and liquid from remaining two cans. Add chiles. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer, and cook 5 minutes, until ingredients are heated through. Serve chili topped with cheese and salsa to taste.
