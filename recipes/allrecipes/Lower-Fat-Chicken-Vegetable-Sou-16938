In a large pot over high heat, combine the chicken broth, cabbage, carrots, potatoes, onion, green beans, green bell pepper, tomato juice, garlic, oregano, basil and Italian-style seasoning. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour, or until all vegetables are tender. Add the chicken and simmer for 15 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
