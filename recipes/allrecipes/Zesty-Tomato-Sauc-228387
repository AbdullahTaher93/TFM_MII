Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Toss tomatoes, butter, garlic, and thyme together in a bowl; pour onto prepared baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven until tomatoes are slightly charred and have reduced in size, about 1 hour. Transfer tomato mixture to a blender; add black pepper and kosher salt. Blend until smooth.
