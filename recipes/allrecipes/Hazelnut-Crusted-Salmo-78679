Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Arrange salmon on the baking sheet and spread with equal amounts mayonnaise. Top with hazelnuts and sprinkle with tarragon, orange zest, salt and pepper. Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
