Flatten chicken to 1/4-in. thickness; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Prepare stuffing mix according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a small skillet, saute the pecans in butter until lightly browned; add to the stuffing. Place 1/2 cup stuffing down the center of each chicken breast half; roll up and secure with a toothpick. Place seam side down in a greased shallow 1-qt. baking dish. Spoon soup over chicken; sprinkle with remaining stuffing. Cover and bake at 400 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until chicken juices run clear. Remove toothpicks before serving.
