Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch pie plate with butter. Unroll pastry crust and press against the bottom and sides of the pie plate. Pierce all over with a fork. Cover with a piece of parchment paper or aluminum foil; fill with ceramic pie weights. Bake in the preheated oven until light brown, about 15 minutes. Let cool, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove pie weights. Spread mustard over cooled crust. Cover mustard with flaked tuna. Arrange tomato slices over tuna. Whisk cream, eggs, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until smooth. Pour evenly over the tomato slices. Sprinkle Gruyere cheese over the egg mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 30 minutes.
