Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Slice bread rolls horizontally without separating into individual rolls, creating 2 even halves. Whisk eggs in a large, shallow bowl until smooth. Stir in milk, vanilla extract, and cinnamon to make a smooth batter. Dip bottom half of bread rolls into batter, coating both sides, and place in baking dish. Cover bread with sliced bananas. Sprinkle brown sugar and pecans on top. Dot with cubes of butter. Dip top half of bread rolls in batter, coating both sides, and place on top. Bake in the preheated oven until middle is set and top is golden brown, about 25 minutes.
