Pour pine nuts into a small nonstick frying pan. Toast over medium heat, shaking pan often, until nuts are pale gold (2 to 3 minutes). Pour out of pan and set aside. Increase heat to medium-high. To pan, add pancetta and oil. Cook, stirring often, until pancetta is brown and crisp, about 3 minutes. Remove from pan with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels; set aside. Add shallot to pan and cook for 1 minute; then stir in vinegar and mustard. Remove pan from heat and set aside. Place spinach, green onion, egg, and pancetta in a medium bowl; pour in hot dressing and toss to coat evenly. Top with pine nuts. Serve immediately. Add pepper to taste.
