Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x9 inch baking pan. Mix egg, milk and oil together. In a separate bowl, stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cornmeal and potato flakes. Stir egg mixture into flour mixture just until combined. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of pan comes out clean.
