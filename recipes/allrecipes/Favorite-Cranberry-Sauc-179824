In a 2- to 3-quart pan over high heat, bring cranberries, granulated and brown sugars, orange and lemon juices, and cinnamon to simmering. Simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cranberries are tender when pierced, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in vanilla; let cool. Serve, or chill airtight up to 1 week.
