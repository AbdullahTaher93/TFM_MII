Blanch broccoli and cauliflower in a large pot of boiling water until just barely tender. Drain and rise with cold water. In a large bowl combine broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms, pepper, celery and onion. In a medium bowl, combine the vinegar, poppy seeds, sugar, mustard, salt and vegetable oil. Mix until well blended. Pour the marinade over the vegetables and mix well. Chill overnight before serving. Keep any extras refrigerated.
