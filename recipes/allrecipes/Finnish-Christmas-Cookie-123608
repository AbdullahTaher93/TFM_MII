In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar until fluffy. Beat in flour. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Roll out onto a well-floured surface to 1/4-in. thickness. Brush lightly with egg. Sprinkle with almonds and sugar if desired. Using a fluted pastry cutter or knife, cut into 2-in. x 1-in. strips. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-12 minute or until lightly browned. Cool on wire racks.
