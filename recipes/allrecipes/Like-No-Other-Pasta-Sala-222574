Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook penne at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water. Transfer to a large bowl. Blend onion, cucumber, canola oil, vinegar, sugar, garlic powder, salt, mustard, parsley, and pepper in a food processor or blender until smooth, about 2 minutes. Pour sauce over pasta; toss to coat. Refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.
