Cut zucchini lengthwise into quarters, then cut in half crosswise. In a large nonstick skillet, cook and stir zucchini in oil over medium heat for 4 minutes. Sprinkle with lemon peel, salt and pepper. Cook and stir 4-5 minutes longer or until zucchini is crisp-tender. Remove from the heat; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.
