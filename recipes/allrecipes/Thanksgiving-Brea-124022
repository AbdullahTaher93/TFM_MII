In a mixing bowl, beat eggs and sugar. Add pumpkin and oil; mix well. Add dry ingredients; stir just until moistened. Fold in cranberries. Spoon into two greased 8-1/2-in. x 4-1/2-in. x 2-1/2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-55 minutes or until bread tests done. Cool in pans 10 minutes before removing to wire racks.
