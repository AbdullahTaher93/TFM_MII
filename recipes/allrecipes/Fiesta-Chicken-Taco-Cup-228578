Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray 8 medium muffin cups with cooking spray. In 1-quart saucepan, heat taco sauce with chicken over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until thoroughly heated. Unroll dough and separate into 4 rectangles; press each into 8x4-inch rectangle, firmly pressing perforations to seal. Cut each in half crosswise, making 8 squares. Sprinkle both sides of each square with cornmeal. Press each in bottom and up side of muffin cup; turn edges of dough under, pressing to extend 1/4 inch above edge of cup. Spoon about 2 tablespoons chicken mixture into each cup. Sprinkle cheese over each. Bake 12 to 17 minutes or until edges are deep golden brown. Cool in pan on wire rack 5 minutes; remove from muffin cups. Serve warm.
