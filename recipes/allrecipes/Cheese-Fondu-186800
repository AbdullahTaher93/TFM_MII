Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook 2 minutes, whisking frequently. Whisk in milk until blended; bring to a boil. Cook briefly to thicken; whisk in wine. Simmer 2 minutes. Whisk in cheese by handfuls, adding more as previous addition is almost melted. When melted, smooth and hot, pour into small fondue pot or heatproof container over candle warmer. Dip bread cubes into fondue, using forks.
