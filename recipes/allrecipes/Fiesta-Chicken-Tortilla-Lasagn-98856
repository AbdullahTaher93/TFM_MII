Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a medium-size bowl, make a sauce by stirring together soup, corn, chiles and beans. Spread 1 cup sauce into the bottom of a greased 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Top with 3 tortillas, cutting one in half and overlapping it to cover the sauce. Spread 1-1/2 cups of sauce over tortillas and top with 1-1/2 cups of cheese. Cover with 3 tortillas, remaining sauce and remaining cheese. Bake uncovered for 30 minutes. Let set 10 minutes before cutting into squares.
