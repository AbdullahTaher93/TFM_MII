In a blender or food processor, whirl graham cracker pieces to make fine crumbs (you should have about 1 cup). Pour crumbs into a 9-inch pie pan. Mix in melted butter. Press mixture firmly over bottom and up sides of pan. Bake in a 350 degrees F oven until darker brown at rim, 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a 2- to 3-quart saucepan, mix cornstarch and 3/4 cup of sugar; add rhubarb and 1 tablespoon water. Stir often over medium heat until mixture comes to a full boil. Pour into crust. With a mixer or food processor, smoothly blend cream cheese, eggs, vanilla, and 6 tablespoons of the sugar; pour over rhubarb mixture in crust. Bake pie in a 350 degrees F oven until filling appears set in center when pan is gently shaken, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, mix sour cream with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar; set aside. Remove pie from oven and spread sour cream mixture evenly over filling. Bake again at 350 degrees F until topping is set when gently shaken, about 5 minutes. Let cool, then cover and chill at least 2 hours or overnight. Cut into wedges to serve.
