Dissolve yeast in warm water; set aside. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar and baking soda. Cut in shortening with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in yeast mixture and buttermilk; mix well. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface; knead lightly a few times. Roll to a 1/2-in. thickness. Cut with a 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter. Place on lightly greased baking sheet. Cover and let rise in a warm place for about 45 minutes. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10 minutes or until golden brown.
