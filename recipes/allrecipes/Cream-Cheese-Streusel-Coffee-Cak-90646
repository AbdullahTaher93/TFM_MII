Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine butter and sugar; beat well, using an electric mixer at high speed, until mixture is creamy. Gradually blend in nutmeg and 3/4 cup of the flour, mixing at low speed until mixture resembles crumbs. Remove 2/3 cup of the crumb mixture and set it aside for topping. To remaining mixture in bowl, add baking powder, salt, baking soda, and eggs. Beat at medium speed until smooth and well blended. Add remaining 1 1/4 cups flour alternately with buttermilk, beating after each addition just until blended. Spread batter in an oiled 9-inch-square baking pan. Drop cream cheese spread over the top of the batter by generous spoonfuls. Cut through the batter with a knife to marble the cheese through the batter. Using your fingers, squeeze reserved crumb mixture to make coarse crumbs; sprinkle evenly over the batter. Bake coffee cake until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean (about 35 minutes). Cut into squares and serve warm or at room temperature.
