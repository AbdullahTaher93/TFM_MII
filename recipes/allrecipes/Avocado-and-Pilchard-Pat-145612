In a mixing bowl, combine avocados herring fillets, olives, gherkins, and capers. Add chopped green onion if desired. Season with Worcestershire sauce and pepper. With an electric mixer, begin whisking together ingredients to make paste. Mix in mayonnaise to bind: for a rough mixture add in about 1 tablespoon mayonnaise, and for a smoother paste add up to 4 tablespoons. Chill for 4 to 8 hours.
