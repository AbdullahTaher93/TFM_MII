Steep the tea in the hot water for 5 minutes. Remove and discard the tea bags, then whisk in the saffron, sugar, lemon juice, rum extract, cayenne pepper, ginger, clove, coriander, salt, and tarragon until the sugar has dissolved. Cool to room temperature before using. Refrigerate any marinade that will not be used immediately. To use, marinate meats such as chicken or pork in the refrigerator overnight.
