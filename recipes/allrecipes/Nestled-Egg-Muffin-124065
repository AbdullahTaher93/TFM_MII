In a large bowl, combine flour, oats, sugar, baking powder and salt; set aside. Combine eggs, milk raisins and oil; mix well. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fill 18 greased or paper-lined muffin cups half full. Place one whole egg (with shell) on top of each muffin. Bake at 400 degrees F for 18-20 minutes. Cut an egg open to test for desired doneness. Serve warm.
