In a small mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, milk, salt and cayenne until smooth. Stir in the tomatoes, spinach and onion. Spoon into an ungreased microwave-safe 9-in. pie plate. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 5 minutes or until heated through, stirring once. Meanwhile, combine butter and oil; brush over both sides of pitas. Cut each pita into eight wedges; place on ungreased baking sheets. Combine cumin and lemon-pepper; sprinkle over both sides of wedges. Broil 4 in. from the heat for 2-3 minutes on each side or until lightly browned. Serve with spread.
