Cut off and discard the head and tail. Gut and fillet open the trout and remove the bones. Leave the skin on, it helps with serving. Line a shallow broiling pan with aluminum foil and lightly oil it. Lay the trout open on the pan with the skin side down. Place a rack 6-8 inches from the broiler. Preheat boiler. In a bowl add the lime juice, minced parsley, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, chili powder, salt and pepper. Mix well. Add a Tbsp of olive oil and whisk well. Repeat until all the oil is incorporated. Brush the dressing onto the trout. Place the pan under the broiler and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, with the oven door cracked open.
