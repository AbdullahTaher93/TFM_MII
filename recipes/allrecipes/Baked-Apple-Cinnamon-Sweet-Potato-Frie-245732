Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a rimmed baking sheet with olive oil or cooking spray. Place potato pieces into a large mixing bowl. Pour olive oil over the potatoes; stir to coat. Combine crushed Gluten-Free Apple Cinnamon Cheerios, garlic powder, cumin, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Sprinkle over potatoes and oil; stir gently to coat. Spread potato mixture over prepared baking sheet. Place on center rack of preheated oven. Bake 25 minutes; turn pieces over. Bake until tender and browned, about 20 more minutes. If desired, place under the broiler for the last minute or two.
