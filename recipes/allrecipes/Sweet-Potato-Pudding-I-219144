Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2-quart casserole dish. Mix together the sweet potato, sugar, light corn syrup, milk, melted butter, beaten eggs, ground nutmeg, ground cinnamon, salt, coconut, chopped pecans, and raisins in a large mixing bowl; spoon the mixture into the prepared dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and the pudding is set, about 90 minutes.
