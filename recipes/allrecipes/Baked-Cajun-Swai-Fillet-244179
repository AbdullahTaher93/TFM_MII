Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Arrange swai fish in a nonstick baking dish; season with Cajun seasoning and cayenne pepper. Layer banana peppers, habanero peppers, and thyme leaves on top of each fish fillet. Place 1 piece butter on top of each fish fillet. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 30 to 40 minutes.
