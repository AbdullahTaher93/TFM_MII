Combine vegetable broth, sea salt, brown sugar, peppercorns, rosemary, sage, and thyme in a large stockpot. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently until salt and sugar dissolve. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature. Pour the water, broth mixture, and apple cider vinegar into a 5-gallon bucket; stir until brine is combined. Add the apples, onion, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic to the brine mixture.
