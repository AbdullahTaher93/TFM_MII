Check the salmon for any tiny bones and remove them. Roughly crush the peppercorns with a mortar and pestle. Press them into the flesh side of the salmon. Set aside. Cut the potatoes into a saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until tender, about 10 to 12 minutes. Meanwhile, make the salsa. Peel and seed the mango, dice the flesh, and put into a large bowl. Mix in the green onions, cilantro, lime juice, olive oil, and a dash of Tabasco. Heat a ridged grill pan coated with nonstick cooking spray over medium-high heat. Place the salmon fillets in the pan, skin-side down. Cook for 4 minutes. Turn the fish over and cook until the fish is done, about another 4 minutes. Drain the potatoes. Arrange the watercress and new potatoes on 4 serving plates. Place the salmon on top and serve with the mango salsa.
