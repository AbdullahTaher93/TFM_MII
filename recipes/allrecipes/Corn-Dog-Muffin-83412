Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease muffin tins. Stir together the cornbread mix and the brown sugar in a large bowl. Whisk the eggs and milk in a small bowl until smooth. Fold the eggs and cheese into the dry mixture until moistened. Spoon mixture into muffin tins until 2/3 full. Add 1 hot dog half to each muffin. Bake in a preheated oven 14 to 18 minutes, or until golden brown.
