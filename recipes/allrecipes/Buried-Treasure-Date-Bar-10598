Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8 inch square baking pan. Combine flour, baking powder and salt and set aside. Separate eggs and beat together egg yolks and sugar until thick. Beat in milk and vanilla extract. Gradually blend in flour mixture. Fold in bran flakes, dates and nuts. In a large bowl, beat egg whites until stiff but not dry and fold into date mixture. Spread batter evenly in prepared pan. Bake for 15-20 minutes until top is lightly colored. Leave in pan and cool on wire rack. Cut cooled dough into 1 inch strips and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
