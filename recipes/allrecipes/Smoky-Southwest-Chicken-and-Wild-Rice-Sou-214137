In a large saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat; add onion and celery. Saute, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes or until softened. Stir in soup and broth. Add rice, carrots, chicken, chili powder, cumin, chipotle chile and 3/4 cup cheese; bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes to blend flavors; stir in cream and chopped cilantro. Garnish with remaining cheese and cilantro sprigs.
