PREHEAT oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease two baking sheets. COMBINE flour, baking powder and salt in medium bowl. Beat sugar and butter in large mixer bowl until light and creamy. Beat in eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in vanilla extract and lemon peel. COMBINE Nestea and water in small bowl; stir until tea is dissolved. Add to sugar mixture. Gradually stir in flour mixture and nuts. Shape dough into two 11 x 2-inch logs on each baking sheet; smooth sides with rubber spatula.
