In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in egg yolk and vanilla. Gradually add flour. Shape into 1-in. balls. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. With a glass dipped in sugar, flatten into 2-in. circles. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until firm. Remove to wire racks to cool. Combine filling ingredients. Spread on the bottom of half of the cookies; top with remaining cookies. Melt chocolate and butter; stir until smooth. Dip each cookie halfway in chocolate, then in nuts. Place on waxed paper to set.
