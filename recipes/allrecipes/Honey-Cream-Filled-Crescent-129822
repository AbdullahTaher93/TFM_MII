Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Mix cream cheese and 2 Tbsp. of the honey. Stir in almonds. Unroll crescent roll dough; separate into 8 triangles. Spread 1 rounded Tbsp. cream cheese mixture onto each triangle; roll up each loosely, starting at shortest side of triangle, rolling to opposite point. Place rolls on ungreased baking sheet; curve each into crescent shape. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake 12 to 14 min. or until golden brown. Serve rolls warm, drizzled with remaining honey.
