Place butter in a 15x10x1-inch baking pan; heat in a 400 degree F oven until melted, about 3 minutes. Stir in brown sugar and crushed pineapple until sugar is dissolved. In a shallow dish, beat together eggs, LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, and salt. Dip bread into egg mixture, letting bread soak for about 10 seconds on each side. Arrange in a single layer atop pineapple mixture. Bake in a 400 degree F oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Arrange bread slices on serving plates, pineapple side up. Spoon any pineapple mixture remaining in pan atop the bread slices.
