In a large bowl, combine the corn, tomatoes, sweet onion, green onion, and cilantro. Squeeze lime juice over mixture, and mix in. Stir in rice vinegar to taste; the amount you use will depend on the sweetness of the corn, and the acidity of the lime. Season with kosher salt. Cover, and chill for 45 minutes to an hour. Stir before serving.
