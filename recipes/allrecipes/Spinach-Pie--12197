Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Arrange bacon slices in a medium skillet. Fry over medium-high heat until browned and slightly crisp. Drain on paper towels, then crumble into bottom of pie shell. Cover with spinach. In a medium bowl, beat together eggs, sugar, salt, onion powder, minced onion, garlic, and pepper. Slowly add scalded milk. Pour mixture over spinach in shell. Top with shredded cheese. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
