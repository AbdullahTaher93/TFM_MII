In a bowl, combine bread crumbs, minced tomatoes and 2 tablespoons of the reserved oil, egg, salt, and pepper. Add ground beef and gently mix with a fork just until ingredients are evenly blended. Divide meat mixture into 8 equal portions. With your hands, shape each portion into a 4 inch wide patty. In the center of 4 of the patties, gently make a shallow depression about 2 inches wide; place one fourth of the fontina cheese in each depression. Gently top each cheese topped patty with a plain patty; press edges together to seal well. Lay patties side by side on a plate. Cover airtight and chill at least 20 minutes or up to 24 hours. Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for direct heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is directly under the food). Before you put the grill over the hot coals, brush it with a medium coat of oil. Lay patties on lightly oiled grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand just above grill level only 2 to 3 seconds). Keep charcoal grill uncovered; close lid on gas grill. Cook 6 minutes, then turn burgers with a wide spatula. Continue to cook cooking until meat is no longer pink in center (make a small cut to test, but be careful not to let cheese drip out), about 7 minutes longer. Transfer burgers to buns and garnish to taste.
