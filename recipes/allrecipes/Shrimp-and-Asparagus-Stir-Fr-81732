In a mixing bowl, blend together the teriyaki marinade, vinegar and lemon juice. Add the shrimp, toss well to coat and set aside. Cut the asparagus into bite-sized lengths (about an inch). Mince the garlic. In a wok (or skillet) over medium-high heat, add the oil, garlic and asparagus and stir fry for about 2 minutes. Then carefully add the shrimp and sauce. Stir fry for 1-2 minutes, just until the shrimp turns pink, then turn off heat and cover for about 2 minutes. Serve immediately.
