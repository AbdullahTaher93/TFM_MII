Slice the onion and the asparagus, and diced the peppers and tomatoes. Boil a gallon of water in a large pot and add the saffron and half the tomato paste. Then add the rice and boil for 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and spoon the rice into a large baking dish. (Don't discard the water.) Put the vegetables in the pot and heat on medium for 5 minutes; the water doesn't have to boil. Strain the vegetables and mix into the rice. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. In a saucepan, mix the steak, oil, garlic, stock, and remaining tomato paste. Heat on high, stirring occasionally, until the meat is brown (about 5 minutes). Add the wine and simmer, covered, for 3 minutes. Mix the steak and juices into the baking dish. Cover the dish with foil and bake it at 350 degrees F for about 15 minutes, stirring every 3 minutes.
