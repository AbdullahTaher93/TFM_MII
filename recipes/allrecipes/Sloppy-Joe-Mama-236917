Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in hot oil until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add ground beef; cook and stir until the beef is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard grease from the skillet. Transfer beef mixture to a slow cooker. Stir Mexican-style hot tomato sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, cider vinegar, and chili powder into the beef mixture. Cook on Low for 2 hours (or on High for 1 hour).
