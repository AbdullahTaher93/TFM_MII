In a bowl, mix the oil, white wine, and Cajun seasoning. Place chicken in the bowl, and coat with the mixture. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours. Preheat the grill for high heat. Lightly oil the grill grate. Discard marinade, and place chicken on the grill. Cook for 6 to 8 minutes on each side, until juices run clear.
