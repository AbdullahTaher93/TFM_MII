In a large, deep skillet, heat the olive oil until shimmering. Add the thinly sliced garlic, hot soppressata, sweet onion and crushed red pepper and cook over moderate heat until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Add the wine and vermouth and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the clams, cover and cook, shaking the skillet a few times, until all of the shells have opened, about 5 minutes. Discard any clams that do not open. Using a slotted spoon or Chinese wire skimmer, transfer the clams to shallow bowls. Add the chopped parsley and lemon juice to the broth in the skillet, then bring to a simmer. Ladle the broth over the clams and serve.
