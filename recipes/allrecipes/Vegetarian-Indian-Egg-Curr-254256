Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and fenugreek seeds; cook and stir until the seeds begin to sputter, about 5 minutes. Add onion to the pan; cook and stir until the onion turns golden, about 5 minutes. Stir tomatoes, red chile peppers, garlic, ginger, chili powder, salt, ground coriander, and cumin into the onion mixture. Cook and stir until the tomato begins to break down, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir eggs into the curry; reduce heat to low and simmer until flavors are mixed, about 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.
