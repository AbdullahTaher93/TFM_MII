Combine the lentils, bay leaf, 2 cups water, chicken broth, and salt together in a dutch oven or oven-proof saucepan; bring the mixture to a boil. Place a cover on the pan, reduce heat to medium-low, and allow the lentils to simmer for 30 minutes. Remove and discard the bay leaf. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir the dry mustard, ginger, soy sauce, onion, and 1 cup water together in a bowl; stir the mixture into the lentils. Drizzle the honey over the mixture. Return the cover to the pan. Bake in the preheated oven until the lentils are tender, about 1 hour.
