In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over high heat, stir oil, garlic, and mushrooms until garlic is limp, about 2 minutes. Add sherry and chile flakes; cover and simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is evaporated and mushrooms are browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir in parsley. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot or at room temperature.
