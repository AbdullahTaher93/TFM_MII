Stir panko bread crumbs, parsley flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper together in a bowl. Dip tenderloin slices in the crumb mixture to coat both sides. Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a skillet and fry the pork until the crumb coating is browned and the pork is no longer pink inside, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the pork should read at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C).
