In a saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch, salt and nutmeg. Stir in water, lemon juice and pureed peaches. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes or until mixture is thickened. Pour all but 1/2 cup glaze into the pie shell. Top with sliced peaches and brush with reserved glaze. Chill for at least 3 hours.
