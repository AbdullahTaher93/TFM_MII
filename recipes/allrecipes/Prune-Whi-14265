In a medium saucepan, simmer the prunes in water until soft, drain and puree. Combine the puree in a saucepan with the sugar and heat until the sugar dissolves. Add the lemon juice and vanilla. Beat the egg whites until frothy, add the cream of tarter, and beat until stiff. Fold the prune puree into the egg whites. Pour into a buttered and sugared 2 quart baking dish and bake in a preheated 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) oven until nicely browned. Refrigerate and serve chilled with whipping cream.
