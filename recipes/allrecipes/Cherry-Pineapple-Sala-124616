In a mixing bowl, dissolve gelatin in water. Combine pineapple and cherry juices to measure 2-1/2 cups; add along with lemon juice to gelatin. Divide gelatin in half. Set half of the gelatin aside and chill other half until partially set. Fold pineapple into chilled gelatin; pour into a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. pan. Chill until almost firm. Whip cream, mayonnaise, cream cheese and salt until light and fluffy. Spread over chilled gelatin layer. Refrigerate until firm. Chill remaining gelatin mixture until partially set. Fold in cherries and nuts; spread over cream cheese layer. Chill for at least 3 hours.
