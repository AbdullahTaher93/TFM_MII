Place chicken in large resealable plastic bag or glass dish. Add 1/4 cup of the marinade; turn to coat well. Refrigerate 30 minutes or longer for extra flavor. Meanwhile, mix mayonnaise and 2 tablespoons of the remaining marinade in small bowl. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Remove chicken from marinade. Discard any remaining marinade. Grill chicken over medium heat 6 to 7 minutes per side or until cooked through, brushing with remaining 2 tablespoons marinade. Spread mayonnaise mixture evenly on rolls. Top with chicken, bacon, tomato and lettuce.
