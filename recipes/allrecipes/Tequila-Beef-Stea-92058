With a damp paper towel, wipe steaks; put meat in a 1-gallon plastic food bag. Add tequila, oil, pepper, lemon peel, and garlic; seal bag and turn to mix seasonings. Set bag in a bowl and chill at least 1 hour or up to 1 day; turn bag over occasionally. Drain steaks and lay on a lightly oiled barbecue grill 4 to 6 inches above a solid bed of hot coals or gas grill on medium-high (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds). Cover gas grill. Turn steaks to brown evenly; for medium-rare (cut to test), cook 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer meat to plates; season to taste with salt.
