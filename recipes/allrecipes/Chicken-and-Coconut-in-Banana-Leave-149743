Whisk together soy sauce, barbeque sauce, ginger, and coconut. Pour over chicken drumsticks, thighs, plantain, and sweet potato in a resealable plastic bag. Seal, and marinate 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Gently warm the whole banana leaf over a fire or gas burner until the leaf is pliable, but not burnt, 3 to 4 minutes. Cut the leaf into four large squares, measuring at least 12x12 inches. Carefully cut four long, thin strips from the rib of the leaf, these will be used as 'string' to tie the packets later. Place a piece of meat onto each banana leaf square, and evenly divide the vegetables on top. Pour in any remaining marinade, and fold the leaves around the chicken like a present. Securely tie with the rib strips, and place the packets onto a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until the chicken is tender and no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. Check the packets occasionally to make sure they do not burn.
