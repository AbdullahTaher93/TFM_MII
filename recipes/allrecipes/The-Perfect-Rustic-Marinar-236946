Heat a stockpot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot stockpot until browned, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Blend tomato sauce, tomato, red wine, garlic, onion, Parmesan cheese, balsamic vinegar, basil, olive oil, thyme, oregano, black pepper, red pepper flakes, salt, and brown sugar together in a blender until desired consistency is reached. Pour mixture over sausage; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until wine has cooked off, at least 30 minutes.
