Place frozen burritos in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish; set aside. In a saucepan, melt butter. Stir in flour until a smooth; gradually stir in water. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Add the tomato sauce, chili powder, bouillon, cumin and salt. Simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until thickened. Pour over the burritos. Sprinkle with cheese, olives if desired and onions. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until heated through.
