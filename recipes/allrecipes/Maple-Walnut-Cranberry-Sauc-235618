Place cranberries into a large saucepan and stir in orange juice, maple syrup, sugar, port wine, ginger, orange zest, cinnamon stick, and salt. Bring sauce to a simmer. Berries will begin to pop. Cook at a simmer until berries are cooked through and soft, about 10 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and let cranberry sauce cool for about 5 minutes. Shake walnuts in a dry skillet over medium heat, cooking until golden brown and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Wipe away any small particles of walnut skin from skillet to avoid bitterness. Stir walnuts into cranberry sauce. Let cool to room temperature and transfer to a serving bowl; sauce will thicken as it cools. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, pushing wrap to touch sauce and refrigerate until needed. Sauce can be made several days ahead.
