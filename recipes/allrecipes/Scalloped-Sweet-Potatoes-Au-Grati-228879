Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Combine cream, milk, nutmeg, cinnamon, salt, and black pepper in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add sweet potatoes and simmer until sauce is thickened and sweet potatoes are almost tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish. Combine panko bread crumbs, Cheddar cheese, and butter in a bowl; sprinkle topping over sweet potato mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and cheese topping is browned and bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes.
