Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, oats, wheat germ, baking soda, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, and salt together in a bowl. Beat butter, coconut sugar, and brown sugar together in a separate bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy; add pumpkin puree, egg, and vanilla extract and mix well. Stir flour mixture into pumpkin mixture until dough is well mixed; fold in walnuts and raisins. Drop dough, about 1 tablespoon per cookie, on the the prepared baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned on the edges, about 15 minutes. Cool cookies on baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
