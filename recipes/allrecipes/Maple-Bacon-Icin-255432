Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Transfer bacon to a food processor; pulse until finely chopped. Combine confectioners' sugar and butter in a stand mixer; beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add maple flavoring. Mix in milk a little at a time until icing is spreading consistency. Fold in bacon.
