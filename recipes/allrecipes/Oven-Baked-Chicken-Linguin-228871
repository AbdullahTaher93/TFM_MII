Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Heat olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat; cook and stir chicken, onion, and garlic until onion is tender, chicken is no longer pink in the center and chicken juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes. Add tomatoes with their juice, oregano, basil, and thyme; cook until liquid has almost evaporated, about 10 minutes. Combine cooked linguine and 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese with chicken mixture in a large bowl; toss until Cheddar cheese begins to melt. Transfer mixture to a deep casserole dish; top with remaining Cheddar cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, 20 minutes.
