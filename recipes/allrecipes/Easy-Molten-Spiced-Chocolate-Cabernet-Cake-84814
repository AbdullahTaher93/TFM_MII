Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Butter 4 (6-ounce) custard cups or souffle dishes. Place on baking sheet. Microwave chocolate and butter in a large bowl on HIGH for 1 minute or until butter is melted. Whisk until chocolate is completely melted; stir in wine and vanilla. Stir in sugar until well blended. Whisk in eggs and yolk. Stir in flour, cinnamon, ginger and cloves. Pour batter into prepared custard cups. Bake 13 to 14 minutes or until sides are firm but centers are soft. Let stand 1 minute. Carefully loosen edges with a small knife. Invert cakes onto serving plates. Serve immediately. Top with Orange Cranberry Cream, if desired.
