Combine Worcestershire sauce and vinegar in a zip-top plastic bag. Add steaks and refrigerate at least 30 minutes. Grill steaks, covered with grill lid, over medium-high heat (350 degrees to 400 degrees ) about 8 to 10 minutes on each side or to desired degree of doneness. Slice across the grain into thin slices. Combine mayonnaise and sun-dried tomatoes. Spread mayonnaise mixture on bread slices. Layer steak, lettuce, tomatoes, blue cheese and top with remaining bread slices.
