Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin. Mix flour, baking powder, and baking soda together in a small bowl. Beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and frothy, about 3 minutes. Add chocolate milk, sugar, coconut, and oats; beat until thoroughly combined, about 2 minutes. Slowly add flour mixture to the bowl and beat together until no lumps remain in batter. Scoop batter into muffin cups, filling each 2/3 of the way full. Sprinkle a few chocolate chips on top of each muffin. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool, about 25 minutes, before transferring to a serving plate.
