Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in the hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in cumin, ginger, and cinnamon and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir tomato soup, coconut milk, and diced tomatoes into the onion mixture and cook until soup is heated through, about 10 minutes.
