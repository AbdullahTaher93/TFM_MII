Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 muffin tins or line with paper liners. Mix brown sugar and butter together in a bowl until creamy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each one. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Stir flour mixture, milk, and dragon eyes into the sugar mixture. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin tins. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.
