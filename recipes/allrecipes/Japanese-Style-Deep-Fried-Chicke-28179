In a large bowl, mix together eggs, salt, pepper, sugar, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce, and bouillon. Add chicken pieces, and stir to coat. Cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Remove bowl from refrigerator, add potato starch and rice flour to meat, and mix well. In a large skillet or deep fryer, heat oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Place chicken in hot oil, and fry until golden brown. Cook meat in batches to maintain oil temperature. Drain briefly on paper towels. Serve hot.
