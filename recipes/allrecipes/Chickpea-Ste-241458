Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; saute cumin seeds for 10 seconds. Add onion and garlic; saute until onion is dark brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Add coriander; cook and stir for 20 seconds. Mix chickpeas, water, potato, 1 teaspoon cilantro, salt, and pepper into onion mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover saucepan, and simmer until potato is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir tomato into chickpea stew; increase heat to medium and simmer until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle remaining cilantro over stew.
