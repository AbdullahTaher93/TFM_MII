Mix salmon, eggs, bread crumbs, mayonnaise, lemon juice, ranch dressing mix, salt, pepper, garlic powder, dill, and seafood seasoning in a large bowl; divide into 15 portions and shape into patties. Dust each patty with cornmeal. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet. Fry a few patties in hot oil, not overcrowding the skillet, until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Repeat until all patties are cooked. Garnish each with a lemon slice and a sprig of parsley.
