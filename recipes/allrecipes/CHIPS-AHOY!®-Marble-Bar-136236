Drop spoonfuls of the chocolate mixtures onto wax paper-covered baking sheet, alternating the colors of the chocolates. Cut through the chocolate mixtures several times with knife for marble effect. Sprinkle evenly with almonds; press lightly into chocolate. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or until firm. Break into 14 pieces. Store in airtight container at room temperature.
