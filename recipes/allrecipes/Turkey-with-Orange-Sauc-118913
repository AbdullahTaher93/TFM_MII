Sprinkle turkey with 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper; place in a microwave-safe 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. dish. Cover, venting one corner, and microwave on high for 3 minutes. Turn turkey; cover and microwave 1 to 1-1/2 minutes longer or until turkey is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 170 degrees F. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the cornstarch, brown sugar, orange juice, lemon juice, butter and remaining salt. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 1 to 1-1/2 minutes or until thickened; stir until smooth. Serve with turkey.
