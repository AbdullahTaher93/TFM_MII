Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain water and run quinoa under cold water to cool. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add kale, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Place chopped kale in a bowl and refrigerate until chilled, 3 to 5 minutes. Mix avocado, tomato, and cucumber together in a bowl; add quinoa and kale. Sprinkle feta cheese over quinoa mixture; add Italian dressing and stir.
