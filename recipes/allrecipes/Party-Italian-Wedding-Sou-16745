In a large pot over medium heat, combine the chicken broth, spinach, onions, carrots and celery. Mix well and allow to simmer. In a separate large bowl, combine the ground beef, bread crumbs and egg and mix well. Form mixture into 1/2 inch diameter meatballs and carefully drop them into the soup. Put chunks of chicken breast into the soup and reduce heat to low. Allow the soup to simmer for 1 hour. Add the pasta 30 minutes before serving and season with salt and pepper to taste.
