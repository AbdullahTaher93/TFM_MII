Rinse sticky rice and place in a bowl; cover with water. Soak rice for at least 3 hours. Drain. Beat egg in a large bowl; mix in ginger root, soy sauce, and salt. Add pork, cornstarch, and pork stock; stir in 1 direction until combined, 5 to 6 minutes. Roll pork mixture into bite-size balls. Pour enough water into the bottom of a wok to cover by about 1 inch; bring to a simmer. Roll pork balls in sticky rice until they are coated completely. Place 6 balls in a steamer basket. Place steamer in the wok and steam until pork is cooked through and rice is tender, about 30 minutes. Remove balls and garnish with goji berries.
