Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Place carrots and eggs into a food processor and pulse several times to chop carrots; process until finely ground, about 2 minutes. Add 1 cup melted butter, white sugar, matzo meal, vanilla extract, and cinnamon to carrot mixture and process until liquified, 2 to 3 more minutes. Pour carrot mixture into prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of the souffle comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Mix walnuts, brown sugar, and 1/4 cup melted butter in a bowl. Spread walnut mixture over carrot souffle, return to oven, and bake until topping is bubbling, 5 to 10 more minutes.
