Place caramels, butter and cream in a 2-qt. microwave-safe dish. Microwave, uncovered, on medium for 2 minutes; stir. Microwave 1-3 minutes more, stirring every minute, until smooth. Stir in sugar until smooth. Add peanuts. Gently fold in marshmallows. Sprinkle the coconut in a 10-in. x 5-in. strip onto two sheets of waxed paper; spoon caramel mixture down the center of coconut. Using the waxed paper, coat caramel with coconut and roll into two 10-in. logs. Discard waxed paper. Wrap logs in plastic wrap and chill for 4 hours. Remove plastic wrap. Cut logs into 1/2-in. slices. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
