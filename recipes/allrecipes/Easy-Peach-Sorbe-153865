Place unopened cans of peaches in freezer until solid (about 24 hours). Submerge unopened frozen cans in very hot tap water for 1 minute. Open bottom side of cans with can opener. Pour any thawed syrup into food processor bowl. Remove fruit from can; carefully cut into chunks, about 2 inches in size. Place into food processor with remaining ingredients (blender or mini-processors are not recommended). Process until smooth, scraping blade as needed. Serve immediately or freeze until ready to serve. Garnish with additional Peach Slices and fresh mint, if desired.
