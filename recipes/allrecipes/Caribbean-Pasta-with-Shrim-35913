In a small bowl, combine garlic, shallots, ginger and oil. In another small bowl, combine green pepper, tomato, curry powder, allspice, chicken stock, Grand Marnier, soy sauce, brown sugar, cornstarch, and chile paste. Cover and refrigerate both until ready to use. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Heat a large saute pan over high. When hot, add garlic-oil mixture. Saute until garlic begins to sizzle but has not browned. Stir the tomato mixture, then pour into the saute pan. Bring to a rapid boil and cook until it begins to thicken, about 3 minutes. Stir in the shrimp, and toss until they become pink, about 2 minutes. Immediately add the pasta. Stir and toss until well combined and pasta is heated through. Taste and adjust seasonings, especially salt. Transfer to a heated platter and sprinkle on the cilantro. Serve at once.
