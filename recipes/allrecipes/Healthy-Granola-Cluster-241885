Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat sugar, butter, and vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add oats, whole wheat flour, applesauce, eggs, molasses, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, and salt and mix well. Fold walnuts and raisins into mixture; spoon onto a baking sheet, about 1 teaspoon per cluster. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and crisp, 10 to 13 minutes.
