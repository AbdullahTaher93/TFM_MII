Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Prepare a baking sheet by spraying with canola cooking spray. Combine dry ingredients in a large bowl -- oats, wheat germ, coconut, seeds and salt. Add milk, canola oil and honey, stirring constantly. Spread on the baking sheet about 1/4 inch thick. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes until browned, stirring two or three times during cooking. Cool and store in tightly covered container in the refrigerator for up to one week. Serve as a cereal with milk and fruit or eat by the handful as a snack.
