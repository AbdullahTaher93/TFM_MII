Place egg whites in a shallow bowl. In a separate shallow bowl, mix together cornmeal, herbs, salt and pepper. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Dip tomatillo slices in egg whites, then dredge in cornmeal mixture turning to coat both sides. Fry tomatillo slices 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Be careful not to over cook; tomatillos should be tender, but not totally softened. Serve immediately.
