Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook shell pasta in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain. Combine mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, and broccoli in a large bowl; fold in pasta. Drizzle with Caesar salad dressing, tossing to combine. Refrigerate until serving.
