Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a 12-cup muffin pan with cooking spray. In a medium bowl, whisk egg, butter, milk, and lemon zest until combined. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder and salt. Fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Stir until well combined. Gently fold the white baking chips and raspberries into the batter. Divide the batter evenly between the cups and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons sugar. Bake 15 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
