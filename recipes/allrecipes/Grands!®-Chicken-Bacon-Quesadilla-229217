In small bowl, mix sour cream, 1 sliced green onion and 1 tablespoon of the ranch dip mix. In another small bowl, mix salsa, preserves and 1 tablespoon of the cilantro. Heat closed medium-size contact grill for 5 minutes; spray grill plates with Crisco(R) Original No-Stick Cooking Spray. Meanwhile, in medium bowl, mix chicken, cheese, bacon and remaining green onions, cilantro and ranch dip mix. Separate dough into 8 biscuits; press or roll each into 5-inch round. Place 1/4 cup chicken mixture on one side of each biscuit round. Fold biscuit over filling; press edges to seal. Place biscuits, two at a time, on grill; close grill. Cook 2 to 3 minutes or until golden brown. Cut each quesadilla into 3 wedges. Serve with sour cream and salsa mixtures.
