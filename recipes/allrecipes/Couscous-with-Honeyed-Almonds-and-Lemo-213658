Toast almonds in a skillet over medium heat until the nuts just began to brown. Stir in the honey making sure to coat the nuts. Spread the mixture on tin foil to cool; when the almonds have cooled completely break into small pieces. Bring water to a boil in a 2 quart or larger sauce pan and stir in the couscous. Cover the pot and and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until all the liquid has been absorbed. Remove from heat and stir in the almonds, lemon zest, and salt.
