Preheat oven to 325 degrees. With whisk attachment, beat egg whites on medium speed until soft peaks form. With mixer still on, slowly add sugar and salt. Beat 2 more minutes. Fold egg whites into pecans. Then spread mixture onto an ungreased sheet pan. Bake until egg whites are puffed and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Toss to deflate whites, spread out again and bake until nuts are lightly toasted, about 15 minutes. Yields 3 cups. Reserve 1/2 cup for the salad. Set extras out for guests to nibble on before the meal. In a mortar, food processor or blender, pound the garlic, chilies and sugar into a paste. Add soy sauce, vinegar and water. Yields 3 cups. Set aside 1/2 cup for the salad. Store remainder in refrigerator. In a large bowl, combine all salad ingredients with 1/2 cup Candied Pecans, and 1/2 cup Dressing. Toss well and serve.
