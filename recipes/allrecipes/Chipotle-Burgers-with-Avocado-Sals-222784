Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Place half the chopped cilantro into a large bowl and mix with ground beef, chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, mushrooms, and Worcestershire sauce. Set remaining cilantro aside. Form the beef mixture into 4 patties. Lightly toss remaining cilantro in a bowl with avocado, onion, tomato, jalapeno peppers, lime juice, salt, and black pepper. Grill burgers on the preheated grill until browned and no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes per side. Serve the burgers on onion rolls topped with avocado salsa.
