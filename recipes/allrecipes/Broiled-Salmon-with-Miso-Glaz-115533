Position oven rack in upper third of oven; preheat broiler. Line a small baking pan with foil. Coat foil with cooking spray. Toast sesame seeds in a small dry skillet over low heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside. Whisk miso, mirin, soy sauce (or tamari), ginger and hot pepper sauce in a small bowl until smooth. Place salmon fillets, skin-side down, in the prepared pan. Brush generously with the miso mixture. Broil salmon, 3 to 4 inches from the heat source, until opaque in the center, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer the salmon to warmed plates and garnish with the reserved sesame seeds, scallions and cilantro (or parsley).
