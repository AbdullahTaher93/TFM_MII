Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil and cook the soba noodles according to package instructions, or until al dente, about 6 minutes. Meanwhile, cut all of the mixed vegetables into bite-sized pieces. Add to the simmering pasta for the final 3 to 4 minutes of cooking. Drain the pasta and vegetables in a large colander. Place all remaining ingredients in the empty saucepan and return it to the heat. Heat until simmering, then reduce to low. Return the pasta and vegetables to the pan, and cook very briefly until they are reheated. Serve in deep soup bowls, with a spoon to drink the broth and a fork or chopsticks for picking up the solid ingredients.
