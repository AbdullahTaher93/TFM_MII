Spread walnuts in a single layer on a baking sheet. Roast at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes. Chop coarsely. Butter aluminum foil. Pierce beets with a fork, and wrap with foil. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 1 hour, or until tender. Cool. In a medium bowl, beat yogurt until smooth. Mix in green chile pepper, coriander, and walnuts. Season to taste with salt. Chill for 30 minutes. Peel beets, and quarter without cutting all the way through. Place in a serving dish, and spread open. Spoon dressing over beets, and garnish with cilantro, and minced red chile peppers.
