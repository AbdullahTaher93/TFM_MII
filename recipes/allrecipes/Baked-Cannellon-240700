Meat filling: In a large skillet, crumble and cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink and lightly browned; drain, remove from pan and set aside. In the same skillet, heat oil and sauté onions and mushrooms until tender and excess moisture has evaporated. Add sausage to skillet and set aside. Sauce: In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add flour and stir until smooth. Continue to cook and stir until mixture is golden in color, about 3-4 minutes. Gradually add milk, whisking constantly, until sauce comes to a boil and thickens, about 6-8 minutes. Pour one-half of the sauce into the skillet with sausage mixture. Set remaining sauce aside. Return skillet with sausage mixture to the stovetop. Over medium heat, add 3 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese and continue to stir. Gradually add egg yolks and cook until cheese is melted and mixture is hot. Remove from heat and cover. In a Dutch oven, cook pasta according to package directions, drain and rinse with cold water. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spread ¾ cup of the reserved sauce in the bottom of a greased 13-in.x9-in.x 2-in. baking dish. Using a large piping bag or plastic bag with a corner snipped off, fill bag with sausage mixture. Carefully squeeze filling into each end of the cooked pasta. Arrange pasta in prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with remaining mozzarella cheese. Top with Parmesan cheese and oregano. Bake uncovered, at 400F for 40-45 minutes or until heated through and lightly browned. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
