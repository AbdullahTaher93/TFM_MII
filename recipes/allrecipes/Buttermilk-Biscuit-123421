In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. Cut in the shortening until crumbly. Stir in the buttermilk just until moistened. Knead on a floured surface for 1 minute. Roll out to 1/2-in. thickness; cut with a 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter. Place on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 450 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.
