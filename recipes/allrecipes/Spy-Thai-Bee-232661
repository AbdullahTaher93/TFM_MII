Heat large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. Add ground beef; cook 8 to 10 minutes, breaking into 1/2-inch crumbles and stirring occasionally. Remove drippings. Meanwhile, combine water, peanut butter, soy sauce, lime juice, garlic powder, ground ginger and red pepper. Stir peanut butter mixture into beef. Continue to cook over medium heat 2 to 3 minutes or until heated through, stirring occasionally. Evenly divide beef mixture over six wonton triangles, if desired. Garnish with toppings, as desired.
