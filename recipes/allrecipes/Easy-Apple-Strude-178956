Thaw pastry sheet at room temperature 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Mix egg and water. Unfold pastry on lightly floured surface. Roll into 16x12-inch rectangle. With short side facing you, spoon pie filling on bottom half of pastry to within 1 inch of edges. Starting at short side, roll up like a jelly roll. Place seam-side down on baking sheet. Tuck ends under to seal. Brush with egg mixture. Cut several 2-inch slits about 2 inches apart on top. Bake 35 minutes or until golden. Cool on baking sheet on wire rack 30 minutes. Slice and serve warm.
