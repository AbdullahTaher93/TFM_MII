Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 3-quart casserole dish. Mix corn, cream-style corn, corn muffin mix, sour cream, jalapeno pepper, butter, ground black pepper, and salt together in a bowl; pour into prepared casserole dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.
