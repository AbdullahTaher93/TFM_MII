Stir cheese mix, breadcrumbs, and 1/3 cup basil in medium bowl to blend. Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Sprinkle eggplant and tomatoes with salt and pepper. Mix olive oil and Savory Market Open Hearth Grill Flavor. Brush 1side of eggplant slices with some oil/flavor mixture. Grill, oiled side down, until bottom side is tender and grill marks appear, about 3 minutes. Brush second side of eggplant slices with more oil; turn over and top grilled side with tomatoes and cheese mixture. Sprinkle with Parmesan. Drizzle with remaining oil. Cover and grill until tomatoes are tender and the cheese melts (about 5 minutes), then transfer eggplant slices to plates. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons basil and serve.
