Spread cucumber slices in a thin layer on a large platter. Sprinkle salt generously over the cucumber. Let salt soak into cucumber slices for about 30 minutes. Transfer cucumber to a colander and rinse with cold water; drain thoroughly and transfer to a dry surface. Pat cucumbers dry with paper towel. Whisk vinegar, olive oil, sugar, and dill together in a large bowl. Add cucumber slices and tomatoes; toss to coat.
