In a large bowl, combine flour, whole wheat flour, salt, nutmeg and pepper; mix. Make a well in the center and add eggs and 2 tablespoons olive oil; beat well. In a bowl combine chestnut puree and 1/2 cup water; add to egg mixture. Incorporate flour and egg mix. Dough will be very stiff. Adjust with more flour or water. Knead for 10 minutes and allow dough to rest for 5 minutes. Cut off a handful of dough. With a rolling pin, roll 6 inch wide strips, 1/16" thick. Use a pasta machine if you have one. Dust strips with flour. Allow to slightly dry on muslin cloth. Cut into long pasta 1/4" wide. Dry for 30 minutes. Add pasta to a large pot of rapidly boiling salted water with a tablespoon of oil. Boil for 5 minutes; drain. Mix pasta with olive oil, minced garlic, Romano cheese, salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
