Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the water, chicken bouillon, cannellini beans, and diced tomatoes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 30 minutes. Stir in the torn escarole, and continue simmering until the escarole is tender, about 30 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 5 to 10 minutes more before serving.
