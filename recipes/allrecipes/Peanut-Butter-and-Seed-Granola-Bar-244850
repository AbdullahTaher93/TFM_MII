Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with parchment paper or lightly spray with cooking spray. Mix oats, cashews, pumpkin seeds, coconut, cocoa nibs, chia seeds, and hemp seeds together in a bowl. Combine peanut butter, almond butter, honey, and coconut oil in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until smooth and well mixed, stirring every 30 seconds. Mix peanut butter mixture into oat mixture using your hands or a spoon until well combined. Firmly press mixture into the prepared pan. Cut into bars, cover pan, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
