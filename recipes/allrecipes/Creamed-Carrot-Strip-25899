Heat water in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Dissolve bouillon in hot water and add carrots; cover and boil gently for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute celery, mushrooms and onion until tender. Stir in flour, salt, tarragon and pepper. Gradually stir in milk and carrots with the broth they were boiled in. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture comes to a boil and thickens.
