Beat cream cheese and sugar in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Stir in whipped topping. Cover bottom (flat) side of each of 10 of the cookies with about 2 Tbsp. of the cream cheese mixture; top each with second cookie, bottom-side down, to form sandwich. Dip half of each sandwich in chocolate; gently shake off excess chocolate. Place in single layer in airtight container. Freeze 3 hours or until firm. Store leftover sandwiches in freezer.
