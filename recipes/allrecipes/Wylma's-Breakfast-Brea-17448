Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 inch Bundt. Cook the sausage in a skillet over medium heat. Drain on paper towels and crumble. In a large bowl, combine the sausage, cream cheese, cheddar cheese, green onion and baking mix. In another bowl, beat together the eggs and the milk. Add the egg mixture to the flour/cheese mixture; stir just to moisten. Pour into prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 to 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the loaf comes out clean. Remove immediately from the pan and cool slightly on a wire rack. Serve warm. May also be frozen if desired.
