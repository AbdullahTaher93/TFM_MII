Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lay out a piece of aluminum foil large enough to hold the ingredients. Place the pork chops, on the foil, then place the sweet potato, onion and apple over the chops. Fold up and seal each package. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes, or until the potato is soft when pricked with a fork. (Note: Do not open packages while baking as this will allow the steam to escape and will dry out the pork chops. Also, be careful when opening as the steam can burn.)
