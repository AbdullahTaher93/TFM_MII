Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Beat together butter, honey, eggs, orange peel, and vanilla until well blended; stir in the nuts. Peel pear, core, and cut into about 1/2-inch slices. Distribute pear over bottom of pie shell. Pour honey mixture over fruit. Bake on the lowest rack of oven until filling is set when pan is gently jiggled, about 45 minutes. If top begins to brown excessively, drape pie loosely with a sheet of foil until pie finishes baking. Let cool in pan on a rack. If made ahead, cover loosely and let stand until next day. Cut into wedges and top with whipped cream.
