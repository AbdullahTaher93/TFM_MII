Place the butter, olive oil, garlic, orange zest, salt, peppercorns, oregano, rosemary, thyme, cumin, balsamic vinegar, and orange juice into the container of a blender, and pulse several times to combine. Push cloves into the onion, and place the clove-spiked onion, cinnamon stick, orange half, and bay leaf into the cavity of a turkey prepared for roasting. Place the turkey into an oven bag, and use your fingers to loosen the skin over the breast and legs. Pour marinade underneath the loosened turkey skin, seal the bag, and roast according to the oven bag instructions for your turkey's weight.
