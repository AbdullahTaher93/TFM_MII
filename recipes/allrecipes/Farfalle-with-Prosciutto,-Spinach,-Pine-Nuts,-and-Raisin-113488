In a small frying pan, toast the pine nuts over moderately low heat, stirring frequently, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Or toast them in a 350 degrees F oven for 5 to 10 minutes. Combine the raisins and the boiling water. Let stand until plump, about 10 minutes. Drain. In a large frying pan, heat the oil over moderately low heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in the spinach and cook, stirring, until just wilted, about 2 minutes. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the farfalle until just done, about 15 minutes. Drain. Toss with the pine nuts, raisins, spinach mixture, prosciutto, salt, pepper, and Parmesan.
