Separate ground beef into 4 equal parts (4 ounces each); form each part into 4 thin half moon shape patties. Try to shape each patty to fill half of a tortilla. Heat a 10-inch non-stick skillet (or use a square, deep-walled non-stick electric skillet) over medium high heat. Season each hamburger patty with salt and pepper and cook for 3 minutes a side or to your desired temperature. Near the end of desired cooking time, evenly sprinkle each patty with 1/4 cup of Cheddar cheese and allow the cheese to melt. Remove cheeseburgers and reserve hot. Warm tortillas in a microwave for 10 seconds. For 1 serving: Place a hot cheeseburger on one half of a warmed tortilla and top with 1 tomato slice,1 lettuce leaf, onion rings and 3 pickle slices. Fold the tortilla in half and serve. Repeat the build for the remaining 3 servings.
