Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange ham steaks in a baking dish. Whisk brown sugar, maple syrup, Dijon mustard, and vinegar in a bowl; pour over ham steaks. Sprinkle cloves over ham steaks. Bake in the preheated oven until browned on both sides, about 45 minutes, turning every 15 minutes. Discard cloves before serving.
