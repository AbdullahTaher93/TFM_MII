In a mixing bowl, cream butter for 30 seconds. Add sugar and vanilla; beat until well combined. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine flour, baking powder and soda; add to creamed mixture alternately with sour cream. Spoon half of batter into a greased 10-in. tube pan. Combine topping ingredients; sprinkle half over batter. Add remaining batter and topping. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes or until done. Cool in pan on wire rack for 10 minutes before removing from pan to cool completely. For icing, combine all ingredients; drizzle over cake.
