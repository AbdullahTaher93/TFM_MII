Rinse chicken and pat dry. Place chicken between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. With a heavy, flat-sided mallet, pound meat firmly but gently all over to a thickness of about 1/4 inch. Discard plastic and cut chicken into 1/2-inch-wide strips; set aside. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a wide frying pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and mushrooms; cook, stirring often, until onion is soft and golden and mushroom liquid has evaporated (about 10 minutes). Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix cornstarch, sherry, soy sauce, cayenne, and 1/4 cup of the broth; set aside. In a 2- to 3-quart pan, combine remaining 3/4 cup broth and milk; bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in couscous; cover tightly, remove from heat, and let stand until almost all liquid has been absorbed (about 7 minutes). Using a slotted spoon, remove onion mixture from frying pan and place in a bowl; set aside. To same pan, add remaining 1 tablespoon butter, swirling pan until butter is melted. Add chicken strips and stir-fry until meat is tinged with brown and no longer pink in center; cut to test (4 to 5 minutes). Return onion mixture to pan; add cornstarch mixture and cook, stirring, until sauce is bubbling and thickened (1 to 2 minutes). Remove pan from heat. Fluff couscous with a fork, then mound on a warm platter. Spoon chicken mixture around couscous.
