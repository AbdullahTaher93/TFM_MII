Combine turkey broth, lemongrass, ginger, cilantro stems, lime leaves, and red pepper flakes in a pot over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until flavors blend, 20 to 30 minutes. Stain broth mixture through a fine-mesh sieve, discard vegetables, and return broth to the pot. Stir turkey, mushrooms, fish sauce, and palm sugar into broth; simmer until mushrooms are tender and turkey absorbs broth flavor, about 15 minutes. Pour coconut milk, lime juice, green onions, and cilantro leaves into broth. Bring soup to a simmer and drizzle in chili oil.
