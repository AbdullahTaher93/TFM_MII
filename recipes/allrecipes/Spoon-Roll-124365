In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand for 5 minutes. Add butter, egg and sugar; mix well. Stir in flour until thoroughly combined (batter will be soft). Cover and refrigerate overnight. Spoon batter into greased or paper-lined muffin cups. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.
