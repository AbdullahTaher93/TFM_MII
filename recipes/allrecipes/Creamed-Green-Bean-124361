In a small saucepan, melt 1 tablespoon butter; stir in cornflakes and set aside. Melt remaining butter in a large saucepan. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, onion and sugar; heat and stir until bubbly. Reduce heat; add the sour cream and stir until smooth. Cook and stir over low heat for 2 minutes (do not boil). Fold in the beans. Spread into a greased 1-1/2-qt. baking dish. Sprinkle cheese evenly over the top. Sprinkle with cornflake mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes or until heated through.
