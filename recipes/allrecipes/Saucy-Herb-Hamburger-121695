In a bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Shape into four patties. For the barbecue sauce, combine ketchup, brown sugar and mustard in a small bowl. Grill patties, uncovered, over medium-hot heat for 3 minutes on each side. Brush with barbecue sauce. Grill 4-6 minutes longer or until juices run clear, basting and turning several times. Serve on buns.
