Meanwhile, in small bowl, combine remaining 1/4 cup Marinade and syrup; set aside. Remove chicken from Marinade, discarding Marinade. Grill or broil chicken 30 minutes, turning and brushing frequently with reserved maple syrup mixture during the last 10 minutes or until chicken is thoroughly cooked.
