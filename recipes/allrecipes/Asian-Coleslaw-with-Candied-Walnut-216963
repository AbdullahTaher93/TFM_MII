In a large bowl, toss together cabbage, jicama, carrots and cilantro. Whisk together ponzu, sesame oil, orange juice and ginger; pour over cabbage mixture and toss together. Sprinkle with candied walnuts. To make candied walnuts, place 1 cup walnuts and 1/2 cup sugar in a skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves and turns light brown. Toss to coat walnuts. Remove skillet from heat; stir in 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Spread walnuts on aluminum foil to cool.
