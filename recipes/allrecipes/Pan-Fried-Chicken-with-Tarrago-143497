In large bowl, whisk dressing ingredients and set aside. Place chicken between two sheets of plastic wrap. With kitchen mallet (or bottom of small, heavy saucepan), pound tenders 2 or 3 times until 1/4 inch thick. In medium bowl, mix poultry seasoning, tarragon, garlic, and salt. Coat chicken with mixture. Coat large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and place on high. When pan is hot, add 4 to 5 chicken tenders and cook on medium-high until golden and firm, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Wipe down pan with paper towel to remove any burned crumbs and repeat process until all tenders are cooked. Add greens to large bowl and toss with dressing. To serve, place 2 cups greens on dinner plate and top with 3 or 4 chicken tenders.
