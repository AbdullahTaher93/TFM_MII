In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth; gradually beat in milk. Add dry cake mix and eggs; beat until combined. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Pour into a greased and floured 10-in. fluted tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely.
