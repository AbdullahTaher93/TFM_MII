Put creme de cacao in shot glass. Hold a regular teaspoon (not a measuring spoon) upside down over liqueur (spoon should be at a diagonal, with only the tip touching the liqueur), then gently pour cherry juice over curved part of spoon to float it on top of creme de cacao. Using a clean, dry teaspoon, gently pour cream into glass in same manner, creating a third layer. Shave some chocolate over cream using a vegetable peeler.
