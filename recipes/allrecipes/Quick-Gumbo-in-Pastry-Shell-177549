Bake the pastry shells according to the package directions. Remove from the baking sheet and cool on a wire rack. Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the green pepper, red pepper, garlic powder and ground red pepper. Cook for about 5 minutes or until tender. Stir the soup, water, chicken, shrimp, and kielbasa into the skillet. Heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes. Spoon about 1/3 cup of the chicken mixture in each shell. Serve immediately.
