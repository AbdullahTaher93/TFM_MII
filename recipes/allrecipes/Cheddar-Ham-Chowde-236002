Bring water, potatoes, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper to a boil in a large saucepan. Reduce heat, cover with a lid, and simmer until vegetables are just tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Melt butter in a separate large saucepan over medium heat. Stir flour into melted butter until smooth. Gradually stir milk into butter-flour mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir cream cheese and Cheddar cheese into milk mixture until melted. Pour potato mixture, including liquid, into milk-cheese mixture; add corn and ham. Cook, stirring occasionally, until soup is heated through, 10 to 15 more minutes.
