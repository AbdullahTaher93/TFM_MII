Spread cream cheese on lightly toasted Bays English Muffin halves, then sprinkle with walnut pieces. Place three to four slices of leftover turkey (or deli turkey) over the cream cheese and walnuts, then top with Craisins or your favorite cranberry sauce. For your Roast Beef Sandwiches, spread lightly toasted Bays English Muffins with a teaspoon of horseradish, then with a layer of scallion cream cheese. Top each muffin half with three to four slices of leftover roast beef or deli roast beef, then sprinkle with walnut pieces and enjoy!
