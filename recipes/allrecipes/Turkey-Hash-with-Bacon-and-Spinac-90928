In a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat, stir bacon, garlic, and onion often until mixture is lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, in a food processor or with a knife, coarsely chop turkey and 1/2 cup rice. Put in a bowl and add bacon mixture and remaining rice. Chop spinach leaves and add to bowl along with salt and pepper to taste. In another bowl, beat eggs to blend; stir into meat mixture. Shape into 8 patties, each about 3/4 inch thick. Wipe frying pan clean. Melt half of the butter in pan over medium-high heat. Add 3 or 4 patties and cook until bottoms are browned, about 4 minutes. With a spatula, gently turn patties and cook until brown on other side, about 4 minutes longer. Transfer to a platter and keep warm; repeat to cook remaining patties. Transfer patties to dinner plates and serve.
