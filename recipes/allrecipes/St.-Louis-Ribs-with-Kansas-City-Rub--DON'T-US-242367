About one hour before smoking, make the dry rub. Combine brown sugar, paprika, salt, pepper, chili powder, onion powder and garlic powder in small bowl. Pat ribs dry with paper towels; sprinkle both sides of each rack with the rub. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour. Heat charcoal or gas grill for indirect cooking at 250 to 300 degrees F. Add drained wood chips, if using. Place the ribs, meaty side down, over a drip pan and cook for 2 hours, spraying both sides of ribs with apple juice every 20 to 30 minutes. Add about 12 coals to a charcoal grill every 45 minutes or so to maintain the heat. Remove ribs from grill. Double-wrap each rack in heavy-duty aluminum foil. Return wrapped ribs to the grill and cook for 2 1/2 to 3 hours more over indirect heat, until very tender. Add more coals as needed to maintain temperature for a charcoal grill. Remove ribs from grill and unwrap. Place ribs over direct heat on grill and brush with barbecue sauce. Cook for about 5 minutes, until the sauce is set. Turn ribs and repeat with more sauce. Cut the racks into 3- or 4-rib sections and serve.
