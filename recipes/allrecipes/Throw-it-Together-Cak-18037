Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. In a large bowl, stir together the sugar, flour, baking soda, cinnamon and cloves. Add the eggs and oil, mix until well blended, then stir in the pecans and apple filling. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 55 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
