Melt 1/4 cup of the butter. Pour 2 tablespoons of the melted butter into an 8-cup fluted-tube cake pan; brush the butter over pan sides and bottom. In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and almonds. Sprinkle bottom of pan with half the brown sugar mixture; combine the remaining mixture with the remaining melted butter and set aside. In a large bowl, beat remaining 1/4 cup butter with granulated sugar until blended. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, until blended. Beat in orange peel and bananas. Mix all-purpose and whole-wheat flours, baking powder, soda, and salt. Add to banana mixture along with the buttermilk; stir until well blended. Pour half the batter into prepared pan. Spoon remaining brown sugar mixture evenly over top; cover with remaining batter. Bake in a 350 degrees F oven until a long wooden skewer inserted into the thickest part of the cake comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Cool the cake on a rack about 5 minutes, then invert cake onto a serving plate. Serve the cake warm or cool.
