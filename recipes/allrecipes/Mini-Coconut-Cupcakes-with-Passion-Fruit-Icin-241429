Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 mini muffin tins with mini paper liners. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt together into a bowl. Beat butter, white sugar, egg, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until creamy, about 3 minutes. Beat flour mixture into creamed butter mixture, keeping mixer on low speed, until smooth. Add coconut milk and beat until batter is smooth; fold in shredded coconut. Spoon rounded tablespoons batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into centers comes out clean, 15 to 18 minutes. Transfer cupcakes to a rack to cool completely, 20 to 30 minutes. Mix confectioners' sugar, passion fruit nectar, and cream together in a small bowl until smooth. Dip tops of cupcakes into icing, letting excess drip off. Let icing set for 2 minutes; garnish with flowers.
