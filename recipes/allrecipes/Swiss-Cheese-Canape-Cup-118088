Cut each slice of bread into four squares. Press squares into greased miniature muffin cups. In a bowl, combine the butter, parsley, horseradish and mustard. Stir in cheese. Add egg white; mix well. Place about 3/4 teaspoonful in each bread cup. Bake at 400 degrees F for 6-8 minutes or until filling is set and edges of bread are golden brown. Serve warm.
