Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium saucepan over low heat combine the raisins, peanuts, honey, mustard, syrup and butter; stir all together until a medium thick glaze has formed, then leave on burner to cook slowly. Stir occasionally to keep from burning. Bake hen at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 1 hour or until bird is cooked through and juices run clear. Baste hen thoroughly with prepared glaze every 10 to 15 minutes while baking; when hen is cooked through and ready to serve, garnish with orange zest.
