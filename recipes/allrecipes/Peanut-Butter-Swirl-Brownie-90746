Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Partially melt unsweetened chocolate with butter in microwave on medium power (50%) for 3 minutes. Stir until butter and chocolate are completely melted. Add 3 eggs and stir until well blended. Stir in sugar, flour and nuts (optional). Spread in a greased 9-x 13-inch pan. Bake for 30 minutes. Drop spoonfuls of peanut butter and 2 squares chopped semisweet chocolate over brownies while they are still warm. When peanut butter and chocolate melt, gently swirl a knife over them to create a marbled topping.
