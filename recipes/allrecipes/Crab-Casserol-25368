Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a 2 quart casserole layer the beans, crab, 1 teaspoon flour, cheese and all but 1/3 cup onion rings. In a small bowl mix together the soup and milk; stir in remaining 2 teaspoons flour and pour mixture over casserole. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes or until bubbly. Arrange biscuits on top of casserole and bake for another 20 minutes, adding remaining onion rings in the last 3 minutes of baking.
