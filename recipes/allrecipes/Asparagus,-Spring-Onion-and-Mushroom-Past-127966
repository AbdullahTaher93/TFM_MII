Cut off tough ends of asparagus and slice crosswise into two-inch pieces. Trim tough stems from mushrooms. If the mushrooms are dirty, quickly rinse in cold water and pat dry before slicing into bite-size pieces. Heat oil in a 12-inch saute pan over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add onions and cook 1 to 2 minutes, until softened. Add asparagus and saute 2 minutes. Add wine and simmer until liquid has evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Add vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Add butter and toss until melted into vegetables. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook pasta until al dente. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Mix in the sauce and chervil. Season with additional salt and pepper, and serve.
