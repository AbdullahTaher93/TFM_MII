Sprinkle the green onions and mushrooms into a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Arrange fish over vegetables, overlapping the thickest end of fillets over the thin end. Sprinkle with marjoram, salt and pepper. Pour wine or broth and lemon juice over fish. Cover with cheese and bread crumbs; drizzle with butter. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
