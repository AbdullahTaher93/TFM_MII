Cut the lamb into 1 inch cubes. Crush the garlic cloves and add to the tomato juice. Season with the salt and pepper and cumin powder. Marinate the lamb cubes overnight. Drain lamb cubes and wash and remove the seeds from the pepper and cut into 1 inch squares. Thread the lamb, green and red peppers and mushrooms alternately onto 8 kebab skewers. Brush with oil and grill slowly until the lamb is just cooked through. Prepare the Kahlua Peanut Sauce: Peel and finely chop the onions. Saute in the oil with the crushed garlic. Add the cayenne pepper and cumin powder and cook gently for 1 to 2 minutes more. Add the tomato juice, Kahlua, peanut butter and stock. Simmer over a low heat for 10 minutes, stirring from time to time. Serve cooked kebabs on a bed of rice with the Kahlua Peanut Sauce.
