Pour half the Simmer Sauce into pie plate; place bread crumbs on separate plate. Dip chops, 1 at a time, in sauce, then in crumbs, turning to evenly coat with crumbs. Heat oil in large skillet on medium-high heat. Add chops; cook 6 to 8 min. on each side or until browned on both sides. Top with remaining Simmer Sauce and Finishing Sauce; simmer 3 min. or until chops are done (145 degrees F). Sprinkle with mozzarella; cover. Simmer on low heat 1 to 2 min. or until cheese is melted.
