Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place four (3/4 cup) ramekins or custard cups in an 8 x 11 inch oblong pan. Combine milk and cornstarch in medium saucepan and stir to dissolve cornstarch. Add evaporated milk and fat free half and half. Heat over medium flame, stirring occasionally until milk is scalded but not yet boiling. Beat eggs, add vanilla and vanilla bean seeds. Slowly add hot milk mixture to egg mixture beating constantly with a wire whisk. Pour liquid through a strainer and then fill each ramekin. Pour enough water in pan to reach halfway up sides of ramekins. Bake at 300 degrees F/150 degrees C for 1 hour or until custard is set. Remove from oven and pan to cool about 30 minutes before refrigerating. Chill at least 3 hours. To make creme brulee: Sprinkle 2-3 teaspoons Sugar In The Raw evenly over each custard. Using a blow torch direct the flame so that sugar melts in about 1-2 minutes until brown. Keep the blow torch about 2 inches from sugar topping. Serve immediately. Garnish with raspberries and pomegranate.
