Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Heat salad dressing in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook shrimp in dressing until beginning to firm, about 4 minutes. Stir marmalade and chipotle peppers into shrimp mixture and continue cooking until shrimp are completely pink, about 3 minutes more. Remove from heat and stir in cilantro. Serve over rice.
