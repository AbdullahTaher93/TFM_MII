Rinse chicken with cold water; pat dry with paper towels. In small bowl, combine Seasoned Salt, rosemary and Lemon Pepper. Gently lift skin from meat on breast. Rub seasoning mixture onto meat under skin, all over outside of chicken and inside cavity. Spray 13x9x2-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray; add chicken, breast-side-up. Roast in 400 degrees F oven about 70 minutes, or until meat thermometer inserted in thickest part of the chicken reaches 180 degrees F. Let stand 10 minutes before carving.
