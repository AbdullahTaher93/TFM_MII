Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a bowl, put flour, salt and pepper to taste. Dredge chicken breasts in flour and pat, leaving a light coating. In a skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken. Saute, turning once, until golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking sheet. Roast until chicken is cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes.
