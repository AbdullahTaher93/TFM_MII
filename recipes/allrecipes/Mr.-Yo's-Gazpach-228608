Combine tomatoes, green bell pepper, onion, cucumber, and garlic together in a bowl. Blend tomato mixture, working in small batches, in a food processor or blender until smooth. Transfer to a large bowl and stir to combine all the batches. Stir tomato-vegetable juice, salt, and black pepper into the tomato puree. Add cauliflower, olive oil, red wine vinegar, cumin, and hot pepper sauce; stir to combine. Cover and chill in refrigerator for 4 hours. Drizzle each serving with about 1/8 teaspoon sesame oil.
