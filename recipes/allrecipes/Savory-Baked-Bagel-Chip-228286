Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place bagel slices into a large mixing bowl and drizzle with olive oil while tossing lightly; sprinkle bagel slices with garlic powder and toss again. Arrange bagel chips onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes; turn the chips over and bake until chips are crisp and dry, about 10 more minutes.
