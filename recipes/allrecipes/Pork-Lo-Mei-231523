Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 9 minutes; drain. Whisk soy sauce, vinegar, cornstarch, sugar, and sesame oil together in a small bowl. Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir snap peas and onion in the hot oil until onion is softened, about 2 minutes. Add pork, mushrooms, red bell pepper, 1 clove garlic, and ginger; cook until pork is no longer pink, about 2 minutes. Mix 2 cloves garlic into the pork mixture; cook for 1 minute. Pour soy sauce mixture over pork mixture; cook and stir until sauce thickens, about 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat. Add linguine to the mixture; toss to coat. Sprinkle with green onions.
