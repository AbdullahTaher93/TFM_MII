In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the oil, soy sauce, garlic, onion and five-spice powder. Lightly crush the chiles with the side of a large knife and add to the bag. Close the bag; shake to mix. Add the pork to the bag of spices and mix well; squeeze out the air and seal the bag. Chill the pork for at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Fill 2 medium saucepans halfway with water and bring each to a boil. Add the broccoli to one pot and cook for 3 minutes; drain in a colander and rinse with cold water until cool. Cook the sweet potatoes in the other pot, simmering until barely fork-tender, about 5 minutes; drain and let cool. Preheat a large nonstick skillet or a wok over high heat. If using the skillet, add half of the pork and its marinade (if using the wok, add all of the meat at once) and stir-fry until the pork is no longer pink (about 4 minutes per batch). Transfer to a bowl and cook the remaining pork. In a bowl, stir together the broth, water and cornstarch until smooth. Add the broth to a large skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring, until thickened and no longer cloudy, about 2 minutes. Add the reserved vegetables to the pan and cook, stirring often, until heated through. Add the pork and any juices to the pan and stir until heated through, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve with steamed rice.
