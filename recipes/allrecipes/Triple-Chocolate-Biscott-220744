Combine the ingredients until a dough is formed. Divide the dough into 2 pieces and roll into logs. Place onto a sheet pan that is lined with parchment paper. Gently flatten and separate the logs to one inch thick and three inches wide. Bake 325 degrees F for about 25 min or until firm. Cool for 5 minutes, slice and re-bake for 15 minutes to dry out. Allow to cool completely.
