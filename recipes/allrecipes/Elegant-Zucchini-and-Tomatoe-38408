Place bacon in a large skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Crumble, and return to pan. Add zucchini, onion, and salt to the bacon; cook, stirring frequently, until zucchini is tender-crisp. Add tomato wedges, basil, and ground black pepper; heat, stirring gently, until tomatoes are warm. Using a slotted spoon, transfer vegetable mixture to a serving bowl. Top with crumbled blue cheese.
