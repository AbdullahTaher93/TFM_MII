Pour chicken stock and potato soup into a slow cooker; add chicken breasts. Cook on Low until chicken is no longer pink in the middle, about 4 hours. Remove chicken to a cutting board to cool slightly, shred, and return to the slow cooker. Stir water, celery, carrots, cabbage, and parsley into the soup mixture. Cook on High until the vegetables are tender, about 2 hours.
