Heat oil in a wide nonstick frying pan over high heat. Add onion, russet potato, and sweet potato; cook, stirring often, until vegetables are browned (about 8 minutes). Add rosemary and water. Stir to scrape browned bits free from pan bottom; then reduce heat, cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender to bite (about 5 minutes). Stir in Worcestershire sauce; season to taste with salt and pepper.
