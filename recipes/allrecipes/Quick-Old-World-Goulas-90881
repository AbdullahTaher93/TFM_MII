Cut beef across the grain into bite-size 1/8-inch-thick slices. Place a wide nonstick frying pan over high heat. When pan is hot, add beef and stir-fry until lightly browned (2 to 3 minutes). Pour beef into a bowl. Add mushrooms to pan and cook, stirring often, until browned (3 to 4 minutes); add to beef. Add onion to pan and stir until lightly browned (about 2 minutes). Reduce heat to medium and stir paprika into onion. Meanwhile, in a 4- to 6-quart pan, bring about 3 quarts water to a boil over high heat; stir in noodles and cook, uncovered, until barely tender to bite (4 to 5 minutes); or cook noodles according to package directions. Drain and place on a large, deep platter; keep warm. In a small bowl, mix broth and cornstarch; add to onion mixture in pan and stir just until mixture boils (about 2 minutes). Return beef and mushrooms to pan, stirring until hot (about 1 1/2 minutes). Add sour cream and stir just until heated through (about 1 minute). Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon beef mixture over hot noodles. Sprinkle with parsley.
