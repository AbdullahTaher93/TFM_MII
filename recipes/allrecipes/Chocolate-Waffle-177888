Preheat waffle iron on medium heat. Fill the bottom half of a double boiler half full of water. Replace top pan of double boiler and bring water to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat and add chocolate to top pan and let stand to melt. In a large bowl, combine melted chocolate, sugar, eggs, milk, butter, and vanilla. Beat with an electric mixer or by hand, until all the ingredients are well blended, about 1 minute. Add the flour and baking soda; mix slowly until the flour is moistened, then beat until batter is smooth. Brush insides (top and bottom) of waffle iron lightly with vegetable oil. Pour about 1/3 cup batter in the center of the bottom iron; close lid. Cook until waffle looks dry, about 3 minutes (take a peek when it stops steaming). Lift waffle from pan with a fork and transfer to a rack to cool. Waffle will be soft and might tear unless handled carefully. Repeat to cook remaining batter. Waffles can be made ahead: Let cool, wrap airtight, and hold at room temperature up to overnight. To serve warm, heat in a 200 degrees F oven for about 5 minutes.
