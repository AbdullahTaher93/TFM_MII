Make the dressing: Whisk together lemon juice, vinegar, salt, and sugar in a medium bowl; season with pepper. Add oil in a slow, steady stream, whisking constantly until emulsified. Make the salad: Toss carrots and fennel in bowl with dressing to coat. Let stand until softened, about 15 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer carrot-fennel mixture to a large bowl; discard excess dressing. Add shallot, orange segments, and mache; toss to combine. Divide salad among 4 serving plates.
