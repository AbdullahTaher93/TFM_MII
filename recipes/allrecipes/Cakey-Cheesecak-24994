Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, confectioners' sugar and cinnamon. Reserve 1/2 cup of this mixture and set aside. Stir in butter to remaining crumb mixture. Mix well and press into the bottom and 1 inch up the side of a 9 inch springform pan. Chill in refrigerator. In a large bowl, stir together sugar and heavy cream until sugar is dissolved. Beat in cottage cheese, egg yolks, flour, vanilla, lemon juice and lemon zest. In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites and salt until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the batter, then quickly fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain. Pour batter into crust. Sprinkle top with reserved crumb mixture. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until filling is just set. Turn the oven off, and let cake cool in oven, with the door closed, for 1 hour. Chill in refrigerator.
