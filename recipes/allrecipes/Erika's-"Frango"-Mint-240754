Line a baking sheet or plate with waxed paper. Melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula. Beat confectioners' sugar, egg substitute, and butter together in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add melted chocolate and beat until incorporated. Beat mint extract and vanilla extract into chocolate mixture until light and fluffy. Drop chocolate mixture by the heaping teaspoonful onto prepared baking sheet. Chill in the refrigerator until firm, at least 4 hours.
