Peel carrot and thinly slice diagonally. Rinse and stem cherry tomatoes; cut in half. Scrub clams. Rinse fish and pat dry. Cut into 4 equal pieces. In a small bowl, mix teriyaki sauce, sugar, and 1 tablespoon sake. Coat fish with teriyaki mixture and set pieces slightly apart in an oiled 9-inch-wide baking pan. Bake fish in a 450 degree F oven until barely opaque and still very moist-looking in center of thickest part (cut to test), 8 to 10 minutes. As fish bakes, in a 3- to 4-quart pan over high heat, bring broth and remaining sake to a boil. Add orzo and carrot; cover and cook until orzo is tender to bite, about 10 minutes. Add clams and peas, cover, and cook until clams pop open, about 5 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer open clams to a small bowl; discard any that don't open. Set one piece of fish in the center of each of 4 wide soup bowls. Surround with equal portions of clams and tomatoes. Ladle orzo and broth mixture around fish and sprinkle fish with green onions.
