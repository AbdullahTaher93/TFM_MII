Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in ground beef and onions. Cook and stir until beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Transfer beef mixture to a slow cooker. Stir in spaghetti sauce, water, mixed vegetables, diced tomatoes, celery, beef bouillon, and pepper. Cover and cook on Low until vegetables are tender, about 8 hours.
