In a bowl, combine the water and oats. Sprinkle with chocolate chips (do not stir); let stand for 20 minutes. In a mixing bowl, cream margarine and sugars. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in oat mixture. Combine flour, baking soda and salt; add to the creamed mixture and mix well. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. For frosting, dissolve coffee granules in cream; set aside. In a small mixing bowl, cream margarine; add vanilla and salt. Gradually beat in sugar. Beat in enough of the coffee mixture to achieve spreading consistency. Frost the cake.
