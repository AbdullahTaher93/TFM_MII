Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray 13 x 9-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Stir together cranberry sauce, chili sauce and sour cream in large bowl. Reserve 1 cup and set aside. Stir chicken, 1 cup cheese, the chopped cilantro, green chiles and serrano pepper into sauce mixture in large bowl. Divide chicken mixture evenly down center of each tortilla. Roll tortillas over filling; place seam-side-down in prepared baking dish. Pour reserved 1 cup sauce over enchiladas. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Cover tightly with foil. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until heated through. Garnish with cilantro sprigs, if using.
