Preheat oven to 350F. Mix all ingredients together in a bowl, but avoid excessive handling for a moist meatloaf. Form into a loaf and place in a baking dish or loaf pan. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Remove from oven and let the meatloaf stand covered for 10-15 minutes before slicing.
