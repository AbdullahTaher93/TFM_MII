Combine panko bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, and black pepper together in a bowl. Beat eggs in a separate bowl. Pour flour into a third bowl. Pour in enough vegetable oil to measure 1/2-inch in a large skillet; add olive oil. Heat oil mixture to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dredge each tomato slice in egg; coat with flour. Dredge through egg again and press into panko mixture until evenly coated. Fry coated tomato slices in the hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove fried green tomatoes with a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper plate or paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle with salt.
