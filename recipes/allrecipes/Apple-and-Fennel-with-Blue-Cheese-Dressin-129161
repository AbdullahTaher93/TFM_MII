To make the dressing, put the blue cheese in a bowl with the water and mash to a smooth paste using the back of a spoon. Stir in the yogurt to make a thick, smooth dressing. Season to taste with pepper; set aside. Heat a small nonstick skillet over high heat. Add the hazelnuts and toast until they smell nutty, stirring frequently, about 2 minutes. Immediately tip onto a clean dish towel and rub to remove the papery outer skins. Coarsely chop the nuts. Add the fennel and endive to the dressing and stir to combine. Core the apples and cut into very thin slices, then add to the salad. Toss gently, making sure the apples are coated in dressing. Fold in the hazelnuts. Arrange the radicchio leaves on 4 plates. Top with the salad and sprinkle with the chives.
