Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate. Place a cube of cream cheese, a shrimp, and several slices of jalapeno at one end of each half slice of bacon. Roll the bacon around the shrimp, cream cheese, and jalapeno, and secure the roll-ups with a toothpick through the center. Place the shrimp roll-ups on the preheated grill, and grill for 5 to 7 minutes, until the shrimp is opaque, the cream cheese is melted, and the bacon is crisp.
