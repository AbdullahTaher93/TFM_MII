Place the pumpkin into a steamer insert and set in a pot over one inch of water. Bring to a boil, cover and steam until soft, about 20 minutes. Transfer pumpkin to a blender and blend until smooth with no lumps. Combine the pumpkin, coconut cream, brown sugar, and pandan leaves in a pot over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until mixture is thick and smooth, about 1 hour; remove leaves and discard. Cool kaya before serving; refrigerate unused portion.
