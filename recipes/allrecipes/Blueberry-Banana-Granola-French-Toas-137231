Heat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F for dark pan). Spray 13x9-inch pan or 12x2-inch round cake pan with butter-flavor or regular cooking spray. Separate dough into 8 rolls; set icing aside. Cut each roll into quarters; arrange evenly in pan. Sprinkle 3/4 cup of the crushed granola bars evenly over dough pieces. In large food processor or 5-cup blender, place eggs, milk and condensed milk; cover and process 1 minute. Add bananas; cover and process 1 minute. Pour egg mixture over dough in pan. Sprinkle with remaining 3/4 cup crushed granola bars. Bake 35 to 45 minutes or until golden brown and set in center. Spoon and spread reserved icing over warm rolls. Cool 15 minutes before serving. To serve, spoon baked French toast into shallow bowls or cut into 8 servings. Top each serving with 3 tablespoons blueberries; garnish with 2 tablespoons whipped cream topping.
