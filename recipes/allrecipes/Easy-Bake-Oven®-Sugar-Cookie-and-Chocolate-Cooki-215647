PREHEAT your EASY-BAKE(R) oven for 15 minutes. MIX THE DOUGH. Pour one sugar cookie mix and 3/4 teaspoon of water into a bowl. In a separate bowl, pour one chocolate cookie mix and 3/4 teaspoon of water. Stir both mixes until you form a dough. PREPARE A WORKSPACE. Spray two baking pans with cooking spray. Sprinkle flour onto your hands and a clean counter. Divide both batches of dough into two equal parts, so that you will have a total of four cookies. SHAPE THE COOKIES. Roll each piece of dough between your hands and the counter until you form a ball. Flatten the balls into cookie shapes. Put one chocolate cookie and one sugar cookie into separate baking pans. MAKE HEART SHAPES. Press the cookie cutter into the center of both cookies. Carefully peel away the hearts and switch the centers. BAKE THE COOKIES. Use the pan pusher to move one cookie into the oven. Bake for 11 minutes. After baking, use the pan pusher to move the cookie into the cooling chamber. Let it cool for 10 minutes. Now, prepare and bake the other cookies, using a clean pan each time. SERVE. Share your cookies with someone special!
