Stir together the sugar, brown rice vinegar, cornstarch, and cold water in a small bowl. Heat the oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. When hot, add the chile peppers; cook and stir until browned, about 4 minutes. Remove from the pan using a slotted spoon. Add the bok choy to the pan and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until wilted and tender. Pour in the vinegar sauce and bring to a boil. Cook and stir briefly until thickened, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat, and season with salt.
