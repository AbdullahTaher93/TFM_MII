Heat oil in a 6-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook about 3 minutes or until garlic is golden. Blend in diced tomatoes and puree; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; stir in red pepper flakes, oregano, and salt. Cook uncovered for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, prepare pasta according to package directions. Drain; reserve 1/2 cup cooking water. Return pasta and reserved water to pan; sprinkle with cheese. Add basil to sauce; then pour 2 cups of sauce over pasta. Toss until well combined. Serve pasta with additional sauce.
