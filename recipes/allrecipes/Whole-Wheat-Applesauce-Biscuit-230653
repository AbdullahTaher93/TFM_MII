Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir applesauce, peanut oil, and water into flour mixture until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Drop golf ball-sized spoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are browned, 10 to 12 minutes.
