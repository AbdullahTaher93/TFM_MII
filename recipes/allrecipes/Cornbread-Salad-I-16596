Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease one 9x13 inch pan. Combine the cornbread muffin mix, eggs and milk, stir until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Set aside to cool. Once cool crumble into bite-size chunks. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. Whisk together the pickle juice and mayonnaise. In a large bowl layer 1/2 of the crumbled cornbread followed by the onion, pepper, tomatoes and pickles. Drizzle with 1/2 of the dressing and repeat. Top with bacon and chill for 1 hour.
