In a small saucepan bring the vinegar, tarragon sprigs, shallot, water and peppercorns to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes or until the liquid has reduced by half. Remove from heat and strain. Discard solids and let the liquid cool. In a medium bowl whisk the egg yolks, white wine, sherry and cooled vinegar mixture. Place over a double boiler and whisk constantly until the mixture is thick enough to form a ribbon when drizzled from the whisk. Be careful not to overcook. Remove from heat. Whisking constantly, slowly add the clarified butter in small amounts until all the butter has been absorbed. Season with chopped parsley, mustard, lemon juice, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce and Morton Nature's(R) Seasons Seasoning Blend. Remove from heat and keep warm. Serve with Nature's Seasons(R) Steak Oscar. (See recipe link below)
