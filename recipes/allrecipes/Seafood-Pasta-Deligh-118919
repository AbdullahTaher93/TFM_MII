Cook pasta according to package directions. In a bowl, combine the cornstarch, sugar, salt and pepper; stir in the broth, wine or additional broth and soy sauce until smooth; set aside. In a large nonstick skillet or wok, stir-fry the peppers, peas, garlic and ginger in oil for 2-4 minutes or until crisp-tender. Add scallops and shrimp; stir-fry 2 minutes longer. Stir cornstarch mixture and add to the pan. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Drain pasta; add to skillet. Heat until scallops are firm and opaque and shrimp turn pink. Sprinkle with sesame oil.
