Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix ground beef, milk, crackers, onion, eggs, salt, black pepper, and ground ginger together in a large bowl until ingredients are well mixed; divide into six even portions, roll into balls, and flatten into patties. Wrap each patty with 2 slices bacon. Spread brown sugar into the bottom of a 13x9-inch baking dish in an even layer. Pour barbeque sauce evenly over the sugar. Arrange wrapped patties into the baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Plate meatloaf patties and ladle sauce over them to serve.
