Wash and dry apples. Insert one popsicle stick in the core of each apple. Place caramels and evaporated milk in 1-quart microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high, stirring frequently until smooth, about 3 minutes. Dip apples in melted caramel mixture, using a spoon to cover. Place on waxed paper until caramel sets or refrigerate 15 minutes for quicker results.
