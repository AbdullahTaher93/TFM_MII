Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic, and beef. Stirring frequently, cook until meat is browned and crumbly, about 3 minutes. Drain excess fat. Stir in chicken broth, Ragu(R) sauce, diced tomatoes with mild green chilies, beans, chili powder, and cumin. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Bring to a boil and stir in pasta; cover, reduce heat to a simmer and cook until pasta is al dente, about 14 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in the cheese and parsley. Serve immediately, garnished with additional cheese and parsley, if desired.
