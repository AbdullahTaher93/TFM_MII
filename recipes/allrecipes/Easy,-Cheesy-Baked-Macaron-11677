Cook macaroni according to package directions, shortening recommended cooking time by 2 to 3 minutes as macaroni will continue to bake later in oven. Drain. Mix cooked macaroni and tomato sauce in large glass ovenproof dish. Stir in 3/4 of the shredded cheese. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 of the cheese on top. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 minutes.
