Bring a large pot of water to a boil, salt it, add the pasta and cook until al dente. Drain, setting aside a ladle of pasta cooking water. While the pasta is working, in a nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon EVOO, 1 turn of the pan, over medium-high heat. Season the steak filets with salt and pepper. Place a sage leaf on each and top with a slice of pancetta. Place the steaks in the skillet pancetta side down, and cook, turning once, until browned, 10 to 12 minutes; keep warm. In a large skillet, heat 1/4 cup EVOO, 4 turns of the pan, over medium heat. Stir in the shrimp, garlic and crushed red pepper. Cook until pink, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the wine, reduce for 1 minute, then add the lemon peel, lemon juice and parsley. Add the reserved pasta and cooking water and toss; season with salt and pepper. Toss the endive, radicchio and arugula with a little vinegar and the remaining 2 tablespoons EVOO; season with salt and pepper. Place the greens on 2 plates alongside 2 filets and the scampi pasta.
