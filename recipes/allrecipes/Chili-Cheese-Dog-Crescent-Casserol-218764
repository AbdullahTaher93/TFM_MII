In 2-quart saucepan, mix chili and hot dogs. Heat to boiling over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Spoon chili mixture into ungreased 13x9-inch (3-quart) glass baking dish; sprinkle with cheese. Separate or cut dough into 4 long rectangles (if using crescent rolls, press perforations to seal). Place on top of chili mixture. Sprinkle with sesame seed. Bake at 375 degrees F 15 to 20 minutes.
