Squeeze spinach dry with paper towel; divide evenly into 4 portions. Set aside. Meanwhile, place corn snacks in resealable food-storage plastic bag; seal bag.

Press each into 6x4-inch rectangle, firmly pressing perforations to seal. Arrange ham in 4 stacks with 4 slices each. Top each stack with 1 portion of spinach, spreading spinach evenly over ham.
