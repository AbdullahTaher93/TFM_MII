Combine vinegar and water in a saucepan. Stir in sugar and salt; add mustard seeds, dill, peppercorns, and habanero pepper flakes. Bring to a boil; stir until sugar and salt are dissolved. Remove from heat; cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Divide habanero peppers and garlic clove between 2 canning jars. Divide avocado slices evenly between jars. Stir vinegar mixture to evenly disburse seasoning; pour into jars. Close lids and place in the refrigerator. Chill until flavors combine, about 24 hours.
