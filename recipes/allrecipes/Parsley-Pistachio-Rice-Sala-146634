Combine the rice and water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer until rice has absorbed all of the water, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and set aside to cool. In a separate bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice and mustard. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the dressing over the rice, and stir in the parsley, mint, tomatoes, bell pepper, pistachios and olives.
