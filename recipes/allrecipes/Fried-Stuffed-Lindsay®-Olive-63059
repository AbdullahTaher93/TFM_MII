In a small bowl make a paste of the garlic, anchovy paste, lemon zest, thyme and basil. Fill a small pastry bag fitted with a small plain tip with the paste. Stuff olives. Roll in flour, then dip in eggs and finally roll in crumbs. Fry in oil at a moderate temperature (250-to 275-degrees F.) until crisp and golden brown. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Serve hot.
