In a saucepan, combine sugar, buttermilk and butter. Cook and stir over low heat until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved. Cook over medium heat until a candy thermometer reds 234 degrees F-240 degrees F (soft-ball stage), stirring occasionally. Add peanut butter, vanilla, baking soda and peanuts; stir rapidly until mixture is thickened and creamy. Drop quickly by tablespoonfuls onto waxed paper-lined or lightly buttered baking sheets, shaping into patties. Let stand until cool and set. Store in an airtight container.
