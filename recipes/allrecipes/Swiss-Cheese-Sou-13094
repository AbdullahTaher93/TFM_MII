Place the stock in a large pot over high heat. Bring to a boil, stir in the garlic and reduce heat to low. In separate skillet over medium heat, combine the butter and flour and stir well for a few minutes. Add the garlic and stock mixture along with the wine, stirring constantly. Bring to a boil to thicken. Stir in the cheese and serve immediately. (Do NOT allow to boil once cheese has been added, and do not allow to sit long or the cheese will separate out.)
