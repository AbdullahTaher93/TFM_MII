Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, and stir in the ground beef. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir in the condensed tomato soup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and vinegar. Cook and stir until thick, about 5 minutes. Adjust seasoning to taste, and serve on the toasted hamburger buns.
