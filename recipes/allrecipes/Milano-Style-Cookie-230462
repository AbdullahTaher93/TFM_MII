Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat butter and shortening together in a bowl until creamy. Beat confectioners' sugar, water, egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract into the creamed mixture. Stir in flour and salt until dough is smooth. Fold chocolate chips into the dough. Scoop dough with a small cookie scoop and drop cookies on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are lightly browned, about 9 minutes.
