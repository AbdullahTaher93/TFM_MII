Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. In a small bowl, blend mayonnaise and brown mustard. In a medium bowl, mix dry bread crumbs, shredded coconut, chopped mixed nuts, sugar, salt, and cayenne pepper. Dip fish in the mayonnaise mixture, then in the bread crumb mixture. Arrange coated fish fillets in the prepared baking dish. Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until fish is easily flaked with a fork.
