Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray or grease a Bundt pan or two 8x4-inch loaf pans. In the bowl of a stand mixer beat oil, sugar and eggs until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, salt, baking powder and poppy seeds. Add flour mixture to egg mixture alternately with Pure Almond, beginning and ending with flour. Stir in almond and vanilla extracts. Bake for 1 hour until top springs back and a tester inserted into cake comes out clean. Combine glaze ingredients in a small bowl. Remove warm cake from pan. Use a fork to poke several holes around cake. Using a pastry brush or spoon, slowly "baste" cake with glaze until it is uniformly moistened and all glaze is absorbed.
