Cut off stem at base of artichoke. Cut 1 inch from the top. With scissors, snip the tip end of each leaf. Remove outer leaves. Rub cut ends of leaves with lemon juice. In a Dutch oven or soup kettle, combine the artichokes, lemon slices and garlic; cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 30-45 minutes or until tender. Drain, then arrange on a serving platter. Refrigerate for 1 hour. For dip, in a bowl, whisk together the oil, lemon juice, vinegar, mustard, garlic, salt and pepper. Stir in green pepper and onion. Serve with artichokes.
