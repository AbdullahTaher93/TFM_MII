Place onion, bell pepper, jalapeno pepper, pickling spice, sugar, salt, and vinegar into a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pack pepper mixture into hot, sterilized canning jars, and fill with hot vinegar, leaving 1/4 inch headspace. Top with a sterilized lid, and screw on tops securely. Place jars into a canner or large stockpot, and cover with 2 inches of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium, and simmer gently for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove jars and allow to cool to room temperature. Refrigerate any jars that did not seal. Refrigerate after opening.
