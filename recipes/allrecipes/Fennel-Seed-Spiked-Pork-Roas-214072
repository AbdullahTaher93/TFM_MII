Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Toast the fennel seed, rosemary, thyme, and peppercorns in a heavy pan over medium-low heat until strongly fragrant and the fennel seeds are lightly browned, 1 to 3 minutes. Do not let the spices burn! Place the toasted spices, sea salt, garlic, and ouzo into a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, and grind to a paste. Score the fat layer of the pork roast with a sharp knife; rub the spice paste all over the roast. Spread the sliced onions and fennel into the bottom of a large roasting pan; pour enough water into the pan to just cover the vegetables. Place the roast on top of the onions and fennel with the fat layer facing upward. Roast in the preheated oven until the pork is tender, 5 to 6 hours (or about 40 minutes per pound). An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 185 degrees F (85 degrees C). Add extra water if needed during roasting to prevent the onions and fennel from burning.
