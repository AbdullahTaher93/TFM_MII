Line a 9-in. pie plate with bottom of pastry; trim even with edge of plate. In a mixing bowl, beat eggs on medium speed for 1 minute. Add sour cream, sugar, vinegar, cinnamon, cloves and salt; mix well. Stir in raisins. Pour into pastry shell. Roll out remaining pastry to fit top of pie. Place over filling; trim, seal and flute edges. Cut slits in pastry. Cover edges loosely with foil. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F and remove foil. Bake 40-45 minutes longer or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. Refrigerate leftovers.
