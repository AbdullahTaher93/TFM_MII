Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slide orange slices under chicken skin (skin will pull up easily). Place chicken in a 9x13 inch baking dish skin-side-up. Then place potatoes, carrots, onions and celery around the chicken and pour broth over all. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bake for 1 hour at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). (Note: If water decreases as it is cooking, add as needed; this will be your gravy.)
