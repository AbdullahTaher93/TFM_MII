In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites until frothy; beat in cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Add the extracts. Gradually beat in sugar until stiff, scraping bowl occasionally. Sift flour over beaten whites; sprinkle with berries. Gently fold flour and raspberries into batter until well mixed. Pour into an ungreased 10-in. tube pan. Bake at 325 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until lightly browned and entire top appears dry. Immediately invert cake pan; cool completely, about 1 hour.
