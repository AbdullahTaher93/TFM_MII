Cut tenderloins crosswise into 1-inch pieces; flatten with heel of hand to about 1/8-inch thickness and place in shallow pan. Combine remaining ingredients and pour over pork cutlets; cover and refrigerate for up to four hours. Remove pork from marinade (discard remaining marinade) and grill over medium-hot coals just until nicely browned; about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve on sandwich buns if desired.
