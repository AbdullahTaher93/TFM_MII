Pop popcorn according to package directions; remove unpopped kernels. Combine popcorn with almonds in large bowl. Stir together teriyaki sauce and ginger. Melt butter in large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup and salt. Bring mixture to a boil; stir occasionally. Insert candy thermometer; continue boiling until mixture reaches 265 degrees F., or a small amount of mixture dropped into very cold water forms a hard ball. (Do not stir mixture while boiling.) Remove from heat; stir in baking soda. Add teriyaki sauce mixture, about 1 Tbsp. at a time, and stir until mixture stops bubbling; pour in thin stream over popcorn, tossing until popcorn and nuts are well coated. Cool slightly. Butter hands; shape mixture into desired sizes of balls and place on waxed paper.
