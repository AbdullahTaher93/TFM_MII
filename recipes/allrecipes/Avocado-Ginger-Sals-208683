Cut avocado in half, remove pit, and peel. Cut into cubes and place in a medium bowl. Peel and section oranges over avocado in bowl so juice can drip into bowl. Cut orange sections into bite-sized pieces. Add radishes, ginger and salt and toss gently to mix. Cover surface with plastic wrap and chill until ready to serve.
