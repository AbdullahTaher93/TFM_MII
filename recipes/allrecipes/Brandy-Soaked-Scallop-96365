Wrap 1 piece bacon around each scallop; secure with toothpicks, if necessary (metal toothpicks pictured; if using wooden toothpicks, soak in water 20 minutes). Place wrapped scallops in 13x9-inch baking dish. Combine oil, brandy, parsley, garlic, pepper, salt and onion powder in a small bowl; mix well. Pour over scallops; cover and marinate in refrigerator at least 4 hours. Remove scallops from marinade; discard marinade. Arrange on rack of broiler pan. Broil, 4 inches from heat, 7 to 10 minutes until bacon is brown. Turn over; cook 5 minutes or until scallops are opaque. Remove toothpicks. Arrange over salad greens and garnish, if desired.
