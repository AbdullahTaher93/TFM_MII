In a saucepan, combine carrots, 1/2 cup water and bouillon. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and cook for 5 minutes or until carrots are crisp-tender. Drain, reserving cooking liquid. Set carrots aside and keep warm. In a large skillet, saute onions in butter for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with flour; stir until blended. Stir in the salt, honey, sugar, pepper and reserved cooking liquid until blended. Add remaining water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Stir in carrots; heat through.
