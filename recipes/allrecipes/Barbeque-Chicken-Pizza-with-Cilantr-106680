Adjust oven rack to lowest position and preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). In a medium bowl, toss shredded chicken with 1/4 cup barbecue sauce. Place pizza crust on baking sheet. Spread remaining barbeque sauce evenly over the pizza crust and sprinkle with chicken, mozzarella cheese and red onion slices. Bake until cheese melts and pizza is crisp, about 15-20 minutes. Sprinkle with cilantro, cut into wedges and serve.
