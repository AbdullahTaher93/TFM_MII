Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix wheat and white flours, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Blend in brown sugar, cinnamon, allspice, and grated carrots. In a mixing bowl beat eggs. Blend in milk, molasses and butter. Combine this mixture with the flour mixture. Stir until all dry ingredients are moist. Spoon mixture into oiled muffin tins adding nuts and raisins if you would like. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes.
