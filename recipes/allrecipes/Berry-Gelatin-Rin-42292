In a bowl, dissolve gelatin in water. Add cranberry sauce, pineapple, wine or juice and walnuts; mix well. To evenly distribute fruit and nuts, chill until partially set, about 2 hours. Then pour into a 6-cup ring mold coated with nonstick cooking spray. Refrigerate until set. Unmold onto a serving plate. In a small mixing bowl, combine cream cheese, mayonnaise and orange peel. Serve with the salad.
