Heat the BecelÂ® Buttery Taste margarine in a large, deep, non-stick skillet set over medium heat. Add the celery, carrot, onion, garlic, sage, thyme and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently for 8-10 minutes or until softened and fragrant. Stir in the barley and cook, stirring, for 1 minute or until combined. Pour in the broth and water; bring to a boil. Cover and reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer for 20 minutes; stir in the cranberries. Continue to cook for 25 minutes or until all of the fluid is absorbed. Stir in the parsley and lemon zest. Drizzle with lemon juice and fluff with a fork just before serving. Tip: Convert this side dish into a main course to serve 4 by adding 2 cups (500 mL) of chopped, cooked chicken during the last 5 minutes of cooking time.
