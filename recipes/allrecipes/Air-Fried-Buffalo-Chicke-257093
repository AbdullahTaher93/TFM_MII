Whisk Greek yogurt, egg substitute, and 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon hot sauce in a bowl. Mix panko bread crumbs, paprika, garlic pepper, and cayenne pepper in a separate bowl. Dip chicken strips into yogurt mixture; coat with panko bread crumb mixture. Arrange coated chicken strips in a single layer in an air fryer. Cook until evenly browned, about 8 minutes per side.
