Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease cookie sheet with shortening or spray with cooking spray. Unroll dough; separate into 12 breadsticks. Stretch each breadstick until about 9 inches long. Unroll all fruit snack rolls. With scissors, cut each evenly into 4 (about 8-inch-long) pieces. Place 1 piece on each breadstick. Roll up each breadstick, coiling dough into spiral shape; press ends to seal. Place sugar in shallow dish. Brush top and side of each coil with beaten egg white; roll in sugar. Place sugar side up on greased cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F for 11 to 16 minutes or until light golden brown. Immediately remove from cookie sheet. Cool 5 minutes. Serve warm with strawberries and orange slices.
