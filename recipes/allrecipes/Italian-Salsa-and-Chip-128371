To Make the Chips: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190C). Cover a baking sheet with foil. Cut the pitas into quarters. Separate each wedge into two pieces. Place on the baking sheet. Lightly coat the pitas with nonstick spray. In a small bowl, combine the Parmesan and Italian seasoning. Sprinkle over the pitas. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Transfer to a platter or serving basket. To Make the Salsa: Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes, onion, basil, vinegar, olives, oil, garlic, salt, and pepper. Serve with the chips.
