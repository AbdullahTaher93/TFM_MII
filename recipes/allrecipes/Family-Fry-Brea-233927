Whisk 3 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk water and butter together in a separate bowl; pour into flour mixture and stir until mixture comes together to form a ball and is slightly sticky and elastic. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Cover bowl with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch down dough and turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in 1/4 cup flour, if necessary. Shape into 10 balls. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large cast iron skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll each dough ball out on a lightly floured surface into an 8-inch round. Place each round into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove fry bread to a baking sheet lined with paper towels. Repeat with remaining dough rounds.
