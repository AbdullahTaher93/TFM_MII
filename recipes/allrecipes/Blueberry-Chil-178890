Spread the crushed vanilla wafers evenly into the bottom of a square baking dish. Beat the cream cheese, heavy cream, and confectioners' sugar in a bowl until smooth; spread in a layer over the vanilla wafers. Spread the blueberry pie filling over the cream cheese layer. Freeze at least 2 hours before serving.
