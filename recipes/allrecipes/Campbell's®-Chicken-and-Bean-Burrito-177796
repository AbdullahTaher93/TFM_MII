Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic powder and cook until the onion is tender. Stir the soup, salsa and chicken in the skillet. Cook until the chicken mixture is hot and bubbling. Spoon about 1/3 cup chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Fold up the sides of the tortillas around the filling then fold up the ends to enclose the filling.
