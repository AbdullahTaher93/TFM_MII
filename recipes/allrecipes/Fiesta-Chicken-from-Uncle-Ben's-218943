Cut chicken breasts into 1/2-inch strips. Spray a 10-inch skillet with a nonstick spray and heat over a medium heat until hot. Add the chicken and red pepper, cook until chicken is browned and fully cooked. Add the onion, cook for 30 seconds. Add the water, rice, chili powder, corn and salsa; simmer for 10 minutes until rice is done. Serve chicken over the rice with chopped cilantro.
