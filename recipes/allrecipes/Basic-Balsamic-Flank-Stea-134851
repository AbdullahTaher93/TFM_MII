Poke the meat with a fork to help the marinade penetrate. Mix the marinade in a large resealable bag, reserving 1/4 cup. Drop the steak into the bag and refrigerate it for up to 24 hours. Grill for 6 to 8 minutes per side (until medium rare). Brush with the reserved marinade before serving. Slice diagonally across the grain in thin slice.
