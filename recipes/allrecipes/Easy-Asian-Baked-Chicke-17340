Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour soy sauce and vinegar over chicken, then sprinkle with bell pepper and top with water chestnuts. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 40 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
