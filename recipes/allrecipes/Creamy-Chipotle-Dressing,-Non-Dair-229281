Blend tofu, soy milk, olive oil, lemon juice, honey, garlic powder, salt, cumin, and black pepper in a blender until smooth. Scrape the sides of the blender with a spatula as needed. Add chipotle peppers and adobo sauce a little bit at a time and blend into the sauce, tasting after each addition until you meet the level of spiciness you desire. Transfer sauce to a bowl. Stir dill into the sauce to serve.
