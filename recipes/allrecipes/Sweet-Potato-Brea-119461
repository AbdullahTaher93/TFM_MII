In a large mixing bowl, combine eggs, oil, applesauce and vanilla. Stir in sweet potatoes and orange peel; mix well. Combine the flour, sugars, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and baking powder; stir into sweet potato mixture just until combined. Stir in nuts. Pour into two greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
