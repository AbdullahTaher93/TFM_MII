Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in onion, and cook until it begins to brown. Sprinkle with flour and bouillon granules, and stir until the melted butter is absorbed. Stir in salmon and 1/2 cup half-and-half. Stir in dill, white pepper, and paprika; cook about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat, and let cool slightly. In a food processor or blender, puree salmon mixture. Return to saucepan over medium-low heat, and gradually add remaining 1/4 cup half-and-half. Stir in the port, and cook 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt to taste.
