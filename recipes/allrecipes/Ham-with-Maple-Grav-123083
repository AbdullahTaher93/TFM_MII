Place ham on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Score the surface of the ham, making diamond shapes 1/2 in. deep; insert a clove in each diamond. Combine 1/2 cup maple syrup and mustard; pour over ham. Pour apple juice into the roasting pan. Bake at 325 degrees F for 1-1/2 to 2 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 140 degrees F, basting frequently. Remove ham and keep warm. Transfer the pan juices to a saucepan. Combine cornstarch and water until smooth; add to saucepan. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1 minute or until thickened. Meanwhile, in a skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add apples and remaining maple syrup. Cover and cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Slice ham; serve with the apples and gravy.
