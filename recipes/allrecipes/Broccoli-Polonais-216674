Place a steamer insert into a saucepan, and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Cover, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add the broccoli, cover, and steam until just tender, 2 to 6 minutes depending on thickness. Drain broccoli and place into a serving dish. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter; stir in bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese, and cook until the crumbs are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle the browned crumbs onto the steamed broccoli, and toss gently. Sprinkle the broccoli with chopped egg.
