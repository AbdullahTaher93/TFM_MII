Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken breasts between two sheets of wax paper or plastic wrapping, and pound with a meat mallet to flatten. Cover each flattened breast with a slice or two of ham. Place 2 tablespoons cheese and a bit of carrot and a zucchini on the end of each chicken breast. Roll up each breast, and fasten with toothpicks. In a large skillet, heat a small amount of oil over medium high heat. Cook chicken breasts in hot oil for 2 to 3 minutes to lightly brown. Place browned rolls in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
