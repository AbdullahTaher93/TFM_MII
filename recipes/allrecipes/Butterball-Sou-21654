Remove crusts from day old bread and crumble stale slices into a medium bowl. Mix in the butter, egg, salt and pepper until dough forms. Knead until the dough can be formed into balls. Form balls 3/4 inch in diameter, the recipe should make about 30 balls. Heat the chicken broth to boiling in a large saucepan or stockpot. Drop balls into the broth and simmer for 10 minutes, or until balls rise to the top. Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately.
