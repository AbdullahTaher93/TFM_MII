In Dutch oven, melt butter over medium heat. Stir in bell pepper, onion and celery; cover and cook 5 minutes, stirring 2 or 3 times, until vegetables are crisp-tender. Meanwhile, in medium saucepan, combine spaghetti sauce and diced tomatoes and chiles. Heat, covered, over medium heat until boiling. Reduce heat and simmer. Add shrimp to vegetables and increase heat to high. Cook 2 to 3 minutes, tossing, until shrimp are pink and just opaque in the center. Add sauce; stir well and return just to a simmer.
