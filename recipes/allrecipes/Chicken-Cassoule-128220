Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Spread half of the beans in a 2-quart (2-l) casserole. Season chicken on both sides with pepper. In a large skillet over medium heat, brown chicken in oil for 5 minutes, turning once. Transfer chicken to casserole. Top with kielbasa, remaining beans, and broth. In the same skillet, cook onion for 4 minutes, stirring to loosen any browned bits from the pan. Stir in bread crumbs, tomatoes, and basil; cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Spread over beans, patting to create a thick crust. Cover and bake 10 minutes. Remove cover and bake 15 minutes, or until crust is browned. (Casserole can be frozen at this point. To serve, thaw in refrigerator first, then reheat in oven.)
