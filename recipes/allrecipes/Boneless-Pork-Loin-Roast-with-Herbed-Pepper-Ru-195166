Pat pork dry with paper towel. In small bowl, combine all rub ingredients well and apply to all surfaces of the pork roast. Place roast in a shallow pan and roast in a 350 degrees F. oven for 1 to 1-1/4 hours (18 to 20 minutes per pound), until the internal temperature on a thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove roast from oven; let rest until temperature reaches 160 degrees F, about 10 minutes before slicing to serve.
