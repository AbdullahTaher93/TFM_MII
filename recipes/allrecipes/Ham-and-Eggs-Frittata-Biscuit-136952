Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray large cookie sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Separate dough into 8 biscuits; place 3 inches apart on sprayed cookie sheet. Press out each biscuit to form 4-inch round with 1/4-inch-high rim around outside edge. Beat 1 of the eggs in small bowl. Brush over tops and sides of biscuits. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of the Italian seasoning. In another small bowl, combine remaining 2 eggs and remaining 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning; beat well. Spoon egg mixture evenly into indentations in each biscuit. Top with ham, 1/2 cup of the cheese, roasted peppers, tomatoes, sliced basil and remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15 to 20 minutes or until biscuits are golden brown and eggs are set. Garnish with basil sprigs and cherry tomatoes.
