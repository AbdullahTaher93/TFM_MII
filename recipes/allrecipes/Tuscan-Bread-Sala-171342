Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Tear bread into 1/2- to 1-inch pieces and place in a baking pan. Bake until bread is light golden and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Let cool. Meanwhile, place tomatoes and any juices in a salad bowl. Stir in olive oil, vinegar, olives, capers, garlic, and chile flakes. Stir cool bread into tomato mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Let stand just until bread is softened, 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add arugula and basil, mix, and serve.
