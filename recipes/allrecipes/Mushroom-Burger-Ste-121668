In a large saucepan, cook beef and onion over medium heat until the meat is no longer pink; drain. Add the water, potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, soup mix, salt and pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Add mushrooms; simmer 5 minutes longer.
