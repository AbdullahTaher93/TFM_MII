Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Layer potatoes, carrots and onions in a large buttered casserole dish. Sprinkle the uncooked rice over the vegetables. Then add the peas (with liquid) and arrange the pork sausage on top of that. Dilute tomato soup with a can of water and pour over the sausage. Season with salt and pepper. Bake covered in a preheated oven for 1 hour, then uncovered for an additional hour.
