In a small bowl, mix flour, almonds, 1/2 cup sugar, and cinnamon together. Add chilled butter and vanilla extract. Cut together with a pastry blender until small crumbs form. Unfold pastry and cut into a 10 inch circle. Place on a large, ungreased baking sheet. Brush with melted butter or margarine. Arrange apples in the center of the pastry, leaving a 1/2 inch wide border of pastry. Spoon almond topping gently over the apples, being careful it doesn't spill over the edges of the pastry. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes, or until golden brown. Place egg yolks and 3 tablespoons sugar in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Beat mixture constantly with a portable electric mixer. When foamy, add the marsala; continue to beat until the mixture begins to thicken. Do not overcook, or the mixture will curdle. Remove from heat. Serve warm over the apple crumble.
