Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lay squash slices in a 11x13-inch baking dish. Spread rice in an even layer over the squash slices. Arrange chicken pieces onto the layer of rice. Mix chicken broth, broccoli soup, peas, sage, and black pepper together in a bowl; pour into baking dish around the chicken piece. Sprinkle cayenne pepper over the chicken pieces. Season chicken and rice mixture with salt. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil. Cook in the preheated oven for 1 hour and 45 minutes. Remove the aluminum foil and continue cooking until the chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cool dish 5 minutes before serving.
