Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray 12 nonstick muffin cups with cooking spray. Mix spice cake with pumpkin in a bowl with an electric mixer until batter is thick and smooth; stir miniature chocolate chips into batter. Scoop batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean or with moist crumbs, about 15 minutes. Let muffins rest for about 3 minutes to set before removing from pan to finish cooling on a wire rack. Store in a covered container.
