In a large skillet, saute onions and green bell pepper in oil until tender. Add 2 tablespoons flour; stir well. Gradually blend in RED GOLD(R) or REDPACK(R) WHOLE PEELED TOMATOES, breaking up tomatoes with a spoon. Add celery leaves, sugar, salt and pepper; bring to a boil over medium heat. Cook and stir for 2 minutes. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5 minutes. For dumplings combine flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl; cut in shortening until crumbly. Add cheese. Stir in milk just until moistened. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto simmering tomato sauce. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in a dumpling comes out clean (do not lift the cover while simmering).
