Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large pot over medium/high heat, heat the olive oil and quickly brown the beef pieces on all sides. Place the onion, green pepper, celery, and carrots into the pot and fry for 5 minutes; stirring occasionally. Remove from heat. In a mixing bowl, combine the honey, lemon juice, mustard, ketchup, water, salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly. Transfer the meat and vegetables to a 2 quart casserole dish. Pour the ketchup mixture over the meat and vegetables. Bake in a preheated oven for 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until meat is tender.
