Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic; cook and stir until the garlic has turned golden, about 2 minutes. Stir in the chopped chile peppers, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more. Add the shrimp and cook until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice, seasoned salt, black pepper, and cilantro, and cook for another minute to incorporate the flavors. Pile the shrimp onto the toasted French bread and serve. Use any liquid remaining in the skillet as dip for the sandwiches, or pour over it the sandwiches before serving.
