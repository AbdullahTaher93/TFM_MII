In a large bowl, combine orange juice, olive oil, oregano, parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix well. Place the tuna steaks in the bowl, turn to coat both sides with marinade; cover and refrigerate 30 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Remove tuna from the marinade and shake off excess. Place tuna onto preheated grill and cook to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per inch for medium-rare or 10 minutes per inch for medium-well.
