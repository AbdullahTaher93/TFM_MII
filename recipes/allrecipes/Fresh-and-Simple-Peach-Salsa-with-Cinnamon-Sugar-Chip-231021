Mix peaches, tomatoes, onion, cilantro, and jalapeno pepper together in a bowl; sprinkle with cardamom. Drizzle lime juice and lemon juice over salsa; toss to coat. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush tortilla wedges with melted butter; sprinkle generously with cinnamon sugar. Arrange coated wedges on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until chips are crisp, 15 minutes. Serve chips alongside peach salsa.
