Place the chicken in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with salt, tarragon, paprika and pepper. Combine the sherry, lemon juice and soy sauce; drizzle over chicken. Top with shallots. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 degrees F. Cover and bake for 30 minutes, basting occasionally. Uncover; bake 15-20 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees F.
