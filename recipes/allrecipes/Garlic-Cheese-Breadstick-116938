In a large mixing bowl, combine 1-1/2 cups flour, wheat germ, yeast and salt. In a saucepan, heat the water, 1 tablespoon oil and honey to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat just until moistened. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn on to a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 4-6 minutes. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Roll into a 15-in. x 10-in. rectangle. Transfer to a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan; press dough to edges of pan. Brush with remaining oil. Sprinkle with parsley, basil and garlic. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 425 degrees F for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with cheeses. Bake 3-5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted and bread is golden brown. Cut into 20 strips. Serve warm.
