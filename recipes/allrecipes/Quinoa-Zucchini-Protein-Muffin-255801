Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 muffin tins with paper liners. Combine whole wheat pastry flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cloves, allspice, ginger, and nutmeg in a bowl. Mix Greek yogurt, zucchini, quinoa, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Add flour mixture; mix until batter is well blended. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin tins. Bake in the preheated oven until tops are lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
