Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine the melted and cooled butter or margarine with the brown and white sugars. Beat in the eggs at medium speed of an electric mixer. Add the vanilla, oats, corn flakes, flour, baking soda and baking powder; beating well. Drop tablespoon sized spoonfuls of the dough on to an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15 minutes for a soft and chewy cookie.
