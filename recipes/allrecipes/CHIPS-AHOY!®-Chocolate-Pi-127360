Crush cookies in resealable plastic bag until fine crumbs form. Mix 1-1/2 cups of the crumbs with butter; press firmly onto bottom and up side of 9-in. pie plate to form crust. Reserve remaining crumbs for later use. Add milk to pudding mix in a medium bowl; beat with wire whisk 2 min. Gently stir in whipped topping. Spoon into crust. Refrigerate 30 min. or until set. Top with reserved cookie crumbs just before serving.
