Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter or margarine in a large skillet over medium high heat. Saute onion and mushrooms until soft. Add a sprinkle of the wine, garlic powder and seasoning and stir all together. Remove mixture from skillet. Melt remaining tablespoon of butter or margarine in skillet. Add remaining wine, garlic powder and seasonings. Add beef and saute until browned, about 7 to 10 minutes. Add water to beef and let simmer over low heat until meat is tender. Drain off skillet liquid and reserve. Return onion/mushroom mixture to skillet; stir in Alfredo sauce and spaghetti sauce. Return 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the reserved liquid to the skillet (do not add too much, as this will make the sauce too watery). Stir all together and serve.
