Heat grill. Place chicken breasts in resealable food-safe plastic bag. Pour steak sauce over chicken. Seal bag and refrigerate 30 minutes. Cook chicken on grill over medium heat 10 to 12 minutes, turning once, or until no longer pink in center. Discard marinade. Place buns, split side down, on grill and top chicken with blue cheese during last 2 minutes of cooking. Serve chicken in buns. Top with lettuce and additional steak sauce, if you like.
