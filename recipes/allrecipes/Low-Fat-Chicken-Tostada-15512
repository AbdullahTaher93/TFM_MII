In a large bowl combine the chicken, lettuce, green bell pepper, tomatoes and onions. Mix together and set aside. Heat tortillas by placing them in a large dry skillet over medium high heat and turning once until golden and puffy. To Assemble Tostadas: Place a tortilla on a plate, top with some of the chicken mixture and garnish with sour cream, salsa and cheese. Repeat with all tortillas.
