Arrange bread cubes in a single layer on several ungreased large baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-30 minutes until golden brown and crisp. Transfer to a large bowl. Add the chicken, potatoes, celery, carrots and parsley. In another large bowl, combine the milk, broth, eggs, butter, salt and pepper. Pour over bread mixture; toss to coat. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes; stir. Bake 45 minutes longer or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Serve with gravy if desired.
