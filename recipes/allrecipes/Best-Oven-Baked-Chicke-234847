Stir water, ketchup, onion, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, olive oil, honey, flour, garlic powder, black pepper, and poultry seasoning together in an oven-safe Dutch oven. Simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend, 5 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place chicken in Dutch oven and turn to coat in ketchup mixture. Spoon 1/4 the mixture and onions into the chicken cavity. Place chicken breast side down into Dutch oven; cover with an oven-proof lid. Bake chicken in the preheated oven, basting once, for 45 minutes. Uncover the Dutch oven and increase heat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Turn chicken breast side up and bake until chicken has browned, about 15 more minutes. Let chicken stand for about 10 minutes before serving.
