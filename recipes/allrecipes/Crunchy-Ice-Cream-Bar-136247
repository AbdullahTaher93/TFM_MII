Mix wafers, pecans, coconut and margarine until well blended. Press 1 cup of the wafer mixture firmly onto bottom of 9-inch square pan. Spoon vanilla ice cream over crust; carefully spread to form even layer. Freeze 25 min. or until firm. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup of the remaining wafer mixture; cover with the chocolate ice cream. Sprinkle with the remaining wafer mixture. Freeze 4 hours or until firm. Let stand 10 min. at room temperature to soften slightly. Cut into 16 bars to serve. Store leftover bars in airtight container in freezer.
