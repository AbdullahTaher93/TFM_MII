Mix 1 1/2 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon honey, garlic, and ginger together in a bowl. Add chicken; turn to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight. Whisk egg in a bowl until smooth. Pour panko bread crumbs into a shallow bowl. Dip chicken pieces in whisked egg and roll in panko until coated. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook chicken in batches in the hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain excess oil. Mix Japanese mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons honey, Dijon mustard, mirin, and 1 tablespoon soy sauce together to make sauce. Pour sauce over chicken.
