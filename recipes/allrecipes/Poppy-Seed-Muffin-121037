In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, poppy seeds, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, beat the eggs, milk, oil and extracts. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fill greased muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 350 degrees F for 22-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. Combine glaze ingredients; spoon over warm muffins. Serve immediately.
