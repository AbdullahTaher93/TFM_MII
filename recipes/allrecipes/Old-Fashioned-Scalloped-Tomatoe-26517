Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a small baking dish. In a medium bowl, mix diced tomatoes and crackers. Season with salt and pepper, and transfer to the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, and dot with butter. Season with parsley. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven 20 minutes, or until lightly browned.
