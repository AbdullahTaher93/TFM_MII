Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, stir together the honey, soy sauce, lemon juice and sesame seeds. Dip the pieces of chicken into the sauce to coat, then place in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake for about 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until chicken is cooked through and sauce is caramelized.
