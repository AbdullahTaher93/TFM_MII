Combine rice wine (or sherry), tea, juice, soy sauce and honey in a small bowl. Combine cinnamon, ginger, pepper and salt in a small bowl. Rub spices evenly on both sides of chicken. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and reduce heat to medium. Cook until the chicken is golden outside and no longer pink in the middle, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon oil to the pan. Add bell pepper and garlic; cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Increase heat to high and add the reserved rice wine-tea mixture. Bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits. Cook until the liquid is reduced by half, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and return the chicken and any accumulated juices to the pan. Simmer gently, spooning sauce over chicken, until heated through, about 1 minute.
