Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Wash chicken breasts and cut into large bite-size pieces. Cut sausages into large pieces. In a large, deep skillet over medium low heat, combine oil and garlic; and cook just enough to flavor the oil. Remove garlic from oil. Add chicken and sausage to skillet and brown both lightly until they are opaque. Add the tomatoes and the wine. Bring to a boil and let simmer for 20 minutes. Season sauce mixture with basil, rosemary and salt and pepper to taste. Add cooked, drained pasta to the skillet mixture. Toss and serve.
