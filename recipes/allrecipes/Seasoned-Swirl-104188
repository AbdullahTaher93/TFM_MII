In small bowl, combine cream cheese and Morton(R) Natures Seasons(R) Seasoning Blend. Unroll crescent rolls. Place half (4 triangles) on a smooth surface. Pinch perforated creases together. Spread half of cream cheese mixture onto dough, covering the entire surface. With the wide end at the top, roll rectangle up tightly. Wrap rolled dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Repeat with remaining half of crescent roll dough. Unwrap and cut into 1/2 inch slices using a sharp knife. Place on parchment paper-lined cookie sheet. If desired, lightly sprinkle swirls with Morton(R) Natures Seasons(R) Seasoning Blend. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15 minutes or until light golden brown.
