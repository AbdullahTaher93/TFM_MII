Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Cut 3 slices bacon into 1/4-inch wide slices. Cook in medium saucepan over medium-high heat until crisp; drain. Carefully pour all but 1 tablespoon grease from pan. Add butter and apple cider; bring to a boil. Remove from heat; stir in cooked bacon, cornbread stuffing mix, apple, cranberries and pecans. If needed, add addition cider to moisten stuffing. Place 4 remaining slices of bacon about 2 inches apart down center of 15x10x1-inch baking sheet. Cut down center of tenderloin but not all the way through; lay flat on top of bacon slices. Spoon stuffing down center of tenderloin; wrap bacon slices around tenderloin, overlapping on top. Secure with wooden picks. Bake 40 to 45 minutes until internal temperature of stuffing reaches 160 degrees F. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing.
