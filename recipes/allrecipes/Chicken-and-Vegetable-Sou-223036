Combine chicken broth, water, chicken breast, kale, turnips, kohlrabi, spinach, celery, leek, carrots, garlic, and barley in a large pot; season with salt and pepper. Bring the soup to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until barley is cooked through but firm to the bite, about 1 hour.
