Soak apricots in warm water for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, cream the sugar, butter and egg. Stir in orange juice. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; stir into creamed mixture just until combined. Drain apricots well; add to batter with nuts. Pour into a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55 minutes or until bread tests done. Cool 10 minutes in pan before removing to a wire rack.
