Mix garlic, rosemary, sage, thyme, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl. Pat garlic mixture over entire roast. Make an incision down the middle of the roast, keeping parallel with the bones. Place the roast in a plastic roasting bag and pour Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce into the bag, concentrating on the incision in the roast. Tie the bag and refrigerate roast to marinate, turning often, at least 2 hours. Remove roast from refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature, 1 to 2 hours. Remove roast from bag and discard marinade. Place roast, fat-side up, in a roasting pan. Preheat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Lower heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue cooking until an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (65 degrees C), about 1 hour. Let roast stand for 20 minutes before slicing.
