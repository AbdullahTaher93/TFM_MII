Whisk together the soy sauce, ginger, gin, water, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Arrange wings in a single layer in baking dish. Pour the soy sauce mixture over the wings. Allow wings to marinate 30 minutes. Pour oil into a 2-quart saucepan; heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Drain and discard marinade from wings. Cook wings in batches in heated oil until brown and no longer pink on inside, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain cooked wings on paper towels before serving.
