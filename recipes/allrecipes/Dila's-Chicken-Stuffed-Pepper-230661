Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Mix cilantro, diced chicken, mayonnaise, and 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese in a bowl; fill pepper halves with chicken mixture. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese over peppers and arrange on prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and filling is heated through, 8 to 10 minutes. Top each pepper with 1 tablespoon sour cream before serving.
