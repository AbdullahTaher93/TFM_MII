Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Melt butter with olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic in the butter mixture until softened, 2 to 3 minutes; add spinach and cook to wilt slightly, about 1 minute. Stir fettuccine with the spinach mixture. Pour cream over the pasta and spinach. Increase heat to medium-high and cook until the cream is slightly thickened and reduced in volume, about 5 minutes. Stir Parmesan cheese into the sauce to melt; season with black pepper. Toss to coat noodles with the cheesy sauce.
