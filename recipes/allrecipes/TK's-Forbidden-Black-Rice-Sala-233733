Bring water and rice to a boil in a pot. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes. Let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Transfer rice to a large bowl, fluff with a fork, and cool until just warm. Whisk rice vinegar, tamari, sesame oil, mirin, sriracha sauce, and agave nectar together in a bowl until dressing is smooth. Pour dressing over cooled rice; stir. Stir carrots, cashews, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, orange bell pepper, scallions, Thai basil, purple basil, and jalapeno into rice until evenly distributed.
