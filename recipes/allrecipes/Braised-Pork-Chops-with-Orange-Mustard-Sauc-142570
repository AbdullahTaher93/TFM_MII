Season chops with salt and pepper. Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown chops, 3 to 4 minutes per side. In small bowl, stir together ginger root, orange juice, soy sauce, honey, mustard and garlic. Pour ginger mixture over chops. Simmer, covered, 8 to 10 minutes or until chops are tender. Place cooked chops on serving plate; spoon 1/2 of orange-mustard sauce over pork. Garnish with orange slices and watercress. Pass remaining sauce.
