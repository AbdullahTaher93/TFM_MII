In a medium bowl combine all the ingredients, except chicken. Mix well and let stand for 30 minutes to blend flavors. Place the chicken breasts between two sheets of plastic wrap and flatten with a rolling pin to a uniform thickness. Broil or grill chicken 4 minutes on each side or until cooked through. Top the chicken with the salsa.
