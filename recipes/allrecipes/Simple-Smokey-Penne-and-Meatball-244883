Pour whole box of pasta into a large skillet (approximately 12 inches in diameter). Pour 3 cups of cold water into the pan ensuring that the water covers the pasta. Turn the burner to high and set your timer to 10 minutes (optional: add a bit of salt to taste). After 5 minutes add meatballs and stir to combine. With about 1 minute left add both sauces and season with salt and pepper, fold to combine. Remove the skillet from the heat and top with onions, cheese and cilantro. Serve immediately.
