In a large skillet over medium heat, cook beef until no longer pink. Add butter, zucchini, mushrooms and onions; cook and stir until the vegetables are tender. Drain. Stir in chili powder, salt and garlic powder. Add rice, chilies, sour cream and half of the cheese. Transfer to a greased 2-qt. baking dish; top with remaining cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees for 20 minutes or until cheese is melted.
