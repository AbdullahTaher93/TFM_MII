Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Place walnuts in a food processor; process until crushed. Mix crushed walnuts, tofu, egg, and Irish stout beer in a large bowl until the mixture holds together when lightly squeezed. Stir in soy sauce and season with salt and black pepper. Form the mixture into six patties. Grill patties on the prepared grill until browned and set in the middle, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
