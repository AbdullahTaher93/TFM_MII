For each toast cup, place on slice of bread halfway over another; roll flat. Press into jumbo muffin cups coated with nonstick cooking spray. Spritz bread cups with butter spray. Combine Parmesan cheese and onion powder; sprinkle over cups. Bake at 350 degrees F for 13-15 minutes or until the bread is toasted. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely. For salad, combine the turkey, celery and onion in a bowl. Stir in mayonnaise and salt; spoon into toast cups. Top with lettuce and salsa. Combine cheese; dollop over each serving. Garnish with parsley and olives.
