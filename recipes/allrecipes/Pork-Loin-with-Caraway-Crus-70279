Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a small bowl, mix together the caraway seed, salt, mustard powder, thyme, oregano and vegetable oil to make a paste. Place the roast in a roasting pan fat side up. Rub the spice mixture into the top and sides of the roast. Insert a meat thermometer into the roast, and place in the oven. Roast for about 1 hour, or until the internal temperature reaches 155 degrees F (67 degrees C). Remove from the oven and let rest for 15 minutes. The temperature will rise to 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Slice and serve.
