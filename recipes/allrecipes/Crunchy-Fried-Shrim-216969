Beat eggs in a medium bowl until frothy. Mix flour, salt and pepper in another medium bowl. Dredge shrimp in flour, shake off excess. Dip shrimp into eggs, then press shrimp into Panko; turn shrimp over and press into Panko again to coat both sides. Pour enough oil into heavy large pot to reach depth of 2 inches; heat to 350 degrees F. Working in batches, add shrimp to hot oil; deep-fry until cooked through, about 1 minute. Using tongs transfer shrimp to paper towels to drain. Arrange shrimp on platter. If desired, serve with Kikkoman Tonkatsu Sauce for dipping.
