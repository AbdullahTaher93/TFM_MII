Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Stir the chicken, 1/2 cup soup, the salsa and cheese in a medium bowl. Stir the remaining soup and the milk in a small bowl. Divide the chicken mixture among the tortillas. Roll up the tortillas around the filling. Place the filled tortillas, seam-side down, into an 11x8x2-inch baking dish. Pour the soup mixture over the filled tortillas. Cover the baking dish. Bake for 30 minutes or until the enchiladas are hot and bubbling.
