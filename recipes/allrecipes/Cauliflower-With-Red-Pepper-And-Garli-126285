Place a steamer basket in a large saucepan with 1/2 inch of water. Place the cauliflower and pepper in the steamer. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 4 minutes, or until tender-crisp. Place in a serving bowl. Heat the oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Remove from the heat and stir in the garlic. When the sizzling stops, stir in the vinegar, thyme, paprika, and salt. Add to the vegetables and toss to coat well.
