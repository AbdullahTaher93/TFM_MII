Combine the salsa, black beans and crab meat together in a 12 inch non-stick pan. Warm the mixture over a medium temperature, until the mixture is hot. Add the Pepper Jack cheese and heat through until melted. Pour crab-cheese mixture over tortilla chips, top with a dollop of sour cream and a garnish of green onions. Enjoy immediately!
