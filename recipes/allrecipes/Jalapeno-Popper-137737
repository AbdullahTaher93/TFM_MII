Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the chiles on a baking sheet and roast, flipping once, until just softened, about 20 minutes. Transfer the chiles to a plate to cool. Cut a slit down one side of each from top to bottom. Using a spoon, scrape out and discard the ribs and seeds, being careful not to tear the flesh. Set aside. Fill a medium, heavy-bottomed pot with enough oil to reach a depth of 1 1/2 inches and heat the oil to 325 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Combine the cream cheese, cheddar cheese and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl and mash well with a fork. Spoon the cheese mixture into a resealable plastic bag with a corner snipped off to make an opening about 1/2 inch wide. Carefully pipe about 1 1/2 tablespoons cheese mixture into each chile, then squeeze back together. Place the eggs in one wide, shallow bowl and the bread crumbs in another. Roll each chile in the eggs, then transfer to the bread crumbs and press gently to coat, shaking off any excess. Repeat the egg- and bread-crumb-coating process to double-coat the chiles. Working in batches, fry the chiles until deep golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chiles to paper towels to drain. Season to taste with salt.
