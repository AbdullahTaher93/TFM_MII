Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions; saute until soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and beef; continue to cook until meat loses its pink color, 4 to 5 minutes longer. Stir in basil, oregano, red pepper and tomatoes; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally and adding water if necessary to make a thick sauce, about 20 minutes. Adjust oven rack to center position and heat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Mix eggs, ricotta, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and parsley in a small bowl. In a 9x13 inch lasagna pan, dissolve 1 1/2 tablespoons salt in 2 quarts of hot tap water. Add lasagna noodles; soak until soft and pliable, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. To assemble the lasagna, spoon about 1/2 cup of sauce over the lasagna pan bottom. Make 3 layers in the following order: 3 lasagna noodles, 1 cup sauce, 1/2 cup ricotta, 3/4 cup mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Top with remaining lasagna noodles, mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Seal with foil. Bake until hot and bubbly, about 30 minutes. Remove foil, turn on broiler and broil until cheese is brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from oven, let stand 10 minutes, cut, and serve.
