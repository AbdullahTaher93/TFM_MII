Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium mixing bowl, beat eggs and sugar together; add butter and beat well. In a separate bowl, sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Add the flour mixture to the egg mixture, alternating with milk. Fold in the cherries and pecans; stir just to combine. Scoop batter into prepared muffin pans and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
