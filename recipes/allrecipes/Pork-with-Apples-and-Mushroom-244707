Season the pork with the thyme and black pepper. Heat the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork and cook until browned on both sides. Remove the pork from the skillet. Cook the mushrooms and onion in the skillet for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the apple and cook for 5 minutes or until the apple is tender-crisp. Stir in the soup, vinegar and broth and heat to a boil. Return the pork to the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the pork is cooked through. Serve the pork and sauce with the rice.
