In a Dutch oven, stir together the broth, chopped onions, lemon juice, oil, ginger, paprika, coriander, allspice, cardamom, salt, and pepper. Add the turkey and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat, cover, and gently simmer for 8 minutes. Turn the turkey over and continue simmering, covered, for 8 minutes more. Layer the carrots, potatoes, and quartered onions around the turkey. Cover and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the vegetables and turkey are tender. To serve, slice the turkey. Then arrange the turkey and vegetables on a deep serving platter. Spoon the broth mixture over the turkey and vegetables.
