Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and baking soda. Cut in butter and 1 teaspoon vanilla until crumbly. Press firmly on bottom of ungreased 13x9-inch baking pan. Bake 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Top evenly with marshmallows; bake 2 minutes longer or until marshmallows begin to puff. Remove from oven; cool. In heavy saucepan, over medium heat, combine sweetened condensed milk and peanut butter; cook and stir until slightly thickened, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in remaining ingredients and 2 teaspoons vanilla. Spread evenly over marshmallows. Chill. Cut into bars. Store loosely covered at room temperature.
