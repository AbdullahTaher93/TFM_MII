In a mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Stir in butter, eggs, milk and vanilla; set aside. Combine all topping ingredients. Spread half the batter into a greased 12-in. x 8-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Sprinkle with half of the topping. Carefully spread remaining batter over topping, then sprinkle with remaining topping. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until cake tests done.
