Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray. Mix sour cream, vegetable dip mix, garlic salt, and Creole seasoning together in a bowl. Arrange salmon fillets, skin-side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Spread sour cream mixture over each fillet. Bake in the preheated oven until fish almost flakes easily with a fork, 7 to 8 minutes; sprinkle macadamia nuts over fillets. Turn on oven's broiler. Broil until nuts are browned and fish flakes easily with a fork, 2 to 3 minutes more.
