In a large, nonreactive bowl, combine all ingredients except the 1 teaspoon olive oil, pork chops, and butter; mix well. Add chops, and spoon marinade over them to coat. Marinate for at least 30 minutes. Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat for 2 minutes. Remove chops from marinade, reserving marinade. Brush pan with the teaspoon of oil; cook chops for 5 minutes on each side. Add marinade, lower heat, and cook, covered, for 7 minutes, turning chops once. Remove chops from pan, and set aside. Turn up heat to medium high; reduce liquid until thick. Remove from heat, stir in butter, and strain. Pour sauce over chops; serve immediately.
