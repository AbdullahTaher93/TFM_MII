In a large bowl, combine the flour, oats and sugar. In another bowl, beat the egg, milk and oil. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in cheese and onion. Fill greased muffin cups three-fourths full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.
