Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix cream cheese, sour cream and broth in large bowl until well blended. Add potatoes, ham, 1-3/4 cups of the cheese and peas; stir gently to coat all ingredients. Spoon into 13x9-inch baking dish sprayed with cooking spray. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake 1 hour or until casserole is heated through and potatoes are tender.
