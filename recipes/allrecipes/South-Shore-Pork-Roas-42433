In a large skillet over medium heat, brown roast in butter for 5 minutes on each side. Transfer to a roasting pan. In the same skillet, saute onion and carrots until crisp-tender. Place around roast. Sprinkle with paprika. Add broth to pan. Cover and bake at 350 degrees for 1-1/2 hours. Uncover; bake 50 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 145 (63 degrees C). Remove roast and vegetables to a serving platter; keep warm. Pour pan drippings into a measuring cup; skim fat. Add water to measure 2-2/3 cups. In a saucepan, combine flour and sour cream until smooth. Add drippings, parsley and salt. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Serve with the roast.
