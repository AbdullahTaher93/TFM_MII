Pierce the potatoes with a fork. Bake at 400 degrees F for 60-70 minutes or until tender. Cut potatoes in half lengthwise; scoop out pulp, leaving a thin shell. Set shells aside. In a large bowl, mash pulp; add butter, garlic powder, salt, oregano, cayenne, celery salt and enough milk to make a smooth filling. Stuff or pipe into shells; place in two greased 13-in. x 9-in.x 2-in. baking pans. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and paprika if desired. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until heated through.
