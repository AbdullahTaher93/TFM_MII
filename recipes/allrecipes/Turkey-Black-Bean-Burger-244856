Combine turkey, black beans, onion, tomato, parsley, egg white, garlic, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until well combined; form into 4 patties. Heat a greased skillet over medium heat; cook patties until no longer pink in the center, 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
