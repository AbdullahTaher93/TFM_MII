Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Tear the dried beef into strips, and lay the strips across the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Remove the skin from the raw chicken pieces. Wrap 1 piece of bacon around each piece. Place the chicken pieces in the baking dish on top of the beef. Mix the cream cheese, cream of mushroom soup and cream of celery soup together in a bowl until thoroughly blended. Pour the mixture over the chicken. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is bubbly, about 2 hours. Cool 10 minutes and serve.
