Mix the oil, garlic, oregano, and cumin in a 1-quart microwave-safe dish and nuke for 1 minute. Stir in the tuna, tomatoes, hot-pepper sauce, and lime juice. Microwave for 2 to 4 minutes, or until heated through, stirring once. Nuke the tortillas for 10 seconds, or until warm. Spoon some of the hot filling onto each tortilla, top with the cheese, and fold up.
