Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. In a bowl, cream together the butter, chopped parsley, and chives. Arrange the butterfish in the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper. Dot the fish with about 2 tablespoons of the butter mixture. Bake 5 minutes in the preheated oven, until the butter is melted. Turn fillets, brush with remaining butter mixture, and continue baking 10 minutes, or until fish is easily flaked with a fork. Garnish with parsley sprigs and lemon wedges to serve.
