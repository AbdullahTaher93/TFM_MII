Preheat broiler. Cut turkey into 3/4-inch cubes. Place turkey, green onions and red peppers in food storage bag. Seal bag; refrigerate at least 1 hour, turning occasionally. Meanwhile, soak 16 bamboo skewers in cold water at least 30 minutes. Thread all ingredients onto wooden skewers; brush with marinade. Broil until heated through and browned, 3 to 4 minutes, turning once.
