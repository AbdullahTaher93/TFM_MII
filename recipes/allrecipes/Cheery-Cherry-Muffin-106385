Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners. Lightly spray liners with vegetable cooking spray. Set aside 12 cherries. Chop remaining cherries. Place cherries on a paper towel to drain. Beat margarine and cream cheese at medium speed with an electric mixer until creamy. Add SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, beating well. Add egg beating until blended. Add flour to butter mixture alternately with milk, beginning and ending with flour. Beat at low speed until blended after each addition. Do not over beat. Stir in chopped cherries. Spoon one tablespoon of batter into each muffin cup. Place a cherry in the center of each cup. Top with remaining batter, filling muffin cups three-fourths full. Bake 25 minutes or until muffins are lightly browned. Remove from pans immediately, and cool on wire racks.
