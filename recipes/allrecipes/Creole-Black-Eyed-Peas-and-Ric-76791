Crumble the ground beef into a deep skillet or large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and green pepper. Cook and stir until beef is evenly browned. Drain the grease. Add the rice and water to the pan, and season with Creole seasoning, pepper, and garlic powder. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 30 minutes, until the water is absorbed. About halfway through cooking the rice, stir in the black-eyed peas.
