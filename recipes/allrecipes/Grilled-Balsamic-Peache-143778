Preheat grill for high heat for 10 minutes. Place olive oil in a bowl. Add peach halves and toss to evenly coat with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Cook the peaches, flesh side down, on preheated grill until slightly charred, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the grill and dust with Cajun seasoning. Cut halves into 1 inch-thick slices. Place halves in a bowl; add vinegar and parsley, tossing peaches to coat evenly. Place on a serving platter and garnish with sprigs of parsley.
