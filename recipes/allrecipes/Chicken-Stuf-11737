In a large skillet, melt butter or margarine over medium heat. Lay chicken strips in butter or margarine, and sprinkle with garlic salt and lemon pepper. Cook, turning frequently, until chicken strips are golden brown on all sides; the chicken should be still soft, not fried hard. Stack cooked strips at outer edges of the skillet if you need to cook more strips. When all chicken strips are browned, add condensed mushroom soup, 1 soup can of water, and mushrooms to skillet; blend well with pan drippings and chicken strips. Add macaroni noodles, and just enough water to cover noodles; stir well. Lower heat, and cover. Simmer until noodles are done, stirring frequently.
