Reserve 2/3 cup broth; pour remaining broth into 2-quart oblong baking dish. Place squash cut-side down in broth. Bake in 400 degrees F oven, 25 to 30 minutes. In medium saucepan, over medium-high heat, heat reserved broth and butter until butter melts; stir in stuffing mix, pecans and raisins. Turn squash cut-side up; spoon stuffing into squash cavities. Bake 20 minutes longer or until squash is cooked, basting with broth after 10 minutes.
