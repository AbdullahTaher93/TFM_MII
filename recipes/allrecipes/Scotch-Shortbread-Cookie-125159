In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and sugar. Cut in butter until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Knead dough until smooth, about 6 to 10 minutes. Pat dough into an ungreased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Pierce with a fork. Bake at 325 degrees F for 25 to 30 minutes or until lightly browned. While warm, cut into squares. Cool.
