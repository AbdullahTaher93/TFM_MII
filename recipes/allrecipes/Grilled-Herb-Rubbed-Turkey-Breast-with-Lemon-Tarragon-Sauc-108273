At least 1 day before serving, in a spice (or coffee) grinder or a blender, finely grind 2 tablespoons salt, the tarragon, thyme and peppercorns together. Rinse turkey breast and pat dry. Using poultry shears or kitchen scissors, cut off any ribs extending beyond edges of breast meat (to make breast easy to turn on the grill). Then, trim off any extra fat and skin. Rub herb mixture over both sides of turkey breast. Cover and chill for at least 1 day (see notes). Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for indirect heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is balanced on the sides, not directly under the food). Rub turkey breast with oil. Set breast skin side down on center of grill (not over direct heat). Cover charcoal grill and open vents; close lid on gas grill. Cook for about 30 minutes. Turn turkey breast over and continue to cook until an instant read meat thermometer inserted through thickest part of breast to bone reaches 160 degrees , 25 to 30 minutes longer. Meanwhile, in a blender, whirl mayonnaise, lemon juice, tarragon and garlic until smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste. Pour into a small bowl; cover and chill. Transfer cooked turkey to a clean platter or rimmed carving board and let rest in a warm place about 10 minutes. Thinly slice meat from the bone and serve with lemon tarragon sauce to add to taste (see notes).
