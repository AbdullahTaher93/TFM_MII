Stir in salsa, vinegar, chili powder and beans; cook until heated through. On 6 plates, evenly divide and layer lettuce, tomatoes and pepper. Top with turkey mixture, cheese and green onion. Serve with lean tortilla chips, yogurt and lime wedges, if desired. Lean tortilla chips: Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray two baking sheets with cooking spray. Brush six 8-inch flour tortillas lightly with water and sprinkle with garlic salt. Cut each tortilla into eighths. Place triangle-shaped pieces on baking sheets and bake until crisp and golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.
