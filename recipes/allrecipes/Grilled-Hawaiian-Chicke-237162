Whisk water, soy sauce, coconut milk, brown sugar, green onions, white onion, sesame oil, and garlic together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add chicken thighs and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight. Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from marinade and discard the marinade. Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
