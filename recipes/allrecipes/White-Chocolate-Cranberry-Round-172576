In a bowl with a mixer, beat butter with sugar until well blended. Then beat in egg. In another bowl, combine flour and baking soda. Add to butter mixture. Stir, then beat until well mixed. Stir in rolled oats and white chocolate chips. Drop dough in 1 1/2-tbsp. (4-tsp.) portions 2 in. apart onto buttered 12- by 15-in. baking sheets; measure the first few precisely, then eyeball the rest. Press 3 or 4 cranberries into each cookie. Bake in a 350 degrees F oven until light golden, 10 to 12 minutes; if using more than 1 pan in 1 oven, switch pan positions halfway through baking. With a wide spatula, transfer cookies to racks to cool. If hot cookies start to break, slide a thin spatula under them to release, let stand on pan to firm, 2 to 5 minutes, then transfer to racks. Serve cookies, chill up to 2 days, or freeze to store longer.
