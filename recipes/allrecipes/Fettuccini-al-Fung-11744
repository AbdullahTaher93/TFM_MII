Cook the pasta according to package directions. Meanwhile, saute mushrooms and garlic in olive oil over low heat until tender. Mix in pesto mix, milk, and cream cheese; bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat, and simmer while stirring until cream cheese has melted and mixture has thickened. Drain pasta. Pour sauce over noodles, and toss to coat. Serve.
