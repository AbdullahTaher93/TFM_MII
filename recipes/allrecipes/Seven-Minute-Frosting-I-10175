Combine sugar, water, egg whites, salt, corn syrup, and vanilla in the top of a double boiler. Beat all ingredients about one minute before placing bowl or pan over the heat. Place over rapidly boiling water; beat at high speed until the mixture forms soft peaks. (This may take longer than 7 minutes). Transfer frosting mixture to large bowl; beat until the mixture is thick and cool enough to spread.
