Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Combine salt, 1/2 teaspoon basil, oregano and pepper; press onto beef roast. Place roast on rack in shallow roasting pan. Insert ovenproof meat thermometer so tip is centered in thickest part of beef. Do not add water or cover. Roast 1 1/2 hours for medium rare doneness. Remove roast when meat thermometer registers 135 degrees. Transfer to board; tent with foil. Let stand 15 to 20 minutes. (Temperature will continue to rise about 10 degrees to reach 145 degrees for medium rare.) Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees. Combine zucchini, oil, lemon juice, and 1/2 teaspoon basil in large bowl; toss. Place on rack in pan. Roast 15 minutes or until tender. Add tomatoes; toss. Carve roast. Serve with vegetables. Season with salt.
