Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef, zucchini, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, sucanat, basil, sea salt, oregano, and black pepper into beef mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until flavors have blended, at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour for better flavor. While sauce is simmering, bring salted water to a boil and cook spaghetti according to package directions. Serve sauce over hot pasta.
