Whisk soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, cane sugar, lime juice, lime zest, green onion, garlic, ground ginger, and chile-garlic sauce together in a large glass or ceramic bowl; add the sliced pork and toss to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours. Remove pork from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard marinade. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook pork slices in oil until no longer pink in the center, about 2 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
