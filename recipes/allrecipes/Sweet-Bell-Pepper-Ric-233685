Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion in the hot oil until tender, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and continue to cook and stir until onion is translucent, 2 to 3 minutes more. Stir green bell pepper and red bell pepper into onion mixture; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Season with basil, oregano, black pepper, and salt. Pour wine into vegetable mixture and reduce heat to medium low. Simmer until liquid is reduced, about 5 minutes. Stir rice into vegetables. Top with Parmesan cheese before serving.
