In a covered 5- to 6-quart pan, bring about 4 quarts of water to a boil over high heat. Meanwhile, trim and discard discolored ends of chard stems. Rinse and drain chard; stack leaves and cut in half lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Set aside. Heat oil in a wide nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add prosciutto and cook, stirring often, until prosciutto is brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in chard and garlic. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, just until chard is wilted, about 3 minutes. Uncover and, if necessary, stir over high heat until any liquid evaporates. Remove chard mixture from pan and set aside. Drop gnocchi into boiling water; once they have risen to the surface, cook for 1 more minute (total cooking time will be 3 to 4 minutes). Or cook according to package directions. Drain well. Melt butter in frying pan over medium-high heat. Add chopped sage; swirl in the pan for 1 minute. Add drained gnocchi and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly golden on all sides, about 5 minutes. Add chard mixture and stir gently just until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Divide gnocchi between 4 dinner plates; garnish with sage sprigs. Sprinkle equally with cheese.
