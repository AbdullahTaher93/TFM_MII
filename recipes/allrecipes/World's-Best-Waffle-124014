In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm milk. Beat egg yolks lightly; add to yeast mixture with vanilla. Combine flour, salt and nutmeg; stir into yeast mixture just until combined. Add butter; mix well. Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form; fold into batter. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45-60 minutes.
