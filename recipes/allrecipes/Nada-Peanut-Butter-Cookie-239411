Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Mix peanut butter, agave nectar, Diamond Crystal(R) Fine Sea Salt, baking soda, and vanilla together in a bowl until well combined. Drop dough by rounded tablespoons onto prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart. Lightly press tops of cookies down with a fork dipped in water twice at a 90 degree angle to form a criss-cross pattern and to flatten slightly. Bake until the edges are golden brown, about 9 minutes. Cool cookies on cookie sheet for 2 minutes to set. Then carefully slide parchment with the cookies onto a cooling rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container.
