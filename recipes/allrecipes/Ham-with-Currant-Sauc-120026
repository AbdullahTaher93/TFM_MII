In a large skillet, bring ham and water to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until ham is heated through, turning once. Meanwhile, in a small microwave-safe bowl, combine jelly and horseradish. Cover and microwave on high for 2-3 minutes or until heated through, stirring occasionally. Serve over ham.
