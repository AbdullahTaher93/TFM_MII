Mix warm water, salt, and sugar together in a bowl. Put flour in a large mixing bowl; work in 3 1/2 tablespoons ghee using your fingertips. Beat egg and 1 teaspoon water together in a bowl; add to flour mixture. Gradually mix warm water mixture into flour mixture while kneading until dough becomes soft and pliable. Form dough into balls and let rest in a well-oiled bowl, 2 to 3 hours. Working on a flat greased surface, take a dough ball and flatten it using the heel of your palm to make a paper-thin circle. Spread 1 teaspoon ghee inside it. Fold the edges together to make roti into a square. Repeat with remaining dough. Heat about 1 tablespoon ghee on griddle or in a skillet over medium heat; cook roti until browned, 1 to 3 minutes per side.
