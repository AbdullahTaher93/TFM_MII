Scrub potatoes, but do not dry them. Prick the center of each potato with a fork. Arrange in a microwave in a circle, about 1 inch apart. Microwave on high (100%) for 17 to 20 minutes or until soft when pierced in the center. Cool potatoes 5 minutes. Meanwhile, heat soup. Cut potatoes open lengthwise and mash coarsely with a fork. Spoon 1/2 cup soup into each potato. Season with salt and pepper.
