Place potatoes and celery root into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and coarsely mash with a potato masher. Mash butter, nutmeg, salt, and black pepper into potato mixture until desired consistency is reached. Fold cream into puree until just combined.
