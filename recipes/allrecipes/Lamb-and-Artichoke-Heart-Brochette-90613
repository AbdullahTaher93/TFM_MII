In a bowl, mix lamb, artichoke hearts, lemon peel and juice, olive oil, garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper; cover and chill until next day (or at least 2 hours). Stir occasionally. Up to 2 hours before grilling, thread meat and artichokes onto skewers, fitting pieces snugly together. Arrange on a flat pan, drizzle marinating juices over skewers, cover, and chill. Lay skewered brochettes on a lightly oiled barbecue grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. (Or broil in pan 4 inches below heat.) Cook until meat is browned, turning as needed, until done (cut to center of meat to test); for medium-rare (pink), about 8 minutes total; for well (gray), about 12 minutes total. Transfer brochettes to plates or a warm platter; garnish with rosemary sprigs.
