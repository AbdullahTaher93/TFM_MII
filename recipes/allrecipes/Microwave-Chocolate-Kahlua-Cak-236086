Mix cake mixes together. (Mixture makes enough for about 24 Kahlua cakes). Spoon 3 tablespoons of mixture into a lightly oiled coffee mug. Add water and Kahlua. Stir well and microwave until cooked through, 1 minute 20 seconds.* Let the cake stand for a few minutes before adding topping of your choice.
