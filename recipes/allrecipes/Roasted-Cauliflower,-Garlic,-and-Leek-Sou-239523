Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Put cauliflower florets into a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil over the cauliflower; season with salt and pepper. Add garlic to the cauliflower and spread onto a baking sheet. Roast in preheated oven for 15 minutes, turn the florets and garlic, and continue roasting until golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir celery and leek in hot butter until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir flour into the celery mixture; cook and stir until flour is heated, 2 to 3 minutes more. Stream chicken broth into the pot while continually stirring to incorporate. Add cauliflower, garlic, and marjoram to the broth mixture; bring to a simmer and cook until the flavors develop together, about 10 minutes. Blend soup with an immersion blender to your desired consistency; season again with salt.
