Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and place 2 tablespoons of sesame salad dressing in the skillet. Add the chicken, and cook and stir until no longer pink in the middle and beginning to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the orange juice and 2 more tablespoons of sesame dressing, and bring to a boil. Stir in the red bell pepper, zucchini, broccoli, and green onions, and cook and stir until the vegetables are tender and the broccoli is bright green in color, 5 to 8 minutes.
