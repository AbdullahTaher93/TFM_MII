Whisk eggs, milk, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and Parmesan cheese together in a bowl. Place each American cheese slice between two pieces of bread to assemble 6 sandwiches. Dip both sides of each sandwich in egg mixture. Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Place dipped sandwiches in the hot frying pan; cook until golden brown and cheese is melted, about 3 minutes per side.
