Mix together the eggs, milk, and vanilla in a large flat dish. Dip the bread in the egg mixture, and then flip it so both sides are coated. Heat both sides of the toast in a nonstick skillet until golden brown. Stir the maple syrup and peanut butter together in a separate bowl and microwave until warm. Pour over the French toast. Open mouth. Eat.
