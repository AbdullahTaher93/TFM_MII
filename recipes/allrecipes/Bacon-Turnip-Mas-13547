Peel and cube the turnip. Cook in a saucepan in salted water until very tender. Drain then mash with the butter or margarine, salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste. Set aside. In a skillet fry the bacon until nice and crispy. Remove from the skillet and crumble. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the bacon grease. To the skillet with the 2 tablespoons of bacon grease add the mashed turnip and crumpled bacon. Stir and heat to the desired temperature before serving.
