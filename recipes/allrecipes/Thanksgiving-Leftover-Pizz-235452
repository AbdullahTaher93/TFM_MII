Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease or flour a pizza pan. Roll dough onto the prepared pizza pan. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir mushrooms and garlic until mushrooms are tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Spread gravy over pizza dough; top with mushroom mixture, turkey, and spoonfuls of mashed potatoes. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese and parsley over pizza. Whisk remaining 1/2 tablespoon olive oil with garlic powder and garlic salt; brush over pizza crust. Bake in the preheated oven until dough is cooked and cheese is melted, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly before serving, 3 to 5 minutes.
