In a large saucepan, heat the beans, chipotles and cumin over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until simmering. Stir in the green onions and chopped cilantro; continue to simmer 2 minutes. To assemble, spoon about 1/2 cup bean mixture on center of each tortilla. Top with equal amounts of the cheese and lettuce. Fold bottom edge up over filling. Fold right and left sides to center, overlapping edges. Serve with the salsa and guacamole and garnish with the cilantro sprigs, if desired.
