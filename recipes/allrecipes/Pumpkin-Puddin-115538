Beat pumpkin and eggs in a large heavy saucepan. Combine cornstarch, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cardamom in a medium bowl and stir into the pumpkin mixture. Add milk and juice. Cook over medium heat, whisking continuously--be sure to get the corners where lumps can hide--until the pudding is very thick, about 10 minutes. Reduce the heat and give the pudding a few quick whisks to remove any lumps. Divide among 8 ramekins or place in a serving bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours.
