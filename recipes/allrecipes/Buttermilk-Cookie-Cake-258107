Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Combine sugar, butter, egg yolk, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Add flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with buttermilk; beat dough well after each addition. Clean beaters and beat egg white in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold gently into the dough. Drop tablespoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies just start to brown, 10 to 11 minutes.
