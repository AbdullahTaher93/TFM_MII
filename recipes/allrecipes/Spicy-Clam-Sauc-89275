Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and drained clams; cook and stir for about 5 minutes. Season with oregano, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Pour in the reserved clam juice. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and serve over pasta. Garnish with Parmesan cheese, if desired.
