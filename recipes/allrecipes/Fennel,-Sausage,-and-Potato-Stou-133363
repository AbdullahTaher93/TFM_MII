In a large soup pot, heat the EVOO, 2 turns of the pan, over medium-high heat. Add the sausage, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, and brown for a couple of minutes. Add the onion, fennel, garlic and bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper and cook for 5 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the wine, stirring for about 2 minutes, then add the broth, cover and bring to a boil. Add the potatoes and cook, uncovered, until tender, about 10 minutes. Turn off the heat, adjust the seasonings and top the soup with the chopped fennel fronds, basil and parsley. Pass around cheese and bread at the table.
