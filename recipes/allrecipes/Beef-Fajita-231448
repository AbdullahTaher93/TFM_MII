Whisk olive oil, lime juice, cilantro, onion, garlic, cumin, salt, and black pepper in a bowl, and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add steak strips, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 4 hours to overnight. Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir beef in hot skillet until all liquid is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve cooked beef with tortillas, salsa and Mexican cheese blend.
