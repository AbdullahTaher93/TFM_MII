In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the bow ties until just done, about 15 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold water, and drain thoroughly. Meanwhile, season the scallops with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and 1/8 teaspoon of the pepper. In a large nonstick frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over moderately high heat. Sear the scallops, in two batches if necessary, until brown and just done, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Let cool. Using a stainless-steel knife, peel the oranges down to the flesh, removing all of the white pith. Cut the sections away from the membranes and put them in a large glass or stainless-steel bowl. Squeeze the juice from the membranes into the bowl. Add the remaining 4 tablespoons oil, the lemon juice, olives, onion, mint, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Stir to combine. Add the pasta and scallops and stir again.
