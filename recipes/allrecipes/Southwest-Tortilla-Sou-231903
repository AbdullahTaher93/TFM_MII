Sweat onions and garlic in olive oil. Add chicken, corn, beans and chilies and heat thoroughly. Add chicken broth, Idahoan(R) Bacon & Cheddar Chipotle Flavored Mashed Potatoes and tomatoes. Simmer for 45 minutes and adjust seasoning (we like it a little bit spicy so we add some hot sauce at this point). Here's the important part when serving: Crunch up tortilla chips on bottom of the bowl and ladle soup over. Top with diced avocado, sliced olives, shredded cheese, green onions, a dollop of sour cream and cilantro.
