In a bowl, combine the cracker crumbs, butter, sugar and water; press onto the bottom and up the sides of two 10-oz. custard cups. Bake at 350 degrees F for 6 minutes or until crust is lightly browned; set aside. In a saucepan, combine the milk and pudding mix; prepare according to package directions. Keep warm. In a small mixing bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until stiff peaks form. Spoon warm pudding into crust; spread with meringue, sealing edges to crust. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack for 1 hour; refrigerate for 1-2 hours before serving.
