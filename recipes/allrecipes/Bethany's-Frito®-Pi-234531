Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread about 2 cups corn chips in a baking dish. Sprinkle half the onion and half the Cheddar cheese over chips and top with chili. Spread remaining 1 cup corn chips over the chili, followed by remaining chopped onion and cheese. Bake until hot and bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes.
