Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter a 2-quart souffle dish. Add the Parmesan and turn to evenly coat the bottom and side of the dish. Tap out any excess. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over moderate heat. Whisk in the flour until a smooth paste forms. Whisk in 1 cup of the milk until smooth, then whisk in the remaining 1 cup of milk and add the bay leaf. Bring the sauce to a boil, whisking constantly. Reduce the heat to low and cook, whisking frequently, until very thick, about 10 minutes. Scrape into a large bowl. Stir in the goat cheese and season with salt and pepper, then whisk in the egg yolks. Cover and let cool, then stir in the herbs. In a large stainless steel bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until firm but not dry. Fold one-third of the beaten whites into the cheese sauce. Fold in the remaining whites, leaving a few white streaks. Scrape the souffle mixture into the prepared baking dish and bake in the center of the oven for 45 minutes, or until browned, puffed and still slightly jiggly in the center. Serve at once.
