Whisk orange juice, cumin, chile pepper, and sea salt together in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the steak, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove steak from marinade and discard marinade. Cook the steak until it starts to firm and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).
