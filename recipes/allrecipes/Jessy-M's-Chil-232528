Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir pinto beans, kidney beans, onion, chili powder, and Parmesan cheese with the beef; season with salt and pepper. Pour enough tomato juice into the pot to cover the mixture by 1 inch. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until the beans are heated through, about 10 minutes. Serve with crackers and pickle juice.
