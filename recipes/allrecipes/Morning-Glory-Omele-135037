Drizzle the oil in the skillet, then dump in the potatoes, onion, tomato, mushrooms, garlic and parsley. Cook over medium heat until most of the liquid from the tomato has evaporated (about three minutes). With a spatula, distribute the vegetables evenly across the bottom of the pan. Then pour in the fat-free egg substitute from the carton, swirling it across the vegetables. Lift, tilt and rotate the pan to distribute the eggs evenly over the vegetables. Return pan to heat. Cook until the eggs are moist but not runny, then fold the omelet in half with the spatula. Cook for one more minute. Cut the folded omelet in half with the spatula and lift or slide each serving onto a plate.
