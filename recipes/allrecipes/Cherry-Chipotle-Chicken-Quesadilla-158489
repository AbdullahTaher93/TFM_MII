To assemble, layer 1/3 cup cheese, 1/2 cup chicken, 1/3 cup cherries and 1 1/2 tablespoons salsa on half of each tortilla. Sprinkle each with 1/3 cup of remaining cheese. Fold tortillas in half; pressing gently. Spray a nonstick 10- or 12-inch skillet and tops of each quesadilla with no-stick cooking spray. Heat skillet over medium-low heat. Place quesadillas in skillet, bottom sides down. Cook quesadillas, uncovered, for 9 to 12 minutes or until golden and cheese is melted, carefully turning over once. Remove quesadillas from skillet. Cut quesadillas into wedges. If desired, serve with additional salsa, sour cream and green onions.
