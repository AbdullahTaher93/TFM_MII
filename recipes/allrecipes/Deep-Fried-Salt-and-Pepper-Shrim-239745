Cut off feathery legs and hard pointed area right above the tail of each shrimp. Rinse shrimp and dry thoroughly. Combine salt, pepper, and 5-spice powder in a small bowl. Heat oil in wok or a heavy pot over high heat until your deep fry thermometer reaches 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cook shrimp, about 5 per batch, in the hot oil until shrimp are bright pink and cooked through, about 1 minute. Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Return oil temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) before each new batch. Discard the oil in the wok and heat wok over medium-high heat; add deep-fried shrimp and spice mix and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
