Season the salmon as desired. Spray a 12-inch skillet with the cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Add the salmon, skin-side up and cook for about 5 minutes or until it's well browned. Turn the salmon over and cook for 4 minutes or until it flakes easily when tested with a fork. Remove the salmon from the skillet and keep it warm. Add the red pepper and garlic to the skillet and cook over medium heat until the pepper is tender-crisp. Stir the juice, mango, honey, cornstarch, lime juice and black pepper in a small bowl. Stir the juice mixture and the spinach into the skillet. Cook for 2 minutes or until the mixture boils and thickens. Stir in the cilantro. Serve over the salmon. Serve with the rice.
