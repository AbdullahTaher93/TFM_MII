Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion in the melted butter until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle flour over the onion; continue cooking 2 to 3 minutes, stirring often. Pour chicken broth and milk into the pot; reduce heat to medium, and bring the mixture to a simmer. Stir shredded Gouda cheese into the liquid; cook and stir until the cheese melts completely. Place broccoli into a microwave-safe dish; cook in the microwave until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir broccoli into the soup. Season the soup with nutmeg, salt, and black pepper to serve.
