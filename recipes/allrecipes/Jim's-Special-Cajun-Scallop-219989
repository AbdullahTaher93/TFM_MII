Combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and blackened seasoning in a large, resealable plastic bag. Dip the scallops into a bowl of heavy cream to coat. Place the scallops one at a time into the plastic bag; shake to coat with the seasoning mixture. Place the breaded scallop on a plate and repeat with the remaining scallops. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Pan fry the scallops until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side.
