Line a baking dish with plastic wrap. Sift the confectioners' sugar into a large, microwave-safe bowl. Add the milk, maple extract, and butter to the bowl, but do not stir. Heat in microwave on full power for 3 minutes. Stir the walnuts into the fudge mixture until the fudge begins to thicken; pour into the lined baking dish. Smooth the top of the fudge with a spatula. Refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes. Remove the fudge from the pan using the plastic wrap as a handle. Cut into small squares and store in an airtight container.
