Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Place 1/4 of vegetables in center of a sheet of Reynolds Wrap(R) Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil. Drizzle with butter; top with basil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bring up sides of foil over vegetables; fold down two times. Double fold both ends of foil to seal packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside. Repeat to make four packets. Place packets on baking sheet with 1-inch sides. Bake 15 to 18 minutes on the cookie sheet. Open packets carefully by cutting beside top fold with a sharp knife, allowing steam to escape. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese over vegetables in each packet.
