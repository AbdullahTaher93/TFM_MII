Stir the chicken, garlic, lime juice and 1 tablespoon cilantro in a medium bowl. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken mixture and cook until the chicken is well browned, stirring often. Remove the chicken mixture from the skillet. Heat the remaining oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and peppers and cook until they're tender-crisp, stirring occasionally. Stir the soup, milk and peanut butter in the skillet and heat to a boil. Return the chicken the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through, stirring occasionally. Serve the chicken mixture with the rice and sprinkle with the remaining cilantro.
