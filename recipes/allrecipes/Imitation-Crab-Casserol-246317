Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 11 minutes. Drain. Combine cream of onion soup, Cheddar cheese, milk, and mayonnaise in a large bowl. Heat 1/4 cup butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add broccoli; cook and stir until just tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer broccoli to onion soup mixture; stir in pasta, imitation crabmeat, and tomatoes. Spread mixture into prepared baking dish. Mix bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and remaining butter together in a small bowl; sprinkle over crabmeat mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until brown and bubbly, 35 to 45 minutes.
