Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bring the rice and water to boil in a pot. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 25 minutes. Arrange broccoli in the bottom of the baking dish. Mix the cream of celery soup, mayonnaise, wine, and curry in a bowl, and pour 1/2 evenly over the broccoli. Cut salmon into chunks and place in baking dish. Top with remaining soup mixture. Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until broccoli is tender and fish flakes easily with a fork. Serve over cooked rice.
