If necessary, cut fish into 4 or 5 equal portions. Lay salmon, skin down, in a single layer in a close-fitting shallow casserole (about 8- by 12-in.) with a little space between pieces. (Use recommended casserole size; larger dish may cause sauce to dry out.) Finely grate enough peel from 1 orange to equal 1 tbsp. Squeeze juice from the orange; you should have about 1/2 cup. (If necessary, squeeze the other orange to yield 1/2 cup of juice total.) In a 1- to 2-quart pan, mix cornstarch with water until smooth. Add orange juice, orange peel, teriyaki sauce, sugar, butter, and ginger. Stir over high heat until thickened but not boiling. Quickly spoon sauce evenly over fish. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven until fish is done (cut to taste; fish should no longer look wet at thickest part), 20 to 25 minutes. Lift out portions, separating meat from skin. Spoon sauce over fish. Squeeze juice from extra orange wedges onto fish to taste.
