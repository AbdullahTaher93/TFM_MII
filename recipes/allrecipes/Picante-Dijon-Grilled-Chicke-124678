Pound chicken breasts to about 1/2-in. thickness; set aside. Combine picante sauce, mustard and sugar; mix well. Place chicken over medium-hot coals; brush generously with sauce. Grill about 6-8 minutes per side or until chicken is tender and no longer pink, brushing occasionally with remaining sauce.
