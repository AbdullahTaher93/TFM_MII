Heat oil in a large, deep saute pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and bell pepper; cook until soft and golden, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and chili powder; continue to cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Add tomatoes, broth and hominy; bring to simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer, partially covered, about 10 minutes, to blend flavors. Add turkey, salt and pepper. Simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in cilantro. Serve with tortilla or corn chips if you like.
