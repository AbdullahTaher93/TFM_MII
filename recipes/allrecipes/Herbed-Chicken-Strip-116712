Place chicken strips in a greased 1-qt. baking dish. In a skillet, saute onion and garlic in butter until tender. Stir in the parsley, dill oregano, salt and pepper. Pour over chicken. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 15 minutes. Stir; bake 5-10 minutes longer or until chicken juices run clear. Serve over rice if desired.
