Preheat oven to 450 degrees F and line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Divide pizza dough into 2 pieces and roll out each very thinly (about 9 x 13-inches) on a lightly floured board. Place on prepared baking sheets and brush lightly with olive oil. Thinly slice Brie and place evenly over dough or spread Chevre evenly over dough; sprinkle with half the walnuts. Top with ham and rosemary. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Stir together balsamic and honey in a medium bowl. Add arugula, pear and remaining walnuts and toss lightly to coat. Sprinkle evenly over warm flatbread and cut into small squares.
