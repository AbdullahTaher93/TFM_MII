In a saucepan saute onion and garlic over medium-low heat until they start to become clear. Combine in a pot, diced tomatoes, carrots, celery, red bell pepper, mushrooms, oregano, parsley, basil and olive oil. Bring to boil and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer for at least 1 hour, however, 3 hours of cooking develops better flavor and consistency.
