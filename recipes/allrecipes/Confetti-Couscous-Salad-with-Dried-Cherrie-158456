In a quart saucepan, heat olive oil over medium high heat. Add onion and saute for about 3 minutes or until softened. Add the broth and bring to a boil. Add couscous, stir, cover and remove from heat. Let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Transfer to a mixing bowl to cool. In a small bowl, whisk together cherry juice concentrate, lemon juice and mustard. Whisk in oil until emulsified. Set aside. Add dressing and remaining ingredients to couscous and mix well. Serve immediately.
