Puree water, garlic, serrano chile peppers, and ginger together in a blender or food processor until smooth. Heat ghee in a 6-quart saucepan over medium heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Cook chicken in hot ghee until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate. Cook and stir garlic puree in the 6-quart saucepan until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Add fenugreek, coriander, garam masala, and turmeric to onion mixture; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir tomatoes into onion mixture; cook and stir until tomatoes are lightly browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Add chicken, milk, and cream; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, cover saucepan, and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer chicken to a serving platter using a slotted spoon. Continue cooking sauce until slightly reduced, 5 to 7 more minutes. Stir cilantro into sauce and pour over chicken.
