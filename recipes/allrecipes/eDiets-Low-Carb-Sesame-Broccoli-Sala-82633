Rinse and cut up the broccoli into florets. In a medium saucepan, boil the broccoli for about 5-6 minutes until tender, but still crisp. Heat a small dry nonstick skillet at medium heat and toast the sesame seeds for about one minute, stirring constantly, until lightly golden. Remove from skillet and set aside. In a small bowl, whisk the soy sauce, rice vinegar and sesame oil until well blended. Pour the dressing over the broccoli and mix well. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Serve warm or at room temperature.
