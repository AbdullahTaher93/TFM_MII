In a large pot over high heat, combine the chicken broth, carrot, celery, onion, potatoes, thyme, parsley, salt and ground black pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer mixture to a food processor or blender, puree until smooth and set aside. In the same pot over medium heat, saute the mushrooms and scallops in the butter or margarine for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the wine and reserved puree mixture to the pot, reduce heat to low and allow to simmer. In a separate small bowl, combine the egg yolk and heavy cream. Mix well and add to the soup. Continue simmering over low heat, stirring occasionally for 10 to 15 minutes.
