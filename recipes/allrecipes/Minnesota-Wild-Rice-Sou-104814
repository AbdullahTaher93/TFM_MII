Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in garlic, onion, and celery, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in flour, and cook for 3 minutes more. Pour in the vegetable broth, then bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in wild rice, carrot, almonds, and red pepper flakes; return to a simmer, and cook until the carrots are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in half and half, and cook until warmed through. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.
