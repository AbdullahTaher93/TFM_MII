In a large bowl, combine the biscuit mix, milk, onion and pepper sauce just until moistened. Stir in cheese, bacon and walnuts. Spread into a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 48-52 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely.
