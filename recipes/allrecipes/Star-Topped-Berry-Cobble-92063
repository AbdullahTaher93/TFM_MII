Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Heavily coat a 7- by 11-inch baking dish with oil or cooking oil spray. To make filling, in a medium-size bowl with a large rubber spatula, gently stir together strawberries, blackberries, sugar, cornstarch, and balsamic vinegar until combined. Pour into prepared pan. To make pastry topping, in a food processor or a bowl with an electric mixer, mix the flour, salt, brown sugar, and baking powder to combine. Add the butter and pulse or mix on low speed until the mixture is the size of large peas. Add cream and mix just until dough holds together. Gather dough into a ball. Flatten into a disk. On a lightly floured board, roll out dough to 1/2 inch thick. Using a 3-inch star-shaped or other shape cookie cutter, cut the dough into desired shapes. Top berries with as many pastry cutouts as desired. Sprinkle pastry with cinnamon sugar. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until juices are bubbling and pastry is lightly golden. Cool slightly before serving.
