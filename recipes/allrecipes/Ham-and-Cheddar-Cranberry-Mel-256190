Preheat heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-low heat. Butter one side of two slices of bread and then turn buttered side down. Top one slice with ham slices (5 ounces) and the other with cheese slices (3 ounces) and transfer to skillet face up and cook for 5-7 minutes or until bread is lightly browned and cheese is beginning to melt. Remove sandwich halves from skillet and transfer to cutting board and repeat for remaining sandwiches. Top ham side with cranberry sauce and greens and place cheese side of bread on top to finish sandwich and cut in half to serve. Best when it's hot and melty!
