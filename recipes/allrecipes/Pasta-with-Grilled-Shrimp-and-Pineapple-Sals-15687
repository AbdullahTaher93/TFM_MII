Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain. In a large bowl combine pineapple, red pepper, red onion, jalapeno pepper, orange juice, and lime juice. Mix well and set aside. Prepare an outdoor grill with an oiled rack set 6 inches from the coals. On a gas grill, place the setting to high. Grill the shrimp for 2 minutes per side. Toss the cooked noodles with the salsa. Arrange the shrimp on the pasta and serve.
