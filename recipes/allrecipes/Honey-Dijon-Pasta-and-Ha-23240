Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain. Meanwhile, combine sour cream, mustard and honey in small bowl; mix well. Set aside. Place ham and green onions in 12-inch nonstick skillet. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until ham is lightly browned (3 to 4 minutes). Add vegetables. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are crisply tender (5 to 7 minutes). Reduce heat to medium-low. Add cooked pasta and sour cream mixture; stir gently to coat. Cook until heated through (1 to 2 minutes).
