Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, and cook and stir onion and garlic until the garlic turns golden brown and smells toasty, about 6 minutes. Do not let garlic burn. Pour in the cannellini beans, diced tomatoes, and carrots, cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, uncover the pot, and allow the mixture to simmer until slightly thickened, 5 to 8 more minutes. Stir in the chicken and spinach, bring the mixture back to a boil, and mix in the escarole. Simmer until almost all the liquid is gone, about 10 minutes; turn off the heat, sprinkle with cheese, and cover; allow to stand for another 5 to 10 minutes to melt cheese.
