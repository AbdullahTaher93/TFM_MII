Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat; saute celery, carrots, onion, parsley, and bay leaf until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Add beef stock, chicken stock, turkey, salt, and pepper to vegetable mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover pot with a lid, and simmer until soup is heated through, about 15 minutes. Stir rotini into soup and cook until pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, about 15 minutes.
