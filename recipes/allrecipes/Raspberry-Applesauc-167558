Stir together applesauce and raspberries in a small microwavable bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave on High power until heated through, about 1 1/2 minutes. Stir gently to avoid breaking down the raspberries. (Alternatively, warm applesauce in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from the heat and stir in raspberries; let stand until they are thawed.)
