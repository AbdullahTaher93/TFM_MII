Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil; cook the macaroni at a boil until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain. Rinse with cold water to cool the macaroni to the touch; drain again. Stir the mayonnaise, Italian-style salad dressing, and mustard together in a large bowl. Add the cool macaroni, cucumber, tomato, bell pepper, green onion, salt, pepper, tuna, and egg; stir to evenly combine. Chill at least 4 hours before serving.
