Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, about 10 minutes. Whisk vinegar, peanut butter, mustard, miso, sesame oil, water, garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes together in a large bowl until dressing is smooth; stir in green onions. Mix steamed broccoli, carrots, and cilantro into dressing until evenly coated.
