Sprinkle gelatin over milk in a small saucepan; let stand 1 minute. Cook over low heat, stirring until gelatin dissolves (do not boil). Set aside to cool. Process 1 1/2 pints strawberries in a food processor, or until pureed, stopping to scrape down sides. Press strawberries through a fine wire-mesh strainer into a bowl, discarding solids. Stir cooled milk mixture into strawberry puree. Add SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and vanilla, stirring until SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener dissolves. Coat 4 (6-ounce) ramekins with cooking spray. Divide strawberry mixture evenly among ramekins. Cover each ramekin with plastic wrap; refrigerate 4 hours or overnight until panna cottas are set. Run a knife around the edge of each panna cotta and unmold onto serving plates. Serve with sliced strawberries.
