Sort cranberries and discard any soft or decayed fruit. Rinse and drain berries. Cut tangerines in quarters and pick out and discard seeds, if any. In a food processor, whirl cranberries, tangerines (including peel), ginger, lime juice, and honey until finely chopped. Spoon into a bowl and taste. Cranberries are meant to be tart, although if desired add more honey.
