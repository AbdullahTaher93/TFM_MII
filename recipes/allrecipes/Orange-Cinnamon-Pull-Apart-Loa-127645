Spray 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Stir pecans, sugar, 1 teaspoon orange peel, and cinnamon in small bowl. Cut rolls in half, toss with melted butter. Sprinkle with pecan mixture and toss to coat. Pour coated dough into prepared loaf pan. Cover with plastic wrap; let rise until double. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Bake loaf 45 to 50 minutes. Cover with foil during last 10 minutes of baking to prevent over browning. Cool 10 minutes. Remove from pan and place on wire rack to cool. Mix powdered sugar, 1/2 teaspoon orange peel and 1 tablespoon of the orange juice in medium bowl. Stir in just enough additional orange juice to make icing pourable. Drizzle over loaf.
