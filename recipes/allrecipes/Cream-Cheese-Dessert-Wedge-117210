Separate biscuits into 10 pieces; place in an ungreased 9-in. round baking dish. Press onto the bottom and 1 in. up the sides, pinching edges together to seal. Bake at 350 degrees F for 5-7 minutes or until slightly puffed. Meanwhile, in a small mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugar, egg and flour until smooth; pour over crust. Combine topping ingredients; sprinkle over filling. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until filling is set and crust is golden brown. Cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before cutting. Serve warm or chilled. Refrigerate leftovers.
