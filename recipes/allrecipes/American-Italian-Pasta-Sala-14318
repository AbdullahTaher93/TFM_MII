In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until al dente, rinse under cold water, and drain. In a medium bowl, combine mayonnaise, sour cream, milk and Italian dressing mix. Whisk together until smooth, set aside. In a large salad bowl combine cooked and cooled pasta, peas, olives, salami, green onions, celery and parsley. Mix in dressing last, reserving 1/2 cup. Let sit overnight in fridge. Stir before serving. Add extra dressing if pasta appears dry.
