Combine cranberries and port in a small bowl. Set aside. Slice tenderloin into medallions 1 1/2 inches thick. Place between 2 layers of plastic wrap, and pound the medallions with the bottom of a saucepan until they are 1/2 inch thick. Season both sides with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear medallions on one side until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn and sear on the other side for 4 to 5 minutes; turn medallions again and continue cooking until golden brown and no longer pink in the center, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove to a serving platter and cover loosely to keep warm. Add garlic to the pan and return to medium-high heat. Cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add port with cranberries, vinegar and sage leaves; cook for 1 minute, scraping skillet for browned bits. Pour in broth, swirl the pan and bring to a boil again. Continue cooking until sauce thickens and is reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Remove the garlic and sage. Season the sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon over the pork and serve.
