In a small bowl, combine the oil with the lime juice, ginger and sugar. Season with salt and white pepper and whisk until blended. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the soybeans and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain the soybeans and cool under running water. Remove the soybeans from their pods and pat dry with paper towels. In a large bowl, combine the soybeans with the chicken, avocados, scallions, celery and all but 1 tablespoon of the cilantro. Add the dressing and gently toss to combine, being careful not to mash the avocados. Mound the salad on plates, sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon of cilantro and serve.
