Place shrimp in a small bowl and cover with 1 cup very hot water. Let stand until soft, about 30 minutes. Do not discard water. Remove and discard bad outer leaves from bok choy; slice bok choy into 1 1/2-inch-by-1-inch pieces. Heat oil in wok over high heat. Add bok choy and stir-fry for 5 minutes. Add shrimp and soaking water and cook until heated through, about 3 more minutes. Add salt, mix well, and serve.
