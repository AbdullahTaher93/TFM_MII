Place eggs, water and oil into blender container. Cover and process by pulsing several times. Add pancake mix. Process until smooth. Coat a crepe pan or 8-inch non-stick skillet with no-stick cooking spray. Heat pan over medium-low heat. Remove pan from heat and pour 2 to 3 tablespoons batter into center of pan. Quickly rotate pan, tilting to coat the surface. Cook until center and edges appear dry and lightly browned. Turn to brown second side. Turn out crepe onto a plate. Repeat with remaining batter to make a total of 10 (6 to 7-inch) crepes. Beat mascarpone and mocha cappuccino spread in medium bowl, with an electric mixer, until smooth. Spread 3 tablespoons filling over crepe. Cut crepe in half. Roll each half of crepe, pivoting at center point, to form a cone. Repeat process with remaining crepes. Overlap two crepe cones on dessert plate. Create a mound of whipped cream next to crepes, garnish with raspberries and sprinkle with cocoa powder. Serve immediately.
