In a medium saucepan, heat the 1/4 cup oil and garlic. Cover and cook over low heat for 5 minutes, or until the garlic is softened. Add the beans, sage, salt, and red pepper. Cover and cook for 12 minutes, or until the beans are softened. Uncover and cook for about 8 minutes, mashing the mixture occasionally with the back of a large spoon. The mixture should be a coarse puree. Transfer to a bowl. Serve immediately or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. If mixture is too thick after refrigeration, stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons of warm water. Cut off the end crusts of the bread and reserve for bread crumbs. Cut the loaf into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Cut the larger slices in half to make pieces that are approximately 2 inches square. Place on a large baking sheet. Broil 6 inches from the heat source for about 2 minutes, just to dry. Remove from the broiler. Turn pieces over. Spray lightly with olive oil from a mister or coat lightly with a pastry brush dipped in oil. Return to the broiler and cook for about 1 minute, or until the oil is sizzling. Remove. Spread with the bean mixture. Sprinkle with the parsley.
