Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a shallow bowl, mix the peanuts, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt-free herb seasoning blend. Dip the chicken thighs in the melted butter, then press into the peanuts to coat. Arrange on a baking sheet. Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until chicken juices run clear.
