Press peppercorns into both sides of steaks. In a wide frying pan, melt butter with oil over medium-high heat. Add steaks and cook, turning once, until well browned on both sides and cooked to desired doneness (6 to 8 minutes total for medium-rare). Lift steaks from pan and place on a warm platter; keep warm. With pan off heat, add warmed brandy; set aflame (not beneath an exhaust fan or near flammable items), shaking pan until flames die. Add cream to pan, return to heat, and boil, stirring often, until sauce is reduced by about half and slightly thickened. Season to taste with salt. Pour sauce over steaks.
