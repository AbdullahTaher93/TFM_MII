Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking dish. Microwave chocolate and butter together in a large microwave-safe bowl in 10 second increments until chocolate is melted, about 2 minutes. Stir sugar, pumpkin, applesauce, stevia, and vanilla into chocolate mixture. Add flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt to chocolate mixture; stir in chocolate chips. Pour batter into prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in center of dish comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool on a rack for 20 minutes.
