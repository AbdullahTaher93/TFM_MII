Combine baby carrots, mushrooms, cumin, and coriander in a pot. Pour enough water into pot to just cover the mixture. Bring to a boil and cook until carrots are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain mixture and transfer to a large bowl. Stir garlic and lemon juice together in a small bowl; drizzle over carrot mixture. Stir to evenly coat.
