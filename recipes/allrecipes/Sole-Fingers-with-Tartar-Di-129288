Heat the oven to 425 degrees F. Using scissors or a sharp knife, cut the fish fillets across into 2 1/2-inch x 3/4-inch strips. Season the flour and spread on a plate. Put the egg on another plate, and mix the bread crumbs with the sesame seeds on a third plate. Toss the fish strips in the seasoned flour, shaking off any excess. Dip each strip into the egg and, finally, coat all over with the crumbs. Brush a large nonstick baking sheet with the olive oil and lay the fish strips on the sheet in one layer. Bake 5 minutes. Turn the strips over and bake until the fish fingers are crisp and pale golden, about 5 minutes longer. Meanwhile, make the tartar dip. Stir all the ingredients together, then spoon into 4 small bowls. Serve the fish fingers with the dip.
