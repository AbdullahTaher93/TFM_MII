Place the potatoes, onion, butter, chicken bouillon cubes, parsley and water into a slow cooker. Set on low and let cook for 6 to 8 hours. At least half an hour before serving, stir together the milk and flour until no lumps remain, and mix into the soup. Cook for 30 minutes or until the soup is thickened.
