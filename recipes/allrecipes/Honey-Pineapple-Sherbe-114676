Drain pineapple, reserving the juice; set pineapple aside. In a saucepan, combine honey and pineapple juice. Bring to a boil, stirring several times. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Cool completely. Stir in yogurt, vanilla and pineapple. Pour into a 9-in. square freezer-proof dish. Cover and freeze for 2 hours, stirring every 30 minutes until slushy. Transfer to a mixing bowl; beat for 1-2 minutes. Return to pan; cover and freeze until firm. Remove from the freezer 10-15 minutes before serving. Garnish with raspberries and mint if desired.
