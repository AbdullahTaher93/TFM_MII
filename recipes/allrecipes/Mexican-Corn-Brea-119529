In a bowl, combine corn bread mix and onion. Combine the remaining ingredients; add to the corn bread mixture just until moistened. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50--55 minutes or until lightly browned and the edges pull away from sides of pan. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.
