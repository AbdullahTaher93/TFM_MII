Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Brush butter over Brussels sprouts and season with garlic powder, black pepper, and seasoned salt. Place sprouts on the preheated grill and cook until tender and grill marks appear, about 10 minutes. Squeeze lime juice over sprouts before removing from grill.
