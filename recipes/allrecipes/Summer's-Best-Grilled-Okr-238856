Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Prepare a grill basket with cooking spray. Trim stem ends of okra close to the top without piercing the pods; put into a large bowl. Drizzle canola oil over okra pods. Season okra with garlic powder, salt, and pepper; toss to coat. Spread okra into the prepared grill basket. Cook on preheated grill, turning frequently, until tender and browned in spots, 4 to 6 minutes.
