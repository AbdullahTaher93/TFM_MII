Remove fat from steak and score both sides by cutting 1/4 inch deep diagonal slices forming a diamond pattern. Mash garlic with salt. Add soy sauce, tomato paste, oil, pepper and oregano. Mix well and rub into steak. Wrap in waxed paper and let stand in refrigerator 5 to 6 hours, or overnight. Broil or barbecue to desired degree of doneness.
