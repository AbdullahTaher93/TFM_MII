Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a 9x13 inch baking pan, mix rice, fruit, onion, sugar and salt. Pour in water. Arrange chicken parts over the rice mixture. In a small bowl, mix butter, curry powder and paprika. Brush butter mixture over chicken pieces. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil. Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, until chicken juices run clear and rice is tender.
