In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the oil, onions, carrot, parsnip, celery, potato and leek. Stir well for 5 minutes, or until onion is translucent. Add the lentils, tomatoes with liquid, stock, bay leaves, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce and wine. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes or until lentils are tender. Remove the bay leaves and add the fresh coriander or fresh parsley to taste.
