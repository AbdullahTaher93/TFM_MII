In a large pot over high heat, combine the water, potatoes, bouillon, celery and onion. Bring to a boil and cook until soft. Reduce heat to low and use a masher to mash down the potato mixture in the pot to desired consistency. Add the soup and lightly whisk, until smooth. Add the cheese a little at a time, stirring often, until melted.
