Place bok choy in a large bowl; add 1/4 cup pickling salt and stir; cover with an upside-down plate. Let salted cabbage sit until softened and liquid has been released, 2 to 3 days. Rinse cabbage in a colander and drain. Transfer cabbage to a clean bowl; add 1/4 cup pickling salt, Korean chile powder, green onions, carrots, serrano chile peppers, garlic, fish sauce, and ginger and mix well. Pack cabbage mixture into clean jars to within 1 inch of the top. Tightly secure lids onto each jar. Refrigerate until flavors have had time to merge and cabbage has fermented, at least 2 weeks.
