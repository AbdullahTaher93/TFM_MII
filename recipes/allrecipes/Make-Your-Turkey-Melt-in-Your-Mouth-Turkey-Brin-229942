Combine chicken broth and apple juice in a food-safe container large enough to hold your turkey and the brine ingredients. Squeeze juice from orange halves and drop spent orange halves into the broth mixture; add celery, onion, rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, and sage leaves to the mixture. Stir salt, poultry seasoning, and black pepper into the liquid to dissolve.
