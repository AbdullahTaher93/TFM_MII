Place brisket in the crock of a slow cooker. Pour beef stock over brisket. Place pickling spices, garlic, and bay leaves into a cheesecloth bag, tie the bag, and submerge it into the stock. Cook on Low for 8 hours. Remove brisket to a cutting board; cut into small pieces. Strain cooking liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. Discard spices and any strained pieces. Combine brisket, chicken stock, strained beef stock, and cabbage in the slow cooker crock. Cook on Low until cabbage is tender, about 2 1/2 hours.
