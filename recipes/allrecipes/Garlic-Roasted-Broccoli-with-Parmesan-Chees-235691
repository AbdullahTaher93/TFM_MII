Preheat your oven to 425 degrees F. Wash the broccoli and cut it into bite-sized pieces. Place the broccoli on a large rimmed baking sheet. Mince the garlic and toss it in with the broccoli. Drizzle 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil over the broccoli, then season with coarse black pepper and kosher salt. Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes until the broccoli is tender. Toss in lemon juice, parmesan cheese, and 1 tablespoon olive oil; serve immediately.
