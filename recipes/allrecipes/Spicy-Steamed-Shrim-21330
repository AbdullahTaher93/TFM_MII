In a large pot, bring 1 quart of water to a boil. Place shrimp in a steamer basket and place on top of the pot; cover. Do not submerge shrimp. Remove some water if necessary. Season the shrimp with Old Bay seasoning. Steam shrimp until pink. Eat by removing shells as you go and dipping in cocktail sauce.
