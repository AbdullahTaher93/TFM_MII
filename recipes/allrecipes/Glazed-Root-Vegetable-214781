Spread the turnips, carrots, parsnips, and sweet potatoes in a single layer into the bottom of a large skillet. Pour enough water over the vegetables to cover, but not completely submerge; add the sugar and balsamic vinegar. Place the skillet over medium-high heat; bring the liquid to a boil. Cook and stir until the liquid is evaporated and the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to serve.
