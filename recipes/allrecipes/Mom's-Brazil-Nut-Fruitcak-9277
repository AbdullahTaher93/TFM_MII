Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease one 9x5 inch loaf pan. Sift the flour, white sugar, baking powder, and salt together. Mix in the nuts, dates, and cherries. Beat the eggs until foamy, add the vanilla and the flour mixture. Stir until just combined and pour into the prepared pan. Bake at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for 1 hour and 45 minutes. Store in the refrigerator, wrapped in foil.
