Preheat oven to 475 degrees F. Combine first 5 ingredients in a large bowl. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon salt over apple mixture; toss well to coat. Spread apple mixture on a jelly-roll pan coated with cooking spray. Sprinkle chicken with 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper; arrange on top of apple mixture. Bake at 475 degrees F for 25 minutes or until chicken is done and apple is tender. Remove chicken from pan; set aside, and keep warm. Partially mash apple mixture with a potato masher; serve with chicken. Sprinkle with parsley, if desired.
