In a medium bowl, combine the water with the sugar, sake, miso, soy sauce, vinegar, cornstarch and chile-garlic sauce. Heat a large, deep skillet for 2 minutes. Add the oil and heat until smoking. Add the green beans and scallions and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until just tender and browned in spots, about 6 minutes. Stir the sauce mixture, add it to the beans and bring to a boil. Cook until the sauce is glossy and slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Stir in the sesame oil. Transfer the beans to a platter and garnish with the sesame seeds. Serve with the tortilla wedges for wrapping.
