Combine water and lentils in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover saucepan, and simmer for 15 minutes. Add carrots, onion, jalapeno pepper, and garlic to lentils; cook until lentils are tender, about 15 minutes more. Remove saucepan from heat and slightly cool lentil mixture. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease an oven-proof wire rack. Mix bread crumbs, eggs, olive oil, salt, and Italian seasoning in a bowl; add lentil mixture and stir until well combined. Form mixture into 6 to 8 patties and place on the prepared wire rack; refrigerate for 15 minutes. Place wire rack with patties onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until burgers are firm, about 20 minutes.
