Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Soften the butter and blend with the almond meal, cocoa powder and Splenda. Whisk together the powdered egg whites and water. Be patient as it takes a little while to dissolve. Add to the almond mixture. Blend well. Press dough into a 9 inch pie pan. It will be gooey, but just get a general shape. Then pop it into the freezer for about 5-10 minutes (or the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes) and then remove and finish shaping the crust. It should be much easier to shape now. Bake at 350 degrees F for about 12 minutes. Allow to cool completely before filling. Pull the ice cream out of the freezer while the pie shell is cooling. Just when soft enough to work with, gently spoon into the crust. Using a spatula, smooth off the top. Cover and freeze for 1 hour or longer. Cut into 8 slices.
