Remove eggs from the refrigerator 10 minutes prior to cooking to reduce the risk of the shells cracking. Place eggs in a saucepan and cover cold water by 1-inch. Bring water to a boil, remove from heat, stir eggs, cover the saucepan, and set aside until eggs are hard-boiled, about 11 minutes. Fill a bowl with ice water. Transfer eggs to ice water and cool for 10 minutes, adding more ice as needed. Remove eggs from ice water and peel.
