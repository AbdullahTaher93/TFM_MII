Combine lettuce, corn, and bell pepper in a medium-size bowl. Cover and chill until serving time. In another small bowl, mix together salsa, avocado, onion, and lime juice. Cover and chill until serving time. Rinse scallops well. Pat them between paper towels until they are completely dry. Pour flour into a small shallow dish. Pour the egg white into another small dish, and pour the crumbs into a third dish. One at a time, dip each scallop into flour and turn to coat all sides. Then dip into egg white, turning to coat. Finally, roll scallops in crumbs to coat. Place coated scallops on a plate. Pour oil into a 10- to 12-inch heavy frying pan over high heat. When pan is very hot and oil just begins to smoke, add scallops. Cook, turning once, until scallops are golden brown on both sides, 30 to 40 seconds per side. Watch carefully as they can scorch easily. When scallops are browned, transfer them to a small baking pan. Bake scallops in a 400 degrees F oven just until they are no longer translucent in the center (cut to test), 3 to 5 minutes. While scallops are baking, combine lettuce mixture with salsa dressing and mix well. Divide salad between two serving plates. Top equally with hot scallops and serve immediately. If desired, slice leftover avocado and place on top of salads.
