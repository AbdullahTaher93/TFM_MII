Prick potato skins with a fork and cook on high for 13 to 15 minutes or until soft. Set aside. Season chops with 2 tablespoons of jerk seasoning and arrange in a 3-quart microwavable dish with bones facing outward. In a large bowl, mix pineapple (with half of juice), pepper, scallions, brown sugar, and vinegar. Pour evenly over chops. Cover tightly with microwave-safe plastic wrap and cook on high for 6 minutes. Rotate chops and scatter black beans in dish. Re-cover and cook on high for 5 to 6 minutes or until chops are barely pink in center (145 degrees F on instant-read thermometer). Cut each potato in half and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and remaining jerk seasoning. Serve alongside pork chop.
