Cut garlic head in half crosswise. In a square 8- to 9-inch pan, smear oil in a small area and set garlic halves, cut side down, on oiled section. Bake in a 375 degrees F oven until garlic is soft when pressed and cut sides are browned, about 40 minutes. Let garlic cool. Use or, if making ahead, cover and chill up to 1 day. Squeeze garlic cloves from skin; discard skin. In a bowl, mash cloves or garlic smoothly; then add ricotta cheese, gorgonzola cheese, chives, basil, parsley, and rosemary, and mix well. Add salt to taste. Use, or chill airtight up to 1 day.
