Place the fillets in a shallow 2-qt. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle with lemon juice and pepper. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Meanwhile, in a small skillet, saute the mushrooms and garlic in butter until tender. Add shrimp; cook for 2-4 minutes or until shrimp turn pink. Spoon over fish. Sprinkle with onion.
