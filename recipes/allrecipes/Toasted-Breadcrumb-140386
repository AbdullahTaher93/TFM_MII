Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Using tongs, place bread slices directly on oven racks. Leave in oven until hard and golden brown, about 30 minutes; darker if you prefer. Remove and cool on wire rack. Crumble slices into a large bowl until reduced to fine crumbs, or place in bowl of food processor and process until fine.
