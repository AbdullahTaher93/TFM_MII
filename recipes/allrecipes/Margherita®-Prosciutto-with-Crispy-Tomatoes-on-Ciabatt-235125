To make the garlic aioli, combine the mashed garlic, oregano, lemon juice, mayonnaise, and olive oil. Stir until well mixed, or beat with a small whisk. Season to taste with salt and pepper. In small or medium mixing bowl, combine grated Parmesan cheese and polenta, then distribute evenly on separate plate. Place sliced tomatoes in the polenta-parmesan mixture, covering both sides to coat. Heat small or medium frying pan to low heat, add a dash olive oil to pan, then add tomatoes. Fry for 1-2 minutes on each side until light brown and crispy, then remove from heat. Toast the sliced ciabatta roll in the frying pan until edges become crispy, about 1 minute, then remove from heat. Spread 2 tablespoons garlic aioli to the bottom slice of ciabatta bread. Add baby arugula then polenta-parmesan crusted tomatoes. Top with sliced Margherita(R) Prosciutto, close with top half of bread and serve.
