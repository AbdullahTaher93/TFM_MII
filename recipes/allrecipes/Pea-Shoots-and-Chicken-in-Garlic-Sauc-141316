Toss the strips of chicken breast with the cornstarch in a mixing bowl. Sprinkle with the sesame oil and toss until evenly mixed. Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in the chicken and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant. Stir in the pea shoots just until wilted; pour in the chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Cook and stir a few minutes until the chicken broth has thickened. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
