Add oil in a 10 to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat. Add ground beef, onions, and garlic and heat until meat is cooked through and browned, about 5 to 7 minutes. Drain any excess fat and stir in rice and pine nuts; cook, stirring often, until rice and pine nuts are pale golden (4 to 5 minutes). Add broth, apricots, and cinnamon. Increase heat to high and bring mixture to a boil. Then reduce heat, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until rice is tender to bite (about 15 minutes). Stir in parsley. Season to taste with salt.
