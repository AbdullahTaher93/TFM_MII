Combine broth and water in a medium soup pot over high heat. Rub the chicken breasts with olive oil, then season with salt. When water reaches a slow boil, lay the chicken breasts side by side in pot. Reduce heat so the liquid is just boiling and cover pot. Cook 10 minutes, then turn off heat and check to see if the chicken is done. (It should no longer be pink inside.) Cool the chicken, then tear it into bite-size shreds. In a medium bowl, whisk together the chicken broth, mustard, and oil. Add the chicken, celery, apples, and capers. Toss them together until well-combined. Season to taste. Serve cold.
