Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Melt margarine in a small saucepan or microwave. Brush a 10-inch (25 cm) pie plate with margarine. To remaining margarine, stir in onion and seasonings. Arrange 1/3 of the potato slices in a circular pattern in pie plate. Spoon 1/3 of the margarine mixture over top, spreading out onions as best you can. Repeat layers two more times. Cover and bake 30 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until potatoes are tender and crispy brown around the outside edge, about 30 more minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving. Cut into wedges.
