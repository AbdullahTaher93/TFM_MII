In a mixing bowl, combine the eggs, sugar, buttermilk, mayonnaise and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda and salt; add to egg mixture and beat just until combined. Fold in apples, raisins and walnuts. Spoon into two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 375 degrees F for 1 hour or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely.
