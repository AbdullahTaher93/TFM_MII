Wash and dry each tomato slice. Sprinkle cornmeal on a piece of wax paper or a large flat surface. Dip each tomato slice into the cornmeal and pat gently until cornmeal covers the surface; turn slice over and coat the other side. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add tomato slices, and fry for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until golden brown. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot.
