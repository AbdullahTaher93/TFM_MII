In a wok or large nonstick skillet, warm the oil over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp and stir-fry until they are opaque. Remove the shrimp and set aside. Add the carrots, celery, water chestnuts, garlic, and gingerroot to the wok, and stir-fry until the vegetables are crisp-tender. Return the shrimp to the wok and add the hoisin sauce, tamari or soy sauce, and the vinegar. Cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Divide the shrimp mixture among the 8 lettuce leaves. Roll each leaf around the filling and serve. Garnish with the pine nuts or peanuts, if desired.
