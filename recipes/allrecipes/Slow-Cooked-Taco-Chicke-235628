Season the chicken with the salt and black pepper. Place the chicken into a 6-quart slow cooker. Add the onions and broth. Cover and cook on HIGH for 4 to 5 hours or until the chicken is fork-tender. Using 2 forks, shred the chicken. Stir in the tomato paste. Spoon about 1/3 cup chicken mixture in the center of each tortilla. Top with the lettuce, sour cream, cheese, salsa and/or guacamole, if desired. Fold the tortillas around the filling.
