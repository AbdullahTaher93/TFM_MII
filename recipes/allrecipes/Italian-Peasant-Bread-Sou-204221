Preheat oven to 275 degrees F. Cut bread into 3 strips; cut each strip into thirds, making 9 cubes. Place bread cubes in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake 15 minutes or until very crisp. Set bread aside to cool. Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven. Add onion, carrot, celery and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are quite tender, about 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in remaining ingredients, except crisp bread cubes and Parmesan cheese. Heat to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 25 to 30 minutes. To serve, ladle soup into individual serving bowls and top each with crisp bread cubes. Top with shredded Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.
