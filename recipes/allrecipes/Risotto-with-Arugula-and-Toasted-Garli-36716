Bring broth to a simmer in a small saucepan (do not boil). Keep broth warm over low heat. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic; saute 3 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove garlic with a slotted spoon; set aside. Add rice and onion to pan; saute 5 minutes. Add wine, salt, and pepper; cook 1 minute or until wine is nearly absorbed, stirring constantly. Add warm broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly until each portion of broth is absorbed before adding the next (about 20 minutes total). Remove from heat; stir in garlic and arugula.
