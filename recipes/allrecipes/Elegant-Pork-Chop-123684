In a skillet, brown the pork chops on both sides in oil over medium heat; set aside. In an ungreased 8-in. square baking dish, combine the soup, milk, rice and seasonings; mix well. Top with pork chops. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes or until meat is tender. Uncover and bake 5 minutes longer. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
