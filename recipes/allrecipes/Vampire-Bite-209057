Combine the flour, baking soda and cinnamon in a medium bowl; set aside. Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add the egg; beat well. Slowly add the flour mixture into the dough until blended. Add enough food coloring to tint the dough a bright red. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 2 hours. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line the cookie sheet pans with the parchment paper. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness. Use a cookie cutter to cut out 24 lip shapes. Otherwise, you can form the dough into 24 balls and flatten each slightly to create free-form shaped lips using your hands to pinch and shape the dough. Transfer these to the prepared cookie sheets. Re-roll the scraps if necessary. Sprinkle the cookies with red sugar. Bake 7 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from the oven, and immediately press a MILKY WAY Bar into the center of each cookie. Cool completely. Use vanilla frosting to pipe fangs over the candy.
