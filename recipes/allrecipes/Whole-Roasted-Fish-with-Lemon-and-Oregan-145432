Preheat grill or broiler to medium-high and coat rack lightly with cooking spray. Whisk together oil, lemon juice, oregano, pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt in small bowl. Set aside. Make 3 shallow vertical slits along each side of fish and rub with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Brush inside of fish with oil mixture and stuff with garlic and lemon slices. Grill fish 16 to 20 minutes, turning and basting twice with remaining oil mixture, until fish is golden brown and flesh begins to turn opaque. Let fish rest 10 minutes before serving.
