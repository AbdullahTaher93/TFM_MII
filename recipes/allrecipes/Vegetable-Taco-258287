Heat olive oil and chili powder in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in scallion and garlic; cook for 1 minute. Add tomato and garbanzo beans; cook and stir until tomato begins to break down, about 5 minutes. Season mixture with hot sauce. Stir spinach into the skillet; cook until bright green and wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Spoon tomato and spinach mixture over the tortilla wraps. Garnish with Mexican-style cheese and almonds. Squeeze fresh lime juice on top.
