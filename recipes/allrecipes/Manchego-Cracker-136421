Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, beat butter, cheese, salt, and cayenne with an electric mixer until combined. Gradually stir in flour until just incorporated. Add rice cereal; mix to combine. Form rounded tablespoons of dough into disks, 1 1/2 inches across. Arrange on baking sheets, about 2 inches apart. Bake until golden brown around the edges, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve, or store in an airtight container up to 5 days.
