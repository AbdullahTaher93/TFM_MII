Insert wooden pop sticks (from bag of caramels) into stem end of each apple. Cover large plate with wax paper; grease paper with butter. Set aside. Place caramels in large saucepan. Add water; cook on medium-low heat until caramels are completely melted, stirring constantly. Dip apples into melted caramel until evenly coated, spooning caramel over apples if necessary. Allow excess caramel to drip off. Scrape bottoms of apples, then place on prepared plate. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or until ready to serve. Remove from refrigerator and let stand at room temperature 15 min. before serving. Store leftover dipped apples in refrigerator.
