Heat water in a 6-quart pot over high heat; add potatoes, turkey ham, onion, beans, carrots, celery, frozen corn, cream-style corn, dill, salt, and black pepper. Bring water to a boil, lower heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender and soup is reduced, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Remove pot from heat and stir in milk until incorporated and soup is creamy.
