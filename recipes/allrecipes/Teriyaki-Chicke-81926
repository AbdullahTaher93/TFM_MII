Cut chicken into strips or bite-sized cubes. Put in a large re-sealable plastic bag with 1 cup of the marinade. Squish it around to be sure that all pieces are coated well. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes but 2 hours is better. Julienne the vegetables. In a wok or a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. To protect yourself from splatter, use a kitchen mitt or cover your hand loosely with a kitchen towel or dampened paper towel. Using tongs, remove the chicken pieces from the bag and carefully place in the wok. Discard the marinade. Stir fry for about 2-3 minutes. Add the vegetables and stir fry for another 2-3 minutes. Add a Tbsp of fresh marinade sauce. Stir and serve immediately.
