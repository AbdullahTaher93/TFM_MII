Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Combine cracker crumbs and butter in a large bowl to make the crust. Press into bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Beat cream cheese with an electric mixer until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. Add sour cream, flour, onion, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and black pepper; beat until blended. Spread 1/4 of the cream cheese mixture over crust. Sprinkle shredded carrots on top. Repeat layers with remaining cream cheese mixture, broccoli, and red bell pepper, ending with cream cheese mixture on top. Bake in the preheated oven until set and golden, about 1 hour. Turn off oven, open door partially, and leave cheesecake in the oven as it cools, at least 1 hour. Let cool completely, about 1 hour more. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator. Combine yogurt, mayonnaise, 1/2 cup cucumber, dill, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl; mix until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and chill until serving. Slice chilled cheesecake and serve garnished with remaining chopped cucumber and cucumber sauce.
