To make streusel topping: In a medium bowl, mix together 3/4 cup flour and 3/4 cup brown sugar. Cut in 6 tablespoons butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking for 35 to 40 minutes, or until filling is bubbling and streusel is golden brown. Allow to cool for at least 1 hour. While the pie is cooling, prepare the vanilla sauce. In the top of a double boiler over medium heat, whisk together eggs, half-and-half and 1/2 cup sugar. Cook, stirring constantly, until sauce has thickened. Remove from heat, and stir in vanilla. Spoon sauce (warm or cooled) over slices of pie.
