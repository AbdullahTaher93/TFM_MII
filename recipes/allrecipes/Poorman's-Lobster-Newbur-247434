Combine shrimp soup and cream cheese in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook, stirring constantly, until the cream cheese has melted and sauce starts to bubble, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in sherry. Cook, stirring constantly, until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and keep warm. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Season monkfish fillets with salt and black pepper. Place in a shallow baking dish. Bake monkfish in the preheated oven until flesh flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer monkfish to serving plates. Serve topped with sauce and garnished with parsley.
