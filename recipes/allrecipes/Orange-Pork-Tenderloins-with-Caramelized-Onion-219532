Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork and cook until well browned on all sides. Remove the pork from the skillet. Heat the remaining oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 15 minutes or until well browned, stirring often. Stir the picante sauce, marmalade and orange zest in the skillet. Return the pork to the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 10 minutes or until the pork is cooked through.
