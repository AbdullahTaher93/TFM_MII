In a saucepan, mix together cream and flour. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is thickened. Remove from heat and cool. Using an electric mixer, beat in the butter, confectioners' sugar and vanilla. Continue to beat on high speed for 6 minutes, or until frosting reaches spreading consistency.
