Add onion, red bell pepper, and green bell pepper to the sausages; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer sausage mixture to a bowl. Stir blue cheese dressing and hot sauce into the sausage mixture, assuring the sausage slices are coated in sauce. Make a bed of spinach in each hoagie roll. Top spinach with the sausage mixture.
