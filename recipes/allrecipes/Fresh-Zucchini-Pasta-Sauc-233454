Mix zucchini and garlic together in a large bowl; stir in olive oil and salt. Set aside for flavors to blend, about 1 hour. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and add to zucchini mixture. Toss to combine and slightly cook the zucchini.
