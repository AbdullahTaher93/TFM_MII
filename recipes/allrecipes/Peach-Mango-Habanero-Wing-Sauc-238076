Blend mango, peach, and habanero peppers in a food processor or blender until smooth. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add mango mixture, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, ginger, salt, and pepper; reduce heat to low and simmer until sauce is smooth and slightly thickened, about 8 minutes.
