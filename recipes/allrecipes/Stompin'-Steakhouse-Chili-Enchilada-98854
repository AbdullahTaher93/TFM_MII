In a 10-inch skillet, stir 1 cup enchilada sauce with 1/2 cup water until boiling; remove from heat. Dip both sides of a tortilla in sauce for about 10 seconds. Place on work surface and spoon 1/3 cup chili across the center. Top with 1/4 cup cheese. Roll up tightly and put seam side down in a greased 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas, chili and cheese. Stir 1/4 cup water into remaining enchilada sauce. Spoon over enchiladas. Sprinkle remaining cheese over the top. (If not serving immediately, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.) Bake uncovered in a preheated 350 degrees F oven for 20 minutes (25 minutes, if refrigerated). Garnish with sour cream and sliced avocado, if desired.
