Pat steak with spice blend to coat both sides evenly. Heat a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat. When pan is very hot, add steak. Cook, turning occasionally, until meat is well browned on the outside and done to your liking (about 14 minutes for medium-rare). Meanwhile, in a blender or food processor, combine salsa, sour cream, and lime juice; whirl until smooth. Arrange spinach, beans, and peppers attractively in a large serving bowl. When meat is done, cut it into thin bite-size slices; add to salad. At the table, pour dressing over salad and, using 2 spoons, mix lightly to coat with dressing. Season to taste with pepper.
