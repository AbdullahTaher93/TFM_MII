Cut steak crosswise into 2 or 3 equal pieces. Prepare barbecue for direct heat cooking. When grill is medium-hot (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds), place steak on barbecue. Cook, turning as needed to brown evenly, until meat is pink in center of thickest part; cut to test (7 to 10 minutes). Meanwhile, in a shallow 9-inch pan on grill, combine butter, mustard, vermouth, and Worcestershire. Stir occasionally until butter is melted, then move pan to side of grill to keep warm. Set cooked steak in pan, slice on the diagonal, and stir meat juices into sauce. Divide watercress among plates and top with meat; spoon sauce over each serving.
