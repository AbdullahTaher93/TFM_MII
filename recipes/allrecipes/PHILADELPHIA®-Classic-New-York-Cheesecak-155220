Preheat oven to 325 degrees F if using a silver 9-inch springform pan (or to 300 degrees F if using a dark nonstick 9-inch springform pan). Mix crumbs, 3 tablespoons sugar and the butter; press onto bottom of pan. Bake 10 minutes. Beat cream cheese, 1 cup sugar, the flour and vanilla with electric mixer until well blended. Add sour cream; mix well. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed after each addition just until blended. Pour over crust. Bake 1 hour 10 minutes or until center is almost set. Run knife or metal spatula around rim of pan to loosen cake; cool before removing rim. Refrigerate 4 hours or overnight. Arrange fruit on cheesecake just before serving; brush with jam. Store leftovers in refrigerator.
