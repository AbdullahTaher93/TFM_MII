Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 13 inch X 9 inch baking dish with cooking spray. Combine the apples and applesauce in the prepared baking dish. In a small bowl, combine the oats, wheat germ, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Add the oil and butter. Mix with your fingers to form crumbs. Sprinkle the oat mixture evenly over the apples. Bake for 30 minutes, or until the topping is golden and the apples are bubbling.
