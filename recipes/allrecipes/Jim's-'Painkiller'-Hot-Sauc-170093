Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, onion, and carrots. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent and the carrot has softened, about 5 minutes. Scrape into a blender, and add the habanero peppers, jalapeno peppers, tomatoes, oregano, parsley, salt, pepper, and vinegar. Blend until smooth and pour back into the saucepan. Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat and cook 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside until cool; pour into a bottle and refrigerate.
