In a large bowl, combine flour, crumbs and baking powder. In another bowl, beat eggs, honey, oil, orange juice and peel. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in apple, dates and apricots. Spoon into three greased 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely.
