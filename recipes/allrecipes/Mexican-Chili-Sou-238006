Heat oil in a large pot over high heat; saute rump roast until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Add onions and garlic; saute until onions are softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir chili powder, cumin, coriander, cayenne pepper, and bay leaves into meat and vegetables; cook and stir until meat and vegetables are coated in seasonings, about 2 minutes. Add beef stock, enchilada sauce, green chile peppers, and tomato paste; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover pot, and simmer until meat is tender, about 50 minutes. Stir pinto beans into soup, mashing beans to thicken if desired; simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes.
