Heat the butter and olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and saute the garlic and shallots until lightly browned. Stir in shrimp, and season with salt, pepper, and red pepper. Mix in sun-dried tomatoes. Cook and stir 5 minutes, or until shrimp is opaque and lightly browned. Pour cognac into the skillet, and stir to loosen browned bits from bottom. Reduce heat to low, and stir in half-and-half. Simmer 5 minutes, or until slightly thickened.
