Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roast peppers in preheated oven until nearly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove and discard seeds and stems from peppers. Transfer peppers to a food processor. Blend peppers and 2 tablespoons milk in the food processor until smooth. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat until bubbly. Stir flour into the melted butter; cook until the mixture starts to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the pepper mixture to the flour mixture. Begin whisking milk into the mixture; cook, whisking regularly, until it begins to thicken, thinning with additional milk as needed. Season with salt and paprika. Sprinkle cilantro over the sauce to serve.
