To cut pork roast into a large rectangle that can be filled and rolled, cut lengthwise about 1/2 inch from top of pork to within 1/2 inch of opposite edge; open flat. Repeat with other side of pork, cutting from the inside edge to the outer edge; open flat to form rectangle. Sprinkle apricots, nuts, garlic, salt and pepper over pork to within 1 inch of edge. Tightly roll up pork, beginning with short side. Secure with toothpicks, or tie with string. Pierce pork all over with metal skewer. Brush apricot nectar over entire surface. Let stand 15 minutes. Brush again with remaining apricot nectar. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours but no longer than 24 hours. Heat oven to 325 . Place pork, fat side up, on rack in shallow roasting pan.
