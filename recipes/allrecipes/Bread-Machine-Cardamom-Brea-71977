Place ingredients into the pan of your bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select the Dough cycle and press Start. When the bread machine indicates that the cycle has ended, remove the dough, and knead slightly. Form into a loaf shape, and place into a greased 9x5 inch bread pan. Cover, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Uncover the loaf, and brush the top with water. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until nicely browned, and the loaf makes a hollow sound when tapped on the bottom. Allow to cool for 10 minutes before removing from the pan. Cool for about 1 hour before slicing.
