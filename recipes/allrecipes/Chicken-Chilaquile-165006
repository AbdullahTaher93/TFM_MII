Tortilla strips may be cooked on a griddle or fried in oil until crisp. Set aside. (Tip: If you prefer, bake tortilla strips in the oven until crisp.) Saute onion and garlic in an oiled skillet until translucent, approximately 4 minutes. Puree the cooked onion and garlic along with the tomato sauce, chilies and bouillon cube in a blender. Place the blended mixture in a skillet, bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Add tortilla strips and chicken to the skillet mixture and heat through, approximately 2 minutes. Serve with optional toppings.
