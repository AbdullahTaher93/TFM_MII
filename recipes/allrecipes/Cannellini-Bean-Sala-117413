Cut red pepper in half; remove seeds. Place pepper halves cut side down on a rack in a broiler pan. Broil 4 in. from the heat until skin blisters, about 8 minutes. Immediately place peppers in a bowl; cover and let stand for 15-20 minutes. Peel off and discard charred skin. Cut peppers into strips; place in a large bowl. Add the beans, onion and basil. In a jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine the vinegar, oil, salt and pepper; shake well. Pour over bean mixture; toss to coat.
