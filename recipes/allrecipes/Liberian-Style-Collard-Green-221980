Place the bacon in a large deep skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate and crumble. Heat collard greens, vegetable oil, water, and chicken bouillon in a large pot over medium heat. Simmer until greens are wilted, about 10 minutes. Stir bacon, peanut butter, liquid smoke, soul food seasoning, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper into pot; cover and simmer until greens are very tender and peanut butter begins to separate, about 1 1/2 hours. Add more water if the mixture becomes too dry. Stir flounder fillets into greens. Continue to cook until fish breaks down, about 30 minutes more, stirring frequently.
