Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir together the luncheon meat, processed cheese, relish, and salad dressing in a bowl. Spoon the filling into the sandwich buns, and wrap each sandwich individually in aluminum foil. Place the sandwiches onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is hot, and the buns have toasted, 10 to 15 minutes.
