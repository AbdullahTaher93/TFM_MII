Place greens in a clear glass serving bowl; sprinkle with green onions. Layer sliced beets on the onions. Arrange hard-boil egg slices on their sides against the glass for a decorative layer. Add sliced red onions and peas. Top with shredded Cheddar cheese. Mix sour cream, half-and-half, crumbled blue cheese, salt, and pepper together in a mixing bowl until well blended. Pour evenly over the salad. Top with rice noodles just before serving.
