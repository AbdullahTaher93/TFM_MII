Cut grapefruit segments from their surrounding membranes, letting them drop into a bowl. Squeeze any remaining juice from the membranes into the bowl. Remove the segments from the bowl with a slotted spoon, and arrange on 4 dessert plates. (Reserve the juice for breakfast the next day.) Crush rosemary leaves with the flat of a knife blade to release the fragrant oil. Scatter over the top of the grapefruit. Drizzle each serving with 1 tablespoon creme de cassis (or black-currant syrup).
