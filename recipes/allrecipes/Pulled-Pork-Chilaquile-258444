Set a cast iron Dutch oven over hot coals. Heat butter until melted. Add onion; cook, stirring often, until soft and deeply browned in parts, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour salsa and chicken stock into the Dutch oven; bring to a boil. Layer in 1/2 of the chips, Cheddar cheese, and pulled pork. Repeat with the remaining chips, Cheddar cheese, and pulled pork. Cover and cook until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.
