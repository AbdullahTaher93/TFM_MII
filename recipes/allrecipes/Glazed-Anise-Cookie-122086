In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in aniseed and extract. Combine flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or until easy to handle. On a lightly floured surface, roll out to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with 2-1/2-in. cookie cutters dipped in flour. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake 375 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool. In a saucepan, combine sugar, water and cream of tartar; bring to a boil over low heat. Cook and stir until a candy thermometer reads 226 degrees F (thread stage). Cool to 110 degrees F (do not stir). Stir in extract and enough confectioners' sugar to achieve spreading consistency. Spread over cookies.
