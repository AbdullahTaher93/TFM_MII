In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Cut in shortening and butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in milk and apple just until moistened. Turn onto a floured surface. Pat into a 10-in. x 8-in. rectangle, about 12 in. thick. Spread with butter, then applesauce; drizzle with honey. Sprinkle with brown sugar and raisins.
