Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Pat beef dry and season with salt and pepper to taste. Toss vegetables, except garlic, in a sheet pan with oil and rosemary and salt and pepper to taste. Spread vegetables out on sheet pan and nestle beef in middle. Place foil package of garlic in upper third of oven and place beef with vegetables in lower third of oven. Roast, stirring vegetables occasionally, until vegetables are golden brown and tender, garlic is very soft and a meat thermometer when inserted 2 inches into center of beef registers 135 degrees F for medium rare, 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer meat to a carving board, cover roast with foil and let stand for 15 minutes before slicing. Transfer vegetables to a serving bowl and season to taste with salt and pepper. Keep warm, covered. Carefully remove garlic from foil and scoop out garlic cloves into a bowl, mashing them with a fork until smooth. Boil vinegar in a small saucepan until reduced by a third, about 3 minutes. Whisk in garlic and broth and boil, whisking occasionally, for 3 minutes. Transfer to a gravy dish. Cut beef crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices and serve on top of roasted vegetables. Drizzle with balsamic sauce and garnish with rosemary.
