Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until tender. Throw in the sliced frankfurters; continue to cook and stir until slightly browned. Stir in the garlic and cook just until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in the vegetable juice cocktail and Worcestershire sauce and add tomato, Brussels sprouts and pepper. Stir to blend, then cover and simmer over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes or until sprouts are tender.
