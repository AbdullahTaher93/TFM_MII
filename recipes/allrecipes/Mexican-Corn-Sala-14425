In a heavy large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the corn, bell pepper, zucchini, green onions and jalapeno pepper. Saute until vegetables are tender, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat and refrigerate vegetables until chilled. Add salsa and chopped cilantro to vegetable mixture. Stir and season with salt and pepper to taste.
