Season pork with salt and pepper. Dredge chops in flour. Heat butter and olive oil in large nonstick skillet over medium high heat until butter is melted and foamy. Cook chops 6 to 8 minutes, turning once, or until well browned on both sides. Remove to serving platter and cover to keep warm. Add lemon juice, wine and remaining 2 tablespoons butter to pan. Cook 2 minutes, scraping up browned bits. Stir in remaining ingredients and pour over chops.
