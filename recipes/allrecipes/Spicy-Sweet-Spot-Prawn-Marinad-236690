Stir canola oil, mirin, pepper flakes, garlic, lemon zest, and salt together in a small bowl. Place prawns in a resealable plastic bag; pour in marinade. Press out excess air; seal the bag. Marinate prawns in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Thread prawns onto skewers; discard marinade. Grill prawns until opaque, about 3 minutes each side.
