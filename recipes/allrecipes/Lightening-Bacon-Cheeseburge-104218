In a large bowl combine ground beef, onion, garlic, cilantro, Dijon mustard and Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM). Mix well. Portion the meat into four 6 ounce balls. Form each ball into a uniform burger patty, each about 3/4 to 1 inch thick. Place each burger between sheets of parchment paper, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for one hour to allow the meat to set. In a fry pan, over medium-high heat, fry the bacon sprinkling each slice of bacon lightly with Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM) on both sides, until crisp. Remove from pan and pat dry with paper towel to remove excess fat. Set aside and keep warm. Prepare all of your remaining burger garnishes and condiments and set aside. Preheat grill to medium-high. Sprinkle burgers with Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM), on both sides to season. On a well seasoned grill, grill the burgers for 4 to 5 minutes per side with the grill lid open, until fully cooked. Ground meats should be cooked to well-done, a minimum 160 degrees F internal temperature. Top grilled burgers with cooked Hot Salt seasoned bacon and Cheddar cheese, reduce grill heat to low, close lid and allow the cheese to melt for approximately 1 minute. At the same time toast the burger buns. Top each bun with bacon cheeseburgers and garnish with your favorite burger toppings including lettuce, red onion, pickles and tomato.
