Heat the oven to 450 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of the butter with the oregano, cumin, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Rub the mixture over the skin of the hens and arrange them, skin-side up, on a baking sheet. Roast in the upper third of the oven until golden and cooked through, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons butter with the scallion, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. When the hens are roasted, top with the scallion butter. Serve with lime wedges.
