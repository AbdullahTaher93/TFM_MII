Pierce potatoes and bake at 375 degrees F for 1 hour or until tender. Cool. Cut a thin slice off the top of each potato. Scoop out the pulp and place in a mixing bowl. Add butter, milk and salt; beat until fluffy. Beat in cream cheese and sour cream. Spoon into potato shells. Sprinkle with paprika. Place on a baking sheet. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until heated through and tops are golden brown.
