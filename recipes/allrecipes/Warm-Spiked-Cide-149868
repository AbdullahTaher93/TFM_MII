With a vegetable peeler remove four 3-inch-long strips of zest from lemon and two 6-inch-long strips from orange. In a 3-quart saucepan bring cider to a rolling boil and pour through a sieve lined with a triple layer of cheesecloth or paper towels into a heatproof pitcher. Stir in orange and lemon zests, star anise, cloves, cinnamon sticks, juniper berries, and sugar and steep at room temperature 1 hour. (Cider may be made 1 day ahead and cooled completely before being chilled, covered.) Just before serving, in a saucepan reheat cider over low heat until just warm. Discard spices and stir in brandy.
