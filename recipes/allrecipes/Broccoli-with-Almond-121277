In a large saucepan, bring broccoli, water and bouillon to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5-8 minutes or until broccoli is crisp-tender. Drain and place in a serving dish; keep warm. In a skillet, saute almonds in margarine until browned. Add onion and salt; saute until onion is tender. Pour over broccoli; toss to coat.
