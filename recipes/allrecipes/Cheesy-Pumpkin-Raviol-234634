Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in ravioli and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until ravioli float to the top and filling is hot, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain. Melt mascarpone cheese, butter, and a pinch black pepper in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir milk, pumpkin, Pecorino Romano cheese, brown sugar, cinnamon, 2 teaspoons salt, and nutmeg into mascarpone cheese mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until sauce thickens, 5 to 10 minutes. Add cooked ravioli into sauce and toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Top each serving with pine nuts.
