Preheat the grill to high heat. Line a hot grill with Reynolds Wrap(R) Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil. Coat the chicken breasts with the oil and season on all sides with salt and pepper. Place the chicken breasts directly on the hot grill lined with foil and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side or until grill marks have formed. Transfer the chicken in a slow cooker lined with a Reynolds(R) Slow Cooker Liner and pour in water and BBQ sauce and cook on high heat for 3 hours or low heat for 5 hours. Pull the chicken apart using two forks until it is shredded and keep warm. Mix together the coleslaw mix, mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar and salt and pepper until combined. Serve the pulled chicken on sweet rolls and top off with some creamy coleslaw.
