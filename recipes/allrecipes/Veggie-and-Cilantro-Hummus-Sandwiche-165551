To prepare the cilantro hummus, place the garbanzo beans, tahini, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, garlic powder, and paprika into a blender. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons of olive oil, 1 tablespoon of water, lemon juice, and the cilantro. Puree until smooth, and set aside. Whisk together 1/4 cup of water, vinegar, 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, sugar, 1 pinch of salt, and sesame oil in a bowl until the sugar has dissolved. Add the cucumber, tomato, and red onion. Toss to coat the vegetables in the dressing. Spread two slices of bread with the cilantro hummus, and sprinkle with crumbled feta cheese. Top with shredded lettuce and the vegetable mixture. Pour on additional dressing to taste, and top with the remaining slice of bread.
