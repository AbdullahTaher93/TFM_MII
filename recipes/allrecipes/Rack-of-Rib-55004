Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Season the ribs with salt and pepper and place into a roasting pan that is slightly larger than the rack. In a medium bowl, stir together the sauerkraut, onion and dill; spread on top of the ribs and place around them in the roasting pan. Bake for 3 to 4 hours in the preheated oven, until the rib meat easily pulls away from the bone.
