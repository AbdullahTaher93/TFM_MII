Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange sausage in an 8-in. square nonstick baking pan. Bake sausage according to package directions. Remove sausage from baking pan; set aside. Cut tortillas into four equal quarters; cover with plastic wrap. Place one tortilla wedge on a work surface; place one sausage link on wide end of wedge. Brush pointed end of tortilla with water; roll up and press to seal. Place in pan, seam side down. Repeat with remaining sausage links. Bake for 5 minutes. Turn seam side up and sprinkle with cheese. Bake 3 minutes longer or until cheese is melted. Cool slightly. Top with red pepper jelly and green onions.
