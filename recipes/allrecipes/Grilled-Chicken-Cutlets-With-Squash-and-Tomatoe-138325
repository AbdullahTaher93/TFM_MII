Heat grill or grill pan to medium-high. Place chicken in a shallow nonreactive dish, and toss with lemon juice, 2 tablespoons oil, and 1 garlic clove. Cover; marinate 15 minutes. In a medium bowl, toss squash and tomatoes with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and garlic clove, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Grill vegetables until charred and slightly softened, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Let cool slightly, then cut into large chunks. Combine vegetables in a bowl with basil; cover, and set aside. Remove chicken from marinade, and season with 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper; discard marinade. Grill chicken until browned and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer vegetables to a serving platter. Place grilled chicken on top, and garnish with more basil.
