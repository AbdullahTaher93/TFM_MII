Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place macaroni in the pot, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain and rinse under cold water. In a large bowl, mix the macaroni, celery, sweet onion, pimentos, and pickle. In a separate bowl, mix the creamy salad dressing, mustard, vinegar, sugar, and salt. Stir dressing into the macaroni mixture. Fold in the eggs. Chill in the refrigerator at least 2 hours before serving.
