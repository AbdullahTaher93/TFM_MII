Move oven rack to lowest position and preheat to 450 degrees F. Grease 12-inch pizza pan. Cook beef in 10-inch skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally until brown; drain. Stir in salsa, corn and 1/4 cup water. Heat to boiling then remove from heat. In a medium bowl, mix Bisquick, 1/3 cup hot water and oil until a soft dough forms. Beat vigorously for 20 strokes. Let stand for 5 minutes. Press dough in pizza pan, using fingers dipped in Bisquick; pinch edge to form 1/2-inch rim. Spread beef mixture over dough. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake for 11 to 15 minutes, or until crust is golden brown and cheese is melted. Arrange Toppings on pizza to form jack-o-lanterns.
