In a bowl, combine the first eight ingredients. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Shape into a loaf in an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Top with bacon. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 70-80 minutes or until meat is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F. Drain; let stand for 10 minutes before cutting.
