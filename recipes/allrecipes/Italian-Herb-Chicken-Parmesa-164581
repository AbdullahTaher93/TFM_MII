Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Brush chicken with oil. Coat evenly on both sides with Crusting Blend. Place on foil-lined shallow baking pan. Discard any remaining Crusting Blend. Bake 15 minutes. Remove from oven. Top each chicken breast with 2 tablespoons each of the sauce and the cheese. Bake 5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted and chicken is cooked through. Serve with spaghetti and additional sauce, if desired.
