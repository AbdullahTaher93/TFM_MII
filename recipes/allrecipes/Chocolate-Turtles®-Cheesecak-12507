Place caramels and evaporated milk in a saucepan. Heat over low heat, stir continually until smooth for about five minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup chopped pecans. Pour into pie crust. Combine cream cheese, sour cream, and milk in a blender. Process until smooth. Add pudding mix; process for about 30 seconds more. Pour pudding mix over caramel layer, covering completely. Chill, loosely covered, until set (it usually takes about 15 minutes). Drizzle fudge topping over pudding layer in a decorative pattern. Sprinkle top of cake with remaining pecans. Chill, loosely covered, until serving time.
