Sprinkle the turkey thigh cubes with salt and black pepper, and place into a slow cooker. Pour the diced tomatoes over the turkey, and follow with the artichoke hearts in a layer. Place the parsnips, baby carrots, yellow squash, and green bell pepper into the cooker, and pour in the chicken broth to cover. Place the bouillon cubes into the broth. Cover, and cook on Low for 8 to 10 hours. Pour in the garbanzo beans in the last hour. Garnish with fresh dill.
