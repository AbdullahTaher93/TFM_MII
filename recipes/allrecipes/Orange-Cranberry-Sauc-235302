Stir cranberries, orange zest, sugar, and enough water to cover berries together in a saucepan. Bring mixture to a boil and cook until cranberries begin to burst, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low, stir in orange juice, and simmer until flavors blend, about 1 hour. Cool to room temperature and refrigerate until a gel consistency is reached, at least 1 hour.
