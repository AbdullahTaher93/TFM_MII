Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. Scrub potatoes and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Lay potatoes on a rack in a pan over at least 1 inch boiling water. Cover and steam potatoes over medium-high heat just until tender when pierced (10 to 12 minutes). Meanwhile, pat dough evenly to fit a lightly oiled 12-inch pizza pan. Scatter mozzarella and jack cheeses over crust. Lay potato slices in a single layer over cheese. Sprinkle potatoes with salt and pepper to taste. Scatter rosemary, onion, capers, and feta over potatoes. Drizzle with olive oil. Bake on lowest rack in oven until bottom of crust is well browned (9 to 10 minutes for pizza crust dough or 12 to 15 minutes for bread dough). Cut into wedges to serve.
