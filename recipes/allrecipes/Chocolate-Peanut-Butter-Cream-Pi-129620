Spoon 1/2 cup of the fudge topping onto bottom of crust. Place in freezer 10 min. Mix peanut butter and milk with wire whisk in large bowl until well blended. Add dry pudding mixes; beat 2 min. or until well blended. (Mixture will be thick.) Gently stir in half of the whipped topping. Gently spoon over chocolate layer. Top with remaining whipped topping. Refrigerate 3 hours or until set. Drizzle with remaining 1/4 cup fudge topping just before serving. Store leftover pie in refrigerator.
