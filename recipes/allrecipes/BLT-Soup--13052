In a heavy 3-quart saucepan cook bacon over medium heat until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Do not drain fat. Add butter or margarine and heat until melted. Stir in lettuce and saute 2 minutes. Blend in flour with a wire whisk. Stir over medium heat until well blended and evenly cooked, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Add hot water, chicken soup base, tomatoes, nutmeg, and red pepper. Heat to boiling, stirring frequently. Reduce heat and gently boil 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened. Add cream, mixing well. Heat to simmering, stirring frequently. Serve hot, garnished with crumbled bacon bits. ENJOY!
