Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl combine bread pieces, celery, onion, eggs and 1/2 melted butter; mix well. Stir in turkey liver and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish. Place mixture inside the cavity of a turkey or place it in a casserole dish. If stuffing is to be baked separately from the turkey, bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes.
