Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Cut fat from brisket. Place meat in a roasting pan into which it fits loosely. Sprinkle meat with salt and pepper. Roast covered for 3 to 4 hours, or until tender when pierced with a fork. If drippings around meat boil, reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F. Cool meat to room temperature. Wrap in foil and refrigerate. To prepare barbecue sauce, mix tomato sauce, onion, garlic, vinegar, Worcestershire, sugar, honey, mustard, chili powder, salt to taste, lemon, and liquid smoke, if desired, in a 3- to 4-quart pan with 1/2 cup water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce heat to low, and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Carve brisket into thin slices. Arrange a layer of meat in bottom of a large oven-to-table casserole dish or roasting pan. Spread with a layer of barbecue sauce. Continue layering meat and sauce until all is used. If not using immediately, cover with plastic wrap and then foil and refrigerate or freeze. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Bake for 45 to 60 minutes or until heated through. Or microwave on high (100%) for 10 to 20 minutes, or until hot. Serve warm on rolls.
