To Prepare: Heat 1/4" of oil in small skillet. Cook tortillas in hot oil one at a time for 20-40 seconds on each side or until crisp and golden brown. Drain tortillas on a paper towel; keep warm in foil in 250 oven until serving time. To assemble, top each tostada with lettuce, chicken, salsa, cheese, avocado and olives.
