Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Scatter onion rings on bottom of 11x7 or 13x9-inch glass baking dish; lay chicken on top. Pour steak sauce over all and toss slightly to coat. Bake about 35 minutes or until chicken is fork tender and juices run clear and onions are of desired tenderness. Place roll halves, cut side up, on baking sheet. Bake 5 minutes. Place 1 slice cheese on bottom half of each roll. Top with chicken, onions and second slice of cheese. Cover with top of rolls. Use any leftover sauce as a dip.
