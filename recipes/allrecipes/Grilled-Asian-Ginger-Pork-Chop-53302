In a shallow container, mix together orange juice, soy sauce, ginger, orange zest, garlic, chile paste, and salt. Add pork chops, and turn to coat evenly. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight. Turn the pork chops in the marinade occasionally. Preheat grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate. Grill pork chops for 5 to 6 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.
