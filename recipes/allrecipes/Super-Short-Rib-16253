Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium high heat. Add the ribs and brown well on all sides in small batches. Set ribs aside. Add the onions, broth, pineapple, chili sauce, honey, Worcestershire sauce and garlic. Return the ribs to the pot, coating them well with this sauce. Bake, covered, at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour. Remove cover, season with salt and pepper to taste, and bake for 1 more hour. Garnish with the parsley.
