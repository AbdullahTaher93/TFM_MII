To make chili, brown ground beef in 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large saucepan for about 10 minutes over medium heat. Add onion and red bell pepper, stirring well. Add tomato sauce and seasonings, stirring well. Allow mixture to bubble for about 10 minutes, then reduce heat to simmer and cook at least 30 minutes. To make hot dogs, cook on your grill or on a grill pan until just seared on the outside. Meanwhile, toast buns in a 400-degree oven for about 10 minutes, taking care not to brown. Swipe each bun with mustard, top with chili as desired, followed by grated cheese, onion and, if you're brave, jalapenos. If you'd like the cheese all melty, place chili dogs on a foil-lined cookie sheet and run under a hot broiler for 2 to 3 minutes or until cheese bubbles.
