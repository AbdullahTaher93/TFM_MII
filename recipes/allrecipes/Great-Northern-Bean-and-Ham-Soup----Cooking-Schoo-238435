Place Great Northern beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain and set aside. Melt butter in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-low heat. Add onion, carrots, and celery; cook and stir until vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes. Stir garlic into vegetables; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir chicken stock, beans, ham, and bay leaf into vegetable mixture; bring to a boil and reduce heat to low. Cover the pot with a lid, leaving lid slightly ajar. Simmer soup, adding more stock as needed, until beans are tender and soup is thick, about 2 1/2 hours. Discard bay leaf and season soup with salt and pepper.
