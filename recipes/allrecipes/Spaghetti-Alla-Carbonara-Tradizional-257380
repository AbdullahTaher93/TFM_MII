Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain. Heat a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir guanciale until crisp, 5 to 10 minutes. Whisk egg yolks and egg together in a bowl; add Pecorino-Romano cheese, salt, and pepper and whisk well. Stir in guanciale. Add spaghetti and toss until evenly coated.
