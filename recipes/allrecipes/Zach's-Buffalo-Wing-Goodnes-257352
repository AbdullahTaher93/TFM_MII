Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease with cooking spray. Mix flour, paprika, salt, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Pat chicken wings dry with paper towels. Dip in the flour mixture until thoroughly coated. Transfer floured wings to the baking sheet; spray lightly with cooking spray. Bake in the preheated oven, without turning, until browned, about 48 minutes. Preheat the oven's broiler. Broil wings until crisp and browned, about 5 minutes. Combine hot wings and hot sauce in a large bowl; toss until evenly coated.
