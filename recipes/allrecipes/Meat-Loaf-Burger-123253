Place onion and celery in a slow cooker. Combine beef, 1 teaspoon salt and pepper; shape into six patties. Place over onion mixture. Combine tomato juice, garlic, ketchup, bay leaf, Italian seasoning and remaining salt. Pour over the patties. Cover and cook on low for 7-9 hours or until meat is tender. Discard bay leaf. Separate patties with a spatula if necessary; serve on buns.
