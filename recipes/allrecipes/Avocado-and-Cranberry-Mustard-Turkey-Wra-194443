To make the cranberry mustard, whisk together the Dijon mustard and cranberry sauce, then chill. Lay tortillas flat on a clean work surface. Spread the cranberry mustard equally among the tortillas. Lay two slices of turkey on each tortilla; cover turkey with a slice of Swiss cheese. Top the Swiss cheese with four slices of Avocado on each and sprinkle with a little salt. Assemble wraps by folding in both sides and the bottom of each tortilla up over the filling, then roll to close. To serve, cut in half crosswise or into 2-inch slices crosswise and arrange on a serving platter.
