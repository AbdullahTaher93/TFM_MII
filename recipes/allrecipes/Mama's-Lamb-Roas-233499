Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix white wine, garlic, parsley, and salt in a bowl. Arrange leg of lamb in a large roasting pan; pour white wine mixture evenly over lamb. Roast in the preheated oven to your desired degree of doneness, or an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (65 degrees C) for medium, about 90 minutes, flipping the lamb over halfway through. Remove from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.
