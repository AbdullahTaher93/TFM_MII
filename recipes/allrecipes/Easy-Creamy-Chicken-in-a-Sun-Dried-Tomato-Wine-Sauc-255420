Prepare Idahoan Signature™ Russets Mashed Potatoes according to package directions. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; add frozen chicken tenders. Season with Italian seasoning, salt, oregano, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Cook until tenders are browned and no longer pink inside, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken tenders from the skillet. Place diced onion in the same skillet over medium-high heat and cook until translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Add sun-dried tomatoes and garlic; cook 1 minute longer. Stir in butter and flour and cook for 1 minute. Add white wine and scrape any bits from bottom of the pan. Stir in milk, sugar and Parmesan cheese. Bring mixture back to a simmer; simmer until mixture begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Transfer chicken back to skillet and cook until heated through. Serve over Idahoan Signature™ Russets Mashed Potatoes.
