Tear the bread into pieces and soak in a bowl of cold water for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and squeeze the bread dry, removing all water. Place the bread in a large bowl and break it up into smaller pieces with a fork. Set aside. In a small bowl, combine tomatoes, olives, onions, 1/3 cup vinaigrette and stir gently. Add the vinaigrette mixture to the bread pieces and combine well. Shred basil leaves and add to the mixture. Add ham strips and mix gently to combine.
