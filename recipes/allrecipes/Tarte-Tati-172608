Cut 1/3 cup butter into chunks. In a food processor or a bowl, whirl or mix with your fingers the butter chunks, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1 1/4 cups flour until mixture looks like fine meal. Add egg and yolk; whirl or stir vigorously until dough holds together. Pat into a 5-in. disk, wrap in plastic, and chill to firm somewhat, 30 to 40 minutes. Peel and core apples, then slice lengthwise 1/3 in. thick; mix slices with lemon juice and set aside. In a 10-in. ovenproof frying pan over medium heat, melt remaining 1/4 cup butter. Add remaining 1 cup sugar, and stir often until sugar melts, turns deep caramel color, and just barely starts to smoke, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Quickly (to cool caramel) and carefully (to avoid splattering) spoon apples and juice over caramel, filling pan compactly. On a board, overlap sheets of plastic wrap to make a 16-in. square. Unwrap dough, dust with flour, and place on wrap. Cover with more plastic wrap. With short, gentle strokes, roll dough into an even 11-in. round. Remove top layer of plastic, invert dough over apples, and remove remaining layer of plastic. Tuck edge of dough between apples and pan. Cut 3 vents near center of dough, each about 2 in. long. Bake in a 375 degrees F oven until pastry is deep golden and juices start to bubble in center, 55 to 60 minutes. Let cool on rack until pan is no longer hot to touch, at least 2 hours or until next day (if it stands overnight, apples will absorb most of sauce). Loosen crust from side of pan. If tart is very juicy, tip pan, and spoon or siphon out some of the sauce. Place a rimmed serving plate over crust, and invert. Top wedges with sauce and ice cream.
