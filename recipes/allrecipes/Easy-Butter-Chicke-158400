Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Season the chicken with salt, pepper and tarragon; drizzle with lemon juice. Set aside. Place an oven proof skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat and melt the butter. Place the chicken in the dish, turning to coat both sides. Cover the chicken with a sheet of parchment paper, and then cover with a lid. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through.
