In a 9 inch iron skillet, mix cornmeal, white sugar, baking powder, salt, 2 eggs, evaporated milk and vegetable oil. Bake cornmeal mixture in the preheated oven 35 to 40 minutes, or until lightly browned. Allow to cool. Crumble the cooled cornbread into a large bowl. Mix in remaining eggs, mushrooms, celery, green onions, butter, chicken broth, condensed cream of chicken soup, ground black pepper and dried parsley. Transfer the mixture to the prepared 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven.
