Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic; cook and stir until golden, about 2 minutes. Add zucchini; cook, stirring occasionally, until starting to soften, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and stir in tomato, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper. Let cool, about 5 minutes. Stir in basil. Let zucchini mixture marinate in the refrigerator, 20 minutes to overnight. Spread zucchini mixture over baguette slices. Sprinkle feta cheese on top.
