Melt butter in a soup pot over medium heat. Cook and stir celery, green onions, salt, and black pepper in melted butter until slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Stir potatoes, chicken broth, and water with celery mixture. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, cover, and lower heat to a simmer until vegetables are softened, about 30 minutes. Stir cream of celery soup, cream of chicken soup, milk with the potatoes mixture. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until heated through, stirring occasionally, 5 to 10 minutes.
