Boil water in a large pot. Place chicken, garlic, ginger, salt, and sugar in the pot. Return to boil and let simmer for 35 minutes. Remove chicken, cover to keep warm, and set aside. Heat coconut oil in a rice cooker or heavy-bottomed pot with lid; cook and stir garlic, shallots, ginger, and pandan leaves until golden and aromatic. Pour rice into the rice cooker or pot; stir to coat with oil. Stir in chicken broth and set the rice cooker cycle. If using a pot, bring rice to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 15 minutes. Combine ginger, red Thai chilies, fermented soybeans, pickled garlic, white vinegar, and soy sauce in a food processor or blender. Pulse until liquefied, but not smooth in texture. Debone chicken and cut into 1-inch pieces. Place chicken pieces over cooked rice to serve. Top with sauce (or serve sauce on the side) and garnish with cucumbers and cilantro. Enjoy!
