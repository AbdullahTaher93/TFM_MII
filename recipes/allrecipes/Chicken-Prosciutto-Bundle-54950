Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Wash Hands. Place chicken on cutting board. Holding sharp knife horizontal to board, cut a 3-inch deep pocket lengthwise in the thick side of each breast. Place 2 basil leaves on each slice of mozzarella, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Stuff each breast pocket with a cheese bundle. Wrap 2 slices prosciutto around each breast, anchoring with toothpicks. Wash Hands. Heat oil in large oven-proof nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add chicken and cook about 3 minutes on each side or until browned. Transfer chicken in skillet to oven; bake 12 to 15 minutes or until done (internal temp 170 degrees F).
