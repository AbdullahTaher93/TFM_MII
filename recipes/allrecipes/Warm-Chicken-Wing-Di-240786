Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, chicken, blue cheese dressing, ranch dressing, and hot pepper sauce together in a bowl until well-combined. Spread chicken mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbling, about 40 minutes.
