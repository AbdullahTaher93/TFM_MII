Place potatoes in a large pot, and cover with water. The water level should stand about 2 inches above potatoes. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until very tender. Remove soup from heat, and slowly stir in nondairy creamer. Continue stirring until soup is creamy. Mash slightly with a potato masher. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot or cold.
