Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add beef; cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes, oregano, and salt. Simmer sauce until flavors combine, about 10 minutes. Spread 1/4 of the sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Top with a 1/3 of the quinoa. Drop spoonfuls of ricotta on top of quinoa, and sprinkle 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese on top. Repeat layers twice more, ending with sauce and Parmesan cheese on top. Bake lasagna in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and top is golden, about 35 minutes.
