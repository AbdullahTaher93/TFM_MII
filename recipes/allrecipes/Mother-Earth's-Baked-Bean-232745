Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; reserve about 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in the skillet. Crumble bacon and transfer to a slow cooker. Cook and stir ground beef and onion in bacon drippings in skillet over medium heat until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer ground beef mixture to the slow cooker. Mix brown sugar, barbeque sauce, ketchup, mustard, molasses, liquid smoke flavoring, black pepper, and chili powder in a bowl; pour over ground beef-bacon mixture. Stir well. Add baked beans, kidney beans, Great Northern beans, and pinto beans; mix well. Cook on Low for 6 hours; refrigerate overnight for 8 hours. Reheat in slow cooker until warmed, at least 1 hour.
