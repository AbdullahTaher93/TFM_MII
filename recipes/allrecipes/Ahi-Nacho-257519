Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cut wonton wrappers into small triangles 2 to 3 inches in length. Cook in the hot oil in a single layer until crispy and golden, 1 minute per layer. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Combine soy sauce and sesame seeds in a bowl. Add ahi tuna; mix until coated with soy sauce and sesame seeds. Mix mayonnaise, pickle juice, and sriracha sauce together in a small bowl to make sauce. Arrange fried wonton wrappers on a large serving plate. Layer ahi tuna and avocado chunks on top. Drizzle sauce on top.
