Mix pork, maple syrup, sage, salt, fennel seed, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, and anise seed in a large bowl until evenly blended. Shape pork into small patties. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry patties in batches until pork is browned and no longer pink in the center, 4 to 5 minutes per side.
