Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Bring water to a boil in a saucepan. Cook asparagus until bright green and still crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain asparagus and rinse under cold water to stop cooking. Pat dry with a towel. Stir mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, and dry mustard together in a bowl. Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until stiff peaks form, 2 to 4 minutes; fold into mayonnaise mixture. Place pre-baked pizza crust onto a baking sheet, arrange asparagus on crust, and spoon mayonnaise mixture on top. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly brown, 8 to 10 minutes.
