Divide apples evenly between two greased 9-in. pie plates; set aside. In a mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking soda, cream of tartar, sour milk and egg; mix well. Divide batter and pour over apples. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until pies are lightly browned and test done. Invert onto serving plates (so apples are on the top). Combine all topping ingredients; sprinkle over apples. Serve warm.
