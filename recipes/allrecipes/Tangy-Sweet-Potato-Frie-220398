Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Mix sweet potato wedges, Italian dressing, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder together in a bowl until sweet potatoes are evenly coated. Season with black pepper. Arrange potato wedges on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, then flip potatoes over; continue baking until easily pierced with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes more. Sprinkle sweet potato fries with the remaining 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese to serve.
