In a large saucepan, cook bacon; remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Cook beef, onion and green pepper in drippings over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Remove from the heat; add the remaining ingredients. Stir in bacon; mix well. Transfer to an oven proof Dutch oven or greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake 15 minutes longer or until thick and bubbly.
