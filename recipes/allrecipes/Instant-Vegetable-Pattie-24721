Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes; drain. In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, heat oil and add cumin seeds. As they begin to sputter add turmeric and coriander, then potatoes, peas and green chile peppers. Stir in salt and chili powder; cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice. Roll out crescent dough; fill each roll with potato mixture and form into patties. Bake in a preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until evenly browned.
