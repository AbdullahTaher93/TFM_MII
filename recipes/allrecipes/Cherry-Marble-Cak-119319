In a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan, combine cake mix and oil. Combine eggs and water; stir into cake mix until blended. Drop tablespoons of pie filling into batter; cut through batter with a knife to swirl. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean (top will have an uneven appearance). Cool on a wire rack.
