Cook the duck skin and fat in a wok or large skillet over medium heat until the skin is crispy, and the fat has rendered, about 10 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high, and stir in the duck meat, pork, half of the green onions, and the soy sauce. Cook and stir until the meats are heated through, about 5 minutes. Add rice and toss together until rice is hot and sizzling, about 5 minutes. Make a wide well in the middle of the rice, exposing the bottom of the pan. Pour in the beaten eggs and stir until the eggs have scrambled. Then stir the scrambled eggs into the rice along with the rest of the green onions. Toss and stir until the rice is very hot, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.
