Preheat the oven's broiler. In a medium bowl, toss together the tomatoes, onion, red bell pepper, and green bell pepper. Place the slices of bread on a baking sheet, and place under the broiler. Broil for about 2 minutes, just until lightly toasted. Remove from the oven, and turn the bread untoasted side up. Place a handful of the vegetable mixture on top of each slice. Drizzle with a bit of olive oil, then top with a slice of cheese. Return the bread slices to the broiler, and cook until the cheese is melted. Serve immediately.
