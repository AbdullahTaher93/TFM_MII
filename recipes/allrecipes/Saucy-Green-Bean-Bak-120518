In a bowl, combine the first five ingredients. Add the green beans; toss to coat. Transfer to an ungreased 1-qt. baking dish. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a skillet, saute onion, green pepper and garlic in butter until tender. Sprinkle over beans. Top with cheese. Bake, uncovered, for 3 minutes or until cheese is melted.
