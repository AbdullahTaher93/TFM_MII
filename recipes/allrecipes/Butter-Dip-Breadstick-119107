Place butter in an ungreased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt; mix well. Stir in the milk just until moistened. Turn onto a floured surface; knead 10 times. Roll into a 12-in. x 9-in. rectangle. Cut into 9-in. x 1/2-in. strips. Dip each side of strip in butter in prepared pan; arrange in the pan (do not allow sides to touch). Bake at 450 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.
