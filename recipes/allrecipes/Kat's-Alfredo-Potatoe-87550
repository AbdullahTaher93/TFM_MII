Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large glass baking dish. In the baking dish, mix the potatoes, onion, butter, milk, Swiss cheese, Parmesan cheese, and Alfredo sauce. Season with salt, black pepper, red pepper, and parsley. Bake 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until potatoes are tender and sauce is bubbly. Top with more Parmesan cheese during the last few minutes of bake time.
