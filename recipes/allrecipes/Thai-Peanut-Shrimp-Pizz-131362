Cut shrimp into 1/2-inch pieces. Sprinkle lightly with salt (to help shrimp plump). Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Spray a large nonstick frying pan with olive oil spray, then place over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook 2 minutes (outsides should be pink; insides will not be fully cooked). Remove from heat and add 1 tsp peanut sauce. Press dough into a 12-inch round on a nonstick pizza pan. Spread remaining peanut sauce evenly over all but the outer 1/2-inch. In this order, top with cheese, sprouts, carrots, shrimp, onions, and peanuts. Bake for 11 to 14 minutes or until cheese melts and crust is lightly browned. Let stand 5 minutes. Cut into 8 slices and serve immediately.
