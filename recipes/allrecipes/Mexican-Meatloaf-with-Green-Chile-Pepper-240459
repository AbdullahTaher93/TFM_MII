Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine ground beef, 1/2 of the tomato sauce, and 1/2 of the Colby-Jack cheese together in a large bowl; add tortilla chips, onions, eggs, green chile peppers, chili powder, and salt and mix well. Pack meat mixture into an 8x4-inch loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Drain grease from pan. Pour remaining tomato sauce over meatloaf and sprinkle remaining cheese over tomato sauce. Cook in the oven until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.
