Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in rotini, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until rotini has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water. Transfer pasta to a large bowl. Toss salmon and cucumber in with rotini, flaking the salmon as you stir. Combine Greek yogurt, mayonnaise, dill, and onion powder in a small bowl. Spoon yogurt mixture over rotini and gently combine. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Arrange slices of Roma tomatoes on the salad before serving.
