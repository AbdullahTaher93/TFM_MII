In large saucepan, melt butter. Add onion and saute until onions are slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add squash, water and bouillon granules. Cover saucepan and bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 20-25 minutes or until squash is fork tender. Remove mixture and let cool for 15 minutes. Place squash mixture into food processor or blender ( in several small batches, if necessary) and process until smooth. Return pureed squash to saucepan. Add half-and-half, all-spice, salt and pepper. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly, until warmed through. Ladle soup into warm bowls and serve. If desired, place small dollops of sour cream in a circular fashion on top of soup. Gently run a toothpick through sour cream to create a swirled effect.
