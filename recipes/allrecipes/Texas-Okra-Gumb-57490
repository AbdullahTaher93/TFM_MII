Place bacon in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook until evenly browned, then add onion, chicken cubes and okra. Cook, stirring, until chicken is tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in cayenne peppers, tomatoes, and diced tomatoes with green chilies. Add rice and water, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until rice is tender.
