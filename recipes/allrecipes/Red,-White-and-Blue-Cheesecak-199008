Place a rack in the bottom third of the oven. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Coat bottom and sides of a 9-inch spring form pan with non-stick cooking spray. Sprinkle crumbs evenly over the pan bottom. Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine cream cheese and SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend. On medium speed, beat until smooth. (If lumps remain, use a spatula to smooth them before proceeding.) Reduce speed to low, adding egg whites and egg, one at a time, as you continue to mix. Add yogurt, vanilla, and lemon peel. Mix to incorporate, being careful not to overbeat. Add cornstarch and mix until just combined. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until top is well set but center is still slightly soft and edge is light golden brown. Remove pan from oven. Run a butter knife around the inner edge but do not remove the pan side. Let stand to cool for 30 minutes before refrigerating. Chill at least 4 hours before serving. Remove the pan side. With the berries, decorate cake to resemble a flag: Place the blueberries in the upper left and then arrange the strawberries in horizontal stripes to cover the remainder of the cake. Cut and serve.
