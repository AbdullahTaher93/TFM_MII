Preheat broiler to High. Broil pork chops 3 to 5 inches from heat for 5 minutes. Turn; broil 5 minutes longer. Meanwhile, in small saucepan, combine remaining ingredients. Heat to boiling; simmer over low heat for 10 minutes. Brush pork with sauce. Continue broiling, turning and brushing with sauce, 5 to 10 minutes longer, or until pork is no longer pink in center. Bring remaining sauce to a boil; serve with pork chops.
