Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, stir together crushed rosemary, sage, and oregano. Rub one side of each chicken breast with herb mixture. Place chicken herb-side up in a baking dish, and pour broth over the chicken. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Place raspberry preserves in a microwave-safe bowl, and heat for 20 to 30 seconds to soften. Stir in honey mustard and rosemary. Spread about 1 tablespoon of preserve mixture over each breast. Bake 10 minutes more.
