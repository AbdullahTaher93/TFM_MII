In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine evaporated milk, chocolate chips, marshmallows and salt; stir until chocolate and marshmallows melt and mixture smoothes and thickens. Remove from heat and let cool. Line a 9 inch pie plate with vanilla wafers. Spoon half of ice cream over wafers and spread evenly, then top with half of chocolate/marshmallow mixture. Repeat layers and top with pecans; freeze 3 to 5 hours, until firm.
