With a vegetable cleaning brush, scrub potatoes well. Cut potatoes lengthwise into 1/2-inch wide sticks using a sharp knife or a French fry grid. Transfer sticks to a medium bowl and, using hands, toss with melted butter; sprinkle with nutmeg and salt. Arrange spears, skin side down, 1 inch apart on a baking sheet. Bake in a 425 degrees F oven for 20 minutes or until tender.
