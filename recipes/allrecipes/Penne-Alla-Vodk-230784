Fry bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain some of the drippings from the skillet. Cook and stir garlic with the bacon until garlic is tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir tomatoes, salt, and pepper into bacon mixture; simmer for 15 minutes. Pour vodka over bacon mixture; simmer until sauce is slightly reduced, 15 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes; drain and transfer pasta to a serving bowl. Stir cream into vodka sauce and simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Toss penne and vodka sauce together until coated; sprinkle with nutmeg.
