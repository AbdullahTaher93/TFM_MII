In a skillet, saute celery and onion in butter until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the poultry seasoning and sage. Place the bread cubes in a large bowl. Stir in celery mixture and chicken broth; mix lightly. Just before baking, stuff the chicken. Place on a rack in a roasting pan; tie the drumsticks together. Combine paprika, salt and pepper; rub over chicken. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours, basting every 30 minutes. Place the potatoes around chicken; cover and bake 1-1/2 hours longer or until potatoes are tender and a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees F-185 degrees F. Sprinkle with parsley. Reserve pan drippings and thicken for gravy if desired.
