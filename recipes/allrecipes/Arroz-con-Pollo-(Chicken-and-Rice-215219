Using paper towels, pat chicken dry. Season chicken with Adobo. Heat oil in caldero, or large heavy pot over medium heat. Cook chicken, in batches, until brown on all sides, 7-10 minutes; set aside. Stir onions, peppers and garlic into pot; cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add rice, bouillon and Sazon to pot; cook, stirring constantly, until rice is completely coated in oil mixture, about 1 minute. Stir in 3 cups water; bring to a boil. Add alcaparrado and chicken (skin-side up) to pot. Cover pot, reduce heat to low and simmer until water is absorbed, rice is tender and chicken is cooked through, about 25 minutes. To serve, using fork, fluff rice; garnish with pimiento strips and peas.
