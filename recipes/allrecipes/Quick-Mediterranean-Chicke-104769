Heat some oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Place the frozen chicken breasts in the pan, and season with salt, pepper, and Greek seasoning. Cook until the chicken is lightly browned and has fully cooked. Add the green beans, olives, tomatoes, and vinaigrette. Cover, and simmer for 10 minutes to heat the vegetables.
