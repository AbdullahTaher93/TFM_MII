Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place the spinach, eggs, dill, onion, feta cheese, cottage cheese, and black pepper into a large bowl, and mix well. Place 2 sheets of phyllo dough into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish, and drizzle with about 1 tablespoon of olive oil; top with 2 more sheets of phyllo dough. Spread the spinach filling evenly over the sheets of phyllo, pat it down gently, and top with 2 more sheets of phyllo. Drizzle with 1 more tablespoon of olive oil, and top with the remaining 2 phyllo sheets. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is browned and the filling is set, about 1 hour. To serve, cut into squares and top each square with a dollop of sour cream.
