Preheat the oven to 365 degrees F. Grease and flour an 8x3-inch loaf pan, set aside. In a medium bowl combine the eggs and Enova oil; mix well. Sift the dry ingredients into a large bowl. Gently stir the egg mixture into the dry ingredients. Fold the carrots, zucchini, walnuts (if used) and the raisins into the above mixture. Pour the mixture into the loaf pan and bake for about 55 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean. Remove from the oven to a wire rack; allow to cool for 5 minutes. Remove from pan and return to wire rack until completely cooled.
