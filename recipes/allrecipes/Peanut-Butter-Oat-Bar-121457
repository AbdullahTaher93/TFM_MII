In a mixing bowl, combine the butter, peanut butter, brown sugar, corn syrup and vanilla; gradually add the oats. Press into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, for topping, melt chips and peanut butter in a microwave or saucepan. Stir until blended; spread over warm bars. Cool completely; refrigerate for 2-3 hours before cutting.
