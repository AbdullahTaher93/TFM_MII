Combine the cider vinegar and sugar in a small saucepan; bring to a boil and cook until the volume is reduced to about 1 cup. Remove from heat and allow to cool completely. Mix the shoepeg corn, celery, black-eyed peas, green bell pepper, and avocado together in a bowl. Pour the cooled vinegar mixture over the corn mixture; gently toss to coat.
