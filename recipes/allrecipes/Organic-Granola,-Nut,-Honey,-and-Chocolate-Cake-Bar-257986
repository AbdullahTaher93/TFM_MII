Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with parchment paper and grease. Place 3/4 cup oats in a blender; blend to make oat flour. Combine oat flour, remaining oats, nuts, chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl. Mix honey, peanut butter, butter, water, and olive oil together in a separate bowl; stir into oat mixture until well coated. Press firmly across the baking sheet and into the corners. Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Cool to room temperature before cutting into bars.
