Place the potatoes, carrot, and onion in a large saucepan, and add enough water to bring the water level to about 2 inches. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. Mix in eggplant, broccoli, green beans, and zucchini; simmer for 2 minutes. Mix in tempeh, vegetable broth, crushed tomatoes, and garbanzo beans. Season with rosemary and garlic. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until veggies are tender. Ladle into bowls, and top with cheese.
