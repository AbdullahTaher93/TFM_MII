In a medium bowl, stir together oats and buttermilk until well coated. Set aside for 5 minutes. Stir in eggs until well blended. Stir in flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, and oil. Preheat a lightly oiled griddle or large frying pan, preferably nonstick. When pan is hot, drop batter, 1/4 cup per pancake, onto oiled surface. Immediately reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until bubbles appear on top and bottom is golden. Turn over and cook until cooked through.
