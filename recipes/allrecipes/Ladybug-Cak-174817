Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Generously grease or spray bottoms only of 1 1/2-quart round casserole or heatproof bowl and bottom only of 8x4-inch loaf pan. Make cake batter as directed on cake mix box. Pour half of the batter into casserole; pour remaining batter into loaf pan. Bake 38 to 45 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes. Run knife around sides of casserole and loaf pan to loosen cakes; remove from casserole and pan to cooling rack. Cool completely, about 1 hour. Wrap and freeze loaf cake for another use. Place cake, rounded side up, on serving plate. Frost with frosting. Make face on side of cake, using cookies for eyes, red gumdrop slice for nose, red shoestring licorice for mouth and black shoestring licorice for eyebrows and antennae. Sprinkle red sugar over cake to within 2 inches from curved edge of face. Place black gumdrop slices on cake for spots. Store loosely covered.
