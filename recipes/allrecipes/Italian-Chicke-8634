Season chicken with salt and pepper. In a skillet or saute pan, saute minced garlic in olive oil over medium heat. Add sliced breast meat, and brown. Reduce heat to low. Add wine, cover, and simmer for 35 minutes. Add olives, and let simmer for 10 minutes more. When ready to serve, add cherry tomatoes for a minute or two. They should not get mushy or split open, just get warm. Serve immediately.
