Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Mix dressing and 1/2 tsp. of the steak sauce. Stir in tomatoes; set aside. Mix meat, remaining steak sauce and onions. Shape into four (1/2-inch thick) oval patties. Cut baguette crosswise into 4 pieces. Cut each piece lengthwise in half. Grill patties 4 min. on each side or until cooked through (160 degrees F.) Top each patty with 2% Milk Singles. Add baguettes, cut-sides down, to grill. Continue grilling 1 min. or until baguettes are lightly toasted and 2% Milk Singles are melted. Fill baguettes with cheeseburgers; top with dressing mixture.
