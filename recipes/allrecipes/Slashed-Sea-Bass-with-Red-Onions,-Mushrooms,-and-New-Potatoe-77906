Preheat the oven broiler. Place new potatoes in a pot with enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Cook 10 minutes or until tender. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat, and saute the mushrooms and onion until tender. Sprinkle with lemon juice, and season with sea salt and cracked black pepper. Slash the sea bass fillets on both sides, and insert the chervil. Rub with chili oil, sea salt, and cracked black pepper. Place fillets on a baking sheet, and broil 5 minutes on each side, or until easily flaked with a fork. Drizzle with pesto sauce, and serve over new potatoes, mushrooms, and onion.
