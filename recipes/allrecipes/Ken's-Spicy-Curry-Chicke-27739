Over medium heat, whisk coconut milk and curry paste together in a large saucepan. Simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in chicken broth, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, bell pepper, mushrooms, and chicken. Season with fish sauce and basil. Simmer for 10 more minutes, or until chicken is cooked, yet still tender.
