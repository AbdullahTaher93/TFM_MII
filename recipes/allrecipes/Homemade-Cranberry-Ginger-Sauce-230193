Stir orange zest and juice, honey, crystallized ginger, cinnamon stick, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer. Stir cranberries into orange juice mixture, cover, and bring to a boil; let boil for 1 minute. Reduce heat to low. Simmer cranberry sauce until cranberries have popped, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and discard cinnamon stick. If a sweeter sauce is desired, stir in more honey. Serve warm or chilled.
