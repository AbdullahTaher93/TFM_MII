Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, carrot, broccoli, red bell pepper, and garlic in hot oil until garlic just begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Pour vegetable broth into the saucepan; add rice, sazon seasoning, and adobo seasoning and stir. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, about 25 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork to serve.
