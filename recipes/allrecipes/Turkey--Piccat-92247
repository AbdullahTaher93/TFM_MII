In a pie dish, stir flour with salt and pepper to taste. Dip both sides of turkey slices in flour. Pat between your hands to remove excess. In a large skillet, preferably nonstick, heat 2 teaspoons oil over high heat until very hot. Add half the turkey slices; the oil should sizzle. Saute until lightly browned on each side, about 2 minutes per side. Remove to a platter. Repeat with remaining oil and turkey, removing to platter. Reduce heat to medium. Remove pan from heat and stir in garlic, wine, broth, lemon juice, and dissolved cornstarch. Return to heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly until sauce thickens, about 2 minutes. Add turkey slices and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Transfer turkey slices to serving plates. Into sauce in pan, stir capers, parsley, and lemon slices. Spoon over turkey. Serve with pasta or rice.
