Mix tomato sauce, red wine vinegar, cumin, salt, sugar, and cayenne together in a small bowl. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add garlic; cook and stir until golden, about 2 minutes. Add eggplant and red bell pepper; pour in tomato sauce mixture. Simmer, covered, until eggplant and red bell pepper soften, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool, about 10 minutes. Transfer eggplant mixture to a food processor; pulse until it reaches the desired consistency. Sprinkle cilantro over dip.
