Combine bread crumbs, VOSKOS(R) Nonfat Blueberry Greek Yogurt, mustard, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add ground beef, mix well. Shape mixture into twelve small patties. For charcoal grill, place patties on the grill rack directly over medium coals; cover and grill for 8 to 10 minutes or until done (160 degrees F), turning once halfway through grilling and topping each burger with cheese the last minute of grilling time. (For gas grill, preheat grill. Reduce heat to medium. Place patties on grill rack over heat. Cover and grill as above.) Serve patties on buns with sliced onion.
