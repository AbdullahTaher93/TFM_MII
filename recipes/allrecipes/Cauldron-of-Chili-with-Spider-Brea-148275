In 12-inch skillet, cook beef and onions over medium-high heat 5 to 7 minutes stirring frequently until beef is thoroughly cooked. Drain. Stir in tomatoes, chili, beans and corn; heat to boiling. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Make an X shape using two pieces of dough. Pinch and twist the center where they meet to create a ball-shaped spider head. Place on baking sheet, spreading legs of X shape out from the spider body. Use scissors to cut the dough creating four more legs. Attach dough to body and splay all eight legs. Place 2 olive slices on each for eyes. Sprinkle with Italian seasoning. Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until golden brown. Top individual serving of chili with cheese and serve with warm spider breads.
