Combine ground cashews, rice cereal, sunflower seeds, nut butter, agave, oats, and flaxseed meal in the bowl of a stand mixer; blend until smooth. Press cashew mixture firmly into the prepared baking pan with a spatula. Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes.
