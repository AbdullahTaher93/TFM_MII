Place apples in an ungreased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Drizzle with lemon juice; toss to coat. Set aside. In a small saucepan, combine the apple juice, brown sugar, butter and cinnamon. Cook and stir over medium heat until sugar is dissolved and butter is melted. Pour over apples. Add cinnamon sticks if desired. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 20 minutes or until apples are tender. Discard cinnamon. Serve warm with whipped topping if desired.
