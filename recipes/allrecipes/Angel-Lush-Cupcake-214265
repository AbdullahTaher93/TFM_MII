Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Prepare cake batter as directed on package; pour into 30 paper-lined muffin cups, filling each cup 2/3 full. Bake 12 to 15 min. or until tops are golden brown and cracks feel dry. (Note: If baking in batches, refrigerate remaining batter in bowl until ready to pour into lined muffin cups and bake.) Cool cupcakes in pans 10 min.; remove to wire racks. Cool completely. Mix dry pudding mix and pineapple in medium bowl. Gently stir in COOL WHIP; spread onto cupcakes. Top with berries.
