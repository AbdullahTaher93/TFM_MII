Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a heavy bottomed Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook chicken and sausage separately in hot oil until well browned on both sides. Reserve browned chicken and sausages. Turn the heat to low. Make the roux by melting 2 tablespoons of margarine into the oil in the pot. Sprinkle the flour over the oil and margarine and cook, stirring constantly, until roux turns a nutty brown, about 10 minutes. Melt the remaining 3 tablespoons margarine into the roux. Stir in the onion, garlic, green pepper, and celery; cook for 10 minutes. Add the Worcestershire sauce, 1/4 cup chopped parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring often, for an additional 10 minutes. Pour the hot water into the pot and add the boullion cubes, chicken, and sausage. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 45 minutes before stirring in the tomatoes and okra. Cover pot and simmer for 1 hour. Stir in green onions and shrimp and top with 2 tablespoons chopped parsley before serving.
