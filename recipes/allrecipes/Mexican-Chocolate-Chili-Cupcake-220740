Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare cake mix as directed. You will have your cake batter in one bowl and filling (from pouch in cake mix package) in a second bowl. Add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to cake batter and mix well. Spoon cake batter into prepared cupcake liners and pan. Fill cupcake tins no more than half full. Spoon 1 teaspoon of filling on top of the batter in the tins. Cover filling with a tablespoon of batter. Your tins should now be 2/3 full. Bake cupcakes as directed and cool completely. Prepare frosting by adding 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to each container of frosting that you use. Mix completely and frost cupcakes. For a more decorative look, utilize a frosting bag to frost cupcakes.
