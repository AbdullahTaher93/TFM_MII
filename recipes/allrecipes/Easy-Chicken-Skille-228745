Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir chicken until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 5 minutes. Add water, ramen noodles, and 1 seasoning packet from ramen noodles; stir to combine. Stir garlic, red bell pepper, broccoli, green onions, parsley, and soy sauce into chicken-broth mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until broccoli is cooked and noodles are cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
