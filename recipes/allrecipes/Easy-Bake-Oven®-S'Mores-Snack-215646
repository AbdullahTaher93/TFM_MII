PREHEAT your EASY-BAKE(R) oven for 15 minutes. MIX THE DOUGH. Pour both cookie mixes and 2 teaspoons of water into a bowl. Stir until you form a dough. PREPARE A WORKSPACE. Spray the baking pan with cooking spray. Sprinkle flour onto your hands and a clean counter. Divide the dough into 5 equal parts. SHAPE ONE COOKIE. Roll one piece of dough between your hands and the counter to form ball. Flatten the ball into a cookie shape. DIVIDE THE COOKIE. Place the cookie into a baking pan. Use a fork to make a dotted line down the middle. BAKE THE COOKIE. Use the pan pusher to move one cookie into the oven. Bake for 8 minutes. After baking, use the pan pusher to move the cookie into the cooling chamber. Let it cool for 10 minutes. Now, prepare and bake the other cookies, using a clean pan each time. MIX THE CHOCOLATE. Pour one chocolate frosting mix and 1 teaspoon of water into a warming cup. Stir until smooth. If the mix is too thick, add an extra drop or two of water. WARM THE CHOCOLATE. Slide the warming cup into the warming chamber. Allow the frosting to warm, but do not let it get hot. MIX THE MARSHMALLOW. Pour one marshmallow creme mix and 2 1/2 teaspoons of water into a bowl. Stir until smooth. SEPARATE THE COOKIES. After the cookies have cooled, snap them apart on the dotted line you made with your fork. This will make 10 smaller cookies. Place them on a plate with the flat side facing up SPREAD THE LAYERS. Spread the warm chocolate onto half of the cookies. Spread the other half with marshmallow creme. Then press each side together. SERVE your s'mores with a glass of cold milk or a warm mug of cocoa.
