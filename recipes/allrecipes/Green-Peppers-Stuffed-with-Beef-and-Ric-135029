Cook the rice with the carrots according to the package directions. Preheat the broiler. Cut the tops off the bell peppers and scoop out the seeds. Rub the outside of the peppers with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil. Heat the remaining oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and brown the meat for about 5 minutes. Stir the rice and remaining ingredients into the pan for a minute, then stuff everything into the peppers. Broil the peppers until browned, about 5 minutes.
