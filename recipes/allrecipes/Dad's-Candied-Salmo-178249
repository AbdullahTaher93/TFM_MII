Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place the salmon onto a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil with the skin side down. Rub the mustard into the flesh of the salmon and then spread the brown sugar evenly over the fish. Squeeze the lemon over the salmon. Bring the edges of the foil together and seal into a packet. Bake in the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 25 to 30 minutes.
