COMBINE all Dry Spices ingredients in a small bowl. STIR together all Basting Sauce ingredients; cover and let stand 8 hours. Remove bay leaf. (Sauce is intended for basting ribs only.) BRING all Sweet Sauce ingredients to a boil in a Dutch oven. Reduce heat, and simmer sauce, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes. PLACE ribs in a large, shallow pan. Rub Dry Spices evenly over ribs. Cover and chill 3 hours. PREPARE a hot fire by piling charcoal or lava rocks on one side of grill, leaving other side empty. (For gas grill, light only one side.) Place food rack on grill. Arrange ribs over unlit side. GRILL ribs, covered with grill lid, over medium heat (300 degrees to 350 degrees) for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, basting every 30 minutes with Basting Sauce and turning occasionally. Brush ribs with Sweet Sauce the last 30 minutes.
