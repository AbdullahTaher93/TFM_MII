In a bowl, whisk the pudding mix and 1 cup of milk until smooth. Fold in whipped topping; cover and chill. In a blender container, combine oil, eggs, vanilla, sugar, flour, cocoa, salt and remaining milk; process until smooth. Let stand for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the first seven sauce ingredients in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until smooth and thickened, stirring constantly, abut 15 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in the butter and vanilla. Keep warm. Heat a lightly greased 6-in. skillet over medium heat until hot. Pour 3 tablespoons crepe batter into skillet and swirl quickly so bottom is evenly covered. Cook until top appears dry and bottom is lightly browned; turn and cook 15-20 seconds longer. Remove and keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter. To serve, fold crepes in quarters; place three on a dessert plate. Top with chilled pudding mixture and warm sauce.
