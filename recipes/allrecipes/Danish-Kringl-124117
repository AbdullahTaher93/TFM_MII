In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt; cut in butter until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Dissolve yeast in warm water; stir into flour mixture with warm milk and egg. Beat until smooth (dough will be very soft). Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours but not more than 24 hours. Punch dough down. Divide dough in half; refrigerate one half. On a well-floured surface, roll remaining half into a 15-in. x 6-in. rectangle. Combine filling ingredients. Spread half of the filling down center of rectangle in a 2-in. strip. Fold sides of dough over filling; overlapping 1-1/2-in.; pinch edges to seal. Shape into an oval; pinch ends together. Place seam side down on a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 15 minutes. Combine confectioners' sugar, water and vanilla; spread over the kringles. Sprinkle with nuts.
