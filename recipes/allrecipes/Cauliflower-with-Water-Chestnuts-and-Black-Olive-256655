Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add 1 teaspoon salt. Cook cauliflower chunks in the boiling water until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water. Cut into bite-size chunks. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Cook and stir garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add cauliflower; cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in water chestnuts and olives. Add water; cook until water evaporates, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
