Combine milk and marmalade in a saucepan over medium heat; heat until almost boiling. Add Cream of Wheat and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in half of the orange slices. Cover and let stand for 2 minutes, until most of the liquid has been absorbed and the cereal is creamy. Divide between 2 bowls, garnish with the remaining orange slices and serve.
