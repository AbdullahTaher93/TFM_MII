Remove and discard green tops from strawberries. Cut strawberries lengthwise in thirds, then cut a "V" in top of each strawberry half to resemble heart as shown in photo. Discard removed pieces. Spread crackers with chocolate, adding about 1/2 tsp. chocolate to each cracker. Place strawberry slices on chocolate; top with sprinkles. Refrigerate 5 minutes or until chocolate is firm.
