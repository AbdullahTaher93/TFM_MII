In a small bowl, combine the ground black pepper, parsley, Italian-style seasoning, garlic powder, crushed red pepper flakes, anise, paprika, minced onion flakes and salt; mix well. Place pork in a separate large bowl and add the spice mix to it. Mix this thoroughly with your hands. In a large skillet over medium high heat, saute the seasoned pork for 10 minutes, or until well browned and crumbly.
