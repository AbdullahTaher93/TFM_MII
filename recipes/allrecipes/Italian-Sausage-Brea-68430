Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch Bundt pan. Place the raisins in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 5 minutes; drain. In a large bowl, mix the sausage, brown sugar, white sugar, and eggs. Fold in the raisins and pecans. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, ginger, and pumpkin pie spice. Blend the coffee and baking soda in a small bowl, and mix into the flour mixture. Mix the moistened flour mixture into the sausage mixture. Transfer to the prepared pan. Bake 1 hour and 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
