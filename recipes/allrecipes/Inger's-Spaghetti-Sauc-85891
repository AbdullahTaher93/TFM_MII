Heat the olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Mix in onion and garlic, and cook 1 minute. Stir in the green bell pepper. Season with basil, oregano, and chicken bouillon. Stir in the tomato paste and crushed tomatoes, and season with poultry seasoning. Cook and stir 10 minutes. Mix sugar into the sauce. (Some people add up to 2 tablespoons sugar; I suggest starting with 1 teaspoon.) Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 3 to 4 hours.
