Place the potatoes into a 3-quart saucepan and add water to cover. Heat over medium-high heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15 minutes or until the potatoes are tender. Drain the potatoes well in a colander. Peel the potatoes. Return the potatoes to the saucepan. Mash the potatoes. Stir the potatoes, syrup, butter, lemon juice, ginger, nutmeg, black pepper and 3 tablespoons pecans in a medium bowl. Sprinkle with the remaining pecans. Serve with the cracker chips for dipping.
