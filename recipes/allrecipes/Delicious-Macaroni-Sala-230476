Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Cool cooked macaroni under cold running water and drain. Toss macaroni with ham, pickle relish, celery, black olives, red onion, mayonnaise, and Dijon mustard until thoroughly combined. Cover and chill before serving.
