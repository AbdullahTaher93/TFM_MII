Place eggs in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop. Grind the bologna and eggs in a meat grinder with a medium blade. In a large bowl, mix the bologna mixture with desired amount of creamy salad dressing and desired amount of sweet pickle relish. Refrigerate 2 to 3 hours, or until chilled.
