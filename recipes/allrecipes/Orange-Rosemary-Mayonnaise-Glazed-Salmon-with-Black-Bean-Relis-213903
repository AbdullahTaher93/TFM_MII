Combine beans, onion and jalapeno pepper in medium bowl. Season, if desired, with salt and pepper; set aside. Bring orange juice, honey, orange peel and rosemary to a boil over high heat in small saucepan. Cook, stirring occasionally, 8 minutes or until reduced to about 6 tablespoons. Remove from heat and let cool slightly; discard rosemary. Combine Hellmann's(R) or Best Foods(R) Real Mayonnaise with orange mixture in small bowl. Season, if desired, with salt and pepper to taste. Arrange salmon on baking sheet lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil, then brush both sides with 1/4 of the mayonnaise mixture and season, if desired, with salt and pepper. Broil, turning once, 8 minutes or until salmon flakes with a fork. Serve salmon topped with black bean relish and remaining mayonnaise mixture. Garnish, if desired, with additional rosemary.
