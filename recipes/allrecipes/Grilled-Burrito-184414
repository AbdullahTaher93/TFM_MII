Prepare Spanish rice as directed on package except-use olive oil and replace tomatoes with salsa. Remove from heat and stir in pinto beans. For each burrito, place 12-inch length of foil on work surface. Spray with cooking spray. Top with tortilla. Spoon about 3/4 cup rice on center of tortilla. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup cheese. Fold in sides and roll up burrito. Wrap in foil. Refrigerate for up to 3 days or until ready to cook. To heat, either grill foil-wrapped burrito 10 to 15 minutes or bake at 375 degrees F. for 20 minutes until hot.
