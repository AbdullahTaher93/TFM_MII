In a small skillet, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. In a bowl, combine the biscuit milk, cheese, oregano, onion and cilantro. Combine the egg and milk; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Stir in the sausage. Drop by heaping tablespoonfuls onto greased baking sheets. Bake at 425 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Serve warm. Refrigerate any leftovers.
