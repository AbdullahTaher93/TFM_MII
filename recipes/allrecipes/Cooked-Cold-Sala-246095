Heat bacon grease in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute Brussels sprouts and garlic until sprouts are slightly wilted and garlic is fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add chard and saute until slightly wilted, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. Mix Brussels sprouts mixture and kale together in a bowl. Add carrot, Romano cheese, green onions, and hemp seeds and mix well.
