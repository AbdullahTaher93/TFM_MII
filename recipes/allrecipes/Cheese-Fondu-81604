Vegetables should generally be blanched. Drop veggies into boiling water for 2 minutes; then remove from boiling water and plunge into iced water to stop the cooking and to keep colors crisp. Coarsely grate or chop the cheese. (Unpasteurized cheese is best) In a small cup or bowl mix the Kirsch with the guar gum. In a 2 qt. stainless steel sauce pan, rub the garlic onto the bottom and up the sides a little ways. Do the same for whatever you will use as a serving bowl (Step 7), then discard garlic. Add the Chardonnay and place over medium high heat. Once small bubbles start to form on the side of the pan, gradually add some cheese. Stir continuously until the fondue is completely finished. Do not let it boil, reduce heat if needed, but things will progress faster with higher heat. Keep adding the cheese in small doses until it is all melted. With your free hand (or a helper) add the Kirsch to the cheese, stirring vigorously for one minute. Do not boil: reduce heat if needed. Keep stirring until thickened; maybe 2-3 more minutes. Transfer to a fondue pot or chaffing dish on low heat. Place the veggies and meat in separate bowls or on a platter. Serve and enjoy.
