Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2 quart casserole dish. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add carrots and cook until tender but still firm, about 8 minutes; drain. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan. Saute onions and stir in soup, salt, pepper and cheese. Stir in cooked carrots. Transfer mixture to prepared dish. Toss croutons with 1/3 cup melted butter; scatter over casserole. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until heated through.
