Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir chicken, onion, green bell pepper, garlic, cream cheese, and 1 cup Monterey Jack cheese in hot oil until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes. Stir tomato sauce, chili powder, parsley, oregano, salt, and black pepper into the chicken mixture. Divide mixture evenly into tortillas, roll the tortillas around the filling, and arrange in a baking dish. Cover with enchilada sauce and remaining 1 cup Monterey Jack cheese. Bake in preheated oven until cheese topping melts and begins to brown, about 15 minutes.
