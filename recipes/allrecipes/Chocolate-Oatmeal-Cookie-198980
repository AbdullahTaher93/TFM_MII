Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine flour, oats, cocoa, baking powder, and salt. In bowl of electric mixer, beat margarine and SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend on medium speed 1 to 2 minutes, or until light and aerated. Beat in eggs for 1 minute, or until light. Beat in vanilla and almond extract. Stir in dry ingredients. Drop teaspoonfuls of dough onto lightly greased baking sheets and flatten each with the back of a fork dipped in water. Bake 8 to 10 minutes, or just until puffed and no longer shiny on top. Cool on sheets 5 minutes. Remove to wire racks; cool completely.
