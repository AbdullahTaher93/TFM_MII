Pour cold milk into large bowl. Add dry pudding mixes. Beat with wire whisk 2 min. or until well blended. (Mixture will be thick.) Spoon 1-1/2 cups of the pudding into pie crust. Top with marshmallows. Gently stir 1-1/2 cups of the whipped topping into remaining pudding; spoon over pie. Refrigerate 3 hours. Meanwhile, microwave chocolate in small microwaveable bowl on HIGH 1 min. Stir until melted. Cool slightly. Place melted chocolate in resealable plastic bag. Snip off small piece from one of the bottom corners of bag; squeeze chocolate into 10 desired shapes on wax paper-covered baking sheet. Refrigerate until firm. Top pie with remaining whipped topping just before serving. Garnish with crushed candy canes. Serve each slice with a chocolate decoration.
