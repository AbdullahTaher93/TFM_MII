Prepare macaroni and cheese according to package directions, but use 2% milk and light margarine. In a large nonstick skillet, brown the meat and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder over medium-high heat. Drain off the grease. Stir the beef, corn, and tomato sauce into the prepared macaroni and cheese and heat through.
