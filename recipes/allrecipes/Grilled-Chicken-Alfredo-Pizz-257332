Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a pizza pan with cooking spray. Cook and stir ground chicken in a skillet over medium heat until browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Season with garlic salt, salt, and pepper. Remove from heat and let cool. Roll out pizza dough and press into the greased pizza pan. Spread Alfredo sauce evenly over dough. Sprinkle green onions over sauce. Spread cooked chicken on top. Cover with mozzarella cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is a deep golden brown, 13 to 17 minutes.
