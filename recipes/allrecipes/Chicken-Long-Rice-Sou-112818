Place chicken, chicken broth, salt, and ginger into a large pot. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the chicken is tender and no longer pink, about 35 minutes. Remove chicken, and strain broth into a new pot. Discard the solids. Fill a bowl with hot tap water. Add the long rice noodles, and let sit for 30 minutes to soften. Stir onion into the broth, and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Meanwhile, remove the skin and bones from the chicken and discard. Roughly chop the meat and set aside. Add the noodles, chicken meat, green onion and bok choy; simmer until noodles are tender. After the noodles have sat for 30 minutes, stir in the chicken meat, green onion, and bok choy. Reheat and serve.
