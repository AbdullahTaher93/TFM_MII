Combine cranberries, sugar, orange juice, orange, apple, raisins, and cinnamon in a large sauce pan. Cover saucepan with lid. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and cook at a simmer until all the cranberries have burst, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool until thickened.
