Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine potatoes and leek in a food processor; process until mashed. Add eggs, flaxseed meal, and salt; pulse until incorporated. Spoon potato mixture onto the lined baking sheet. Flatten gently into 3-inch circles. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top. Bake in the preheated oven until Parmesan cheese is melted and golden brown, about 20 minutes.
