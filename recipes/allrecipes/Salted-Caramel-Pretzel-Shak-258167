Place milk, vodka, 2 teaspoons caramel sauce, and sea salt in a blender; pulse and add ice cream. Blend just until shake is smooth and thick, adding more ice cream for a thicker shake. Drop pretzels into the shake as the blender is running and blend until smooth. Drizzle remaining 1 teaspoon caramel around the inside of 2 glasses. Pour shake into glasses.
