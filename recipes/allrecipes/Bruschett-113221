Heat the broiler. Put the bread on a baking sheet and brush both sides with the oil. Sprinkle with the salt. Broil, turning once, until the bread is brown on the outside but still slightly soft in the center, about 3 minutes. Alternatively (and more traditionally), grill the bread. Cut each slice of bread into quarters.
