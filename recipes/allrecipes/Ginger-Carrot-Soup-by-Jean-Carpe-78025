In a large pot, saute onions in olive oil until soft. Add carrots, broth, ginger and cinnamon. Simmer until carrots are thoroughly cooked, 30-40 minutes. Transfer to a blender or food processor and process until smooth. Stir in juice and half-and-half. Serve warm or chilled, garnished with snippets of chives.
