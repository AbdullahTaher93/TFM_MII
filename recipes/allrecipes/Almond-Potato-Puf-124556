Cook potatoes in boiling water until tender, about 15 minutes; drain and place in a mixing bowl. In a skillet, saute onion in butter until tender; add to potatoes. On low speed, beat in eggs, one at a time, until smooth. Beat in cream (the mixture will be thin). Add the ground almonds, salt and nutmeg. Spoon into a greased 1-1/2-qt. baking dish. Sprinkle with the cheese and slivered almonds. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes.
