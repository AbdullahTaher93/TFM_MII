Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook carrots in boiling water until tender, 3 to 5 minutes; drain. Stir celery, bell pepper, tomato soup, green onion, white vinegar, sugar substitute, and Worcestershire sauce together in a large bowl; fold carrots into the mixture. Refrigerate at least 4 hours before serving.
