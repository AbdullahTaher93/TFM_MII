In a bowl, combine the flours, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, combine the egg, milk, honey and butter. Stir mixture into the dry ingredients just until combined. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
