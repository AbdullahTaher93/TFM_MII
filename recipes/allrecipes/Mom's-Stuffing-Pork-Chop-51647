Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Brown chops, turning once, and transfer to a shallow baking dish. Add water, and cover. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. When chops are almost done, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir celery and onions until onions are translucent. Stir in bread crumbs, corn, poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, then spoon stuffing over chops and return to the oven. Bake, uncovered, for 15 minutes more, or until no longer pink in the center.
