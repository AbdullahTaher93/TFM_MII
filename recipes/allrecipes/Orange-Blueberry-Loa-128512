Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease and flour one 8 1/2 inch X 4 1/2 inch (22 x 12-cm) loaf pan. In a small bowl, toss together the blueberries and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of flour. In a medium bowl, combine the cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and the remaining 1 3/4 cups (420 mL) of flour. In a large bowl, with an electric mixer on high speed, beat the butter and sugar for 3 minutes, or until light and fluffy. Add the egg and beat well. Beat in the orange juice and orange peel. Add the flour mixture and, with the mixer on low speed, beat until well-blended. Stir in the blueberries. Spread into the prepared pan. Bake for 55 to 65 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool on a rack for 5 minutes. Remove from the pan and cool completely on the rack.
