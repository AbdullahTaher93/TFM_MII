In large saute pan, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add sausage and sear until browned. Remove and reserve. (Alternatively, grill sausage for different flavor profile.) Add pearl onions and cook until lightly caramelized. Add garlic and jalapeno, cooking for 1 minute more. Add sweet corn, edamame, roasted red peppers and cherry tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Saute briefly to warm through. Add red wine vinegar along with fresh herbs. Adjust seasoning if necessary. Add grilled okra and reserved sausage. Garnish with fresh lemon zest.
