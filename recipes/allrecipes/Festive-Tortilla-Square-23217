Place cream cheese and milk in small bowl. Beat on medium speed, scraping bowl often, until smooth (1 to 2 minutes). Stir in jalapeno cheese, green onions and 1/4 cup ripe olives by hand. Spread 1/3 cup cream cheese mixture over 1 tortilla. Top with another tortilla; spread with 1/3 cup cream cheese mixture. Repeat layering with remaining tortillas and cream cheese mixture, ending with tortilla. Wrap tightly in plastic food wrap; refrigerate at least 1 hour. Cut into 1-inch squares. Top each square with cream cheese dollop and choice of toppings: cream cheese, ripe olive slices, cherry tomato slices or green olive slices.
