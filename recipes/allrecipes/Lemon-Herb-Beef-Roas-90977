Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Combine parsley, olive oil, garlic, lemon peel, and pepper; press 1/2 of the seasoning onto beef roast. Combine the remaining seasoning with the potatoes, carrots, onions, and zucchini in large bowl; toss. Place roast on rack in shallow roasting pan. Insert ovenproof meat thermometer so tip is centered in thickest part of beef, not resting in fat. Do not add water or cover. Roast for 1 3/4 to 2 hours for medium rare; 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 hours for medium doneness. After 1/2 to 1 hour, place vegetables, except zucchini, on rack around roast. Remove roast when meat thermometer registers 140degrees F for medium rare; 155 degrees F for medium. Transfer to board; tent with foil. Let stand 15 to 20 minutes. (Temperature will continue to rise about 5 degrees F to reach 145 degrees F for medium rare; 160 degrees F for medium.) Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F. Add zucchini to vegetables on rack; roast 15 to 20 minutes or until tender. Carve roast; serve with vegetables. Season with salt.
