Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. In a small bowl combine 1 cup chickpeas, 1 tablespoon oil, and salt; spread in an even layer in a 15x10x1-inch baking pan. Roast chickpeas about 30 minutes or until browned and crisp, stirring once halfway through roasting; cool completely. In a food processor blend remaining chickpeas until finely processed; set aside. In a large pot bring 4 to 6 quarts of water to a rolling boil; add salt to taste and the Penne; stir gently. Cook pasta according to package directions; remove from heat and drain well, reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan heat 2 teaspoons oil over medium heat; saute zucchini for 2 to 3 minutes; remove zucchini from pan and set aside. In the same saucepan stir together the Roasted Garlic sauce and processed chickpeas; bring to a very low simmer. While pasta is draining, pour Roasted Garlic sauce mixture into large pot; stir in zucchini and 1 tablespoon rosemary; stir in pasta. Stir in up to 1 cup of the reserved cooking liquid until desired consistency is reached; serve immediately topped with roasted chickpeas and crumbled feta.
