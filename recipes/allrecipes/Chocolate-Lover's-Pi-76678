Flour dough lightly. Roll into circle between sheets of waxed paper on dampened countertop. Peel off top sheet. For single crust, trim one inch larger than inverted 9-inch pie plate. Flip into pie plate. Remove other sheet and press pastry to fit. Fold edge under. Flute. Make the filling: Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a large mixing bowl, using an electric mixer, blend CRISCO(R) and sugar at medium speed until light and fluffy. Blend in eggs, one at a time. With a wooden spoon, stir in melted chocolate, espresso powder and vanilla until smooth. Add flour and nuts and stir until combined. Assemble the pie: Transfer filling mixture to pie crust.
