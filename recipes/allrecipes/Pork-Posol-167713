Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add pork and cook, stirring once, until just browned on one or two sides, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate using a slotted spoon. Reduce heat to medium-low; add onion and 2 tablespoons water. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft and golden brown and any moisture has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in garlic, cumin and coriander and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Whisk in the remaining 2 cups water, broth and cornmeal. Bring to a simmer over high heat, stirring often. Add hominy, chiles, pepper and salt; return to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring often, until the onion is very soft and the mixture is thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in lime juice to taste. Return the pork and any accumulated juices to the pot; cook, stirring occasionally, until the pork is just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes.
