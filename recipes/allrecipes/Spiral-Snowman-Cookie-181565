Heat oven to 375 degrees F. In medium bowl, stir cookie mix, flour, butter and egg until soft dough forms. On lightly floured surface, place heaping tablespoon of dough; roll dough into a 10-inch rope. On ungreased cookie sheet, loosely coil 1 end of rope into circle to make head. Loosely coil other end of rope in opposite direction for body. Repeat with remaining dough, placing cookies about 2 inches apart. Sprinkle each cookie with coarse sugar.
