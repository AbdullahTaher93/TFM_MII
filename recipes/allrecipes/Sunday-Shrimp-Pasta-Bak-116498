Cook vermicelli according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, saute the green pepper, onions and garlic in butter until tender. Gradually stir in flour until blended. Stir in the shrimp, celery salt and pepper; cook, uncovered, over medium heat for 5-6 minutes or until heated through. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the process cheese, tomatoes and mushrooms. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 3-4 minutes or until cheese is melted, stirring occasionally. Add to shrimp mixture. Drain vermicelli; stir into skillet. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until heated through.
