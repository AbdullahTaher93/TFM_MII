Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling water until done. Drain. Mix mushroom soup, broth, and poultry seasoning in a saucepan. Heat through. Beat together the cheeses, sour cream, and mayonnaise. Stir in olives, onions, green pepper and parsley. Place half of the noodles in a 9 x 13 inch pan. Layer with 1/2 cheese mixture, 1/2 chicken, and 1/2 mushroom soup mixture. Repeat. Top with crumbs. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 minutes, or until heated through.
