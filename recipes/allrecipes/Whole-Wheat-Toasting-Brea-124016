In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add warm milk, sugar, shortening, egg, salt and 2 cups of flour; beat until smooth. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours. Punch dough down. Divide into thirds; roll each into a 12-in. rope. Braid ropes; place in a greased 8-1/2-in. x 4-1/2-in. x 2-1/2-in. loaf pan. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes. Remove from pan and brush with melted butter. Cool on a wire rack.
