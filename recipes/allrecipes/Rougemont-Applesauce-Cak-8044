Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch square cake pan. Line the bottom of the pan with wax paper, or dust lightly with flour. Sir together flour, baking powder, salt, and spices. In a large bowl, cream shortening. Blend in brown sugar, beating until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Stir flour mixture into creamed mixture alternately with applesauce; make 3 dry and 2 liquid additions, combining lightly after each. Turn batter into prepared pan. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until cake springs back when lightly touched.
