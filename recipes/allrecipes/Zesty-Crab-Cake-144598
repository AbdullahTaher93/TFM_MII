Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; sprinkle with 2 tablespoons cornmeal. Whisk next 9 ingredients in a large bowl. Gently mix in crab, peppers, and breadcrumbs. For each crab cake, shape 1/3 cup crab mixture into a patty; place on prepared sheet. Sprinkle with remaining cornmeal. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate 15 minutes. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook crab cakes in batches, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Serve with lemon.
