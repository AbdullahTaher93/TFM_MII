Stir the broth, thyme and black pepper in a small bowl. Brush the vegetables with the broth mixture. Lightly oil the grill rack and heat the grill to medium. Grill the vegetables for 10 minutes or until they're tender-crisp, turning over once during grilling and brushing often with the broth mixture.
