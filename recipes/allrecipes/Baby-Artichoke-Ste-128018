Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Squeeze 1 lemon half into a large bowl of cold water. Trim off stem and top quarter of each artichoke. Using a sharp paring knife, peel off outer green leaves until you reach pale inner leaves. Place in lemon water as you finish. Cut artichokes in half lengthwise. Squeeze remaining lemon half into boiling water and add a pinch of salt. Cook artichokes 10 minutes, until just tender. Drain in colander and dry on paper towels. Heat 1 tablespoon butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and cook, stirring, until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add artichokes and cook 2 minutes. Add peas, asparagus, 3 tablespoons water, and salt to taste. Simmer, stirring, until just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add herbs and cook 1 minute. Stir in remaining butter. Serve immediately.
