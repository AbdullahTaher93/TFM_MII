Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil; cook the angel hair pasta in boiling water until the pasta has cooked through yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pimentos, lemon juice, vinegar, sugar, 1 tablespoon parsley, basil, oregano, garlic powder, and onion powder to the oil and stir; cook until the herbs are heated and fragrant. Stir the Parmesan cheese into the mixture. Add the pasta to the skillet and toss to evenly coat with the seasonings. Season with salt and pepper, garnish with remaining parsley, and serve hot.
