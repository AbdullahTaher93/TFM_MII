Combine 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 clove garlic; brush over both sides of bread slices. Grill bread 2 to 3 minutes per side in a ridged grill pan or broil 1 to 2 minutes per side until lightly toasted. Reserve outer leaves of lettuce. Tear or chop enough of the inner leaves to measure 6 cups. In a large bowl, combine torn lettuce, olives, tomato and beans. Cut grilled bread into cubes; add to lettuce mixture. Combine remaining 3 tablespoons oil, remaining garlic, vinegar, salt and pepper; mix well. Add to lettuce mixture; toss well. Arrange outer leaves of lettuce on four serving plates; top with salad. Sprinkle basil over salads, if desired.
