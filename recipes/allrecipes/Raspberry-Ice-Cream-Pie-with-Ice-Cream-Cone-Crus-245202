Prepare a 9-inch spring form pan with a layer of parchment paper on the bottom and around the sides. To help parchment paper stick to the sides, spray with a touch of cooking spray. Place all but one ice cream cone into a food processor and pulse into crumbs. Add in melted butter and dash of salt and pulse to combine. Press mixture into prepared pan and refrigerate while making ice cream. In a large bowl, whip the condensed milk and thawed whipped topping together. Add in half the raspberry fruit filling and stir to combine. Pour into prepared sugar cone crust. Use a small amount of the remaining raspberry fruit filling to add swirls to the top with a toothpick or knife (leave some fruit filling for serving). Freeze 4-6 hours or overnight for best results. Top with fresh whipped cream and raspberries. Make the whipped cream extra thick by adding more powdered sugar. Use an ice cream scoop to put a "scoop" of thickened whipped cream in the center of the pie, then place reserved sugar cone on top. Add additional raspberry fruit filling to decorate.
