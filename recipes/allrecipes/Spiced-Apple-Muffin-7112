Mix together sugar, cinnamon, ginger, and anise seeds. In a large bowl, mix flour, baking powder, sugar mixture, salt, milk, and applesauce. Do not overbeat. Stir in diced apples. Spoon batter into 12 greased muffin cups. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 20 to 25 minutes, or until tops spring back when lightly touched. Serve after muffins have cooled a bit, about 30 minutes.
