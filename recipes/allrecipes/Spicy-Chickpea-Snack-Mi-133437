Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl, mix the curry powder with the brown sugar and salt. Add the chickpeas and toss well to coat. Bake the chickpeas on a parchment paper lined baking sheet, stirring occasionally, until crunchy, about 60 minutes. Remove the chickpeas from the oven and let cool, then toss with the orange zest and raisins.
