Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix chili and tomato sauce together in a bowl. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook corn tortillas, one at a time, in the hot oil until slightly softened, about 30 seconds per side. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Place 1 hot dog and 2 to 3 tablespoons of the chili mixture on each tortilla; wrap up. Arrange seam-side down in a baking dish. Spoon remaining chili mixture on top. Cover with Cheddar cheese, onion, and olives. Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbly, about 30 minutes.
