Rinse the chicken and pierce deeply with a fork or knife. Place chicken in a large plastic baggie with the marinade ingredients. Marinade for at least 1 hour or overnight. Turn the bag occasionally to be sure that the chicken gets well coated. The topping can be made while the chicken is cooking or at the same time as the marinade and then refrigerated until ready to use. However, the topping is best at room temperature when served. Chop the olives, capers and parsley. Mince the shallots and bell peppers and toss with the olives. Add fresh cracked black pepper and olive oil, toss well. Put the chicken and marinade in a deep casserole dish (you want a snug fit). Add water (or chicken stock) to almost cover the chicken, if needed. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10 minutes then reduce heat to 300 degrees F and poach for 50 minutes. To serve, transfer the chicken to a serving platter discarding most of the cooking liquids. Top with the olive mixture. Cover with aluminum foil and let rest for 5-7 minutes before serving. It can be kept in a warm oven (180 degrees F or less) for up to 15 minutes, if desired.
