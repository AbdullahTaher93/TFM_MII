Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Beat applesauce, butter, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla together in a bowl until smooth. Mix flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a separate bowl; stir into the applesauce mixture. Fold oats, cranberries, and chocolate chips into the batter; drop by oversized spoonful onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Let cookies cool on pans for a few minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
