In a bowl, pour boiling water over oats; let stand for 5 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugars. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt; add to the creamed mixture alternately with the oat mixture until combined. Transfer to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, bring the brown sugar, butter and milk to a boil over medium heat. Remove from the heat; stir in coconut, nuts and vanilla. Pour over warm cake. Cool completely.
