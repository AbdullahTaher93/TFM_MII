Blend 1 package dough, green dye, and mint extract until uniformly colored. Blend red dye into remaining dough (no mint extract). Divide red and green dough into 2 pieces each; shape each into a 1/2-inch-thick disk; cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm (at least 1 hour). On a lightly floured work surface, roll 1 piece red dough into a 5- by 12-inch rectangle. Repeat with 1 piece green dough. Place green rectangle on top of red rectangle; roll into a log shape, along long side of rectangle. Repeat with remaining 2 pieces dough. Cover all dough with plastic wrap; freeze until firm (at least 1 hour). Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Unwrap chilled dough. With a sharp knife, slice each log into roughly 1/3-inch-thick slices (24 per log); place 2 inches apart on parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake just until edges brown, about 15 minutes.
