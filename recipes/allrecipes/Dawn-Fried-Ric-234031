Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, 1 dash soy sauce, 1 tablespoon teriyaki sauce, and 1 tablespoon curry powder in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir mushrooms and frozen vegetables into beef; reduce heat to medium-low and cook and stir until heated through, about 2 minutes. Fold rice into beef mixture; stir in remaining soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, and curry powder. Add cumin; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.
