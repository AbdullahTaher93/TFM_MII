Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Combine chili sauce and cranberry sauce in medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking occasionally, until smooth. Reserve one-third of sauce mixture. Arrange drumettes on baking sheet coated with non-stick spray. Bake for 15 minutes. Turn drumettes over. Brush with remaining sauce mixture until well coated. Bake for additional 20 to 30 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. Serve hot with reserved sauce for dipping.
