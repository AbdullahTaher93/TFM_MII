Place salmon in a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray; sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon dill. Cover and bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the yogurt, sugar, seasoning blend and remaining dill. Cook and stir over low heat until warmed. Serve with the salmon.
