Directions for cake: Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Spray two 9 x 2-inch round cake pans with CRISCO(R) No Stick Cooking Spray. Line bottoms with rounds of wax paper or parchment paper and spray again. Combine chocolate chips and hot coffee in a bowl. Let mixture stand, whisking occasionally, until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Whisk together sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Beat, in the bowl of an electric mixer, eggs until thick and yellow, about 3-5 minutes. Slowly add CRISCO(R) Oil, buttermilk, vanilla and melted chocolate mixture to eggs, beating until combined well. Add dry ingredients and beat on medium speed until just combined well. Divide batter between pans and bake in middle of oven until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 45-55 minutes. Cool layers in pans on racks for 30-45 minutes. Run a thin knife around edges of pans and invert layers onto racks. Carefully remove wax paper and cool layers completely. Cake layers may be made 1 day ahead and kept, wrapped well in plastic wrap, at room temperature. Directions for icing: Whisk together, in a 1-1/2- to 2-quart saucepan, the cream, sugar and corn syrup. Bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking until sugar is dissolved. Remove pan from heat and add chocolate chips, whisking until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Cut Butter Flavored CRISCO(R) into 3 pieces and add to frosting, whisking until smooth. Transfer icing to a bowl and chill until spreadable, about 30 minutes. Spread icing between cake layers and over top and sides.
