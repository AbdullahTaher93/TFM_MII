Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the chicken legs in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange potatoes, carrots, garlic, and squash around the chicken. Top with onion slices. Season with parsley, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Place 1/2 tablespoon butter on each chicken leg. Pour water into pan to a level of about 1/2 inch. Cover pan with foil and cook 1 hour in the preheated oven. Remove foil and continue cooking 20 minutes, until vegetables are tender and chicken juices run clear.
