Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add chicken and return to a boil; reduce heat and simmer about 10 minutes, until chicken is no longer pink inside. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and cool 5 minutes before slicing into long strips. While the chicken rests, squeeze juice from one orange and measure out 1/4 cup into a small bowl. (Reserve any remaining juice for another use.) Whisk juice with vinegar and oil. Add salt and pepper to taste. Transfer sliced chicken to a medium bowl and toss with a few tablespoons of the dressing. Season to taste with salt and pepper. With a sharp knife, remove the orange peel and white pith from remaining 4 oranges. Slice oranges crosswise into thin rounds. Discard seeds. In a large bowl, toss the onion and watercress with remaining vinaigrette. Divide between bowls and top with warm chicken, oranges, and avocado.
