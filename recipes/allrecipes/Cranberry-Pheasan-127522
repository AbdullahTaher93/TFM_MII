Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange the pheasant pieces in a lightly greased shallow baking dish. In a medium bowl, stir together the onion soup mix, cranberry sauce and Catalina dressing. Pour the sauce over the pheasant. Cover the dish with a lid or aluminum foil. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until meat comes easily off the bone.
