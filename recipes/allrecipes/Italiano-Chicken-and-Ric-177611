Cook the chicken and garlic in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until it's well browned, stirring often. Remove the chicken from the skillet. Add the stock, tomatoes, Italian seasoning and rice to the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 15 minutes. Stir in the cheese. Return the chicken to the skillet. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the rice is tender.
