Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In the container of a food processor or blender, combine the walnuts, garlic, onions, celery and parsley. Pulse until finely chopped. Add the bread crumbs, seafood seasoning, eggs and oil; process until smooth. Roll the mixture into 2 inch balls and place on a baking sheet. Flatten them slightly to keep them from rolling off. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a deep brown color.
