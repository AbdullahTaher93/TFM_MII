Bring a half filled medium saucepan of water to boil. Place jalapeno peppers in the water 10 to 15 minutes, until tender. Drain and cool. Blot dry interiors of the jalapeno peppers with a paper towel. Fill each jalapeno pepper half with approximately 1/2 ounce cream cheese. In a small bowl, whisk together eggs, 1/4 teaspoon salt and vegetable oil. In another small bowl, mix remaining salt, flour, garlic powder, paprika and onion powder. Place cornflakes cereal crumbs in a third small bowl. One at a time, dip the jalapeno pepper halves into the egg mixture, the flour mixture, the egg mixture again, and finally the cornflakes cereal crumbs. Place coated peppers in a medium dish. Freeze approximately 2 hours. Heat oil in a large, deep skillet over medium high heat. Fry the frozen peppers 3 to 4 minutes each, until dark golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve.
