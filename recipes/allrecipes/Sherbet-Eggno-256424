Beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until thick and foamy, about 5 minutes. Stir in sweetened condensed milk, rum, vanilla extract, aromatic bitters, and salt. Freeze for 1 hour. Pour egg mixture into a punch bowl. Add small scoops of orange sherbet; sprinkle nutmeg on top.
