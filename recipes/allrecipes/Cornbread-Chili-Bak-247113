Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Spread chili evenly over the bottom of the dish. Arrange processed cheese in a single layer over the chili. Mix cornbread mix with water in a large bowl until smooth. Spread evenly over processed cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until chili is heated through and cornbread topping is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
