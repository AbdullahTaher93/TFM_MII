Rinse beef, and place in large bowl. Pour in orange juice, wine, oil and pepper sauce. Season with bay leaves, garlic, paprika, allspice, salt and pepper. Mix, to coat beef. Cover, and refrigerate overnight. Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook beef and marinade until beef shreds easily, about 1 hour. Add water as needed.
