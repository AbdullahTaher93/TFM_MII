Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a medium bowl, cream the butter, egg yolk and anise extract until light. Stir in the 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar and flour until blended. Shape dough into crescents and place 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven. Dust heavily with confectioners' sugar before they are completely cool.
