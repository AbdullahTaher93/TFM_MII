To make the matzo balls, in a large bowl with a fork, mix the eggs, oil, broth, garlic and onion powders, pepper, nutmeg, and salt until well blended. Mix in the matzo meal until well blended. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 or up to 24 hours. Bring 4 quarts of salted water to a boil in a 5- to 6-quart pan. Reduce heat to a simmer. You will need two oiled plates to hold the cold matzo balls. Spray the inside of a 1/2-inch-diameter ice cream scoop with a mechanical release liberally with cooking oil spray. Scoop a mound of matzo batter into the scoop. Wet your free hand, then use it to round the upper portion of the mixture (to match the bottom of the scoop.) Release the matzo ball onto a plate. Lightly roll it with wet or oiled hands to shape, if desired. Repeat with remaining batter, working quickly so the matzo balls do not get overworked and warm; you will have about 24. You may want to put one plate in the refrigerator as you fill the second plate. One at a time, gently put the matzo balls into the simmering water; cover immediately. Cook at a simmer for 20 minutes. Do not lift the cover until the matzo balls are done, or their centers will be tough. Using a slotted spoon, gently lift out each matzo ball. Drain well and put into an airtight container. With the container lid ajar to release steam, cool the matzo balls to room temperature. Refrigerate matzo balls , tightly covered, up to 2 days, or freeze up to 3 months. When ready to serve, defrost balls overnight in the refrigerator or in the microwave, covered, at 30% power for about 5 minutes. To make the soup, in a 6- to 8-quart pan, bring chicken broth to a boil. Add carrot and boil for about 10 minutes to soften. Turn the heat down to a simmer, gently add defrosted matzo balls, cover, and cook for 10 minutes until the balls are heated through. Fill each of 8 to 10 soup bowls with equal amounts of soup, 2 or more matzo balls, and a sprinkling of green onion. Serve immediately.
