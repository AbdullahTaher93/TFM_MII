Lightly oil a grill rack or broiler-pan rack. Preheat the grill or broiler. Place the cumin in a small skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes, or until fragrant and darker in color. Place in a small bowl and let cool. Remove 1 teaspoon toasted cumin and place in a medium bowl. To the small bowl, add the garlic, 2 tablespoons of the lime juice, the black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and mix well. Place the steak on the prepared rack and rub the cumin mixture over both sides of the steak. Let stand at room temperature. Meanwhile, in the medium bowl with the reserved cumin, combine the tomato, chiles, scallions, the remaining 1 tablespoon lime juice, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Let stand at room temperature. Grill or broil the steak for 4 minutes per side, or until a thermometer inserted in the center registers 145 degrees F for medium-rare. Place the steak on a cutting board and let stand for 5 minutes. Cut the steak into thin slices and serve with the salsa.
