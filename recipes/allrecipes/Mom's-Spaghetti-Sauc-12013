In a large skillet cook ground beef with the chopped onions, parsley, and olive oil. Cook until onions are soft and ground beef is cooked through. In a large saucepan, combine tomato juice, tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt, ground black pepper, and garlic. Add ground beef mixture and simmer for 1 hour.
