Scramble eggs and add in salt, pepper, oregano and basil to taste. Lay pizza crust on a cookie sheet and preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place the scrambled eggs on the pizza crust and place a thin layer of shredded mozzarella cheese on top. Then, finely slice red onion and place on top of the cheese. Bake the pizza for 8minutes at 350. Remove the pizza from the oven and place, big pieces of sliced avocado on top. Enjoy!
