Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a bowl, mix together the olive oil, brown sugar, lemon juice, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, oregano, thyme, salt, and black pepper until thoroughly combined. Add the broccoli florets, and toss until evenly coated with the seasoning. Spread the broccoli florets out onto an baking sheet with a rim. Bake in the preheated oven until the broccoli is just browned on the top, 10 to 15 minutes.
