Preheat the broiler. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown but still soft. Drain, slice into thirds and set aside. Slice each tomato into 6 slices, then halve the slices. Halve the onion slices. Cut the cheese slices into thirds. On a large baking sheet, arrange the bread slices in a single layer. Top with cheese, tomato, onion and bacon. Broil 5 minutes, or until the bacon is golden brown.
