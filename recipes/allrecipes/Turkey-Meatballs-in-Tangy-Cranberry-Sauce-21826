Mix turkey, bread crumbs, milk, salt, 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, the pepper, onion and egg. Shape mixture into twenty 1 1/2-inch meatballs. Heat oil in 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Cook meatballs in oil about 10 minutes, turning occasionally, until brown. Stir remaining ingredients into skillet with meatballs. Heat to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer uncovered about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until meatballs are no longer pink in center.
