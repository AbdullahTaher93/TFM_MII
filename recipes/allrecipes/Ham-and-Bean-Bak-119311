In a large skillet, saute onion, green pepper and garlic in butter until tender. Stir in ham, beans, tomatoes, tomato sauce, chili powder, mustard, salt, pepper and hot pepper sauce. Bring to a boil. Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, combine the milk, egg and oil; stir in corn. Add to cornmeal mixture just until combined. Transfer the hot bean mixture to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Drop corn bread batter by spoonful over the top. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until bubbly and a toothpick inserted near the center of topping comes out clean.
