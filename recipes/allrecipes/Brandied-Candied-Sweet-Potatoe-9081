Peel and cut the sweet potatoes into 2 inch chunks. Place them in a large pot of water and boil until tender. In a large skillet melt the butter or margarine. Stir in the brown sugar, brandy and salt. Stir until smooth. Add the sweet potatoes. Cook over low heat, stirring gently, until sweet potatoes are heated through and well glazed.
