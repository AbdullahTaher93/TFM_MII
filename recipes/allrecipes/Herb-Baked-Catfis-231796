Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange catfish fillets in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Combine parsley, paprika, thyme, oregano, basil, and black pepper in a small bowl; sprinkle herb mixture over fish. Mix lemon juice, butter, and garlic powder in another bowl; drizzle butter mixture over fish. Bake in preheated oven until fish is easily flaked with a fork, about 20 minutes.
