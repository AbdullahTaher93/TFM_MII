In a bowl, combine the first three ingredients. Crumble beef over the mixture and mix well. On a large piece of heavy-duty foil, pat beef mixture into a 10-in. x 8-in. rectangle. Combine the stuffing mix, celery, mayonnaise, water and curry powder; spoon down center of rectangle. Bring long sides over stuffing mixture, peeling foil away while folding. Seal edge and ends. Place seam side down in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, heat preserves; stir to break up pieces of fruit. Spread over the meat loaf. Bake 10-15 minutes longer or until meat is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F.
