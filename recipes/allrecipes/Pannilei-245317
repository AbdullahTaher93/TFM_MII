Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray baking sheet with cooking spray and line with parchment paper. Place bacon in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until cooked through but not browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Grate potatoes, onions, and carrots in a food processor; transfer to a large bowl and mix to combine. Stir cooked bacon and bacon fat into the potato mixture. Mix in 2 cups of flour, salt, and pepper and stir well. If filling appears too wet, gradually mix in more flour for a firmer consistency. Spread mixture evenly over lined baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 1 hour. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and cook until lightly browned with crispy edges, about 15 minutes longer. Cool before slicing, about 10 minutes.
