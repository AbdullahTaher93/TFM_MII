Mix cottage cheese, 1 clove of garlic, cardamom, and cloves thoroughly in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Heat the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion, ginger, green chile pepper, and 2 cloves of garlic; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the spinach and cook until just wilted. Drain any excess liquid, and serve the spinach mixture over the seasoned cottage cheese.
