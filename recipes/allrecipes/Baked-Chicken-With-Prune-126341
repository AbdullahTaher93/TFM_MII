Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 13 inch x 9 inch baking dish with cooking spray. Place the chicken in the prepared baking dish. In a small microwaveable measuring cup, combine the wine and prunes. Microwave on high power for 1 minute, or until the wine boils. Pour over the chicken. Sprinkle with the rosemary, salt, and pepper. Bake for 30 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted in the thickest portion registers 160 degrees F and the juices run clear.
