In a heavy 10- to 12-inch frying pan, combine the onion and 3 teaspoons of the oil. Stir often over medium heat until onion is lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Pour onion into a bowl, add beans, and mix well. Set aside. To frying pan, add 2 more teaspoons oil. Place pan over medium-high heat. Season steaks with salt and pepper to taste. When pan is very hot, add steaks and cook, turning once, until meat is well browned and done to your liking, 6 to 8 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer meat to a cutting board; keep warm. Quickly mix together remaining oil, broth, vinegar, and garlic. Add to pan (be careful, mixture will boil and steam vigorously) and whisk constantly over high heat until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Add 2 tablespoons mint and all but 3 tablespoons of the warm vinaigrette to bean mixture. Stir to mix well. Divide arugula into four bunches and place each slightly off-center in the middle of a dinner plate. Spoon equal portions of bean mixture in center, covering the stem ends of arugula but leaving leaves sticking out. Quickly cut steaks crosswise into thin slices. Divide between plates, arranging slices around edge of beans. Sprinkle meat with remaining mint; drizzle meat and arugula with remaining vinaigrette. Add additional salt and pepper as desired.
