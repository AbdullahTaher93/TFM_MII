In a 3-quart bowl, combine the white grape juice, cranberry-raspberry juice and pear liqueur. Quarter and core the apples and pears, then thinly slice them and add to the bowl along with the orange and grapes. Cover the fruit and chill for at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Transfer the fruit and juices to a 5-quart punch bowl. Add the wine and serve the sangria over ice cubes in tumblers.
