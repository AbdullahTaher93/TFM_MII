Place the rabbit pieces in a deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat along with the onion, garlic, and green pepper. Season with saffron, cumin, salt, pepper, lemon juice and the bay leaf. Pour the water over all. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 20 minutes. Add the potatoes, and cook for about 20 more minutes, until tender. Add the raisins, capers, white wine, tomato sauce, olives and olive oil. Simmer for about 5 more minutes. Finally, stir in the peas and remove from the heat.
