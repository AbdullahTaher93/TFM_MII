Lay tortillas on clean surface. Drizzle each tortilla with 1 tablespoon ranch dressing. Layer each tortilla with equal amounts of turkey, tomato, cucumber, avocado, alfalfa sprouts, and spinach or arugula. Drizzle with remaining ranch dressing. Roll up tortillas tightly, cut in half diagonally, and secure each half with a wooden pick.
