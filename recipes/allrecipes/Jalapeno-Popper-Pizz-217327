Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Stir together the softened cream cheese and ranch dressing mix in a bowl until smooth. Spread the mixture on the pre-baked crust. Sprinkle the jalapeno slices and bacon on top of the cream cheese mixture; then top with the shredded cheese. Combine the melted butter and seasoned bread crumbs. Sprinkle the mixture over the top of the pizza. Bake in preheated oven until the bread crumbs are nicely browned and the cheese has melted, about 15 minutes.
