Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in melted butter until the onion is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir pork, marjoram, paprika, salt, basil, dill, and mustard powder into the onion mixture; cook and stir until pork is only slightly pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour about half the water over the pork mixture. Add sauerkraut and sour cream; stir. Bring the mixture to a boil and add remaining water; cook at a boil until thickened, about 15 minutes.
