Warm the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, celery, and green onions. Cook, stirring frequently, until tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in beans, tomatoes, cream of mushroom soup, and water. Bring to a boil. Stir in dill, reduce heat to medium, and simmer 10 minutes. Stir in shrimp, and simmer until shrimp are pink, about 5 minutes.
