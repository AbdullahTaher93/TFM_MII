Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with buttermilk. Fold in the chocolate chips. Pour into three greased and floured 9-in. round cake pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely.
