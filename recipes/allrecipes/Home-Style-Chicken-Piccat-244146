Whisk flour, garlic powder, and paprika together in a bowl. Beat egg in a separate bowl. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Dip chicken in egg until coated. Dredge chicken through flour mixture until evenly coated, shaking off excess. Fry chicken in the melted butter until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Add chicken broth to skillet, cover, and cook until chicken is not longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes. Squeeze lemon over chicken.
