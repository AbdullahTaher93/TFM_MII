Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir zucchini, onion, and garlic in hot oil until vegetables are limp and moisture evaporates, about 5 minutes. Stir basil, parsley, black pepper, and thyme into the vegetables; remove from heat. Transfer zucchini mixture to a large mixing bowl. Stir eggs, crushed crackers, and 1 cup Parmesan cheese into the zucchini mixture until it binds together; shape into 14 3-inch patties. Pour enough vegetable oil in a skillet to reach about 1/2 inch deep; heat over medium-high heat. Cook patties, 3 to 4 at a time, in hot oil until well browned, about 2 minutes per side. Sprinkle with additional Parmesan cheese to serve.
