Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Heat olive oil in 10-inch skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in turkey, vegetable and stuffing. Cook and stir until heated through. In medium bowl beat eggs with milk, salt and pepper. Pour into skillet and stir to mix with turkey mixture. Continue to cook until mixture is set at edges. Meanwhile, cut avocado in half, remove the pit and peel. Cut into slices or chunks. Arrange slices or scatter chunks over top of frittata. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake until knife inserted just off-center comes out clean, about 5 minutes. Cut in wedges to serve.
