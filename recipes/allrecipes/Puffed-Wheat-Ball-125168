Place cereal in a large bowl; set aside. In a heavy saucepan, bring brown sugar and corn syrup to a boil. Add butter. Combine evaporated milk and sugar; add to boiling mixture and continue cooking until a soft ball forms when liquid is dropped into cold water (240 degrees F on a candy thermometer). Pour over cereal and stir to coat. Shape into 2-in. balls.
