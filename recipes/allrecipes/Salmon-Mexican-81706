Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a bowl, toss together the tomatoes, olive slices, lime juice and cilantro. Use heavy duty foil or a double thickness of regular foil. Cut off about 2 feet or more and place on a baking pan. Shape up the edges a bit. Place the salmon fillets in the center of the foil. Pour the tomato mixture over the salmon. Fold up the edges of the foil and crimp to keep all the juices in. Bake at 375 degrees F oven for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and carefully open the top of foil to allow the steam to escape. Place salmon fillets on plate or serving platter and pour the tomatoes on top. Serve right away.
