Combine rocket leaves and tomato in a large bowl. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; arrange halloumi cheese slices on top. Broil halloumi cheese in the preheated oven, until light brown, about 3 minutes. Flip slices and broil on the second side, about 3 minutes more. Cut into cubes; add to the bowl. Toast pita bread until golden. Cool until crisp, about 5 minutes. Break into small pieces; add to the bowl. Whisk olive oil, balsamic vinegar, honey, sesame seeds, mustard, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl. Pour into the large bowl; toss salad to combine.
