Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. In a medium bowl, toss peppers, zucchinis and onions with 2 tablespoons olive oil and a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper. Place on hot grill and cook until grill marks form on both sides, about 6-8 minutes. Remove from grill; toss with garlic and 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar. Arrange tomatoes and mozzarella cheese on a large plate. Sprinkle with salt and drizzle with remaining oil and vinegar. Arrange equal portions of vegetables down the center of each tortilla; top with 3 basil leaves, equal portions of tomatoes and mozzarella, and 3 more basil leaves. Roll up, slice in half and serve.
