In a large microwave-safe bowl, melt margarine or butter and marshmallows in a microwave set on HIGH for 2 minutes, stirring after 1 minute. If desired, add green food colouring. Stir until mixture is smooth. Add KELLOGG'S* RICE KRISPIES* cereal, stirring until well coated. When slightly cooled, shape cereal mixture into wreaths using buttered hands. Place on waxed paper or a surface coated with cooking spray. Allow to cool. Decorate with dried fruit, candies, or other KELLOGG'S* cereals. For ribbon use red fruit-flavored candy strips or licorice. Use icing to attach decorations.
