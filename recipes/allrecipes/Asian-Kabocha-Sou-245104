Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Brush flesh side of squash with vegetable oil. Place halves, flesh down, on prepared baking sheet. Bake until tender, 50 to 60 minutes. Let cool. Scoop out flesh and set aside. Heat olive oil in a large, heavy pot over medium heat. Add chopped onion; cook and stir until translucent, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and ginger root; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in red curry paste. Add cooked squash. Stir in Swanson(R) Unsalted Chicken Broth and coconut milk. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes. Remove from heat. Season with salt and pepper. Pour soup into a blender or food processor no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Add additional Swanson(R) Unsalted Chicken Broth to bring the soup to your preferred consistency. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with fresh cilantro and a squeeze of fresh lime juice.
