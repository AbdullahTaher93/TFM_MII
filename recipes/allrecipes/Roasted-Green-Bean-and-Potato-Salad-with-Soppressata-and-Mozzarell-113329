Heat the oven to 450 degrees F. On a baking sheet, toss the potatoes with the green beans, 3 1/2 tablespoons of the oil, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and the dried thyme, if using. Roast in the center of the oven for 20 minutes. Turn the potatoes and beans with a spatula and then sprinkle with the fresh thyme, if using. Roast until the vegetables are golden and tender, about 10 minutes longer. Transfer the vegetables to a large bowl. Add the remaining 4 tablespoons oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt, the soppressata, mozzarella, parsley, and pepper to the bowl and toss. Add the lemon juice and toss again. Let stand for 5 minutes to absorb the dressing before serving.
