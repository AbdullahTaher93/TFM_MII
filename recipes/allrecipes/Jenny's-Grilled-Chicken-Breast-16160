Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil grate. Dip chicken in lemon juice, and sprinkle with the onion powder, ground black pepper, seasoning salt and parsley. Discard any remaining lemon juice. Cook on the prepared grill 10 to 15 minutes per side, or until no longer pink and juices run clear.
