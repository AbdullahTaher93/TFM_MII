In a large bowl, stir together the cornmeal, baking powder and baking soda. Make a well in the center and pour in the eggs, oil, honey, pumpkin puree and buttermilk. Let the batter stand while you preheat the oven. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Heat an 8 or 9 inch cast-iron skillet on the stovetop until hot. Coat with cooking spray, then pour in the cornbread batter. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until cornbread starts to pull away from the sides of the pan.
