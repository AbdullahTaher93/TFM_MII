In a medium saucepan, bring the chicken broth to a simmer with the lemon zest and 1 tablespoon butter. Reduce the heat to low, add the rice, cover and cook until the broth is absorbed, about 18 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and stir in the thyme and half the parsley. In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon EVOO, 1 turn of the pan, over medium-high heat. Season the lamb chops with salt and pepper. Sear for 2 to 3 minutes on each side for medium doneness. Transfer the chops to a plate and cover to keep warm. Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 1 tablespoon EVOO, 1 turn of the pan. Add the leeks and cook until wilted, about 5 minutes. Add the artichokes and cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Add the wine to the skillet and deglaze the pan, scraping up all the browned bits. Boil the mixture for 2 minutes. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the pan, turn off the heat and toss well. Season the vegetables to taste with salt and pepper. Serve the lamb chops alongside the rice. Top with the vegetables and sprinkle all over with the remaining parsley.
