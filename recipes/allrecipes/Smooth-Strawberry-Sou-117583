In a bowl, combine the first six ingredients. Place half of the mixture at a time in a blender; cover and process until pureed. Transfer to a large bowl; stir in cream and orange juice, if desired. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours. In a skillet over medium heat, saute bread cubes in butter until golden brown. Remove from the heat. Sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon; toss to coat. Cool. Stir soup before serving; garnish with croutons.
