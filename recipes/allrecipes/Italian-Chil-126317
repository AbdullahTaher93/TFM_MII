In a large saucepot or Dutch oven over high heat, cook the beef, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until no longer pink. Drain and set aside. Wipe the pot with a paper towel. Heat the oil in the same pot over medium-high heat. Add the onions, bell peppers, and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes, or until soft. Add the chili powder, Italian seasoning, and salt and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Add the wine and bring to a boil. Add the zucchini, diced tomatoes (with juice), crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and beef. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Add the beans and return to a simmer. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes, or until the zucchini is tender.
