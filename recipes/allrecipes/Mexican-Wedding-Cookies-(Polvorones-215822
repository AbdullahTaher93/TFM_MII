Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine shortening, 1 cup powdered sugar and vanilla in bowl of electric mixer; beat on medium speed until well blended. Combine flour, baking soda and salt in medium bowl. Add to creamed mixture; mix well. Stir in walnuts; mix well. Roll dough into walnut-size balls; place on ungreased baking sheets about 1 12 inches apart. Bake 15 minutes or until edges begin to brown slightly. Cool on baking sheets until cool enough to handle, but still warm. While still warm, roll in remaining 1 cup powdered sugar; place on cooling racks to cool completely.
