Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Separate shallots into cloves and cut larger cloves in half lengthwise; place in a large nonstick roasting pan. Add 2 tbsp. olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste; shake pan to coat. Roast shallots until they are browned and tender when pierced, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool and cut into chunks. In a large bowl, whisk together vinegar, mustard, and remaining 6 tbsp. olive oil. Add beans and shallots; mix to coat. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate up to 2 days. Remove salad from refrigerator at least 2 hours before meal. Just before serving, stir in tarragon and all but 1 tbsp. parsley. Cut cherry tomatoes in half, add to salad and mix. Taste; add salt and pepper, if desired. Sprinkle with remaining chopped parsley and serve.
