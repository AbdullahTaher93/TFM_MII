In a shallow bowl, beat the eggs and milk. Place chips in another shallow bowl. Dip one side of four slices of bread in the egg mixture, then in the chips. Place chip side down on a greased baking sheet. Spread with salad dressing. Top with corned beef, Swiss cheese and sauerkraut. Dip the remaining bread slices in egg mixture and chips; place chip side up on sandwiches. Cook on a medium-hot griddle until lightly browned, turning once.
