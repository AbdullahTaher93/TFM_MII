Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-low heat, and lightly oil the grate. Use a sharp paring knife to cut down the backs of the shrimp nearly all the way through, so you can spread apart the two halves. Open up the shrimp and lay them out onto your work surface. Spoon some crumbled feta cheese onto each shrimp, then top with slivers of jalapeno pepper. Close up the shrimp and wrap each with a strip of bacon; secure with a toothpick. Cook on the preheated grill until the bacon has begun to crisp and the shrimp is no longer translucent in the center, 10 to 15 minutes.
