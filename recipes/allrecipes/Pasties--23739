Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Roll dough into 4 thin circles. Arrange potatoes, onion, rutabaga and pork over 1/2 of each dough circle. Dot with butter and season with salt and pepper to taste. Add crushed garlic if desired. Fold dough over the filling and pinch and roll along edges. Poke a few holes in the top with a fork and place on a lined cookie sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until top is golden brown.
