Place pork neck bones into a large pot; cover with water. Bring to a boil and skim scum off the surface with a slotted spoon. Drain. Return bones to the pot. Add 10 cups water, potatoes, tomatoes, onion, and carrot. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer soup until flavors combine, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Season with sugar and salt.
