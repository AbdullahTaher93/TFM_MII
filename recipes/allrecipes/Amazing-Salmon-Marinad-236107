Make a shallow pan from a double layer of aluminum foil. Place foil pan in a large baking sheet. Arrange salmon fillets in the prepared foil pan, skin-side down. Stir basil, honey, lemon, oil, soy sauce, shallot, Worcestershire sauce, and ginger together in a bowl; pour over salmon. Let salmon marinate for 30 minutes to 2 hours. Preheat grill for medium-low heat. Slide salmon in the foil pan off the baking sheet onto the preheated grill. Cover grill. Cook until salmon is easily flaked with a fork, about 20 minutes.
