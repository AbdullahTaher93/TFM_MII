Melt butter in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef, and quickly brown on all sides. Pour in the diced tomatoes with green chilies, and stewed tomatoes. Add the okra, lima beans and corn. Bring to a boil, and reduce heat to medium. Simmer for about 1 hour. Add potatoes, and continue to simmer for another 30 minutes, or until meat is very tender.
