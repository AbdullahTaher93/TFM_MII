Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Butter six 1-cup (250 mL) ramekins and place on a baking sheet. In a bowl, combine filling ingredients and divide among the ramekins. Prepare the batter. In a bowl, combine the first 4 ingredients then cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Make a well in the middle. In another bowl, beat egg, milk and cream for 1 minute. Pour into the well and mix well with a wooden spoon. Divide the batter evenly over the fruit mixture in the ramekins. Bake 15 minutes or until the tops are golden and the filling is bubbling around the edges. Cool 15 minutes at room temperature. Invite each guest to crack the top of the cobbler and pour in a little cream.
