Cook the ground beef in a skillet; drain it on paper towels. Put the beef into a large saucepan and stir in the broth, Italian seasoning, onion powder, and garlic powder. Cover and bring to a boil. Stir in the macaroni, boil again, then reduce the heat and simmer for 8 minutes or until the macaroni is tender. Stir in the tomatoes (juice and all), and add the kidney beans. Simmer until the beans are heated through.
