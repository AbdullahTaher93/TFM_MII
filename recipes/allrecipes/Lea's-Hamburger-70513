Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, onion, egg, bread crumbs, and bacon bits. Season with garlic salt. (I like to use a lot.) Divide into four balls, and pat into patties. Lightly oil the grate, and place patties onto the grill. Cook for about 5 minutes per side, or until firm and no longer pink in the center. Serve on toasted buns with your favorite hamburger toppings.
