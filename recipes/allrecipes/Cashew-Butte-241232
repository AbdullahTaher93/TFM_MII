Put 1 cup cashews in a food processor bowl and begin to process while drizzling vegetable oil into the mixture to keep it moving. Add cashews to food processor, alternating with oil, and process. Once all cashews are added, add sea salt and continue to process until your preferred texture is attained, 10 to 15 minutes.
