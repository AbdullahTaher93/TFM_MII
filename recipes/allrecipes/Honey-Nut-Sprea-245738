Combine Neufchatel cheese and 1 tablespoon honey in a mixing bowl. Mix thoroughly with an electric mixer on low speed. Add remaining honey, 1 tablespoon at a time, until combined. Pulse peanuts in food processor until coarsely chopped. Stir into cheese mixture. Transfer dip to a glass food storage container; refrigerate overnight for best flavor. Place Cheerios in small dry saucepan and cook over medium high heat, stirring constantly, until just starting to brown, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat immediately and cool, stirring occasionally, before pulsing in food processor until roughly chopped. Just before serving, top dip with crushed Cheerios.
