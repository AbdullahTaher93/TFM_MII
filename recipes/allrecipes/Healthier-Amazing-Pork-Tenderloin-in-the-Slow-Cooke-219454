Place pork tenderloin in a slow cooker with sliced onions. Pour water, wine, and soy sauce over top, turning pork to coat. Spread garlic over the pork, leaving as much on top of roast as possible. Sprinkle with pepper. Cover and cook on Low setting, until pork is slightly pink in the center, about 4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Serve with cooking liquid on the side as au jus.
