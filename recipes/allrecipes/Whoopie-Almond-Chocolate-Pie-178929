Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 2 muffin pans with nonstick spray; coat with flour and tap out excess. Cream sugar and butter in a large bowl until fluffy. Add almond paste, 1 piece at a time, beating until well blended after each addition. Beat in eggs 1 at a time. Stir together milk, almond extract and salt, and add to butter mixture. Mix flour and baking powder in small bowl; add to batter. Beat just until blended. Spoon batter into 2 pans; they won't be very full. Bake 15-18 minutes, or until golden brown and a tester inserted into center of one comes out clean. Cool in pan on rack. Chop chocolate and place in a medium bowl. Bring cream to a boil and pour over chocolate; let sit for 2 minutes, and then stir well. Let ganache firm up so that it's spreadable. To assemble whoopie pies, sandwich 2 together with ganache. Spread more ganache on top and sprinkle with almonds.
