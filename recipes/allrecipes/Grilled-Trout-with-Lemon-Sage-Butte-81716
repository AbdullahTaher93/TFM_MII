To make the lemon sage butter, be sure that sage leaves have been rinsed and are completely dry. Finely mince the sage. Heat 1 tsp of canola oil over medium heat in a small sauce pan. Add the sage and cook for about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and add the cubed butter and the lemon extract. Stir until well blended. Pour about 1/2 of the butter in a small bowl to use for the trout. (Set aside the remainder for some other recipe; perhaps a veggie side dish of grilled zucchini or turnips). Generously brush the inside of each trout with the butter. Then brush the out side of the trout. Grill over medium heat for a total of 10-15 minutes depending on the size. Turn the trout over after about 5 minutes. Serve with the lemon wedges.
