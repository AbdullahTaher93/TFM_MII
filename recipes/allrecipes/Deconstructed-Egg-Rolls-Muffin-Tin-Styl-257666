Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray 12 muffin cups with cooking spray. Place 2 wonton wrappers into each muffin cup, pressing into the bottom and along the sides. Mix cabbage, corn kernels, cilantro, green onions, and almonds together in a bowl. Whisk mayonnaise, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, white sugar, pepper, salt, paprika, red pepper flakes, Sriracha chile sauce, garlic, sesame oil, honey, and ginger together in a bowl; fold in chicken. Stir chicken mixture into cabbage mixture until evenly combined; spoon into the wonton cups. Bake in the preheated oven until wontons are crisp and filling is bubbling, about 18 minutes.
