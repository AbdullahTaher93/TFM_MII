Place the milk, butter, brown sugar, egg, salt, cinnamon, yeast and bread flour into the pan of a bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select the white bread cycle. About 5 minutes before the end of the mixing process, add the raisins and cherries. If your bread machine has a fruit setting, use that.
