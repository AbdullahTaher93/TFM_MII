Cut off and discard the top 1/2 to 2/3 of the green portion of the leek. Slice the leek length wise and rinse thoroughly under the tap to remove the sand and grit. Then rough chop the leeks Remove the skin from the shallots, rough chop. Since the size varies a lot, have enough that if they were minced they would fill a Tbsp. In a heavy skillet over high heat, bring to a boil the chicken broth, shallots and leeks. Reduce heat and cook at a very gentle boil until the leeks are very soft (about 5 to 8 minutes generally). With a slotted spoon remove the leeks and shallots to a blender or food processor. Add the butter to the leeks and about 1 Tbsp of the cooking liquid. Puree until smooth, adding more cooking liquids if it is too thick. Add the salmon steaks to the cooking liquids; reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 3 minutes. If using fillets with the skin, start with the skin side up. Gently turn over the steaks and simmer another 3-4 minutes (covered).
