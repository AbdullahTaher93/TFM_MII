This European-style tart is easily shaped on a cookie sheet and has an extra-cinnamony aroma while it bakes. Enjoy it warm from the oven. In 2-quart saucepan, mix sugar, cornstarch and salt. Gradually stir in milk until well blended. Add chocolate chips and egg yolks; cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is thickened. Remove from heat. Beat in cream cheese with wire whisk until smooth. Cover surface with plastic wrap; refrigerate just until cool, about 1 hour. In large bowl with electric mixer, beat whipping cream and vanilla on high speed until soft peaks form. Reserve 1 cup whipped cream for topping. Fold remaining whipped cream into cooled chocolate mixture. Spoon evenly into cooled baked shell. Refrigerate 6 to 8 hours or overnight. Spoon or pipe reserved whipped cream over filling. Store in refrigerator.
