Crush 20 of the wafers to form coarse crumbs; set aside. Pour milk into medium bowl. Add dry pudding mix. Beat with wire whisk 2 min. Gently stir in whipped topping. Layer half of the wafers crumbs and 8 of the banana slices evenly in four individual parfait glasses or individual dessert dishes; cover with half of the pudding mixture. Repeat layers, reserving 4 of the banana slices for garnish. Cover and refrigerate parfaits at least 15 min. or up to 4 hours before serving. Wrap reserved banana slices tightly in plastic wrap; refrigerate until ready to use. Top each parfait with 1 each of the reserved wafers and banana slices just before serving.
