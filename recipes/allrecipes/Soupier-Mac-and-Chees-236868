Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain. Stir cream of mushroom soup, 1 1/2 cups Cheddar cheese, milk, mustard, and pepper together in a large bowl; add macaroni and stir to coat. Pour macaroni mixture into a baking dish. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, top with remaining Cheddar cheese and French-fried onions, and continue baking until the cheese on top is melted completely, about 5 minutes more.
