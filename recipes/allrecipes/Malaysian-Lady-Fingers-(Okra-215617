Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir the garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the red chilies, shrimp, okra, and belacan, and cook and stir until the chilies begin to soften and the shrimp start to turn opaque and pink, about 2 minutes. Pour in light soy sauce and water, and cook and stir until the okra are tender and sticky, 2 to 4 more minutes.
