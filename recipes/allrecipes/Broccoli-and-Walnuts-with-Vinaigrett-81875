Rinse and let dry the broccoli. Cut into bite sized pieces. Mince the shallots and coarsely chop the walnuts. Pour a little bit of the walnut oil (1 Tbsp) into a large skillet over medium heat. Do not cook with the heat too high. Add the shallots and broccoli. Stir frequently at first to coated everything (add more walnut oil if needed to coat) then stir just occasionally for about 3-5 minutes. You want the broccoli to be heated all the way through but still retaining as much crunch as possible. During the last minute of cooking add the chopped walnuts (if they are raw you can add them earlier). Meanwhile; whisk together the remaining walnut oil, vinegar and garlic powder. If your walnuts were unsalted, then add a pinch or two of salt to the vinaigrette. When the broccoli is cooked to your liking, remove from the heat. Pour the vinaigrette over the broccoli, toss and serve.
