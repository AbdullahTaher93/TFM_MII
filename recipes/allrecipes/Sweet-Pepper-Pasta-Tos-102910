Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange peppers and garlic on the baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Roast 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until soft and lightly browned. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. In a large bowl, toss cooked pasta with peppers, garlic, parsley, goat cheese and capers. Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese to serve.
