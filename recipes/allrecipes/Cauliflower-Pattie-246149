Bring water to boil in a saucepan. Add cauliflower; boil until tender, about 15 minutes. Strain cauliflower, transfer to a bowl, and mash with a fork. Stir almond flour, eggs, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper into cauliflower until well-combined; form into 1/4-cup sized patties. Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry patties in a single layer until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining patties and olive oil.
