Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Toss with 2 tablespoons oil, then refrigerate for 1 hour, or until cool. Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat. Cook spinach until wilted. In a large bowl, combine spinach, green pepper, red pepper, yellow pepper and cooled pasta. Whisk together 1/2 cup canola oil, walnut oil, vinegar and honey. Pour vinaigrette over pasta mixture, and toss until evenly coated. Sprinkle top with gorgonzola and chopped walnuts.
