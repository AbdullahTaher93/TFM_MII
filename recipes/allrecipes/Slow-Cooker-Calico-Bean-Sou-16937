Soak the beans in water overnight, rinse well and drain. In a slow cooker, combine the soaked beans, meat bones, tomatoes, red wine, parsley, paprika, celery seed, bay leaves, seasoned salt, garlic powder, sugar, ground black pepper and crushed red pepper flakes. Add water to cover. Cook on low setting for 3 to 4 hours, or until beans are tender. Remove the bones and strip and shred any meat from the bones. Discard the bones and return the meat to the slow cooker. Allow to heat through.
