Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Mist a 12-cup muffin tin with non-stick vegetable oil spray. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl, combine cornmeal mix and baking soda. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together Marzetti Slaw Dressing, buttermilk, egg, and melted butter and pour into dry ingredients. Add zucchini and cheese and fold mixture together just until moistened. Spoon batter into muffin tins. Bake for 14 to 16 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean. Cool.
