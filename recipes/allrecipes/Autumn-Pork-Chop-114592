In a large skillet, brown pork chops in butter for 1-2 minutes on each side. Arrange apricots and prunes over pork. Combine the cider, sugar, salt and curry; pour over fruit. Cover and simmer for 1 hour. Remove chops and fruit and keep warm. Combine cornstarch and water until smooth; add to pan juices. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Serve with pork and fruit.
