In a large saucepan cook bacon until crisp. Set bacon aside, along with 3 tablespoons of bacon drippings. Add potatoes, onion, carrot and celery to drippings. Add enough water to cover vegetables and cook over low heat until tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in milk, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. In separate bowl, stir together sour cream, flour and paprika. Gradually stir 1 cup of hot soup mixture into sour cream mixture. Pour sour cream mixture into soup mixture. Cook until small bubbles break soups service. Top with chopped bacon pieces.
