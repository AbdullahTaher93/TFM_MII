In a large nonporous glass dish or resealable plastic bag combine the onion, carrot, thyme, bay leaves, garlic, celery, parsley, salt, pepper and wine. Mix well and add roast, chops, or whichever meat being marinated. Refrigerate to marinate for 24 hours, turning bag or basting occasionally. Cook drained roast/meat in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 minutes per pound of meat. Baste with strained marinade while cooking.
