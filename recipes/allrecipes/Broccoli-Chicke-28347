Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry chicken breasts until cooked through, about 15 to 20 minutes. Combine the milk and cream of broccoli soup; pour over the chicken. Reduce heat to simmer and cook for a few more minutes. Stir in Cheddar cheese until well blended, and remove from heat. Serve immediately over rice or noodles.
