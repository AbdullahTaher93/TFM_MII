In a large bowl, combine mashed potatoes, eggs, parsley, cheese, salt and pepper, bacon bits and onion flakes. Form mixture into patties, and dredge patties in the bread crumbs. Pour oil 1/2 inch deep in a large, heavy skillet. Heat oil over medium-high heat. Fry patties, flipping to fry them on both sides, until they are golden brown. Serve hot.
