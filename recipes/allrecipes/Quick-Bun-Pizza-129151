Heat the broiler to the hottest setting. Line the broiler pan with a piece of foil. Put the zucchini and bell pepper slices on the foil, sprinkle with the olive oil, and toss together. Spread out the vegetables, then broil until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the buns, laying them on top of the vegetables, crust sides uppermost. Toast lightly on the crust side; remove the buns. Turn the vegetables and continue broiling them while you add the topping to the buns. Spread the untoasted, cut side of each bun with tomato puree, allowing it to soak into the bread. Add a few oregano leaves to each one, then arrange the broiled vegetables on top, sprinkling them with seasoning to taste. Lay the slices of mozzarella cheese over the vegetables. Put the bun pizzas back in the broiler pan. Broil until the cheese melts and begins to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve while piping hot.
