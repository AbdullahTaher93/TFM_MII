Whisk olive oil, vinegar, rosemary, garlic, and black pepper together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add the pork chops and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove pork chops from marinade, discard marinade, and season pork chops with salt. Cook the pork chops on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, 7 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let chops rest for 3 to 5 minutes before serving.
