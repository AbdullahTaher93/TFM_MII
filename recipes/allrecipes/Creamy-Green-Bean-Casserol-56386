Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Combine the green beans and corn in the bottom of a 9-inch square baking dish. Pour soup over the vegetables and top with chopped onion. In a small bowl, stir together the crackers, garlic powder, and margarine until cracker crumbs are coated. Spread over the top of the casserole. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until the sauce is thick and the top is browned.
