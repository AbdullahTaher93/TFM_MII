Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add lamb and onion and cook until meat is browned; stir in beans and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in tomato sauce, water, salt, pepper and mint. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for about 1 hour or until cooked through and beans are tender.
