In a bowl, mix together the tomatoes, the 1/3 cup chopped onion, 2 of the 4 cloves of minced garlic, serrano chile pepper, lime juice, and cilantro. Stir in salt and pepper to taste, and set aside. Place the ground turkey in a bowl. Add the egg, the 1/2 onion, minced, remaining 2 cloves minced garlic, coriander, celery salt, chili powder, cumin, and chopped parsley. Using your hands, work the mixture until all ingredients are evenly blended. Form mixture into 4 patties. Heat a large, non-stick skillet for medium-high heat. Cook the turkey burgers for 5 minutes per side, or until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear. Reduce the heat as necessary during cooking. Serve with Pico de Gallo salsa.
