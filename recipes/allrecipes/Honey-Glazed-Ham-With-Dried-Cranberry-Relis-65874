Prepare and heat ham according to package directions. Meanwhile, prepare glaze. Mix honey with dry mustard and lemon juice in bowl; set aside. For the relish, combine crushed pineapple with orange juice in saucepan. Bring to boil over medium heat; cook to reduce juices 5 minutes. Stir in sugar until dissolved. Add water; return mixture to boil. Stir in orange and lemon zest, and cranberries. Cover pan; simmer over low heat 5 minutes to plump cranberries. Remove pan from heat and stir in pecans. Set relish aside to cool. (Relish may be prepared up to one week before serving. Store in refrigerator in tightly covered container.) Brush glaze on your Cook's ham 30 minutes before meat is done. Heat ham uncovered for final 30 minutes. Carve ham and serve with cranberry relish.
