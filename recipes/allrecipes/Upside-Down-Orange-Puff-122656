In a saucepan, combine butter, sugar, orange juice and peel. Cook and stir over medium heat until sugar is dissolved. Divide among 10 muffin cups. Make a hole in the center of each biscuit; place over orange mixture. Bake at 450 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown. Immediately invert onto a wire rack to cool.
