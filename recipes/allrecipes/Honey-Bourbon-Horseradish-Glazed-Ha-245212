Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine 2/3 cup horseradish mustard, bourbon, brown sugar, honey, and liquid smoke together in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer glaze, stirring frequently, until thickened, at least 30 minutes. Liberally coat ham with the remaining horseradish mustard and place in a roasting pan. Spoon glaze over ham. Bake in the preheated oven, basting occasionally, until until the internal temperature of the ham has reached 160 degrees F (72 degrees C), about 2 hours. (Generally bake 22 minutes per pound.)
