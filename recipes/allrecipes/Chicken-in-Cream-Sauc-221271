Combine chicken (breast-side up), chicken broth, water, Mexican crema, tomatoes, red peppers, jalapeno peppers, onion, garlic, oregano, bay leaf, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper in a large stockpot, ensuring all ingredients are submerged in the liquid. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 hour. Turn chicken over using a pair of tongs. Cover stockpot and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken from mixture and set aside. Increase heat to high and bring mixture to a boil, skimming off any fat that rises to the surface, 5 to 10 minutes. Cut chicken into serving-size pieces and return to stockpot; stir in chopped cilantro and cook until chicken is warmed through, about 5 minutes.
