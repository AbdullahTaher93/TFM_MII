Melt the butter in a heavy skillet over medium-low heat, turn the heat to low, and cook for about 5 minutes, straining off any milk solids, until the butter is caramel brown in color. Pour in the wine, garlic, paprika, sage, and ground ginger, and cook and stir about 5 minutes, until the sauce has reduced and the garlic is barely golden. Lightly fold in the crab. Bring a pan of lightly salted water to a boil over medium heat, and drop in the pasta. Cook until just tender, about 4 minutes, and drain. Place the pasta on serving plates, and drizzle each serving with olive oil. Spoon the butter-crab sauce over each plate, sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste, garnish with parsley, and serve immediately.
