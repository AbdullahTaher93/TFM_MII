Whisk baking mix with salt, black pepper, and Parmesan cheese in a small bowl. Beat eggs in a separate bowl and stir in corn and onion. Lightly stir biscuit mix-cheese mixture into corn mixture just until moistened; do not overmix. Melt butter with vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Drop batter into hot skillet with a tablespoon and flatten fritters slightly with spoon. Cook fritters until browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side, and drain on paper towels.
