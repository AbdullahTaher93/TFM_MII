Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Heat oil in a large, deep-sided skillet over medium heat until it reaches 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix together flour, salt, pepper and garlic powder. In a separate bowl whisk buttermilk, barbeque sauce and steak sauce. Add chicken parts; toss to coat. Working in batches of 6, dredge chicken in flour and add to hot oil. Cover and fry until golden brown on one side, about 9 to 10 minutes. Turn chicken over and fry until golden brown on remaining side and cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes longer. Transfer to a wire rack on a baking sheet and keep warm in oven.
