Scrape flesh into strands with a fork. Heat olive oil in a slow cooker on High. Add onion, green onions, and garlic; cook and stir in the open cooker until tender, about 10 minutes.

Stir in potatoes; cook, covered, on Low for 20 minutes. Stir spaghetti squash strands and spinach into the slow cooker. Mix in heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, salt, hot sauce, thyme, pepper, sage, and red pepper flakes. Cover and cook on Low until flavors combine, about 8 hours.
