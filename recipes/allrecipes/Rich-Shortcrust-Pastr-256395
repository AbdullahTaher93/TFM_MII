Mix flour and salt together in a large bowl. Cut butter into the flour mixture until it is the consistency of breadcrumbs. Lightly beat eggs together in a separate bowl; stir into butter-flour mixture. Add water and mix just until incorporated, using your hands to bring dough together. Turn dough onto a floured work surface and cut into 4 portions. Refrigerate dough for 15 to 30 minutes before using.
