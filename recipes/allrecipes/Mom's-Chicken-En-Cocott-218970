Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour the olive oil into the bottom of a heavy Dutch oven, and place over medium heat. Sprinkle the chicken pieces with salt and black pepper, and cook in the hot oil until browned on both sides, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Add the carrots, potatoes, celery, onion, garlic, chicken bouillon cubes, and water, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, and cover the Dutch oven. Place the Dutch oven into the preheated oven, and simmer, covered, until the vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes.
