Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange broccoli in the bottom of a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. In a medium bowl combine the soup, half-and-half and cheese. Mix until smooth and pour mixture evenly over broccoli. Top with onion rings. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until golden and bubbly.
