Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Put carrots into a large sealable plastic bag; add honey, olive oil, cumin, salt and black pepper. Seal the bag and manipulate the contents until the carrots are completely coated; pour into a baking dish. Roast in the preheated oven until just tender, or to your desired degree of doneness, 30 to 40 minutes.
