Heat the vegetable oil and jalapeno oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Place potato wedges in the skillet, and cook 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Place garlic, onion, jalapeno chile pepper, spicy seasoned salt, and black pepper in the skillet. Reduce heat to medium, and carefully pour in the jalapeno hot sauce. Continue cooking 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until potato wedges are golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
