Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Mix vital wheat gluten flour, nutritional yeast, mustard powder, paprika, fennel seeds, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, anise seeds, and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Stir water, tomato paste, olive oil, liquid amino acid, and liquid smoke flavoring together in a separate bowl or measuring cup. Stir wet mixture into flour mixture until dough is evenly mixed. Turn dough onto a work surface and knead until smooth; shape into a log that is 1 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter. Tightly wrap log in aluminum foil, twisting the ends to secure. Bake in the preheated oven for 90 minutes. Unwrap pepperoni and cool to room temperature; store in refrigerator in an air-tight container or wrapped in plastic wrap.
