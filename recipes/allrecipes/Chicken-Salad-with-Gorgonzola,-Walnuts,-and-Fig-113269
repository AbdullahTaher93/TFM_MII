Put the water and the figs in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, turn off the heat, and let stand until the figs are plump, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the figs and cut them in quarters. In a small frying pan, toast the walnuts over moderately low heat, stirring frequently, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Or toast them in a 350 degrees F oven for 5 to 10 minutes. Light the grill or heat the broiler. Rub the chicken with the 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper, and the rosemary. Grill or broil the chicken until just done, about 5 minutes per side. When cool enough to handle, cut into 1/4-inch slices. Put the radicchio and the spinach in a large bowl. Add the remaining 1/3 cup oil and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper and toss. Add the vinegar and toss again. Put the radicchio and spinach on plates. Top with the sliced chicken, and then the Gorgonzola and walnuts. Put some of the figs in the center of each salad.
