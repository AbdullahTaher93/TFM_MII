Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray mini-muffin pans with cooking spray. Mix together the coconut milk with the water in a mixing bowl. Stir in white rice flour, shredded coconut, and salt. Spoon the mixture into the prepared mini muffin cups, and sprinkle with sugar if desired. Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are golden brown and crusty, about 30 minutes.
