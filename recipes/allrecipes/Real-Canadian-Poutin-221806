Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Spread fries in a single layer over prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until light brown, about 15 minutes. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk in flour vigorously. When mixture bubbles, reduce heat to low; cook and stir until the mixture thins, about 2 minutes. Whisk in beef broth. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until gravy has thickened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Place fries on a serving plate or in individual bowls. Distribute the cheese curds over the fries; pour hot gravy over the fries and curds. Serve immediately.
