Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, cream margarine and sugar together until light and fluffy. Mix in eggs, bananas and pineapple. In a separate bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture. Fold in coconut and walnuts. Pour batter into prepared loaf pans. Bake in preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean.
