Prepare 'Hail Caesar!' Rub by mixing spices and Parmesan cheese in a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid. (Store the blend in a dark cupboard, away from heat, and it will keep for two to three months.) Preheat grill to high heat. Sprinkle 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of the blend on a lightly oiled fillet. Grill or broil over high heat for 3 1/2 to 4 minutes per side, or until the fish begins to flake when tested with a fork in the thickest part.
