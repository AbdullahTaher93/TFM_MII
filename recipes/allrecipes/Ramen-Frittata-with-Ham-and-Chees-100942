Adjust oven rack to middle position, and preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Follow ramen cooking instructions, reserving the seasoning packets. Cook ramen noodles until just tender, and drain. Melt butter in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham and green onions, and cook until tender, about 3 minutes. Whisk eggs and 1 packet of the ramen seasonings in a medium bowl; stir in cooked noodles. Shake skillet to evenly distribute ham and green onions; add egg mixture, and sprinkle top with cheese. Transfer skillet to preheated oven, and bake until eggs are set and cheese melts, about 6 to 8 minutes. Cut into quarters to serve.
