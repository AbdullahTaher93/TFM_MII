In 12-inch ovenproof skillet, heat milk, frozen peas and carrots, chicken and both cans of soup to boiling. Separate dough into 8 biscuits; cut each into fourths. Place biscuit pieces on top of hot soup mixture. Simmer uncovered 10 minutes. Cover; simmer 8 to 10 minutes longer or until biscuits are no longer doughy. Garnish with chopped parsley, if desired
