Add oil to a large non-stick skillet. Saute onions and 2 tablespoons of teriyaki sauce until the onions are soft. Add the sliced meat and cook until meat browns slightly, add remaining 1 tablespoon of teriyaki sauce and stir to combine. Place cheese on the meat and stir until melted, mixing meat, onions and cheese together. Scoop meat mixture onto sandwich rolls.
