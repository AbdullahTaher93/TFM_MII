Bring the rice and 2 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, ginger, and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the kim chee, cucumber, and carrot. Pour in the soy sauce and rice vinegar. Season with salt, pepper, and chile powder. If the mixture becomes to thick, add 1 tablespoon of water. Gently stir in the tuna and continue cooking until the fish is heated through. Serve with rice.
