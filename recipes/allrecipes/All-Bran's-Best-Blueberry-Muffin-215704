In medium bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, soda and salt. Set aside. In large bowl, stir together cereal, milk and juice. Let stand 5 minutes or until cereal softens. Add eggs, oil and brown sugar; mix well. Add flour mixture, stirring just until combined. Fold in blueberries. Spoon batter into lightly greased or paper-lined muffin pan cups. Bake at 200 degrees C (400 degrees F) for 20 to 22 minutes, or until golden brown and tops of muffins spring back when lightly touches.
