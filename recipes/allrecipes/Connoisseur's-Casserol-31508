Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix white corn, green beans, celery, onion, pimento peppers, sour cream, Colby cheese, cream of celery soup, salt, and pepper. Transfer to a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, and stir in slivered almonds and crushed crackers. Sprinkle over the casserole. Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until bubbly and lightly browned.
