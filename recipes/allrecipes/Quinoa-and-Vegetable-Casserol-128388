Coat a broiler pan with nonstick spray. Preheat the broiler. Arrange the bell pappers, mushrooms, tomatoes, and onion on the prepared broiler pan. Coat with nonstick spray. Broil, turning occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the onion and mushrooms are softened. Remove the mushrooms, tomatoes, and onion to a plate. Broil the peppers for 5 to 10 minutes longer, or until lightly blackened. Transfer the peppers to a paper bag and allow to steam for 5 minutes. Slice the mushroom caps into 1/4-inch-thick strips. Peel the peppers. Remove and discard the stems and seeds. Cut the peppers into wide strips. Set aside. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan set over high heat, bring the broth to a boil. Add the quinoa. Stir well. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the broth is absorbed. Remove from the heat. Add the fontina or goat cheese, basil, and salt. Stir to mix. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat a 9 x 9-inch baking dish with nonstick spray. Arrange half of the peppers on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Top with half of the quinoa. Layer the onion, mushrooms, and tomatoes over the quinoa. Top with the remaining quinoa and the remaining peppers. Bake for 15 minutes, or until heated through.
