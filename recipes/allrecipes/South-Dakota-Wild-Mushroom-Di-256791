Stir into mushroom mixture. Cook on medium heat until gravy comes to boil, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to simmer. Stir in 3/4 cup of the cheese. Simmer 1 to 2 minutes or until cheese is melted and gravy has thickened slightly. Spoon into 1-quart baking dish. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese. Bake 5 to 10 minutes or until cheese is melted. Serve with onion rings, fries or crusty bread.
