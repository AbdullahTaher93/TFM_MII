Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large pot, bring to a boil over medium-high heat enough water to cover potatoes by two inches. Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and chop them into 1 1/2 inch pieces. Boil covered 15 to 20 minutes or until the potatoes are completely tender (test with a fork); drain. Toss drained hot sweet potatoes with butter, ginger, cinnamon, and orange peel. Transfer sweet potatoes to a buttered baking dish. Sprinkle the top with pecans and bake for 30 minutes.
