Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray 2 24-cup mini-muffin pans with cooking spray. Cut hot dogs into 4 pieces crosswise and cut each piece lengthwise to make 8 pieces per hot dog. Whisk flour, corn meal, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl; stir in milk, egg, and vegetable oil to make a smooth batter. Stir chopped hot dogs into batter and spoon the mixture into prepared mini muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until the corn muffins are lightly browned and set in the center, about 8 minutes.
