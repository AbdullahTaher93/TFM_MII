Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut chicken breasts into strips. Whisk egg and juice together in a medium bowl. Stir in molasses and honey. Dip chicken strips into egg mixture. Pour cracker crumbs into a resealable plastic bag. Put egg coated chicken pieces in bag, seal and shake to coat with crumbs. Place breaded chicken on a foil-lined cookie sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip the chicken strips and turn the pan, then bake for another 10 minutes.
