Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for 10 minutes or until well browned on both sides. Remove the chicken from the skillet. Heat the remaining oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the peppers and onion and cook until the vegetables are tender-crisp, stirring occasionally. Stir in the broccoli and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the sauce. Return the chicken to the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Slice the chicken before serving.
