In a medium bowl, beat eggs until slightly frothy. Gently stir in salmon, scallions, salt and pepper, and Tabasco. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Coat lightly with cooking spray. Pour egg mixture into skillet and stir constantly until eggs cook through, about 2 minutes. Spoon half of egg mixture onto each tortilla and roll up burrito-style.
