Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (moderately hot oven). Crush Cheez-It(R) Crackers into fine crumbs on a sheet of waxed paper with a rolling pin; pour into medium sized bowl. Combine flour, sugar and baking powder; sift into bowl with cracker crumbs. Add shortening, eggs and milk. Beat just enough to blend well. Spoon mixture into 12 greased 2-1/2 inch muffin wells. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes, or until muffins are a light golden brown. Serve hot.
