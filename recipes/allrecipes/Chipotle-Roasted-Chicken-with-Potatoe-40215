Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Combine chipotle chile pepper, paprika, oregano, garlic salt and cumin. In large bowl, toss potatoes with oil and 1 teaspoon of the spice mixture. Mix brown sugar with remaining spice mixture; set aside. Line jellyroll pan with aluminum foil and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Rub chicken pieces on both sides with remaining spice mixture, rubbing a little under the skin as well. Arrange chicken, skin-side-up, on one half of baking pan. Arrange potatoes, in single layer, on other half of pan. Loosely cover chicken and potatoes with aluminum foil. Bake 40 minutes; remove foil. Turn and rearrange potatoes. Bake, uncovered, 20 minutes longer or until meat thermometer inserted in chicken thigh registers 180 degrees F and potatoes are tender. Garnish with cilantro.
