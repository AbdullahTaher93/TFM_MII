Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry chicken strips in the hot oil until warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer chicken to paper towel-lined plates using a slotted spoon. Cut chicken into bite-size chunks. Layer mashed potatoes, Cheddar cheese, corn, and chicken, respectively, into individual serving bowls.
