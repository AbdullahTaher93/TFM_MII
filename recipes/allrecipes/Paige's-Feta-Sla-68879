Toss cabbage and chopped green onions together in a large bowl; set aside. In a separate bowl, slowly whisk oil into vinegar. Add water, garlic, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning, and whisk until well-blended. Toss cabbage with dressing and feta cheese. Cover, and refrigerate 15 minutes or longer to allow flavors to develop. Serve chilled.
