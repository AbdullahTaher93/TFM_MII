Cook linguine according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the next five ingredients. Cook and stir over medium-low heat until mixture reaches 160 degrees F and coats the back of a metal spoon. Stir in 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, peas and bacon; heat through. Drain linguine; toss with sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan cheese.
