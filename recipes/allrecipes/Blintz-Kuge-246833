Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles; cook, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain. Beat eggs and sugar together in a bowl until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Add cottage cheese, farmers cheese, sour cream, and melted butter; mix well to combine. Stir in noodles. Spread noodle mixture in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Sprinkle corn flakes on top. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 40 minutes.
