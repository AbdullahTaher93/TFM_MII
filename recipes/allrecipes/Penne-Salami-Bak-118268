Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain and set aside. In a large skillet, saute onion and garlic in oil until tender; stir in the tomatoes, tomato paste, green and sweet red peppers, salami, olives, salt and pepper. Simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in pasta. Combine cheeses. Spoon half of pasta mixture into a greased 2-qt. baking dish. Sprinkle with 1-1/3 cups cheese. Top with remaining pasta and cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until cheese is melted.
