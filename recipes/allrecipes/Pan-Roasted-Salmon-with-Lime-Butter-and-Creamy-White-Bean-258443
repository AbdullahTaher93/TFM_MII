Mix butter, lime zest, lime juice, garlic, and salt together in a bowl. Spoon butter onto a large piece of plastic wrap; roll up into a log. Refrigerate until firm, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Season salmon with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons lime butter and olive oil in a cast iron skillet set over a camping stove. Cook salmon fillets, skin-side down, until crisp, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until easily flaked with a fork, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer salmon fillets to a plate; top each fillet with 1 tablespoon lime butter. Heat 1 teaspoon lime butter in the skillet. Cook and stir shallot in the hot butter until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in white beans and heavy cream; season with salt and pepper. Simmer until slightly thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in chives, mint, basil, parsley, and tarragon. Divide bean mixture among 4 serving plates; place 1 salmon fillet on top.
