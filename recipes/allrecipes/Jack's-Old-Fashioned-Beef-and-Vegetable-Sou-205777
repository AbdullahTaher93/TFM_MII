Melt the butter in a large stockpot over medium heat; cook the onion, celery, and steak in the melted butter until the onions caramelize, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the beef stock, water, bay leaf, marjoram, oregano, and soup bones; lower the heat to medium-low and simmer 3 hours, skimming froth off the top of the soup as it develops. Add the potato, carrot, bell pepper, black beans, split peas, rice, macaroni, tomatoes in puree, cabbage, and red wine to the stockpot. Simmer 1 hour more. Remove the soup bones, scraping any meat from them back into the pot. Season with salt and pepper to serve.
