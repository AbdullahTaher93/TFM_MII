Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat olive oil with garlic powder and parsley. Just warm the oil; it does not need to be hot. Arrange slices of bread on a medium baking sheet. Using a basting brush, brush generously with the olive oil mixture. Bake in the preheated oven approximately 10 minutes, until lightly toasted. Remove from oven, and sprinkle bread with mozzarella cheese and any remaining olive oil mixture. Return to oven until cheese is melted and bread is lightly browned.
