Cut chicken roughly into 1 1/2-inch chunks. Chop the bottom 1/3 of the green onions that is white and pale green, to get 1/4 cup. Place the chopped green onions, salt, pepper, Dannon(R) All Natural Plain Yogurt and oil into the blender and blend on high until smooth. Place chicken in a zip lock plastic bag. Pour the marinade over the chicken and marinate for at least 2 hours. Cut the rest of the green onion tops into 1-inch pieces. Meanwhile, soak 4 bamboo skewers in water while chicken is marinating. Preheat broiler. Onto the skewers, thread the chicken, alternating with green onion. Broil chicken 3 inches from heat. Flip the skewers after they have cooked for about five minutes. Cook until chicken is golden brown and cooked through, about 7-10 minutes. Do not overcook.
