In a bowl, beat eggs and seasonings. Melt butter in a skillet. Add egg mixture; cook over medium heat. As eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. When eggs are completely set, remove from the heat. Place cheese over half of the eggs. Fold in half and transfer to a warm platter.
