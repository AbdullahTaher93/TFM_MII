Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread walnuts onto a baking sheet. Bake walnuts in the preheated oven until fragrant, about 7 minutes. Add coconut to the walnuts and bake until coconut is toasted, about 3 more minutes. Remove from oven and cool. Blend walnuts, coconut, sugar, and cinnamon together in a food processor until smooth.
