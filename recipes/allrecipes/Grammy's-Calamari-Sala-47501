In a medium bowl, mix lemon juice, garlic, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Stir in squid, and cook about 3 minutes, or until tender; drain. Toss squid, olives, and celery with the lemon juice mixture. Cover, and chill in the refrigerator until serving.
