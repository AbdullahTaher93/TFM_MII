Spread 1 tablespoon butter and 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil onto 1 side of each bread slice. Heat a cast iron skillet or non-stick skillet over medium heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil. Spread peanut butter, marshmallow creme, and chocolate-hazelnut spread into the other side of each bread slice and put slices together with butter-oil side on the outside, creating a sandwich. Place sandwiches in the hot skillet, cover the skillet, and cook until sandwiches are lightly golden brown, about 30 seconds per side.
