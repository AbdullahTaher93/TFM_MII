Preheat the oven to 350 degree F (180C). Coat an 8 x 8-inch (20 x 20-cm) baking dish with nonstick spray. Place the fillets in the baking dish. Sprinkle with the lime juice and oregano. Set aside. Warm the oil in a medium skillet set over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 or 6 minutes or until soft. Add the tomatoes, olives, and parsley. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until thickened. Spoon over the fillets. Cover tightly with foil. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily.
