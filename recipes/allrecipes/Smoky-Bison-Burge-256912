To make the sauce, combine ketchup with ground chile, molasses, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, onion powder, salt, cumin and mustard. Whisk well and set aside. To prepare burgers, mix the ground bison with seasonings in a large bowl. Shape 8 patties of equal size and brush each with half of the olive oil. In a large skillet, add reserved olive oil and heat until smoking over medium-high heat. Cook 4 patties, covered, for 5 minutes. Turn and cook another 5 minutes, covered. (Add cheese, if desired, for the last 1 minute of cooking.) Remove to a warm platter and cover while you cook the remaining patties. Keeping the skillet warm, brush the buns with olive oil and toast on either side for about 10 to 15 seconds. Assemble burgers by placing cooked patties on bun bottoms, topping with smoky sauce and pickles, along with desired burger toppings.
