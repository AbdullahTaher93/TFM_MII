Crush 40 of the wafers; mix with 3 Tbsp. of the sugar and the margarine until well blended. Press firmly onto bottom of 13x9-inch baking pan; set aside. Pour milk into large bowl. Add dry pudding mixes. Beat with wire whisk 2 min. or until well blended. Gently stir in whipped topping. Spread half of the pudding mixture over crust; top with remaining 24 wafers. Cover with remaining pudding mixture. Refrigerate at least 3 hours. Meanwhile, toss strawberries with remaining 1 Tbsp. sugar. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Cut dessert into 24 squares. Serve each square topped with about 2 Tbsp. of the strawberry mixture. Refrigerate any leftover dessert.
