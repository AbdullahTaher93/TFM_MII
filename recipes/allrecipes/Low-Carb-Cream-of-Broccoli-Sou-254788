Combine chicken broth, cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, butter, and onion flakes in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir until smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Add heavy cream and chicken; bring to a gentle simmer. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a colander to drain excess moisture. Pour chicken broth mixture into a slow cooker; add broccoli. Cook on Low until flavors combine, about 4 hours.
