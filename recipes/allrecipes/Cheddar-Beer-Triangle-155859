Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Stir the baking mix, Cheddar cheese, and beer in a bowl until the mixture clings together. Knead briefly on a lightly-floured surface until the dough just holds together. Pat the dough into a 6-inch circle and cut into 10 wedges; place the wedges onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until browned on the bottom and golden brown on top, 8 to 10 minutes.
