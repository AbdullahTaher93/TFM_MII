Grease three 9-in. round baking pans. Line with waxed paper; grease and flour the paper. In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in molasses. Combine the flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon and salt; add to the creamed mixture alternately with milk. Spoon into prepared pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely. In a small mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and butter. Add lemon peel. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar until smooth. Place on cake on a serving platter. Spread with about 2/3 cup frosting; repeat layers twice. Refrigerated until serving.
