Trim off and discard chard stem ends; cut off remainder of stems at base of each leaf. Thinly slice stems and leaves crosswise; keep separate. Set aside. In a 5- to 6-quart pan, fill with 3 quarts of water and heat to boiling. Cook pasta according to package directions. Meanwhile, heat oil in a wide (at least 12-in.) frying pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and chard stems; cook stirring often, until onion is soft but not browned (3 to 5 minutes). Add garlic and chard leaves and cook, stirring often, until leaves are bright green (about 3 more minutes). Add 3/4 cup water and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and blend in ricotta; season to taste with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Drain pasta well and place in a warm wide serving bowl. Add ricotta mixture; mix lightly, using 2 forks. If desired, serve with parmesan cheese to add to taste.
