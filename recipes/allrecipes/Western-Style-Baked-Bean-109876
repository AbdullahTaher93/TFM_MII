Crumble the ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain off grease and transfer the beef to a 4 quart or larger slow cooker. Stir in the baked beans, bacon, ham, onion, chili powder, ketchup, brown sugar and molasses. If it seems thick, stir in the water. Cover and cook on High for 3 hours or cook for 6 to 8 hours on Low.
