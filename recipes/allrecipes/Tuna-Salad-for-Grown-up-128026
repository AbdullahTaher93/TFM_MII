Sear the tuna in a nonstick skillet on medium-high heat (1 minute per side), seasoning each side with a pinch of salt and pepper as the other side cooks. Remove the tuna from the skillet and set aside. In a large bowl, toss together the lettuce, tomatoes, olives, and roasted red pepper. In a small bowl, stir together the olive oil, lemon juice, mustard, thyme, and garlic until well blended. Cut the tuna into 1/2-inch-thick slices (it should be raw inside). Divide the salad onto two plates and top with the tuna and dressing.
