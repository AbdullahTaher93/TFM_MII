Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat the egg together with the milk in a medium bowl. In another bowl, stir together the cheese, flour, salt, pepper and paprika. Dip catfish in the egg and milk mixture, then dredge in the cheese mixture until coated. Arrange fish in a single layer in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour melted butter over the fish. Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden brown.
