In a large pot over medium heat, cook onions in oil until just tender. Stir in sausage and cook 5 minutes more. Place cabbage, potatoes, beans, ketchup, consomme and water in the pot. Season with garlic powder, pepper and salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 30 to 45 minutes. Stir in vinegar and simmer 1 hour more. Add more water if needed.
