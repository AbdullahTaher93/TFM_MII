In a medium bowl, beat the cottage cheese and egg together. Stir in the half-and-half, flour, baking powder, salt, sugar and nutmeg. Mix until just combined. Fill a deep pot to the 2-inch mark with oil. Heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Drop batter by rounded tablespoons into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown on all sides, about 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Serve hot!
