Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Cook the celery, carrots, onion and garlic until they're tender. Stir the broth, Italian seasoning and tomatoes in the skillet. Heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 15 minutes or until the vegetables are tender-crisp. Add the pasta and beans and cook for 5 minutes. Place half of the broth mixture into a blender or food processor. Cover and blend until smooth. Pour the pureed mixture into the skillet. Cook over medium heat until the mixture is hot.
