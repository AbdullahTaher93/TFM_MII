Blend together shortening, 1 cup white sugar, and brown sugar. Add eggs, vanilla, flour, salt, and soda. Mix well, and set dough aside. To Make Filling: In a saucepan, combine dates, sugar, water and nuts. Cook over medium heat until thick. Cool filling. If necessary, add water until mixture can be spread easily on the dough. Divide dough into 4 parts. Roll out each piece on a floured surface to 1/2 inch thick. Spread with cooled, not cold filling. Roll up jelly-roll style. Close ends and place rolls on cookie sheets. Refrigerate until cold. Slice chilled rolls, and bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 10 minutes.
