Heat a large pot over medium-high heat, and stir in the ground beef. Cook until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain, and discard any excess grease. Stir in the potatoes, carrots, green beans, corn, tomatoes, tomato sauce, and water. Bring the soup to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
