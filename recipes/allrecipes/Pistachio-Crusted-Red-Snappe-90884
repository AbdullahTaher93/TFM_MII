In a blender or food processor, whirl pistachios until finely ground. Pour pistachios into a wide, shallow bowl and add bread crumbs, parsley, and pepper; mix well. In another wide, shallow bowl, beat egg to blend. One at a time, dip fish fillets into egg to coat, then press each side of fillets into nut mixture to coat well. Lay fillets in a greased or nonstick 10- by 15-inch baking pan. Melt butter in an 8- to 10-inch frying pan over medium heat. Add onions and capers, and stir just until onions are brighter green, 1 to 2 minutes. Holding onions and capers back with a spoon, pour butter evenly over fillets. Bake fish in a 450 degrees F oven until fish is opaque in center of thickest part (cut to test), about 10 minutes. With a wide spatula, carefully transfer fillets to 4 dinner plates and top equally with onion-caper mixture. Offer lemon wedges to squeeze over fish and salt to add to taste.
