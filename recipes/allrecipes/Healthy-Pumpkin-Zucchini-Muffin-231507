Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line them with paper liners. Combine oats, whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, raisins, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice, and baking soda in a bowl. Mix zucchini, pumpkin, almond milk, agave nectar, eggs, and canola oil in a separate bowl; stir into dry ingredients until just combined. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
