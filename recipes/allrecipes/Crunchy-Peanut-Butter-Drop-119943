In a large saucepan over medium heat, cook and stir corn syrup and sugar for 7-8 minutes or until sugar is dissolved (do not boil). Remove from the heat; add peanut butter and mix well. Fold in cornflakes. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls onto waxed paper coated with nonstick cooking spray. Let stand for 1-1/2 to 2 hours or until set. Store in a waxed paper-lined airtight container.
