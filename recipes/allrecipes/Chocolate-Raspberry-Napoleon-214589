Place chocolate in a small bowl. In a small saucepan, bring cream just to a boil. Pour over chocolate; whisk until smooth. Refrigerate until chilled. Meanwhile, place one sheet of phyllo dough on a work surface (keep remaining dough covered with plastic wrap and a damp towel to prevent it from drying out). Brush with butter; sprinkle with sugar. Repeat layers seven times. Cut into eight rectangles. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. In a small bowl, beat chocolate mixture until soft peaks form, about 15 seconds. Gently split each pastry in half horizontally. Spread 3 tablespoons chocolate mixture over bottom halves; layer with raspberries and remaining chocolate mixture. Replace tops. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Serve immediately.
