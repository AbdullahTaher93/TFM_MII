Set oven control to broil. Place baguette slices on baking sheet. Broil until toasted on one side. Set aside; let cool. Mix cheese, mayonnaise, mustard and pepper. Spread untoasted side of each baguette slice with a scant tablespoon of cheese mixture. Place on baking sheet. Broil with tops 2 to 3 inches from heat 2 to 3 minutes or until puffed, golden and bubbly. Slice each pear half into 8 thin slices. Top each baguette slice with pear slice, trimming to fit, if needed. Serve while still warm.
