Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Score 1/2 inch slits in your roast and place in baking dish. Combine honey, mustard, pepper, thyme, and salt in small bowl; mix until well blended. Brush mixture over roast, working well into slits. Bake roast in preheated oven for one hour. Remove roast from oven and flip in pan. Brush remaining honey sauce over roast. Return to oven and continue baking for 45 minutes to an hour or until internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let stand for 15 minutes before slicing.
