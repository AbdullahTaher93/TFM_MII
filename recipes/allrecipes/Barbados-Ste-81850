Give the cabbage a fine shred and mince the scallions. In a soup pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the cabbage and saute until it starts to turn a little bit brown (3-5 minutes). Add the scallions, curry powder, and lemon pepper. Mix well sauteing for another minute. Add the coconut milk and the chicken stock. Bring to a boil. Add the chicken and bring to a boil again. Then reduce heat, cover and simmer for 45 minutes to an hour. Check on it occasionally with a good stir and make sure it is not boiling. I like to stir enough towards the end to knock the meat off the bones (a fork helps) and then fish out the bones before serving (but that's just me). You can also serve it with the bones and provide a fork, soup spoon and a pile of damp towels, so you and your guests can get your fingers into it as you lick the juices off the bone (so much fun). Provide an extra bowl to dispose of the chicken bones. Meanwhile, prepare the lemon & limes. You'll need 1 lemon and 2 limes for this recipe. Zest the lemon and just one of the limes and put the zest in a small bowl and set it aside to garnish at the end. Juice the zested lemon and lime into a small bowl and set aside. From the second lime, cut off 4 slices and set aside, as garnish. Once the stew has finished cooking it is time to thicken it. Ladle 1 cup of the soup stock into a bowl, add the guar gum whisking vigorously. Then pour this back into the soup pot. This stew can sit at a simmer until you are ready to serve. Just before serving, stir in the lemon/lime juice. Ladle the stew into individual bowls and garnish with a slice of lime and a sprinkle of zest.
