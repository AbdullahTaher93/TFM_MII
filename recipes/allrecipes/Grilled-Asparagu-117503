In a large skillet, bring water to a boil; add asparagus. Cover and cook for 4-6 minutes or until almost tender; drain and pat dry. Cool slightly. Thread several asparagus spears onto two parallel soaked wooden skewers. Repeat. Grill, uncovered, over medium heat for 2 minutes, turning once. Baste with barbecue sauce. Grill 2 minutes longer, turning and basting once.
