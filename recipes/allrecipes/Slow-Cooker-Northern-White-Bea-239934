Place beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain and rinse. Place neck bones in a slow cooker and pour chicken broth over the top; stir in soul seasoning. Cook on High until meat is falling off the bones, about 1 hour. Transfer bones and meat to a plate and shred meat from bones; discard bones. Stir beans, onion, vinegar, sugar, and hot sauce into slow cooker; spread shredded meat over beans. Cook on High for 2 to 4 hours (or cook on Low for 4 to 6 hours).
