Place the sugar, lemon zest, salt, and pepper into the bowl of a small food processor and process for 1 minute or mix in bowl with wire whisk until well combined. Evenly spread the mixture onto the salmon and allow to sit for 45 minutes, at room temperature. Preheat the grill. Once hot, place salmon on grill skin side down for 4 minutes. After 4 minutes, flip the salmon and cook until the thickest part of the fish reaches an internal temperature of 131 degrees F. Remove the salmon from the grill and allow to rest, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Serve immediately with lemon wedge.
