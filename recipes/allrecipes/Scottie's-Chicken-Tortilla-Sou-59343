Combine the chicken broth, corn, black beans, beef bouillon, broccoli, and tomatoes in a large pot over medium heat. While the broth mixture simmers, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet. Fry the tortilla strips in the hot oil until crisp. Remove from skillet and drain on paper towels. Pour 2 tablespoons olive oil into the skillet. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken; cook and stir until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Stir in the lime juice, tequila, onion powder, garlic salt, cayenne pepper, and Cajun seasoning; cook another 2 minutes. Transfer the chicken mixture to the pot with the broth mixture. Cook on medium 45 minutes; reduce heat to low and simmer another 45 minutes; ladle into bowls and top with tortilla strips and cheese to serve.
