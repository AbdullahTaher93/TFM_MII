Cook the hashbrown patties according to package directions. Mash with a fork and set aside. Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat. Place the peppers in the boiling water and turn off the stove. After 10 minutes remove the peppers from the water and set aside. In a large skillet, cook beef over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Mix in the hashbrowns, green beans, jalapeno, salt, pepper, cumin, and cheddar cheese. Loosely stuff the beef mixture into the peppers. Place peppers onto a baking sheet. Bake 20 minutes in a 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven. Let cool 1 minute before serving.
