Warm milk in a saucepan or in the microwave. Insert whip or blender into warmed almond milk, turn on the motor and whip until milk becomes a dense foam. (If using a handheld blender, the results wont be as frothy.) Prepare espresso-style coffee according to package instructions, filling each mug halfway. Divide foamed milk among the mugs and into the coffee. Dust each mug with a pinch of cocoa, if desired.
