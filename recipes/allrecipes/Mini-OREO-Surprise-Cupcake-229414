Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare cake batter as directed on package. Mix cream cheese, egg and sugar until blended. Spoon half the cake batter into 24 paper-lined muffin cups. Top each with about 1-1/2 teaspoon cream cheese mixture and 1 cookie; cover with remaining cake batter. Bake 19 to 22 minutes or until toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean. Cool 5 minutes; remove from pans to wire racks. Cool completely. Frost with whipped topping. Top with remaining cookies.
