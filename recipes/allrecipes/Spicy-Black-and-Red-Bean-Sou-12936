Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until hot. Add onion, carrot, and garlic; saute 5 minutes. Stir in broth, sugar, corn, beans, tomatoes, and chilies; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 2 hours. This soup can also be prepared in a crock pot. Combine everything in the pot, and cook on HIGH for the first hour. Turn the temperature down to LOW, and cook 7 more hours.
