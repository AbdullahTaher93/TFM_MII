Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, chile-garlic sauce, red pepper flakes, and garlic until the onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Add water, peanut butter, ketchup, sesame oil, and sugar to the onion mixture; cook and stir until smooth. Reduce heat to low and simmer until thickened, about 15 minutes.
