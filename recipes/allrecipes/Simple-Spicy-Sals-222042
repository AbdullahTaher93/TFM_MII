Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Poke a few holes into the jalapeno and serrano peppers and drop into the boiling water. Reduce heat to medium and boil for 15 minutes. Drain. Cut stems off peppers and place into a food processor with diced tomatoes and their juice, onion, and garlic. Pulse several times to your desired texture. Transfer to a serving bowl and stir in salt. If desired, cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 hour to blend flavors.
