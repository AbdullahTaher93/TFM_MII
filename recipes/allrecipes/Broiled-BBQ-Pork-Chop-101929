Adjust oven rack to center position (8 to 9 inches from top heating element) and preheat broiler. Combine all ingredients except pork chops in a medium saucepan on medium-high heat and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, to the consistency of a thin sauce, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Reserving 3/4 cup of the sauce for dipping at the table, dip each chop into sauce; turn to coat completely. Place barbecue-coated chops on a wire rack set over a foil-covered lipped cookie sheet. Broil, brushing once with remaining sauce used for dipping until the edges of the chops start to brown and chops are cooked through, about 10 minutes. Serve with reserved sauce for dipping.
