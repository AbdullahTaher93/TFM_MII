Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the squash pieces in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook until the squash is tender, about 15 minutes. Drain; then mash the squash with 1/4 cup butter, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, salt, and white pepper. Heat the 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over low heat; stir in sliced apples and sprinkle with the white sugar. Cover and cook over low heat until barely tender, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Spread the apples in a 3-quart casserole. Spoon the mashed squash evenly over the apples. Stir together the cornflakes, pecans, the 1/2 cup brown sugar, and melted butter. Sprinkle the cornflake mixture evenly over the squash. Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 15 minutes.
