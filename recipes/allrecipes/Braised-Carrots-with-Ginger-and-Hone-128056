In a 10-inch (25-cm) ovenproof skillet, bring the carrots, ginger ale, honey, gingerroot, orange peel, orange juice, lemon juice, and pepper to a boil over medium-high heat. Remove from the heat. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C), stirring occasionally, until the carrots are tender and the liquid is syrupy, about 40 minutes. Garnish with the parsley.
