Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion and cook until almost softened, about 3 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes longer. Add sherry, simmer until evaporated; whisk in soup, milk and basil. Remove from heat and set aside. In a small bowl, mix ricotta cheese and nutmeg. To assemble lasagna, spread 1/3 cup of the sauce over the bottom of a 9x13 inch casserole dish. Layer 3 lasagna noodles, 1 cup sauce, 1/3 of the chicken, 2/3 cup ricotta and 1/4 of the cheddar cheese. Layer 3 more lasagna noodles, and repeat layers; sprinkle over remaining cheddar and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil and bake in preheated oven until bubbly and heated through, about 30 minutes. Remove foil and broil until top is golden brown, about 5 minutes longer.
