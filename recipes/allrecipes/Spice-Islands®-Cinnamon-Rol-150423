Dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup warm water. In a large bowl, combine mashed potatoes, potato water, butter, salt and sugar. Add egg, cold water and yeast mixture. Mix well. Add flour to make very soft dough. Knead 5 minutes. Cover and let rise until doubled. Punch dough down. Roll out dough to a 24 x 12-inch rectangle on a floured surface. Spread dough with melted butter. Combine 1 cup sugar and the cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly over the melted butter. Roll up from long sides, as a jelly roll. Cut into 24 equal slices. Place cut side up in a greased 11 x 15-inch pan. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25 to 30 minutes, or until done. Remove from oven and cool on rack. For frosting, combine all ingredients; beat until smooth and creamy. Frost cooled rolls.
