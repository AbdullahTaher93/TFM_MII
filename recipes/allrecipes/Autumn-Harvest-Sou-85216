Melt butter over medium heat in a large saucepan. Add onion and saute about 3 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add squash, apple, pecans, and brandy. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 1 minute. Stir in broth, ginger, and nutmeg. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes or until squash and apple are tender. Cool slightly. Working in batches, blend squash mixture in a blender or food processor until smooth. Return squash mixture to saucepan. Stir in whipping cream. Heat through, but do not boil. Top each serving with a dollop of sour cream, if desired.
