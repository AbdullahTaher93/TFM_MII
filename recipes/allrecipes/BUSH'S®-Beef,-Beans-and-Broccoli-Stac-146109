For Vinaigrette: Heat olive oil over low heat in a small saute pan. Add garlic, cook over low heat until translucent approximately 5-8 minutes (garlic should have no color). Remove to a small bowl, stir in red wine vinegar and sugar. Pour 2 tablespoons over the beans and toss. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. For Salad: Toss blanched broccoli florets with 1 tablespoon of vinaigrette, season with salt and pepper. Set aside. Slice zucchini, beef, mozzarella and tomato. Combine broccoli and beans into a large bowl. To serve, divide zucchini slices evenly among 4 plates. Sprinkle bean and broccoli mixture evenly over the zucchini. Place 2 slices of mozzarella over the broccoli and bean mixture. Finish by layering the beef tenderloin on the mozzarella and top with 1 slice of tomato. Season with salt and pepper, sprinkle with chives and drizzle the vinaigrette on each plate. If desired, cover tightly and let sit in refrigerator for 1 hour.
