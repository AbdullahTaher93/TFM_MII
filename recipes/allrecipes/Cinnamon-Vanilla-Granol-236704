Combine old fashioned oats, quick oats, pecans and wheat germ in a large bowl. Combine maple syrup, oil, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg in a small bowl. Pour over oat mixture, stirring to coat. Spread mixture evenly on greased baking sheet. Bake at 300 degrees F for 50 to 60 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes, until oats are toasted. Remove from oven and stir in dried fruit. Cool in pan on wire rack. Store in airtight container. Serving suggestion: To make yogurt parfaits, layer 6 ounces vanilla yogurt, 1/2 cup mixed fresh or frozen fruit and 1/4 cup granola.
