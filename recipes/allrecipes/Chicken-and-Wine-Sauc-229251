Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Stir red wine, soy sauce, salad dressing, brown sugar, ground ginger, garlic, and oregano together in a bowl until the sugar dissolves completely. Add chicken and mix to coat. Pour into a casserole dish. Bake in preheated oven until chicken no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 1 hour.
