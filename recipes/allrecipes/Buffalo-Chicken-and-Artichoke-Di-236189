Mix cream cheese, artichoke hearts, Cheddar cheese, ranch dressing, sour cream, hot sauce, and bacon bits together in a saucepan over medium heat; cook, stirring frequently, until cheeses are melted, 5 to 10 minutes. Add chicken to cream cheese mixture and cook until heated through, about 5 more minutes.
