Cover tray with wax paper. In medium microwave-safe bowl, place peanut butter chips, chocolate chips and shortening. Microwave at HIGH (100%) 1-1/2 to 2 minutes or until chips are melted and mixture is smooth when stirred. With fork, dip each cookie into chip mixture; gently tap fork on side of bowl to remove excess chocolate. Place coated cookies on prepared tray; top each cookie with graham snack cracker. Refrigerate, uncovered, until chocolate is set, about 30 minutes. Store in airtight container in cool, dry place. About 4 dozen cookies.
