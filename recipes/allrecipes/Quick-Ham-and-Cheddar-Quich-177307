Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Stack ham into a block and slice into 1/2-inch squares. Add to a medium bowl with cheese. Thinly slice enough green onions to make 1/2 cup, then mix into the meat-cheese mixture. Add eggs, sour cream, garlic powder, and salt to a blender; blend on high until well mixed. Place frozen pie shell onto baking sheet. Spread meat-cheese mixture evenly into the bottom of the shell. Pour mixture over meat and cheese. Place baking sheet into preheated oven and bake 30 to 35 minutes, until eggs are set and quiche is lightly browned on top. Remove from oven and let rest 10 minutes before serving. Or cool to room temperature, then cover tightly with aluminum foil and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 2 months.
