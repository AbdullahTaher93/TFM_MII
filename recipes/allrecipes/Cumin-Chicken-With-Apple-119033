In a large skillet, brown chicken in butter. Transfer to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. In the drippings, saute apples, onions and mushrooms until apples are crisp-tender. Add flour, soup, water, cumin, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper; mix well. Pour over chicken. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour or until the chicken juices run clear. Sprinkle with chili powder. Serve over rice.
