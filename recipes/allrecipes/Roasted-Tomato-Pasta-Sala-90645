In a bowl, mix chopped basil, vinegar, oil, sugar, mustard, garlic, and pepper; pour 6 tablespoons of the mixture into a foil lined 10 by 15 inch rimmed pan. Cut each tomato lengthwise into 3 equal slices and lay in a single layer in the pan; turn to coat with dressing. Bake in a 425 degrees F oven until tomato edges are browned, 30 to 40 minutes. Meanwhile, in an 8 to 10 quart pan, bring about 6 quarts water to a boil over high heat. Add pasta, and cook just until tender to bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain; immerse in cold water until cool, about 3 minutes, then drain again. Pour pasta into a shallow bowl and add remaining basil dressing and tomatoes; mix and season to taste with salt. Top salad with cheese and basil sprigs.
