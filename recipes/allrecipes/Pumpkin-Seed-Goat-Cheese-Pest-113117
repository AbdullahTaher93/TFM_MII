In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat. Add the pumpkin seeds and cook, stirring, until they begin to turn brown (some will pop), about 5 minutes. Add the shallots and garlic and cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a plate to cool for 10 minutes. Add the pumpkin seed mixture to a food processor along with the parsley, sage, goat cheese and water. Turn the processor on and drizzle in the remaining 6 tablespoons of olive oil, until the mixture reaches an oatmeal like consistency. Transfer to a bowl and add the lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste.
