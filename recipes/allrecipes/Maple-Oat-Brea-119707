Place oats in a blender or food processor, cover and process oats for 6-7 seconds or until coarsely chopped. Transfer to a small bowl; add boiling water. Let stand until mixture cools to 110 degrees F-115 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/3 cup warm water; add syrup, oil, salt, oat mixture and 2 cups flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Shape into a flattened 9-in. round loaf. Place in a greased 9-in. round baking dish. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Brush with egg white; sprinkle with oats. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack to cool.
