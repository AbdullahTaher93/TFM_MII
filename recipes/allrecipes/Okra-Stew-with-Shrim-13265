Place shrimp in mixing bowl and squeeze lime juice on top, trying to coat shrimp evenly. Heat butter in a stock pot and saute the green pepper with shallots or chives for 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in corn, okra, tomatoes, tomato paste, thyme, bay leaf and chili pepper. Season with salt and pepper and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the shrimp, return to a boil and simmer for another 5 minutes. Remove bay leaf and chili before serving.
