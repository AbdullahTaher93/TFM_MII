Mix brown sugar, honey mustard, mustard powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder together in a small bowl; rub onto pork chops and let sit on a plate for flavors to dissolve into pork chops, about 10 minutes. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; add apple cider. Arrange coated pork chops in the skillet; cook until pork chops are browned, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
