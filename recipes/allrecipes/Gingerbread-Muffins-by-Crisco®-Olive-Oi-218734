Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Coat 12 muffin cups lightly with no-stick cooking spray. Combine flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger and cloves in large bowl. Whisk together olive oil, molasses, eggs and buttermilk in small bowl. Stir liquids into flour mixture just until moistened. Divide batter evenly into prepared muffin cups, about 3/4 full. Bake 15 to 18 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool on rack 10 minutes. Remove from pan and cool completely. Spread cooled muffins with frosting. Decorate as desired.
