Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Coat chicken with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Rub with paprika and chili pepper. Arrange chicken in a baking dish and bake for about 20 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove from the oven and set aside. In the meantime, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta for al dente texture. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of cooking water. In a large saucepan on medium high heat, cook bacon with garlic and remaining olive oil until crispy, about 10 minutes. Remove garlic and discard. Add cooked pasta, lemon juice and arugula to the pan. Add cooking water, if desired to help coat. Toss together for about 2 minutes on medium-high heat to incorporate flavors. Serve chicken sliced atop pasta.
