Following the directions on the package, combine the appropriate amount of sugar-free apple cider drink mix with one pint of water in a large pot. Add the cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice, and lemon peel. Keep the oranges whole and leave the peel on. Press 1/2 teaspoon's worth of cloves into each orange and place them in the pot. Heat at least 1/2 hour. Before serving, cut oranges into wedges for garnish. This recipe also makes a great slow-cooker recipe.
