In medium saucepan, combine peaches, pineapple with juice, sugar, cornstarch and ginger; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook and stir 1 minute or until mixture thickens. Stir in lemon juice; set aside. Meanwhile, grill salmon over medium-hot coals (or broil on rack of broiler pan 3 to 4 inches from heat) 7 to 11 minutes or until fish is cooked to desired doneness, turning once. Serve salmon with sauce and sprinkle with almonds, if desired.
