Let ice cream stand at room temperature for a few minutes to soften slightly. Pour candy sprinkles onto a plate. Scoop ice cream onto 4 cookies. Top each with another cookie, squeeze them together gently, and scrape the ice cream edge smooth with a small spatula. Roll edges in candy sprinkles. Eat ice cream sandwiches immediately, or freeze airtight at least 30 minutes or up to 1 day.
