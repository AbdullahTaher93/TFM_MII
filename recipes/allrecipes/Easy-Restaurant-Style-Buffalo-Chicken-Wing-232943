Rinse chicken wings in cold water; drain and pat dry with paper towels. Mix flour, salt, pepper, and garlic powder together in a 1-gallon resealable bag; add chicken wings. Seal bag and shake to evenly coat chicken. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Remove chicken from bag and shake off any excess coating; fry in the preheated oil until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 7 minutes. Remove chicken with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Combine hot sauce and butter in saucepan over medium heat; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Coat cooked chicken wings with sauce.
