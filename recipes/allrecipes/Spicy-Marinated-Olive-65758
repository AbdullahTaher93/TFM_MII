Toast coriander and cumin seeds in a small skillet over medium heat, shaking skillet occasionally, until seeds are fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. In a jar with a tight fitting lid, combine seeds and remaining ingredients except olives. Cover; shake well. Add olives; cover and shake well to coat olives with marinade. Refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to 1 month before serving. Serve at room temperature with wooden picks as an appetizer or add to a tossed green salad
