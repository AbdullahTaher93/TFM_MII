Prepare the cake mix according to package directions. Allow cake to cool for one hour. Crumble cake into a large bowl. Mix in Kahlua. Add frosting and stir until combined. Mixture will be sticky. Cover and refrigerate 2 hours or overnight. Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Use a melon baller to form 2 inch bites; place on waxed paper. Freeze bites for one hour or until firm enough to coat. Using a skewer, pick up bites one at a time and dip into melted chocolate. Use another skewer to slide bite onto the lined cookie sheet. Allow bites to set in refrigerator. Optional: After bites have set, use a pastry bag fitted with a #3 tip to drizzle melted white chocolate.
