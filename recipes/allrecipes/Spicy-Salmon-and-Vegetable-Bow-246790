Preheat the broiler to low heat. Whisk together the chili garlic sauce, 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, sugar and vinegar until combined. Add the cut up salmon to the bowl and mix until coated. Line a cookie sheet with Reynolds Wrap(R) Non-Stick Foil and evenly spread out the salmon and cook under the broiler for 8 to 10 minutes or until browned and cooked throughout. Pour the remaining 1 tablespoon of sesame oil into a large frying pan on high heat and add in the bell peppers, snow peas and carrot and stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes. Finish the vegetables by adding the remaining 1 tablespoon of soy sauce. Divide the rice into 4 portions and serve the cooked salmon and vegetables evenly. Optional Servings: Serve with a hard boiled egg or a fried egg.
