Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Coat a roasting pan with cooking spray. Place a steamer basket in a large saucepan with 1/2 inch of water. Place the potatoes and carrots in the steamer. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 5 minutes, or until the potatoes are just tender. Remove from the heat. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the lemon peel, dried rosemary, fennel, pepper, and salt. Rub the pork with 2 teaspoons of the herb mixture. Place the pork in the center of the prepared roasting pan and drizzle with 1 teaspoon of the oil. Add the potatoes and carrots, tomatoes, and onion to the herb mixture remaining in the bowl. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and toss to coat well. Arrange the vegetables around the roast. Drizzle the vegetables with the broth. Roast for 30 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted in the center reaches 155 degrees F, the juices run clear, and the vegetables are tender and lightly browned on the edges. Place the pork on a cutting board and let stand for 5 minutes. Slice the pork on the diagonal and place on a platter with the vegetables. Drizzle with the pan juices and garnish with rosemary sprigs.
