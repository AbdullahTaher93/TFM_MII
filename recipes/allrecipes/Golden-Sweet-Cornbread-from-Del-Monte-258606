Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a glass or metal 9-inch square baking dish with non-stick cooking spray. Stir together all ingredients in a large mixing bowl; batter will be slightly lumpy. Pour batter evenly into prepared pan. Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until deep golden brown and wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes before cutting.
