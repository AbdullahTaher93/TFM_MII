Spray large baking sheet or 15x10x1-inch baking pan with cooking spray; set aside. Mix sugar and corn syrup in large microwaveable bowl until moistened. Microwave on HIGH 5 min. (CAUTION: Use pot holders as candy mixture gets very hot.) Stir in butter and peanuts. Microwave an additional 3 to 4 min. or until pale golden brown. Add baking soda and vanilla (mixture will foam.) Immediately spread mixture as thinly as possible onto prepared baking sheet. Cool completely. Break into pieces. Microwave chocolate in 1-cup glass measuring cup on HIGH 1 to 2 min. Stir until chocolate is completely melted. Stir in peanut butter until melted. Dip half of peanut brittle pieces halfway into chocolate mixture, scraping back of brittle against edge of cup to remove excess chocolate. Place on sheet of foil or wax paper. Refrigerate until chocolate is set, about 20 min.
