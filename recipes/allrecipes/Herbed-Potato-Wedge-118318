Cut potatoes in quarters. In a bowl, combine butter and lemon juice; brush over cut surfaces of potatoes. Combine the remaining ingredients; dip coated sides of potatoes into cheese mixture. Place potatoes, cut sides up, into a 2-qt. microwave-safe dish. Cover and microwave on high for 12-15 minutes or until potatoes are tender.
