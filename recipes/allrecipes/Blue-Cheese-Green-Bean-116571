Place the first eight ingredients in a blender; cover and process until combined. Gradually add oil in a steady stream, processing until smooth; set aside. Place the beans in a large saucepan and cover with water; bring to a boil. Cook, uncovered, for 8-10 minutes or until crisp-tender. Drain and place in a serving bowl. Drizzle with the blue cheese mixture and sprinkle with bacon.
