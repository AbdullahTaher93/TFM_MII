Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. To make the shell: Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of boiling water for about 8 minutes, or until tender but still firm to the bite. Drain thoroughly in a colander. In a large bowl, whisk together the cheese, egg, salt and garlic powder. Add the spaghetti and toss to coat. Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Press evenly in the bottom and up the sides to form a shell. To make the filling. Place a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until drops of water sprinkled into the skillet dance on the surface. Crumble the beef into the pan and cook, stirring often, for about 4 or 5 minutes, or until lightly browned. Pour off any drippings. Season the beef with the garlic powder, cumin and salt. Stir in the tomatoes and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 3 to 5 minutes, or until most of the liquid has evaporated. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the beef mixture for a garnish. Stir the sour cream into the remaining beef mixture and spoon it into the prepared shell. Sprinkle the cheese over the beef, leaving a 2-inch border around the edge. Spoon the reserved beef mixture onto the center of the cheese. Bake for 15 minutes, or until heated through. Serve the pie cut into wedges.
