Place turkey cutlets between two pieces of plastic wrap and pound with a mallet or rolling pin to 1/20 thick. Trim the asparagus and roll 4 asparagus spears inside each cutlet securing them with toothpicks. In a large skillet sprayed with nonstick vegetable cooking spray over medium-high heat, add vegetable oil. Add turkey rolls and cook 2 minutes on each side to brown. Add 1 cup of chicken broth to the skillet and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook 8 minutes or until turkey is done. Transfer turkey rolls to a plate. Keep warm. Add mushrooms to the skillet and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Combine corn starch with remaining 1/4 cup chicken broth and add to skillet with the Worcestershire sauce and salt. Cook 2 to 3 minutes until thickened. Remove toothpicks from turkey rolls, spoon sauce over the top, and sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley. Serve with hot cooked rice.
