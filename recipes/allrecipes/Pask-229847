Stir together 2 cups flour and the salt in a large bowl. Set aside. Stir yeast into water; add 2 tsp sugar and stir until dissolved. Let mixture stand for 10 minutes until doubled in volume. Meanwhile, beat eggs with electric mixer. Gradually beat in 3/4 cup sugar. Make a well in the flour mixture and pour in scalded milk. Add egg mixture; beat well. Add butter, and lemon and orange rinds and juices, and yeast; beat until combined. Add 1 cup flour at a time, until dough is soft and holds its shape. Knead on a flour-covered surface until elastic and no longer sticky. Place dough in a large bowl. Cover with a piece of plastic wrap that has been rubbed with a little oil. Let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 to 1-1/2 hours. Punch down and let rise again until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Divide dough in half; form each half into a loaf shape and place into a lightly greased 9 x 5-inch (23 x 12 cm) loaf pan. Let rise until doubled in bulk, about an hour. Bake in a preheated 325 degrees F (160 degrees C) oven until golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven, let cool for a few minutes, then remove loaves from pans and finish cooling on a wire rack. Ice just before serving. For each loaf, stir together 2 cups icing sugar with 1 tsp lemon juice and enough milk (approximately 4 tbsp/60 mL) to make a smooth icing that can be spooned over loaf. Decorate with sprinkles.
