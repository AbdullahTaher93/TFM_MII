Place bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until wilted, then add the onion and whole garlic cloves. Cook, stirring constantly until the onion is soft. Add the chicken livers and veal cubes to the skillet, and cook until no longer pink. Set aside to cool. Line a 9x5 inch loaf pan or mold with waxed paper, or spray with cooking spray, and set aside. Spoon the meat mixture into the container of a food processor, and pulse until finely chopped. Do not puree. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the meat mixture, and stir in heavy cream and milk. Cook until heated through. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then pour into the loaf pan or mold. Chill for at least 4 hours before serving.
