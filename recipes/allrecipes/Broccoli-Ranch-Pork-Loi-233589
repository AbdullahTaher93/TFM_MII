Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Slice down the pork lengthwise leaving a 1-inch thickness of meat and lay flat on a clean surface. In a food processor, combine the broccoli with 2 teaspoons Ranch mix and mayonnaise and process until smooth. Spoon the mixture into the bottom half of pork, roll, and fasten with toothpicks. In a bowl, combine remaining Ranch mix and bread crumbs and mix well. Liberally brush the mustard all over pork and roll the pork in bread crumb mixture until well coated. Transfer pork to a roasting pan fit with a rack. Roast for 40 minutes, or until an internal temperature of 165 degrees F is reached and the roast is nicely browned. Let pork stand 10 minutes before removing the toothpicks and slicing crosswise into 1-inch-thick slices.
