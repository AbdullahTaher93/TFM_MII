Prepare noodles per package directions. Place peanut butter in small microwaveable bowl and microwave on high 15 seconds to soften. Whisk together peanut butter, soy sauce, vinegar, oil, chile paste (if using), and sesame seeds in large bowl while noodles cook. Set aside. Heat medium skillet coated with cooking spray over medium heat. Add tofu and saute until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Drain noodles and add to peanut sauce along with all but 1/2 cup of the carrots. Mix until well combined. Top with tofu and remaining carrots and sprinkle with scallions. Serve immediately or chill and serve cold.
