Place eggs in a saucepan with enough cold water to cover, and bring to a boil. Remove saucepan from heat, cover, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Drain, cool, peel, and chop. In a large bowl, mix the eggs, onion, mayonnaise, and mustard. Season with dill, paprika, salt, and pepper. Mash well with a fork or wooden spoon. Spoon egg salad onto 4 slices of bread. Top with cucumbers, grated carrot, and lettuce, and the remaining slices of bread to make 4 sandwiches.
