Preheat broiler. Line a large baking sheet with foil. Roast pepper quarters, skin-up, for 15 minutes, until charred. Remove to paper bag. The steam released as they cool will loosen the skin. Using a small knife, peel off and discard charred skin. Chop peppers. Warm 1 Tbsp oil in large heavy saucepan over medium-low heat. Add shallots; cook 3 minutes, until soft, stirring. Add garlic; cook 1 minute, stirring. Add chopped peppers, broth, salt, and pepper. Increase heat; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat; let simmer 20 minutes, uncovered, until vegetables are very soft. Using a slotted spoon, transfer mixture to food processor or blender; puree. Add broth from pan; blend on high speed until smooth. Chill soup at least 6 hours or overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Using scissors, separate pita to make two rounds. Rub with a garlic half; brush lightly with oil, then sprinkle with cheese. Bake for 15 minutes. Cut each round into 4 wedges. To serve: Whisk soup to blend. Thin with additional broth or add salt, if necessary. Top servings with crisps and basil slices.
