Bring water and lentils to a boil on a saucepan; reduce heat and simmer until lentils are tender, adding more water if needed, 35 to 40 minutes. Spray an 8-inch square glass baking dish with cooking spray. Drain lentils and beat with an electric mixer until mostly smooth; cool slightly. Mix oats, onion, Colby-Jack cheese, dried cranberries, poultry seasoning, and seasoned salt together in a large bowl. Mix 1 1/2 cups cranberry sauce and egg substitute together in a separate bowl; stir into oats mixture. Slowly stir cooled lentil puree into oats mixture until evenly combined. Spread mixture into the prepared baking dish, smoothing the top with the back of a spoon. Cover dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 4 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove plastic wrap from baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Spoon 3/4 cup cranberry sauce over loaf and continue baking until loaf is cooked through, about 15 minutes more.
