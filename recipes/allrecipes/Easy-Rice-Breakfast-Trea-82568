Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Spread rice onto a platter and allow to cool in refrigerator 8 hours or overnight. Stir together 2 cups of the rice and 1 cup milk in each of two microwave-safe bowls. Cook in microwave on high until hot but not boiling, about 5 minutes. Combine the sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in a sealable bag; shake to mix. Divide the mixture between the two bowls of rice; stir through.
