In a medium bowl, stir together the diced chicken, celery, grapes, yogurt, Dijon mustard, honey, and dill weed. Spread 1/4 of the chicken mixture onto a slice of bread. Place 1/4 cup cucumber slices on chicken mixture and cover with another slice of bread. Cut into quarters. Repeat with remaining filling and bread. Chicken mixture will keep in refrigerator for up to 4 days.
