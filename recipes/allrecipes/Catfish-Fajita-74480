Place catfish in a large plastic bag. Pour lime juice over fish. Seal bag and marinate in refrigerator for 1 hour (do not marinate longer; the acid in the lime juice will 'cook' the fish). Soak wood chips in enough water to cover for 30 - 60 minutes. Drain wood chips. In a covered grill, test coals for medium-hot heat. Sprinkle wood chips over preheated coals. Lightly brush grill rack with cooking oil. Place catfish on grill rack. Cover and grill directly over medium-hot coals about 5 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily. Meanwhile in a large skillet cook onion, red or green pepper and garlic in butter or margarine until just tender. Stir in salt and pepper. Cut grilled catfish into chunks. Toss with onion mixture. Fill tortillas with catfish mixture. Serve with salsa, sour cream, guacamole and lime wedges.
