Preheat oven to 190 degrees C (375 degrees F). Rinse chicken in cold water, pat dry with paper towel. In a bowl, beat eggs until frothy, stir in buttermilk. In a plastic or paper bag combine crushed cornflakes, flax, paprika, parsley, salt, poultry seasoning and pepper. Dip chicken into egg mixture, and then coat with seasoned crumb mixture. Arrange pieces on foil or parchment lined baking sheet. Add garlic (if desired) to melted canola margarine and drizzle over chicken. Bake on centre rack until chicken is tender, and juices run clear, about 50 - 60 minutes.
