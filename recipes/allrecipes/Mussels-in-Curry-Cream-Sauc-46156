In a large saucepan, cook shallots and garlic in simmering wine until translucent. Stir in cream and curry powder. When sauce is heated through, add mussels. Cover, and steam mussels for a few minutes, until their shells open wide. With a slotted spoon, transfer steamed mussels to a bowl, leaving the sauce in the pan. Discard any unopened mussels. Whisk butter into the cream sauce. Turn heat off, and stir in parsley and green onions. Serve immediately.
