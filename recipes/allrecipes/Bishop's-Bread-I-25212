Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans. In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition. In a separate bowl, sift together flour, salt and baking powder. In a third bowl, combine the buttermilk, baking soda, vanilla extract and maraschino cherry juice. Stir the milk mixture and flour mixture alternately into the egg mixture until a soft batter is formed. Fold in cherries, chocolate chips, dates, coconut and pecans. Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake in preheated oven for 90 to 120 minutes, until loaves are firm and a toothpick inserted into the center of each loaf comes out clean.
