Peel, core, and cut pears into 1/2 inch cubes. There should be about 4 cups of fruit. Combine pears, dried cherries, vinegar, sugar, ginger, pepper, and salt in a heavy large saucepan. Simmer over medium heat until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes. Remove from heat, and cool to room temperature. Cover, and refrigerate overnight. Can be prepared 4 days ahead. Toast hazelnuts at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) on an ungreased baking sheet for 5 to 8 minutes. Husk the nuts, and chop coarsely. Stir into pear conserve. Serve at room temperature.
