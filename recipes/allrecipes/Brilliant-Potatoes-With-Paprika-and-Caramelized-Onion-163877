Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat, then stir in the Vidalia onion. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned deep brown, 10 to 15 minutes. While the onions are caramelizing, toss the drained potatoes with the olive oil in a large bowl. Season with garlic salt, garlic powder, dried minced garlic, and black pepper; toss until well coated, then pour into the prepared baking dish, and spread into a single layer. Sprinkle the caramelized onions on top of the potatoes, then dot the top of the dish with the room temperature butter, and sprinkle with paprika. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until the outsides of the potatoes are crisp, 45 to 55 minutes.
