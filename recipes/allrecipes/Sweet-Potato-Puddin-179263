Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2 quart baking dish. Peel and grate the sweet potatoes and mix with melted butter in a large bowl. In a medium bowl, beat eggs with sugar until well mixed. Pour over the sweet potato mixture, and stir in evaporated milk, whole milk, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, cloves, and vanilla extract. Mix well to combine all ingredients, and spoon into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 60 to 70 minutes, until the sweet potatoes are tender and the top is lightly browned. Remove dish from the oven and place marshmallows on top of the sweet potatoes. Return to the oven and bake 5 to 10 minutes more, until the marshmallows are lightly browned. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
