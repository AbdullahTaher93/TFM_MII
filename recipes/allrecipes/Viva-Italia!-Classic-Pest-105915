In a food processor, combine, basil, Parmesan cheese, pine nuts and garlic with 2 tablespoons of canola oil. Begin blending. As blending continues slowly add the remaining oil so that the sauce emulsifies. Add salt and pepper to taste. Label with the date and keep refrigerated instructions. Use within 1 to 2 days or freeze.
