In a large saucepan, cook the bacon until crisp. Remove to paper towels; crumble and set aside. Drain all but 2 tablespoons of the drippings. Saute celery and onion in drippings until onion is lightly browned. Add potatoes and water. Cover and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes. Stir in corn, milk, sausage, dill and bacon. Cook until the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.
