Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; saute 5 minutes. Spoon onion into a bowl. Add tomatoes, olives, water, and 1 teaspoon thyme leaves. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours. Prepare grill. Combine 1 teaspoon olive oil, remaining 2 teaspoons thyme, paprika, garlic salt, and red pepper. Rub mixture over both sides of catfish fillets. Place fillets on a grill rack coated with cooking spray; grill 5 minutes on each side, or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Serve with relish.
