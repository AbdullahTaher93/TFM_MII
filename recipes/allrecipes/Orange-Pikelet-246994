Combine 1/3 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoon orange juice and sugar together in a bowl. Sift 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour and salt in another bowl. Add to juice mixture; mix until batter is just combined. Let batter rest, about 10 minutes. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Coat with cooking spray. Drop spoonfuls of batter into hot skillet and cook until golden, about 2 minutes per side.
