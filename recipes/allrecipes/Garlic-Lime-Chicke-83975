In large bowl, toss chicken with oil, Seasoned Salt and Seasoned Pepper. Place in a Ziploc(R) bag and keep cold until ready to grill. Place lime quarters in Ziploc(R) bag and keep cold. Grill chicken on a well-oiled grill over medium direct heat, about 30 minutes, or until chicken is thoroughly cooked, turning frequently. While chicken is cooking, squeeze limes over chicken and sprinkle lightly with Garlic Salt after each turn.
