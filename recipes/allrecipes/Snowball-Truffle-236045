Coconut filling: Blend coconut, coconut milk, vanilla, and sweetener together. Refrigerate for about 10 minutes. Form chilled mixture into balls (about 1/2 teaspoon mixture each). Balls should be about the size of a small marble. Refrigerate or freeze coconut balls until ready to be wrapped in the chocolate truffle mixture. Chocolate truffles: Process nuts to a coarse crumb texture in a food processor. Add the cacao powder, protein powder, and salt; pulse until combined. Add vanilla and half of the dates; pulse until combined. Add remaining dates and coconut oil. Pulse until the mixture is well blended and sticks together when pressed between your fingers. Divide into 36 balls, about 1 teaspoon each (form the same number as the coconut balls). Flatten the chocolate balls so they can be molded around the coconut balls. Sprinkle coconut on a plate or in a bowl. Roll balls in coconut and place on a rimmed cookie sheet or shallow container in a single layer. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. After truffles have set, enjoy immediately or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator or freezer. They will keep longer in the freezer (up to a month), or 2 weeks in the refrigerator. Enjoy!
