Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans. Cover bottoms of pans with wax paper; set aside. Combine cake mix and cocoa powder in large bowl. Add the prepared coffee, bananas, eggs and water; beat with electric mixer on low speed 30 sec., stopping frequently to scrape bottom and side of bowl. Beat on medium speed 2 min.; pour evenly into prepared pans. Bake 30 to 35 min. or until toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean. Cool 10 min.; remove from pans to wire racks. Immediately remove wax paper. Cool cake layers completely. Dissolve 1 tsp. instant coffee in the warm milk. Beat cream cheese with electric mixer on medium speed until creamy. Add milk mixture; beat 2 min. Blend in melted chocolate. Add powdered sugar; beat until light and fluffy. Use to fill and frost cooled cake layers. Immediately press pecans into frosting on side of cake. Garnish with chocolate curls, if desired.
