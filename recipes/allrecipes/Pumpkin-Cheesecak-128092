For crust: Combine crumbs, marmalade and sugar. Press crumb mixture into bottom and up sides of pie plate. Bake at 350 degrees F until crust is set and lightly browned around edge, 8 to 10 minutes. Beat cheeses with an electric mixer until smooth. Gradually beat in egg substitute, granulated sugar and vanilla until smooth. Set aside 1 cup of cheese mixture. Beat pumpkin, brown sugar, and pumpkin pie spice into remaining cheese mixture. Pour half of the pumpkin mixture into crust. Top with reserved cheese mixture, then with remaining pumpkin mixture. Bake at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) until set, about 30 minutes. Cool on wire rack. Refrigerate until chilled. Garnish with the kumquats and mint.
