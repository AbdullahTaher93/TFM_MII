Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 to 25 minutes. Drain. Mash the potatoes with sour cream, milk, butter, jalapeno pepper, Monterey Jack cheese, and garlic powder in a bowl using a potato masher or fork until smooth and fully incorporated.
