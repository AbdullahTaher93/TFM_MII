Carve out center core of bread within two inches of bottom and sides, keeping bread intact. Cut reserved bread and other loaf into 1-inch cubes for dipping. Mix cream cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream and salmon together. Add dill weed, Tabasco, black pepper and 2 tablespoons of capers. Spoon into the center of the hollowed bread bowl. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of capers over the top of the dip mixture. Serve with extra bread for dipping, along with sliced red and green bell peppers and cherry tomatoes. For a lighter dish, consider using low-fat cream cheese, mayonnaise and sour cream.
