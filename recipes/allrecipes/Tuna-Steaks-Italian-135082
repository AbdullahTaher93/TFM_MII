Fire up your grill to medium-hot. Dump the tomatoes, beans, and oil into a big bowl. Stir in 1/2 each of the lemon juice, herbs, and garlic. Dump everything else into a big Ziploc bag. Seal the bag and refrigerate for 30 minutes, or all day if you want. (In which case you should wait to light your grill.) Then, take out the fish and grill for 3 or 4 minutes per side, brushing with marinade, until just brown on the outside and still pink in the center. Don't overcook it - that's just wasting good tuna steaks. To check for interior pinkness, separate the flesh with tongs or make a small cut with a knife. Serve with the bowl of the bean stuff.
