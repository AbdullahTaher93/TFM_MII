In a large zippered bag, stir together orange juice, sherry, vinegar, marmalade, and basil. Rinse chicken and pat dry. Add to marinade. Seal bag and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight, turning occasionally. Remove chicken from marinade and season with salt and pepper. Place on oiled grill over a solid bed of hot coals (you can hold your hand at grill level for only 3 to 4 seconds) or over medium-high heat on a gas grill. Close lid on gas grill. Grill for 5 to 8 minutes per side or until meat is no longer pink in center (cut to test).
