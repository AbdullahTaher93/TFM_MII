Cook penne pasta in boiling salted water until al dente. Place the onion, leek, and carrot in a saucepan with the olive oil and saute for a few minutes until the onions become translucent. Place the tomatoes, honey, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce and Chinese five spice into the saucepan and cook on medium heat for 5 minutes. Add the drained tuna fish and cook for a further 5 to 10 minutes. When you are ready to serve, season with salt, stir in a few spoonfuls of creme fraiche and pour the sauce over the cooked penne.
