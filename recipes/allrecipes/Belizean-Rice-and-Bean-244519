Place kidney beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain. Transfer beans to a stockpot and add enough water to cover; bring to a boil. Add garlic to beans, reduce heat to low, and simmer until beans are tender, about 1 hour. Mix onion, red bell pepper, vegetable oil, salt, and black pepper into beans. Cook and stir rice in a saucepan over low heat until toasted and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add coconut milk, water, and kidney beans; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender, 30 to 40 minutes.
