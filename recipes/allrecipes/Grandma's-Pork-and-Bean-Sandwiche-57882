Preheat the oven's broiler. Place bread slices on a broiling pan that has been lined with aluminum foil. Spoon about 1/2 cup of beans onto each piece of bread. Cover each pile of beans with a slice of cheese. Place three half-slices of bacon onto each sandwich so that they are not hanging over the edge. Broil for 5 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the bacon is cooked and cheese is melted. Watch them carefully! I suggest leaving the oven door cracked near the 5 minute mark to allow some of the oven heat to escape.
