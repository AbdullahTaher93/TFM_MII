Beat egg white, corn syrup, and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until mixture is thick and doubled in volume, about 5 minutes. Reduce mixer speed to low and beat in confectioners' sugar until thoroughly combined. Beat vanilla extract into marshmallow creme just until incorporated. Can be refrigerated in a covered container up to 2 weeks or frozen for 1 month.
