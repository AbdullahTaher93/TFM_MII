Melt butter in a pot over medium-high heat. Whisk flour into butter until mixture forms a smooth paste, about 1 minute. Whisk chicken broth, milk, and light cream into butter mixture; cook and stir until mixture comes to a boil and thickens, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, stir in cooked chicken. Return soup to a boil and cook until chicken is heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.
