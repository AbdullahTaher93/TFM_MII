In a blender or food processor, blend shrimp, onion, ginger, egg whites, salt and pepper until smooth. Cut each white bread slice into 4 triangles. Spread both sides of triangles with shrimp mixture and coat with bread crumbs. Cover and chill in the refrigerator approximately 1 hour. Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In small batches, fry bread triangles 3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Garnish with lemon juice before serving.
