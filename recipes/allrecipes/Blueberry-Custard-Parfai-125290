In a saucepan, combine eggs, milk, sugar and salt. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until custard is slightly thickened and coats the back of a spoon, about 18 minutes. Remove from the heat. Add vanilla, peels and nutmeg; mix well. Cool for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. In a small mixing bowl, whip the cream and confectioners' sugar until stiff. Fold two-thirds into the custard. Layer custard and blueberries in parfait glasses. Garnish with remaining cream. Chill for 1 hour.
