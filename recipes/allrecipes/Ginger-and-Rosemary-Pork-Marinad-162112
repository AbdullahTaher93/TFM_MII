To make the marinade, stir together the lime juice, rosemary, ginger, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and garlic in a bowl. To use the marinade, pour the marinade into a resealable plastic bag, and add up to 1 1/2 pounds of pork. Seal, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours, up to 24 hours.
