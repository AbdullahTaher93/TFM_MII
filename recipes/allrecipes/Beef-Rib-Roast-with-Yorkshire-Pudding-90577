Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine garlic, thyme and pepper; press onto beef roast. Place roast, fat side up, in shallow roasting pan. Insert ovenproof meat thermometer so tip is centered in thickest part of beef, not resting in fat or touching bone. Do not add water or cover. Roast for 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 hours for medium rare; 2-3/4 to 3 hours for medium doneness. Remove roast when meat thermometer registers 135 degrees F for medium rare; 150 degrees F for medium. Tent with foil. Let stand 20 minutes. (Temperature will continue to rise about 10 degrees F to reach 145 degrees F for medium rare; 160 degrees F for medium.) Carve roast. Season with salt. Serve with Yorkshire puddings. Yorkshire Pudding: Combine flour, chives, salt and thyme in bowl. In separate bowl, whisk milk and eggs; gradually add to flour mixture. Beat until smooth. (Refrigerate up to 1 hour, if desired.) After removing roast, heat oven to 450 degrees F. Spoon butter into 12 muffin cups; tip to coat bottoms. Fill halfway with batter. Bake in 450 degrees F oven 15 to 18 minutes or until puffed and golden. Serve immediately.
