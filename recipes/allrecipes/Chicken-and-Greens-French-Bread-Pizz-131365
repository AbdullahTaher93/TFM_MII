Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Preheat indoor or outdoor grill to high heat. Pound chicken flat with meat mallet, then rub with oil. Season with garlic salt and rub with rosemary. Sear chicken, then grill at low heat about 5 minutes per side, or until it's no longer pink inside. Cut baguette in half lengthwise. Place the halves on a medium nonstick baking sheet. Sprinkle on 1 oz Parmesan and bake 5 to 7 minutes or until bread is lightly crisped and cheese is melted. Slice chicken into bite-sized strips. Toss greens with chicken and dressing, then distribute evenly over bread. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan on top. Cut into 4 slices and serve immediately.
