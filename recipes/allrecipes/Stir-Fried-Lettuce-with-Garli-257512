Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat; add green onions and 1/2 of the garlic. Cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add romaine lettuce and oyster sauce; cook and quickly stir until lettuce turns bright green, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn heat to medium. Mix remaining garlic and salt into lettuce mixture and stir.
