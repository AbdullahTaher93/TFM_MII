Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add sweet potatoes, and cook, stirring, until starting to soften, 8 to 10 minutes. Add curry powder. Cook 1 minute. Add 1/2 cup water and onion. Cook, stirring, until water evaporates and potatoes are tender and browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. In the same skillet, cook spinach in two batches, adding second batch when first wilts, 2 minutes. Drain; add to potatoes. Stir in vinegar; season with salt and pepper.
