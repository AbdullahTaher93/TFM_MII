Put spinach in an 8-inch square microwavable dish and cook on high for 4 minutes or until wilted. Drain any liquid, remove spinach to a bowl, and mix with ricotta, half of mozzarella, half of Parmesan, egg white, 4 teaspoons of parsley, salt, and pepper. Wipe out baking dish and generously coat with cooking spray. Mix in onions, pepper, zucchini, and garlic. Mix until coated with spray, then cover tightly with microwave-safe plastic wrap and cook on high for 5 minutes or until vegetables are soft, stirring once. Uncover and scrape vegetables onto a plate. Spread a layer of tomato sauce over bottom of same dish. Add a layer of 2 noodles. Spread a third of cheese mixture over noodles, covering noodles completely. Spoon a third of vegetable mixture over cheese, then spoon on a quarter of sauce, making sure noodles are covered. Repeat layers of noodles, cheese, vegetables, and sauce to make a total of 4 layers of noodles. Top final layer with remaining sauce. Cover tightly with microwave-safe plastic wrap and cook on high for 10 minutes or until noodles are almost tender. Scatter remaining mozzarella and Parmesan over top and cook uncovered on high for 5 minutes or until cheese is melted. Sprinkle with remaining 2 teaspoons parsley. Let sit 5 minutes before cutting.
