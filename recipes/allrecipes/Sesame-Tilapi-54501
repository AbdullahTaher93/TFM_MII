Place the tilapia in a bowl, and drizzle with the sesame oil. Season with the garlic, Italian seasoning, kosher salt, and pepper. Cover, and marinate at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Transfer the tilapia and marinade to a baking dish, and bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until fish is easily flaked with a fork.
