Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a 13 inch X 9 inch baking pan with cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine the butter, maple syrup, cardamom, and salt. Pierce the squash in several places with a fork. Place in the microwave and cook for 4 minutes, or until softened. Peel and seed the squash and cut into 1-inch chunks. Add to the bowl with the butter mixture and toss to coat well. Place the squash mixture in the prepared baking pan. Bake, tossing occasionally, for 45 minutes, or until browned and tender.
