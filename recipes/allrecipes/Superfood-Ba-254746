Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with parchment paper. Combine buckwheat, hemp seed hearts, almonds, coconut flakes, chia seeds, and cacao nibs in a large bowl. Mix 1 1/2 cup almond butter, sugar, honey, and salt together in a large saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Pour in buckwheat mixture; stir until completely coated. Press mixture into the prepared pan. Place chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon almond butter in a small saucepan over low heat; stir until melted, about 5 minutes. Spread melted chocolate over the mixture in the pan with a spatula. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Cut into bars.
