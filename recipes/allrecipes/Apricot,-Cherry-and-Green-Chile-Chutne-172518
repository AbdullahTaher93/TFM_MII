In a 3- to 4-quart pan over high heat, combine apricots, vinegar, sugar, green chiles, cherries, red onion, cinnamon stick, mustard seed, and salt. Bring to a boil. Turn heat to low. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until apricots are soft when pierced, 20 to 25 minutes. Uncover and simmer until most of the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes longer. Let cool, discard cinnamon stick, and serve chutney, or cover and chill.
