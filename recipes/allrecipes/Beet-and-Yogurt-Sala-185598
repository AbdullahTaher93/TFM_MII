Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat, and add mustard seeds. When the mustard seeds begin to pop, add the cumin seeds. Stir for about 10 seconds, and remove from heat. In a large bowl, gently stir yogurt with beets. Stir in mustard and cumin seeds, and season with salt to taste. Garnish with chopped cilantro.
