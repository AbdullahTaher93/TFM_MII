Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Add the vermicelli to a saucepan of boiling water. Let stand off the heat for 10 minutes, until softened. Meanwhile, in a small skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil. Add the jalapeno, garlic and 2 tablespoons of the ginger and cook over moderately low heat until fragrant, about 4 minutes. Add the shallot and cook, stirring, until softened, 5 minutes. Stir in the curry powder and remove from the heat. Add the fish sauce and lime juice, scraping up any bits stuck to the pan. Drain the vermicelli and shake dry. Cut into 4-inch lengths and transfer to a medium bowl. Add the curry sauce, red bell pepper and chopped cilantro and toss well. In a small saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of ginger and the onion and cook over moderate heat until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the tomatoes, crushed red pepper, sugar and vinegar and cook over moderate heat, mashing and stirring occasionally, until thick and jamlike, about 10 minutes. Season the jam with salt and pepper. In an ovenproof skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil. Season the salmon with salt and pepper; add to the skillet, skin side down. Cook over high heat for 3 minutes. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast until nearly cooked through, 10 minutes. Spoon the vermicelli onto plates, top with the salmon and tomato jam. Garnish with cilantro and serve with lime wedges.
