Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place linguini pasta in the pot, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain. In a bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, olive oil, sugar, vinegar, and sesame seeds. In a large bowl, toss the cooked pasta with the soy sauce dressing, greens, imitation crabmeat, cilantro, and avocado. Chill until serving.
