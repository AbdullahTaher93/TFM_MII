Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spread pizza dough onto a pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until just baked enough to hold together, about 8 minutes. Mix chicken, pumpkin, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Coat pizza crust with olive oil and add chicken mixture in 1 even layer. Top pizza with mozzarella cheese. Bake in the oven until crust is browned and cheese is melted, 9 to 11 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes before slicing.
