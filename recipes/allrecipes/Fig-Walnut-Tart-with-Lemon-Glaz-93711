To prepare the tart: Coat a 10-inch springform pan with oil. Prepare the dough. Cut off one-third of the dough. Pat into a disk; refrigerate for 10 minutes. Pat the remaining dough over the bottom and 1 inch up the sides of the pan. Prick all over with a fork. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Roll the reserved refrigerated dough between 2 sheets of floured waxed paper into a 10-inch circle. Slide the waxed paper onto a baking sheet; refrigerate the dough for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a food processor, grind the nuts finely. Add the figs, raisins, and orange zest. Process until the mixture sticks together like paste. Place the honey in a mixing bowl. Add the bourbon or brandy and cinnamon. Whisk to combine. Add the fig mixture and mix slowly to combine. Spoon into the dough-lined pan, spreading evenly. Remove the dough circle from the refrigerator. Carefully remove the top sheet of waxed paper. Turn the dough circle over on top of the filling. Carefully remove the waxed paper. With a fork, tuck the edges of the top crust inside the edges of the bottom crust. Press the edges to seal. Bake for about 35 minutes, or until the crust is golden. Remove to a rack to cool. To prepare the glaze: In a bowl, combine the confectioners' sugar and 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon lemon juice. Stir to make a glaze. Add up to 2 more teaspoons of juice if needed, until the glaze drips off the spoon when lifted. Pour over the tart. Spread with the back of the spoon. Allow to set.
