In a mixing bowl, beat eggs, sugar and oil; add carrots, pineapple and vanilla. Combine dry ingredients; beat into carrot mixture. Pour into two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 325 degrees F for 60-70 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool in pans for 10 minutes; remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
