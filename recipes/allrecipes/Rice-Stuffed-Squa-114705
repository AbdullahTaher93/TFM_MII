In a skillet, saute celery and onion in butter until tender. Add rice, mushrooms, raisins, 3 tablespoons orange juice concentrate, parsley, 3/4 teaspoon salt and marjoram. Sprinkle cavities of squab lightly with remaining salt; stuff with rice mixture. Place on a rack in a roasting pan. Combine oil and remaining orange juice concentrate; brush over squab. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 1 hour or until meat juices run clear and a meat thermometer inserted into the stuffing reads 165 degrees F, basting frequently.
