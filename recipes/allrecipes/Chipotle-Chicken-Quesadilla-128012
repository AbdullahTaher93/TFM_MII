Place 1 tablespoon oil in a large, heavy skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat. Add onion and serrano chile; cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and stir-fry 1 minute. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper. Transfer to a medium bowl and wipe skillet clean with a paper towel. Chop chipotle chile; place in a small bowl with adobo sauce and mash with fork. Add to onion mixture in bowl; add chicken and toss. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Place a tortilla on a cutting board and spread with 1 cup chicken mixture. Top with 1/2 cup cheese and another tortilla. Repeat with remaining ingredients. With paper towel, lightly oil skillet and place over medium-high heat until it is very hot but not smoking. Cook quesadillas one at a time, turning over once, until cheese is melted, 4 to 5 minutes total. Transfer with a spatula to a cutting board; cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Repeat with remaining quesadillas, adding more oil if necessary. Cut into quarters and serve with accompaniments.
