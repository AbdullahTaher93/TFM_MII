Cook and stir bacon in a soup pot over medium heat until bacon is browned and crisp, about 8 minutes. Stir onion into bacon and cook, stirring often, until onion is translucent, about 5 more minutes. Pour water into bacon mixture and stir in potatoes. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Place cod fillets into simmering mixture and cook until fish is opaque and flakes easily, about 10 minutes. Stir milk, evaporated milk, butter, salt, and black pepper into pot. Bring soup to a boil; remove from heat and serve.
