Bring one inch of water to a boil in a large pot. Add mussels, cover, and steam for 3 to 5 minutes, until they are all open. Drain. Remove one side of each shell, and arrange the open shelled mussels on a serving platter. Discard any mussels that do not open. In a medium bowl, mix together the red, yellow, and green bell peppers, olive oil, wine vinegar, parsley, egg, salt, and pepper. Spoon over the mussels on the shells. Refrigerate until serving.
