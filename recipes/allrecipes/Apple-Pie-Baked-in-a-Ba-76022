Place the flour, sugar, salt, and butter together in a food processor; pulse until dough crumbles into pea-sized pieces. Add water, and briefly pulse again, keeping the dough crumbly. Transfer dough onto 2 pieces of parchment paper or foil, and form into 2 discs. Wrap in plastic, and refrigerate overnight. Roll dough out onto a lightly floured work surface to a thickness of 1/8 inch, or until dough is at least 2 inches larger than the pie plate. Lay dough inside pie plate with edges overhanging. Roll the second portion of dough in the same manner, and store on a sheet pan in the refrigerator until ready to use. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place the apple slices, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, vanilla, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg together in a medium bowl; toss to coat. Pour into the pie shell, and dot with butter. Lightly brush the overhanging edges of the dough with water, and carefully cover with the top crust. Pinch the edges together, turning under, all to create a thick edge. Press the rim with the back of a fork for decoration, or simply pinch it to seal. To vent, make small slits in top crust with a sharp knife or scissors. Slide the pie into the brown paper bag, fold the top down, and staple shut. Place pie on a sheet pan on the center rack of the preheated oven, and bake for 1 hour. Remove from the oven, and carefully cut a large circle in the top of the bag. Continue baking until crust is golden brown, about 15 minutes more. Allow pie to cool for at least 30 minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature.
