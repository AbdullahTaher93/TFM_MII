Combine 3 quarts of water, onion, garlic, seafood seasoning, and salt in a large pot. Squeeze lemon juice from halves, and add both the juice and the lemon halves into the pot. Bring to a boil. Place potatoes and sausage in the pot, and return to a boil. Simmer, partially covered, until potatoes are just tender, about 10 minutes. Add the corn; cook until tender, about 10 minutes longer. Remove pot from heat, and stir in the shrimp; let stand, covered, until shrimp are pink, about 5 minutes. Drain off liquid before serving. It may be reserved for other uses, such as soup stock.
