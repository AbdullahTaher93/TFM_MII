Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Roll dough out to a 14x10 inch rectangle. Spread with 1/4 of pasta sauce, leaving a 1-inch border. Layer with Provolone and pepperoni. Sprinkle with Mozzarella. Starting at longest end, roll up jelly-roll style. Fold in ends and pinch to seal. On baking pan, arrange roll in an s-shape, seam-side down. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top. Bake 20 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand 10 minutes and slice. Serve with extra pasta sauce, heated.
