Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a small baking dish. Blend together the cream cheese and butter in a mixing bowl. Gently fold in the corn, chives, and onion salt, and turn the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until heated through and bubbly, about 40 minutes. Stir the casserole after the first 20 minutes.
