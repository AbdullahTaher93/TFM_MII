Place cookies in blender. Blend on High setting, stopping blender to stir occasionally, until cookies become fine crumbs. Reserve. In clean blender, combine strawberries, sugar, and water. Blend on High setting until smooth. Combine pudding mix and milk in a large bowl. Beat with whisk until thick, about 2 minutes. Stir in cookie crumbs. Fill ice pop molds 1/3 full of pudding mixture. Layer with strawberry puree to 2/3 full; top evenly with remaining pudding mixture. Place sticks into molds, and freeze overnight. Run molds under hot water if difficult to remove pops.
