Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Bring pie crust to room temperature. Mix salsa, soup, sour cream, cheese, corn, chicken and beans in large bowl. Spoon into ungreased 13x9x2-inch baking pan. Place crusts on floured surface, overlapping about 3 inches in the center. Press seam to seal. Roll into 14x10-inch rectangle. Trim excess crust. Place crust over chicken mixture and flute edges. Cut slits in pastry. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until pie crust is golden brown.
