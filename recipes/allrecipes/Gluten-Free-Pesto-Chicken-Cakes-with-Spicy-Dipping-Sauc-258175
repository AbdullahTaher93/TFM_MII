Mix 1/3 cup mayonnaise, sour cream, 1 tablespoon pesto, hot sauce, salt, and pepper in a bowl to make dipping sauce. Place in the refrigerator. Combine 1/4 cup mayonnaise, egg, 2 tablespoons pesto, and garlic in a large bowl. Stir in bread crumbs and red onion. Mix in chicken until thoroughly combined. Form mixture into balls; press into 1/2-inch cakes. Heat oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add chicken cakes to the oil in a single layer; cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter lined with paper towels. Repeat with remaining chicken cakes. Serve chicken cakes with dipping sauce.
