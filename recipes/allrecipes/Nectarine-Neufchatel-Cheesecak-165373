Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Beat cream cheese, yogurt, sugar and extracts with an electric mixer until smooth. Add egg whites and eggs, beat just until smooth. Pour into crust and bake for 35 minutes or until center is nearly set. Cool on rack, then refrigerate for 3 hours or until well chilled. Whisk together honey and lemon juice in a medium bowl. Add nectarines and mint and toss gently. Just before serving, top each slice with nectarine mixture. Sprinkle with almonds, if desired.
