To Marinate: Place chicken in a nonporous glass dish or bowl. Pour wine all over and toss to coat. Cover dish or bowl and refrigerate to marinate for at least 2 to 3 hours. Remove chicken breasts from wine (discard any remaining wine) and season with basil, paprika, garlic salt, salt and pepper. Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Add chicken and saute on each side until a nice brown/red color is reached and the inside is no longer pink (20 to 30 minutes).
