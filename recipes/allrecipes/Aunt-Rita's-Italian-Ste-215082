Cook the sausage with onion and garlic in a large, deep skillet or pot over medium heat, until the meat is browned, 10 to 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Mix in the summer squash, zucchini, carrots, mushrooms, and stewed tomatoes, reduce heat to medium-low, and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, and serve.
