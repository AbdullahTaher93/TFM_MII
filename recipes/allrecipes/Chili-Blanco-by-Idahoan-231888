Heat chicken broth to a low boil. Remove product from packages of Idahoan Scalloped Homestyle Casseroles and place in a gallon-sized storage bag. Use a rolling pin to crunch up the pieces. Add potato pieces and scalloped cheese blend to chicken broth and cook until tender. Reduce to a simmer and add chicken, diced green chilies and beans. Simmer for 30 minutes. Add cheese just before serving or place in the bottom of soup bowl and ladle chili over the top. Add garnishes such as fresh chopped cilantro, lime wedge, or chopped scallions if desired.
