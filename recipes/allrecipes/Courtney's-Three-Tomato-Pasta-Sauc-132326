Cook mild and hot Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until crumbly and no longer pink. Drain excess grease and set aside. Heat olive oil in the same pan over medium heat; stir in onion and garlic, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent. Stir in diced and sun-dried tomatoes, and the crumbled sausage; season with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning to taste. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes until sun-dried tomatoes have softened. Before serving, stir in cream and garnish with cherry tomatoes.
