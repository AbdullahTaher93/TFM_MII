Heat the oven to 450 degrees F. Coat the pork with the 1 tablespoon of mustard and the 11/2 teaspoons of oil. Sprinkle it with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the black pepper. Put the pork on a baking sheet and roast until just done, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer the pork to a carving board and leave to rest in a warm spot for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, put the onion in a small bowl of cold water and let stand for 10 minutes. Drain the onion, rinse, and then pat dry with paper towels. In a large glass or stainless-steel bowl, whisk together the lime juice, the 1 teaspoon mustard, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon each salt and black pepper. Add the 1/4 cup oil slowly, whisking. While the pork is still warm, cut it into bite-size pieces. Add the pork, onion, red-pepper flakes, and cilantro to the vinaigrette and toss.
