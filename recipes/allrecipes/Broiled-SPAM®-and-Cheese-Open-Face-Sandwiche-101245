Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Place the three slices of bread onto a baking sheet. Stir together the luncheon meat and Cheddar cheese in a bowl. Press the meat and cheese mixture on top of each slice of bread. Broil in the preheated oven until the sandwiches are hot and the topping is beginning to brown on top, 3 to 5 minutes.
