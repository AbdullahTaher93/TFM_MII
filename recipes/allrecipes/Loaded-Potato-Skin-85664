Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Pierce potatoes with a knife and bake 45 minutes, or until tender. Cool. Cut potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop potato out, leaving a 1/4" of potato on the skin. Halve potatoes again then brush the inside of the potatoes with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Place under broiler for about 5 minutes or until light brown. Fill skins with cheese, scallions and bacon. Broil until cheese melts and serve with sour cream.
