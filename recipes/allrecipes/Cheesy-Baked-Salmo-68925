Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place the salmon on a large piece of foil, and season with garlic, dill, salt, and pepper. Seal foil around the salmon. Place on a baking sheet. Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven. Top with Cheddar cheese and green onions, and continue baking 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted and fish is easily flaked with a fork.
