Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the pork chops in the preheated skillet until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Arrange seared chops into a casserole dish. Whisk maple syrup, water, onion, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, salt, and pepper together in a bowl to dissolve the chili powder; pour over the pork chops. Bake in preheated oven until the chops are no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes.
