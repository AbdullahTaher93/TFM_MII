Place chocolate chips, raspberry chips and butter in large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave at HIGH (100%) 1 minute; stir. If necessary, microwave at HIGH an additional 15 seconds at a time, stirring after each heating, until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth when stirred. Stir in jam, liqueur and 4 tablespoons whipping cream. If necessary, add additional whipping cream, one half teaspoon at a time, until mixture is well blended and smooth. Cover; refrigerate several hours or overnight until chocolate mixture is firm enough to handle. Roll mixture into 1-inch balls; while still tacky roll in your choice of coating. Place coated truffle on cookie sheet to set. Refrigerate several hours or until completely cold; transfer to airtight container. Store in cool, dry place. Candy flavor is best after storing for about 1 week. Truffles also freeze well.
