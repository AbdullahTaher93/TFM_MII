In a large bowl, whisk the eggs with the heavy cream until blended. Add the tarragon, chervil and 1/3 cup of chives and season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Let the batter rest for 15 minutes. Lightly brush an 8-inch nonstick skillet with olive oil and set it over moderate heat. When the pan is hot, add 3 tablespoons of the crepe batter, swirling to coat the bottom, and cook until golden around the edges, about 30 seconds. Carefully turn the crepe and continue cooking just until set, about 15 seconds longer. Transfer to a large plate lined with wax paper. Continue making crepes with the remaining batter, brushing the pan with more olive oil as necessary and layering the crepes with waxed paper. Arrange the crepes on a work surface. Spread lightly with the creme fraiche and top with slices of the smoked salmon. Fold each crepe in half, then in half again to form triangles. Transfer the stuffed crepes to plates, sprinkle the crepes with chives and serve.
