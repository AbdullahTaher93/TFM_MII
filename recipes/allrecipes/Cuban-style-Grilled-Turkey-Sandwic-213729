Combine relish, orange juice, and sugar together in a small bowl. Spray large nonstick pan or grill pan with cooking spray; heat over medium-high heat. Add bread slices to pan. Layer with cheese, turkey, and spinach, dividing ingredients equally between two bread slices. Spread relish mixture on remaining bread slices. Cook over medium-high heat until cheese begins to melt. Assemble into two sandwiches. Cook one additional minute until toasted. Serve immediately.
