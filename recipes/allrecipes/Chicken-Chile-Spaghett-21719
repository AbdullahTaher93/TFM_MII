Skin and bone chicken; set meat aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). (For slow cooker instructions, see Cook's Note.) Bring chicken broth to a boil. Stir in pasta and cook 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente. Remove pasta from pot and set aside. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter.
