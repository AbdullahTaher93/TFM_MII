For Kringle, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place all pecans on a sheet pan and toast for 8 minutes. Cool, chop and set aside. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Line a baking pan with parchment paper. Unfold puff pastry in center of prepared pan. Evenly spread 1/2 of Marzetti Old Fashioned Caramel Dip onto center section of dough. Sprinkle with 1/3 cup pecans. Fold one-third section of dough over to cover caramel and pecans. Spread that dough layer with remaining Marzetti Old Fashioned Caramel Dip and 1/3 cup pecans. Fold remaining section of dough over all, trying to completely cover caramel and pecans. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until pastry is golden brown. For icing: Whisk together all ingredients, adding additional cream if necessary. Cool Kringle slightly and drizzle icing over top. Sprinkle with remaining pecans. Cool completely. Slice and serve.
