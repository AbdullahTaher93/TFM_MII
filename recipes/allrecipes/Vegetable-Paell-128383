Warm the oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic. Cook, stirring, for 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the rice, squash, and bell pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the pepper starts to soften. Add the tomatoes (with juice), broth, water, bay leaf, and salt. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the rice is tender. Add the beans and peas. Cook, stirring gently, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until heated through. Remove and discard the bay leaf.
