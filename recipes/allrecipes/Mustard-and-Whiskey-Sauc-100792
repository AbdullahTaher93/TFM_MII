Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallot; cook and stir until tender, about 2 minutes. Stir in the whiskey, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Simmer until the mixture has reduced by half. Stir in the chicken stock and simmer until reduced by half again. Mix in mustard and remove from the heat.
