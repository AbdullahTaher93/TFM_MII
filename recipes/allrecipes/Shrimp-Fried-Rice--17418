In a medium saucepan bring water to a boil. Add the white rice. Return to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until rice is tender. In a small skillet scramble the eggs in a small amount of sesame oil. Remove from heat once scrambled. In a large skillet, brown onion and celery in remaining sesame oil. Add shrimp and carrots, onion, celery, red pepper, pea pods, and green pepper. Add white rice and stir well. Add soy sauce (if desired) and eggs, stir thoroughly until heated through.
