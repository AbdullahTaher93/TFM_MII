Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Cut stem off pumpkin. With a sharp, heavy knife, carefully cut pumpkin in half vertically. With a metal spoon, scrape out seeds and strings. Cut half the pumpkin into 4 wedges. Rub all 5 pieces (including the half) with 2 tablespoons oil and place in a large rimmed baking pan. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Roast pumpkin until tender when pierced, 25 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large, deep frying pan over medium-high heat, frequently stir prosciutto in remaining tablespoon oil until golden brown and crisp, about 3 minutes. Add sage and cook until leaves turn bright green and are crisp, about 1 minute more. With a slotted spoon, lift prosciutto and sage onto paper towels. Add onion to pan and stir often until tender, about 3 minutes. Add rice and stir often until it begins to turn opaque, 1 to 2 minutes. Add wine; stir often until mostly absorbed. Add 3 cups broth and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes over medium heat. When pumpkin is tender, peel the half-pumpkin piece, then cut flesh into 1/2-inch cubes. Keep wedges warm. When rice has cooked for 20 minutes, add remaining broth, cheese, and pumpkin cubes. Stir gently until cheese melts, pumpkin is hot, and most of broth is absorbed, about 3 minutes. On plates, spoon risotto next to pumpkin wedges and top with prosciutto and sage.
