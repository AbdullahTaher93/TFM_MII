Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in ground pork, mushrooms, onion, garlic, basil, parsley, and paprika. Cook and stir until pork is cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir stewed tomatoes, cream of celery soup, and bay leaf into the pork mixture. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 12 to 14 minutes. Stir cooked bow-tie pasta into tomato sauce, top with Parmesan cheese, and serve.
