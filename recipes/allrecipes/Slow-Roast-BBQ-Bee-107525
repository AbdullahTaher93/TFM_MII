Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Sprinkle roast with garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper. Place roast in a large pot and pour barbeque sauce over meat. Cover and slow-cook until roast is tender enough to shred, about 6 hours. Remove from oven. When cool enough to handle, shred the meat and serve with sauce.
