In a small bowl, mix together mayonnaise, parmesan, tomatoes, basil, and 2/3 of minced garlic. In another small bowl, mix remaining garlic with butter. Sprinkle chicken to taste with salt and pepper. Working quickly, lay one sheet of phyllo on a flat surface, with the long side parallel to you. With a pastry brush, lightly brush it with garlic butter. Top with a second phyllo sheet. Lay 1 chicken breast half diagonally across the upper left corner of phyllo stack. Spread top of chicken with one-sixth of the mayonnaise mixture. Starting with that corner, gently fold over phyllo with chicken one or two times to enclose. Fold ends in toward center, then continue rolling to enclose chicken like a burrito. Place phyllo-wrapped chicken, seam side down, on a lightly oiled, rimmed 12- by 17-inch baking pan. Repeat to use all the mayonnaise mixture, chicken, and phyllo, and all but 2 tablespoons of the garlic butter. Brush phyllo packets with remaining garlic butter. Bake, uncovered, in a 400 degrees F oven until packets are golden brown and chicken is no longer pink in center (cut one packet to test), 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to plates and serve.
