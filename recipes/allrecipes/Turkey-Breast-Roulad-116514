In a bowl, combine the artichokes, mushrooms and onion; set aside. With skin side down, cut a lengthwise slit through the thickest portion of each turkey breast to within 1/2 in. of bottom. Open the turkey breasts so they lie flat; cover with plastic wrap. Flatten to 3/4- to 1-in. thickness; remove plastic. Place ham slices over turkey to within 1 in. of edges. Spoon vegetable mixture lengthwise down center of the ham. Roll each turkey breast, starting from a side where the fold is in the center. Secure with kitchen string at 3-in. intervals. Place the turkey rolls seam side down in one greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan and one 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. In a small bowl, combine the butter and thyme; spoon over the turkey rolls. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1-1/4 to 1-3/4 hours or until meat thermometer reads 170 degrees F, basting frequently. Cover and let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
