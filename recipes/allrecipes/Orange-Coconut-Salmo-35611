Place salmon fillets in a medium bowl with orange juice. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator 8 hours, or overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat salmon fillets with egg. Dip fillets in coconut, and arrange in a single layer on a medium baking sheet. Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until coconut is golden brown and fish is easily flaked with a fork. In a small saucepan over medium heat, blend orange marmalade and Dijon mustard. Heat until warm, and serve as a dipping sauce for the salmon.
