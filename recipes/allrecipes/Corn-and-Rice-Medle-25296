Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the rice, add the water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 16 to 18 minutes, or until water is absorbed and rice is tender. Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in corn, shallots, sugar, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 to 6 minutes, or until tender. In a serving bowl combine cooked rice, corn mixture and mint.
