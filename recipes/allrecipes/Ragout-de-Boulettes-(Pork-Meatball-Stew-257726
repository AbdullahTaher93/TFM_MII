Place flour in a saucepan or small skillet. Heat over medium-high heat, whisking constantly until light brown, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix pork, onion, cloves, ground cinnamon, mustard powder, salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl; shape in small meatballs. Sprinkle the meatballs with about half of the toasted flour. Melt butter in a saucepan; add meatballs and cook until browned. Stir in water; cover and let simmer for 1 hour.
