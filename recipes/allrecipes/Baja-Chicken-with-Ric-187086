Rub the chicken breast with McCormick Poultry Seasoning. Heat the Star Olive Oil in a saute pan. Add the chicken breast and sear on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Add the peppers and saute for 2 minutes. Add the Albertsons Long Grain Rice, Lawry's Baja Chipotle Marinate, Mezzetta Jalapeno Stuffed Olives and 2 cups of water. Bring to a simmer. Cover and let simmer until rice is tender, about 18-20 minutes. Stir in the fresh cilantro and season with salt and pepper.
