Combine raisins, 1/2 cup water, brown sugar and orange peel in small saucepan. Bring to a boil. Cook over low heat 11 to 13 minutes or until raisins are plump and tender and liquid is absorbed. Stir frequently to prevent burning. Cool 30 minutes. Meanwhile freeze cookie dough 30 minutes. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut dough in half; return one half to freezer. Cut remaining half of dough into 16 (1/4-inch) slices. Place 8 slices on large cookie sheet 3 inches apart. With floured hands, pat dough to 2 1/2 inch rounds. In the center of each round, place 1/2 teaspoon chocolate chips and a rounded teaspoon of raisin mixture. On floured surface, pat remaining dough slices into 2 1/2 inch rounds. Place over filling. Press around all edges with floured fork to seal. Bake at 350 degrees F for 13 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool 1 minute. Remove from cookie sheet. Cool. Repeat with remaining half of ingredients while first pan of cookies is baking. Bake as directed.
