Line 8-inch-square baking pan with foil. Coarsely chop 1/4 cup DelightFulls morsels; set aside. Combine dark chocolate morsels and sweetened condensed milk in medium, heavy-duty saucepan. Warm over lowest possible heat, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat; stir in vanilla extract. Gently stir in remaining 1/2 cup DelightFulls morsels just until morsels are covered. Spread mixture evenly into prepared baking pan. Sprinkle with coarsely chopped DelightFulls morsels. Press gently into fudge. Refrigerate for 2 hours or until firm. Lift from pan; remove foil.
