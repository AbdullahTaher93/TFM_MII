In a bowl, combine the egg, sugar and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; stir onto egg mixture just until moistened. Fold in apples and walnuts. Transfer to a greased 9-in. pie plate. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
