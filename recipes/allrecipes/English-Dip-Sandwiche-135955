Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spread split sides of English muffins with margarine and sprinkle lightly with garlic powder. Broil for 1 minute. Divide roast beef evenly among bottom halves of muffins. Place muffin tops on roast beef and wrap each tightly in foil. Bake for 10-12 minutes until heated through. For each sandwich, put 1/3-cup gravy in a small bowl. Serve immediately.
