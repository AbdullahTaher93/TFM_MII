Adjust oven rack to lower position and heat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place pizza crust on a foil-lined baking sheet that has been sprayed with vegetable cooking spray. In a mixing bowl, whisk eggs with 1 cup of cheese, salt and pepper; pour egg mixture over pizza, leaving a 1-inch border. Scatter ham and onions over egg mixture; arrange tomato slices over the pizza. Sprinkle tomatoes with oregano, basil and remaining cheese. Bake until cheese is melted and bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Turn on broiler and cook until cheese begins to brown, about 2 minutes. Cool 2 minutes, then cut into wedges and serve.
