Combine beef and pork in a large skillet over medium-high heat; season with 1 pinch Mexican-style seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Cook and stir until meat is evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, jalapeno pepper, and garlic until onion is softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir beef-pork mixture into onion mixture; add diced tomatoes with juice, beer, tomato sauce, roasted red peppers, water, tomato paste, chili powder, 1 tablespoon Mexican-style seasoning, cumin, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper, cayenne pepper, and bay leaves. Bring tomato-meat mixture to a boil, add chili beans, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, at least 2 hours.
