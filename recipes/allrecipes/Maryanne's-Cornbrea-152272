Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking pan. In a large mixing bowl, combine baking mix, sugar, baking powder and cornmeal. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk and melted butter until creamy. Stir in flour mixture until blended. Fold in frozen corn if using. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean. Serve warm.
