Melt shortening in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Dip pork chops in beaten egg, then dredge in flour. Cook in hot skillet, turning once to brown both sides. Place pork chops into a slow cooker, and arrange sliced onions over meat. Pour soup and milk over the meat and onions. Cover, and cook on High for 4 to 5 hours, or on Low for 8 to 10 hours.
