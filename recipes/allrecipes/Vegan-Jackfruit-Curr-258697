Heat coconut oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Cook and stir jackfruit until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add onion and garlic; cook over medium heat until softened, about 6 minutes. Stir ginger and curry powder into jackfruit; mix until flavors combine, about 2 minutes. Add vegetable broth, baby corn, and potatoes; cook until potatoes soften, 7 to 10 minutes. Pour coconut milk into jackfruit curry and cook until fully heated, about 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
