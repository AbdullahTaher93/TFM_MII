Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Place snapper on a large plate; squeeze juice of 1 lemon onto each side and inside cavity. Set snapper aside to marinate, about 10 minutes. Combine soy sauce, butter, and ginger in a small bowl. Mix remaining lemon juice, tomatoes, chives, chile pepper, sugar, and salt together in a separate bowl. Heat a large skillet to smoking hot over medium-high heat. Cook snapper until just beginning to brown, about 1 minute per side. Place snapper on preheated grill; brush with soy mixture on each side. Grill, basting occasionally with soy mixture, until snapper flakes easily with a fork, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer snapper to serving platter. Pour tomato mixture over snapper to serve.
