Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Drizzle olive oil over hamburger bun cubs in a large bowl; toss to coat. Spread cubes onto a baking sheet. Sprinkle garlic powder, oregano, thyme, basil, salt, and black pepper over the cubes. Bake in preheated oven until brown and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool completely before storing in airtight container.
