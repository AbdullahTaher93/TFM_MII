Slice chicken into thin strips. In a small bowl mix together the dressing, lime juice and honey. Place chicken strips in a 9x13 inch baking dish and pour mixture over chicken, covering all. Cover dish and refrigerate to marinate for 1 hour. Remove chicken from marinade, discarding any remaining marinade. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and saute chicken strips until lightly browned and cooked through (juices run clear), 12 to 15 minutes.
