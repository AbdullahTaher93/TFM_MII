Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl combine the chicken, mixed vegetables, soup, milk, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Mix all together. Pour a layer of the mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Add a layer of Swiss cheese. Repeat layers and bake in the preheated oven for 1/2 hour or until heated through and cheese is melted and bubbly.
