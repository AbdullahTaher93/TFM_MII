In a Dutch oven, brown roast in oil. Add broth. Spread horseradish over roast; sprinkle with onion, salt and pepper. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 2 hours or until tender, basting frequently. Remove roast from the pan; let stand for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, measure the pan juices; add water to equal 2 cups. Return to pan. Combine flour and cold water until smooth; stir into pan juices. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Add additional water if a thinner gravy is desired. Slice roast; serve with gravy.
