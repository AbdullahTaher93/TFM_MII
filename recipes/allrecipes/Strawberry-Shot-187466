Hollow out the core of each strawberry with a melon baller, leaving room for about 2 teaspoons of liqueur. Place each strawberry into a small liqueur glass, wine glass, or shot glass, and spoon the amaretto into the cavity of each berry. Place the glasses on a serving tray, and top each berry with a garnish of whipped cream.
