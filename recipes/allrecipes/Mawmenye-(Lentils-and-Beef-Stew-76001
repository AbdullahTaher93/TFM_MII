Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Season the beef with salt and pepper, then cook in the pot until browned on the outside. Pour in the chicken broth, and simmer over medium heat for about 45 minutes, until the beef is tender. Remove the beef from the liquid, and set aside. Pour the beef broth into the pot, and add the lentils. Bring to a boil, then simmer over low heat for 15 minutes. Season the turnips with cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and basil, and add them to the pot. Return the beef to the pot, and stir in the raisins and figs. Simmer for 10 minutes to blend the flavors before serving.
