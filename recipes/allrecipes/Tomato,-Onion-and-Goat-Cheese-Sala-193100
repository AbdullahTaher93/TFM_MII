Wash and dry butterleaf lettuce. Save six large leaves for 'cups' and tear the remainder into bite-size pieces. In a large salad bowl, combine the torn lettuce, radicchio, tomatoes, onion, and goat cheese. Add the dressing, beginning with 1/3 cup and using up to 1/2 cup if you like, and toss. To serve, place a lettuce cup on each salad plate, then fill with tossed salad. Garnish with cut tomatoes and goat cheese.
