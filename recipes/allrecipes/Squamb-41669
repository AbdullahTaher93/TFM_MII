Bring 3 cups of water to a boil in a large saucepan. Stir in 2 cups of rice. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 45 minutes or until rice is tender. Heat oil in another large saucepan over medium-high heat. Fry the onion and garlic until onions are translucent. Stir in the carrots, red and green peppers, and basil; cook for about 5 more minutes. Add the tomato, beef stock and allspice. Mix together the cornstarch and 1/4 cup water; pour into the saucepan. Season with salt to taste. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes. Serve the stew over rice, and sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the top.
