Place ribs in a large pot with enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a baking dish. In a bowl, mix the applesauce, syrup, lemon juice, ketchup, paprika, cinnamon, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Place ribs in the prepared baking dish, and brush with 1/2 the sauce. Bake uncovered, basting frequently with remaining sauce, for 1 1/2 hours, until done.
