Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Stir together the semolina flour, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning in a small bowl; set aside. Whisk together the egg, olive oil, and salt in a larger bowl until smooth. Slowly whisk in the semolina until a soft dough has formed. Drop the dumpling dough by the teaspoonful into the boiling water. Boil until the dumplings float to the surface and have grown in size, about 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and serve immediately.
