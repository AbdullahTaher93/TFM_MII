In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the milk, shortening, sugar, egg, salt and 3 cups flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down; turn onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into an 18-in. x 12-in. rectangle. Combine filling ingredients; sprinkle over dough to within 1/2 in. of edges. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long side. Cut into 12 slices. Combine the topping ingredients; pour into two greased 8-in. square baking dishes. Place rolls over topping. Cover and let rise for 45 minutes or until nearly doubled. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 5 minutes before inverting onto serving platters.
