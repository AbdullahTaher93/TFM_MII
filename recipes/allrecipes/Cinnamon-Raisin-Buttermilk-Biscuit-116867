In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and cinnamon; cut in shortening until crumbly. Stir in buttermilk just until moistened. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Sprinkle raisins over dough; knead 2 or 3 times. Pat to 3/4-in. thickness. Cut with a floured 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. Combine glaze ingredients; drizzle over biscuits. Serve warm.
