Place sweet potatoes in a large saucepan with water to cover them. Bring the water to a boil, reduce heat, cover and let simmer 25 to 30 minutes until tender. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Use non-aerosol non stick spray to grease a 8x8 inch baking pan. When the sweet potatoes are cool, peel and cut them into large chunks. Arrange them in the prepared dish. In a small saucepan, melt butter, syrup, sugar and coconut together over a low heat. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Sprinkle mixture over sweet potatoes. Top mixture with pecans. Bake 5 to 7 minutes, until top is lightly browned.
