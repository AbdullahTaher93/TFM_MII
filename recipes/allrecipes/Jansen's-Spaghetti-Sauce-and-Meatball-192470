For the sauce, combine the chopped tomatoes, 2 cans tomato paste, tomato sauce, 4 teaspoons oregano, 2 teaspoons parsley, basil, 2 teaspoons sugar, salt, 6 cloves garlic, olive oil, and red wine in a large, heavy pot. Cover, and cook over medium heat until bubbling. Uncover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for at least one hour, stirring often. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray. Combine the meatloaf mix, corn flakes, eggs, 3 garlic cloves, Parmesan cheese, 3 tablespoons tomato paste, 2 teaspoons dried oregano, 2 tablespoons dried parsley, 1 tablespoon sugar, garlic salt, nutmeg, and black pepper in a large bowl. Mix well with a large fork. Form the meat mixture into 1 1/2 inch firm balls. Place the meatballs on the prepared pan. Bake meatballs until browned and cooked though, about 20 to 30 minutes. Drop cooked meatballs into hot spaghetti sauce, and serve immediately.
