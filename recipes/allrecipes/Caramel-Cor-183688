Prepare popcorn according to package directions. Transfer popped corn to a large roasting pan. Add mixed nuts; set aside. In large saucepan, combine sugar, butter, water and salt over medium heat. Stir occasionally until bubbly around edges. Cook 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat; stir in baking soda and vanilla. Pour over popcorn and nut mixture; stir until well coated. Bake in a preheated 300 degrees F oven for 15 minutes, stirring half way through. Let cool; break apart and store in an airtight container.
