Scrub potatoes and place in a 3 1/2- to 4-quart pan; add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-high; boil gently until potatoes are tender when pierced (about 20 minutes). Using a slotted spoon, lift potatoes from water and set aside to cool slightly. Add beans to pan and cook, uncovered, over high heat just until barely tender when pierced (5 to 7 minutes). Drain beans and immerse in cold water until cool. Meanwhile, cut each potato into 8 pieces. Place in a large bowl. Lightly mix in oil and vinegar and season to taste with salt and pepper. Drain beans and pat dry. Add to potatoes with onion and capers; mix lightly. Serve at once or cover and refrigerate for up to 4 hours (beyond that time, the beans will discolor).
