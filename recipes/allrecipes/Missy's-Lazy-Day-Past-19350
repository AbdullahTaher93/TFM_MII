Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and set aside. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Saute green onions and garlic until tender. Pour in broth and cook 3 minutes, then stir in tomato. Cover and simmer another 2 minutes, just until tomato becomes soft, then add cooked spaghetti and heat through. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve.
