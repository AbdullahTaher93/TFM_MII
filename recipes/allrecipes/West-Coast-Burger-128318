To Make Sauce: Combine vinegar, oil, garlic, basil, and black pepper in a shallow baking dish. Add zucchini, red pepper, and onion to sauce and toss to coat. Thread vegetables on 2 metal skewers. Reserve sauce. Grill vegetables over medium-hot coals until tender, turning often, about 15 minutes. Remove from grill and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Meanwhile, to make burgers: Gently shape turkey into 4 burgers. Place burgers in remaining sauce and turn to coat. Grill burgers until well done, until no pink remains, turning once, about 15 minutes. Place each burger on a bread slice and top with grilled vegetables, cheese, and another bread slice.
