Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Brown chicken in oil, then remove from skillet and dip in cracker crumbs to coat; set aside. To skillet add vinegar, garlic powder, dry mustard, cumin, Worcestershire sauce and ketchup. Stir together and cook until heated through and bubbly, about 7 to 10 minutes. Return chicken to skillet and cook, basting with sauce, for about 10 minutes or until cooked through (no longer pink inside).
