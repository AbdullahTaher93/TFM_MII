Cut the pork tenderloin across into 1/4-inch slices, then cut each slice into 1/4-inch strips. Cover the meat and set aside. Cook the noodles in a saucepan of boiling water 4 minutes, or cook or soak them according to the package directions. Drain the noodles well and set aside. While the noodles are cooking, heat a wok or a large heavy-bottomed skillet until hot. Add the oil and swirl to coat the wok. Add the onion and garlic and stir-fry 1 minute. Add the five-spice powder and stir-fry 1 minute longer. Add the pork strips to the wok and stir-fry 3 minutes. Add the snow peas or sugar-snap peas and the bell peppers and stir-fry 2 minutes longer. Pour in the stock, stir well, and bring to a boil. Add the noodles to the wok and stir and toss until all the ingredients are well combined, 2 to 3 minutes. Season to taste and serve immediately, sprinkled with cilantro leaves.
