In a large, heavy skillet, heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry the drumettes until lightly browned and no longer pink on the inside. Remove from heat and drain excess oil. In a large saucepan, bring the tomato soup and water to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer. Mix in the drumettes, green bell peppers and Vidalia onion. Simmer approximately 15 minutes.
