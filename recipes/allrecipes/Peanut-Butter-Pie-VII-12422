Mix confectioners' sugar and peanut butter until mixture has a crumbly texture. Sprinkle half over the bottom of the shell. In the top of a double boiler, combine milk, 2/3 cup sugar, salt, vanilla, cornstarch, and egg yolks. Cook over medium-low heat until thick. Pour filling into crust. Beat egg whites until foamy. Add cream of tartar, and continue beating. Gradually add 6 tablespoons sugar, and continue beating until stiff peaks form. Spread over the top of the pie. Sprinkle with remaining peanut butter mixture. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 30 minutes.
