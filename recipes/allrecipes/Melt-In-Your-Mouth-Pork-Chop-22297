In a large bowl combine soy sauce, teriyaki sauce and water. In a large skillet on medium heat, brown both sides of the pork chops in a small amount of oil. Pour liquid mixture over chops. Add more water if needed. Chops should be covered completely in liquid. Bring to a boil. Lower temperature and simmer for an hour and twenty minutes, turning chops over half way through.
