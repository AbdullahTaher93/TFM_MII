Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly butter a 2 1/2 quart casserole dish. In a large skillet, brown the ground beef and drain. Stir in instant minced onion, garlic salt, tomato sauce and olives. In a mixing bowl, combine sour cream, ricotta cheese and green chiles. Reserve a few chips to use as garnish and crush the remainder. Put half of the crushed chips in the prepared casserole dish and cover with half of the meat mixture. Cover the meat mixture with half of the sour cream mixture, then add half of the Monterey Jack cheese. Repeat layers. Bake uncovered for 30 to 35 minutes. Garnish with reserved whole tortilla chips.
