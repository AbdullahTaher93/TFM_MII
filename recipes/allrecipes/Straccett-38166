In a large shallow dish, combine 1 cup white wine, Worcestershire sauce and Dijon mustard. Add flank, and turn to coat evenly. Refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours. After meat has marinated, slice thinly across the grain, and return to marinade. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Heat olive oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Saute onion until soft and translucent. Stir in mushrooms and garlic. Pour in beef stock. Simmer until sauce is reduced by 1/3, about 10 minutes. Remove beef from marinade, and stir into skillet. Pour in 1 cup wine, and season with Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. Simmer for 10 minutes, or until the beef is fully cooked, then add tomatoes, and cook until heated through but still firm, about 5 minutes. Place pasta into a large serving bowl, and top with sauce and grated Asiago cheese.
