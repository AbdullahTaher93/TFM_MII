First, make the Parmesan cream. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine white wine, shallots, peppercorns and thyme. Cook about 7 to 8 minutes or until mixture is dry. Add chicken stock; continue to cook until liquid reduces by half. Add heavy cream and cook for about 2 minutes more or until sauce is slightly thickened. Strain sauce through a fine mesh wire sieve. Pour strained sauce into a blender. Add grated Parmesan cheese, thyme and oregano; blend until smooth. Strain one more time through fine mesh wire sieve. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground white pepper. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; cook fettucine until al dente. (Time will vary depending on whether you use fresh or dried pasta.) Meanwhile, in a large skillet, over medium-high heat, heat olive oil. Add garlic and cook for about 1 minute. Add pancetta, thyme and oregano and cook for about 2 minutes more. Stir in chicken broth and deglaze pan. Stir in prepared Parmesan cream. Cook only until heated through. Remove 1/2 cup sauce and set aside; keep warm. When fettucine is cooked, drain and add to sauce in skillet together with chopped parsley and crushed red pepper flakes. Stir to mix thoroughly. Season to taste with salt, if necessary. Slice cooked, grilled chicken breasts on the diagonal.
