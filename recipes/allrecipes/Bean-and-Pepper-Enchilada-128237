Coat two 9 X 13-inch (3-L) baking dishes with nonstick spray; set aside. Mix the beans, ricotta, chili powder, and 3/4 cup (175 mL) of the cheddar in a large bowl. Set aside. In a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the scallions and garlic; cook, stirring frequently, until tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the salsa, tomato paste, peppers, and cilantro; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the sauce thickens slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the vinegar. Briefly dip each tortilla into the sauce to coat and soften it. Place 2 rounded tablespoons (25 ml) of the bean filling on each tortilla. Fold a tortilla to enclose the filling, and then place, seam side down, in one of the baking dishes. Repeat with the remaining tortillas. Spoon the remaining sauce evenly over the enchiladas. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup (50 ml) of cheddar. Cover the baking dishes loosely with foil and bake the enchiladas at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) until the cheese has melted and the sauce is hot and bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes.
