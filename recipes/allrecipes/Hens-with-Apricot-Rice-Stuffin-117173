In a large skillet, saute the mushrooms, pecans and onion in 4 tablespoons butter until tender. Stir in the rice, apricots, parsley, salt, pepper and cayenne. Spoon about 3/4 cup rice mixture into each hen; tie legs together with kitchen string. Place hens, breast side up, on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Melt remaining butter; brush over hens. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1-3/4 to 2 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees F for hens and 165 degrees F for stuffing. In a small saucepan, warm preserves and vinegar; spoon over hens. Bake 15 minutes longer.
