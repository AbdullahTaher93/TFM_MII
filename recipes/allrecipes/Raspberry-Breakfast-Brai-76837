In medium bowl, measure baking mix. Cut in cream cheese and butter until mixture is crumbly. Stir in milk. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead lightly 10 to 12 times. Roll dough into a 12x8-inch rectangle. Turn onto greased baking sheet. Spread preserves lengthwise down center 1/3 of dough. Make 2 1/2-inch cuts at 1-inch intervals on long sides. Fold strips over filling. Bake at 425 degrees F for 12 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Combine all glaze ingredients, adding enough milk for desired drizzling consistency. Drizzle over coffee cake.
