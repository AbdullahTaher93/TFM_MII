Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease silicone muffin cups with coconut oil. Mix oat flour, chickpea flour, cinnamon, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt together in a large bowl. Mix apple butter, honey, and eggs together in a separate bowl. Stir apple butter mixture into the oat flour mixture. Fold carrots, apples, coconut, raisins, and walnuts into the batter. Divide muffin batter evenly among muffin cups, filling them almost to the top. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool completely before unmolding, about 20 minutes.
