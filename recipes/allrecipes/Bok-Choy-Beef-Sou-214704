Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the beef, and continue cooking until the beef is evenly browned. Season with salt and pepper. Add the chicken broth, water, lime juice, and jalapeno. Increase heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil. Stir in bok choy, and simmer until tender, about 5 minutes. Mix in chile-garlic sauce.
