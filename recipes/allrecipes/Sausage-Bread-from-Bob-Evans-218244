Preheat oven to 350 F. Place bread dough on a greased baking sheet and gently press to cover bottom of pan. Let rest. In large skillet over medium heat, crumble and cook sausage until browned. Add pepper and onion and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool 20 minutes. Stir in cheese and remaining ingredients. Spoon the mixture down the center of the bread dough. Gently pull up both sides of dough to enclose the sausage and pinch to seal edges shut. Brush the top with oil and sprinkle with some extra spice if desired. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until bread is browned. Cut into 2 inch slices to serve.
