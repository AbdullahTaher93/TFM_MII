Whisk together the mustard, molasses, garlic and chili powder in a bowl. Trim the fat from the pork and place the meat in a baking dish. Pour the marinade over the pork, coating it well. Put it in the fridge and marinate for two to four hours. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the pork on a rack in a roasting pan and season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Cover the pork with the chopped parsley and cilantro, patting them so they adhere to the meat. Roast for 20 to 25 minutes. Cover the meat loosely with aluminum foil and let stand for 10 minutes before slicing against the grain. Serve with steamed vegetables and white rice, and toast with white wine.
