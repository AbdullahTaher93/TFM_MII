Melt butter in a large skillet and saute the green onion, green pepper, and garlic until onions are opaque. Stir in flour and cook for 7 minutes, stirring frequently. Add crawfish meat; cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Stir in the processed cheese, half and half, Cajun seasoning and tomato. Cover and simmer for another 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cook pasta. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Mix together the sauce and pasta and transfer to the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and bake for 20 minutes or until bubbly.
