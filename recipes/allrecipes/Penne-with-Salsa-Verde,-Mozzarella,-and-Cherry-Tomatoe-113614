In a blender or food processor, puree the parsley, the smashed garlic, the capers, and the anchovy paste with the olive oil, the wine vinegar, and the salt and pepper. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the penne rigate until just done, about 13 minutes. Drain. In a large bowl, toss the pasta with the parsley mixture, mozzarella, and tomatoes.
