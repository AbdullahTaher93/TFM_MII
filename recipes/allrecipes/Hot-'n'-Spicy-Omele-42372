In a bowl, beat eggs. Add water, garlic, salt and pepper. In a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, heat oil and butter. Add egg mixture; as eggs set, lift edges, letting the uncooked portion flow underneath. When eggs are completely set, remove from the heat. Fold omelet in half and transfer to a warm platter. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes.
