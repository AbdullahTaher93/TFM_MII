Trim thick outer layer of fat from ribs; discard. Rinse meat and pat dry. In a 1-gallon heavy plastic food bag, combine soy sauce, sherry, sugar, and ginger; shake to mix. Add short ribs to bag, seal, and turn over to coat meat with marinade. Set bag in a bowl; chill at least 30 minutes or up to 1 day, turning several times. Remove ribs and discard marinade. Preheat barbecue grill. Lay ribs, pulled open so meat is flat, on a barbecue grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds). Close lid of gas grill; open vents for charcoal. Brown meat, turning once, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a platter.
