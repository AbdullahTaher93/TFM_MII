Toss to coat beets. Place beets on a shallow baking pan; roast 40-45 minutes, or until fork tender. Cool, then peel beets and cut into approximately 1/2 inch wedges. Whisk together orange juice,1 tablespoon olive oil, vinegar, parsley, remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, garlic powder, and salt. Set aside. Place one cup mixed greens on each of four plates. Top each salad with mandarin orange sections and beets. Sprinkle with walnuts and drizzle with dressing. Serve.
