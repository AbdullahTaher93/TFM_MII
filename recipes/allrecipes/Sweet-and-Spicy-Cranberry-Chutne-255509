Combine water, brown sugar, and white sugar in a large pot; stir until sugars dissolve. Add cranberries, onion, dates, raisins, vinegar, ginger, cinnamon, salt, garlic, and cloves. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until most of the cranberries have burst and sauce begins to thicken, about 15 minutes. Pour into a large bowl and refrigerate until set, about 45 minutes.
