In a bowl, mix the Italian-style salad dressing, soy sauce, and pepper. Place the pork chops in a skillet over medium heat, and cover with the dressing mixture. Cover skillet, and cook pork chops 25 minutes, turning occasionally. Remove cover, reduce heat to low, and continue cooking to desired doneness.
