Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish. In a medium bowl, mix the sour cream, lemon juice, soy sauce, celery salt, garlic salt, and pepper. Dip each chicken breast in the sour cream mixture, then roll in the stuffing mix to coat. Arrange chicken in the prepared baking dish. Drizzle with the melted butter. Bake 40 to 50 minutes in the preheated oven, until the chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear.
