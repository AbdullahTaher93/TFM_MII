In a medium bowl, combine the soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, oil, mustard powder, ginger and ground black pepper. Place the salmon in a shallow, nonporous dish and pour the marinade over the salmon. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, turning occasionally. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium high heat and lightly oil grate. Grill the fish for about 3 to 4 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.
