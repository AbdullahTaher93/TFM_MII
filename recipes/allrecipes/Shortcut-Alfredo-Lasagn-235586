Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Stir the soup and milk in a small bowl. Spread about 1/4 cup soup mixture in the bottom of an 8x8x2-inch baking dish. Layer 16 ravioli, 1 1/2 cups broccoli, 1 1/2 cups chicken, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese and 3/4 cup soup mixture in the baking dish. Repeat the layers. Top with the remaining ravioli. Spoon the remaining soup mixture over the ravioli. Cover the baking dish. Bake for 30 minutes. Uncover the baking dish. Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese. Bake, uncovered, for 15 minutes or until the cheese is lightly browned. Let stand for 15 minutes before serving.
