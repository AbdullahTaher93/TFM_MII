In a large bowl, combine beef, cooked rice, apple, onion, tomato sauce, eggs, garlic, bread crumbs, chili powder, caraway, cumin, oregano, nutmeg, and pepper. Mix ingredients until well combined. Place mixture in a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan, gently rounding top. Bake in a 350 degree F oven until top is browned and edges pull from pan sides, about 1 hour. Top evenly with cheese; bake until cheese melts, about 5 minutes longer. Let loaf cool at least 10 minutes before serving. Loosen edges of loaf with knife; using a spatula, gently lift loaf from pan onto a serving platter.
