In a small bowl, mix mayonnaise, sugar, pepper, lemon juice and vinegar. Cover and refrigerate. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and mash garlic to a rough paste with a fork. Stir in cumin, oregano and cilantro; set aside. Place pork loin fat side down on a cutting board. Insert the point of a sharp knife 1/2 inch from one end and make a lengthwise incision, cutting almost but not quite through to form a large pocket. Repeat, making 2 more lengthwise incisions. Generously sprinkle inside of roast all over with salt and pepper and stuff with the cilantro mixture. Tie loin together with kitchen twine. Season surface of roast with remaining olive oil, salt and pepper. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Place loin fat side down on the hot grill. Cook until well-seared, about 5 minutes. Turn roast over; grill until other side is well-seared, about 5 minutes longer. Turn off all but one burner or transfer roast to cooler section of grill. Cover and cook over indirect heat until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest section registers 130 degrees (55 degrees C), about 1 hour 20 minutes. Brush roast all over with some of the BBQ sauce. Continue to cook, brushing once more until roast registers between 150 and 160 degrees (65 - 70 degrees C), about 30 minutes longer. Remove from heat, cover loosely with aluminum foil and let rest for 10 minutes. Remove strings, slice and serve.
