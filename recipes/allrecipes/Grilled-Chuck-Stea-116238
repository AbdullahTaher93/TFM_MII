In a small saucepan, saute garlic in oil for 3-4 minutes or until tender; remove from the heat. In a 4-cup measure, combine the vinegar, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, basil and garlic. Pour 1 cup marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add the meat. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade. Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill. Prepare grill for indirect heat. Drain and discard marinade from steak. Grill steak, uncovered, over medium heat until browned on each side. Move steak to indirect side of grill. Grill, covered, for 45-50 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F), basting occasionally with marinade.
