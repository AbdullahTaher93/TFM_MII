In a large bowl, or in a food processor, combine the cream cheese, 1 tablespoon of fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme, the pepper, salt and gin or vodka. Beat or process until blended and smooth. Add Swiss cheese and ham and beat vigorously until evenly mixed. If you are using a food processor, do not to overmix; the ham and Swiss cheese should retain some texture. Refrigerate 2-3 hours or until form enough to form. Combine the remaining fresh or dried thyme and the chives and spread on a large plate or sheet of waxed paper. Dampen your hands with water to keep the cheese mixture from sticking to them, then divide the mixture in half. Pat and press each half into a ball about 3 inches across; don't worry about keeping the shape perfect. Roll each ball in the thyme and chive mixture, pressing so the coating adheres. Wrap separately in plastic wrap and chill until firm.
