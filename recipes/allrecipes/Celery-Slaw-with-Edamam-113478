In a food processor or with a sharp knife, slice the celery as thinly as possible. Put the celery in a bowl of ice water and crisp for 15 minutes. Drain and pat dry. Wipe out the bowl and return the celery to it. In a medium saucepan of boiling water, cook the soybeans for 5 minutes. Drain and refresh under cold water. Shell the soybeans and pat dry. Add the soybeans, scallions, cilantro, mint and celery leaves to the celery and toss well. In a bowl, whisk the lime juice with the oil. Pour the dressing over the vegetables, season with salt, toss and serve.
