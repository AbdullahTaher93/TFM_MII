For the marinade, in a blender combine water, onion, oil, lime juice, garlic, jalapeno pepper, chili powder, salt and pepper. Place the pork loin in a re-sealable plastic baggie and pour the marinade over the pork. Try to eliminate most the air when you seal the bag. Refrigerate 4 hours or overnight. Turn it a few times so that all sides get well marinated. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Transfer the pork to a roasting pan, reserving the marinade. Roast uncovered for about 45 minutes or until an internal temp of about 155 degrees F. Transfer to a platter and cover with foil to rest while you make the sauce. Deglaze roasting pan with the chicken broth, scraping up all those yummy brown bits. Pour this into a saucepan over medium high heat and add the reserved marinade, Kitchen bouquet and Splenda. Bring to a boil then cook for about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the cilantro. Slice the roast and serve with the sauce drizzled over the pork or on the side.
