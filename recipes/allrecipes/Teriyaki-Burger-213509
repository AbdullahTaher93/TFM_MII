Shape the beef into 6 (1/2-inch thick) burgers. Cook the burgers in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until well browned on both sides. Pour off any fat. Stir the broth, soy sauce, brown sugar and ginger in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes for medium or to desired doneness. Serve the burgers and sauce on the buns.
