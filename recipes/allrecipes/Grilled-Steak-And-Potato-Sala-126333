To make the steak and vegetables: Coat a grill rack or broiler-pan rack with cooking spray. Preheat the grill or broiler. Rub the steak on both sides with the garlic, pepper, and salt, pressing them into the surface. Place on one side of the prepared rack. On a plate, toss the onion with the oil and vinegar and place on the other side of the rack. Let stand for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, place a steamer basket in a saucepan with 1/2 inch of water. Place the potatoes in the steamer. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 7 minutes, or until fork-tender. Grill or broil the steak and onion for 6 minutes, turning once, or until a thermometer inserted in the center of the steak registers 145 degrees F for medium-rare. Place on a plate. Let stand for 10 minutes, then slice. Grill or broil the onion rings, turning frequently, for 10 minutes, or until tender and lightly charred. To make the salad: In a large bowl, whisk together the vinegar, olive oil, flaxseed oil, mustard, water, garlic, pepper, and salt until well-blended. Add the greens, potatoes, onion, steak, and any accumulated meat juices; toss to coat well.
