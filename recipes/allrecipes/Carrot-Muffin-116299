In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt. In a blender or food processor, combine remaining ingredients; cover and process until carrots are finely chopped. Pour carrot mixture over dry ingredients; stir just until combined. Fill greased muffin cups three-fourths full. Bake at 425 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm.
