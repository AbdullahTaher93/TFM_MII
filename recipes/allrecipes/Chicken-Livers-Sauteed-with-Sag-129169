Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange the French bread on a baking tray. Using 1 tablespoon of the oil, lightly brush the slices of bread on the top side. Bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil with the butter in a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute until soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chicken livers and mushrooms, and saute to brown on all sides. As they cook, break up any large livers into bite-size pieces, using the side of the spatula. Add the balsamic vinegar, shredded sage, and seasoning to taste. Reduce the heat a little and continue cooking until the livers are just cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes. Serve the chicken livers on top of the baked French bread slices, garnished with sprigs of fresh sage.
