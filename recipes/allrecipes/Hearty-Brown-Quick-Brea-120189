In a large bowl, combine the flours, sugars, baking soda and salt. Stir in buttermilk and eggs just until moistened. Fold in raisins and nuts. Pour into two 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely.
