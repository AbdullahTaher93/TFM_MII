Combine the lime juice, honey, poppy seeds, and mustard in a small bowl; slowly whisk in the oil. Combine the almonds, salt, and sugar in a large skillet. Stir constantly over medium-low heat until almonds are light golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove nuts from the skillet to cool. Toss the spinach, strawberries, coconut, onions, and cooled almonds in a large bowl. Top with prepared dressing, and toss to coat.
