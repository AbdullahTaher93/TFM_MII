Mix bread crumbs, crushed potato chips, pepper, dill, salt, and garlic together in a large bowl. Mix in chicken, ranch dressing, tartar sauce, 1/4 cup hot sauce, and green onions. Form mixture into 2-inch or 3-inch balls; press down into patties. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place patties in a single layer in the hot oil; cook until dark golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining patties. Whisk honey and 2 tablespoons hot sauce together to make dipping sauce. Serve dipping sauce with patties.
