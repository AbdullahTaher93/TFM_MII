Prepare SuperPretzel(R) Soft Bites on a baking tray as recommended. While the Soft Pretzel(R) Bites are still hot, cover with chocolate or caramel sauce, or Chocolate Magic Shell for a hard outer covering. Top Soft Pretzel(R) Bites with whipped cream and cherry for a true sundae look. Use peanut butter sauce as a variation.
