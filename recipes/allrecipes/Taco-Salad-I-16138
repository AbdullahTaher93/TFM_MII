Place hamburger in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown and drain. Add taco seasoning mix and prepare as directed by package. Set aside to cool. In a large bowl, combine the lettuce, onions, bell pepper, cheese, beef, tomatoes and tortilla chips. Add enough dressing to coat, mix well and refrigerate overnight.
