In a pressure cooker, saute green pepper in oil until crisp-tender. Remove with a slotted spoon; set aside. Brown pork in pressure cooker over medium-high heat; drain. Stir in the broth, onion, wine or broth, garlic and pepper. Close cover securely; place pressure regulator on vent pipe. Bring cooker to full pressure over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook for 12 minutes. (Pressure regulator should maintain a slow steady rocking motion; adjust heat if needed.) Remove from the heat; immediately cool according to a manufacturer's directions until pressure is completely reduced. Meanwhile, cook noodles according to package directions. Stir tomato and reserved green pepper into the pork mixture. Combine flour and cold water until smooth; stir into pork mixture. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Reduce heat to low; stir in sour cream and browning sauce if desired. Drain noodles; serving with pork mixture.
