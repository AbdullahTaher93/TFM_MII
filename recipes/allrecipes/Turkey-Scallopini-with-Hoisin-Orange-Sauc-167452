Combine flour and pepper in a shallow dish. Dredge turkey lightly in the flour mixture. Heat oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook turkey until the outside is slightly browned and the inside is no longer pink, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to plates or a platter and keep warm. Add garlic and scallions to the pan and saute for 1 minute. Add water, orange-juice concentrate, soy sauce and hoisin, bring to a boil, stirring. Spoon the sauce over the turkey.
