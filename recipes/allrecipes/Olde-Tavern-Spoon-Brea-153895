Measure the milk into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the cornmeal; cook and stir for several minutes, until cornmeal has absorbed all of the milk. Remove from the heat and allow to cool for about 1 hour. The mixture will be very stiff. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish. Place the cornmeal mixture into a large bowl. Stir in the eggs, salt, baking powder and butter. Pour into the prepared casserole dish. Bake for 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges become lightly toasted. Serve hot directly from the dish by the spoonful.
