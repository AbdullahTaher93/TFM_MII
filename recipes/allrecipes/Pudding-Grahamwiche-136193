Beat cream cheese in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until creamy. Gradually add milk, beating until well blended. Add pudding mix; beat 2 minutes. Gently stir in whipped topping. Spoon about 1/4 cup of the pudding mixture onto each of 20 graham squares; top with remaining graham squares to form sandwiches. Wrap each sandwich individually in plastic wrap. Freeze at least 4 hours or until firm.
