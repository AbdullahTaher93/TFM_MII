Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line the cupcake pans with paper liners. Prepare cake mix according to package directions. Chop 15 Snickers(R) (about 2 cups), fold into batter and evenly fill cupcake liners. Bake 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven, transfer to wire rack, and cool. Cut licorice laces into 2-inch pieces and set aside. Tint icing with orange food coloring and frost cupcakes. Set two cupcakes aside to use for the creatures heads. Cover the rest of the cupcakes with M&M's(R). Press a 2-inch line of licorice laces on opposite sides of every cupcake for creatures legs. Decorate the two reserved cupcakes. Make a smile with black M&M's(R). Cover the rest of the cupcake with orange M&M's(R). Cut a Snickers(R) in half for each eye, and use 2 M&Ms for the pupils. Add licorice laces for the antennae. Line the cupcakes into creature shape on a large platter or a piece of strong cardboard (as shown in photo).
