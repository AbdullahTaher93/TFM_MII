In a bowl, combine the strawberries, sugar and vanilla. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. For pancakes, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a bowl. Combine the egg, buttermilk, oil and vanilla; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Pour the batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto a lightly greased hot griddle; place 5-6 banana slices on each pancake. Turn when bubbles form on top; cook until second side is golden brown. Serve with strawberries and whipped cream if desired.
