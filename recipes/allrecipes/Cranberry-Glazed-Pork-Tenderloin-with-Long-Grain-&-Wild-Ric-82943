Prepare rice according to package directions. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Season pork tenderloin with salt and pepper. In a bowl, whisk the cranberry sauce and water until smooth. Brown the tenderloin on all sides in a skillet. Completely coat the browned tenderloin with the cranberry glaze and place in oven. After 10 minutes, glaze the tenderloin again. Cook another 10 minutes, remove from oven, slice and serve on rice.
