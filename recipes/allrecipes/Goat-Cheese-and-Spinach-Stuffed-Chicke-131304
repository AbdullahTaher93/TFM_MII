Preheat oven to 350 degrees F . Wrap spinach in paper towels and squeeze out liquid. Chop finely. Mix with goat cheese; season with salt and pepper. Place chicken breasts between two sheets of wax paper and pound into thin cutlets. Place half of the spinach mixture at wide end of one breast, fold in sides, and roll up, securing with a toothpick. Repeat with the second breast. Place chicken rolls in a baking dish, add broth, and cover with foil. Bake for 30 minutes until chicken is cooked through.
