In a medium glass or stainless-steel bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, sour cream, horseradish, vinegar, pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt until smooth. In a large bowl, toss the escarole with the mushrooms, onion, roast beef, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and all but 2 tablespoons of the dressing. Serve the salad with the remaining dressing drizzled over the top.
