Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir ramen noodles and walnuts until toasted, about 5 minutes. Transfer mixture to a plate lined with paper towels and set aside until cooled. Whisk together vegetable oil, sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Combine ramen noodle and walnut mixture with lettuce, broccoli, and green onions in a large serving bowl. Pour in the dressing and toss to coat.
