Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place the pork roast in a 9x11 inch roasting pan and bake in preheated oven for 3 hours (25 minutes per pound). In a bowl, combine lima beans, onions, potatoes (including all the liquid) and molasses. One hour before roast is done, pour mixture into pan and continue cooking one more hour, until internal temperature has reached 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
