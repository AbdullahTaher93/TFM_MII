Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet or line it with parchment paper. Cut butter into flour until the size of small peas. Pour in the buttermilk and stir just until combined. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls on prepared baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
