Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Process oats, coconut, blueberries, cashews, sesame seeds, and flax seeds together in a food processor until evenly chopped. Mix tahini, honey, and vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer. Mix tahini mixture into oat mixture using your hands until evenly moistened. Spread mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, forming a 1-inch high rectangle. Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 1 hour.
