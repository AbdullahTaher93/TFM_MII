Preheat your oven's broiler to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Arrange slices of eggplant and red bell pepper on a baking sheet. Broil for about 7 minutes, until soft. Meanwhile, place the spinach onto a serving plate and drizzle with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Sprinkle with salt. When the vegetables are done, arrange the red peppers over the spinach. Smear a small amount of sun-dried tomato paste onto each slice of eggplant. Top with a slice of prosciutto. Arrange the eggplant slices over the peppers in an overlapping spiral pattern. Serve immediately.
