In a large resealable bag, combine the first five ingredients. Add the pork; seal and turn to coat. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Drain and discard marinade. Line a shallow baking pan with foil and coat with nonstick cooking spray. Place tenderloins in pan. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
