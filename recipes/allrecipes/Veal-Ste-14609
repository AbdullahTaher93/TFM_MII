In a large pot, heat oil over medium heat. Add onions and garlic; cook and stir until onion is tender. Add meat to the pot, and brown evenly. Stir in tomato sauce and white wine. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, or until tender.
