Slice steak into thin strips and season with garlic and black pepper. Cook beef in hot oil. Add peppers and onions, if desired, and cook until crisp tender. Combine teriyaki sauce and cornstarch and add to beef mixture. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Simmer 2 minutes, or until sauce thickens slightly. Serve over rice.
