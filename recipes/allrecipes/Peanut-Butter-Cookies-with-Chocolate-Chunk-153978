Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment. Combine sugar, spread, peanut butter, egg yolk, and vanilla extract in large bowl and mix until well combined. In medium bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Add to peanut butter mixture and stir until well combined. Divide dough into 36 cookies, using 1 generous teaspoon per cookie, and place on baking sheets. Lightly press each cookie down with fingers until slightly larger than a quarter and about 1/4 inch thick. Bake until lightly golden, 9 to 11 minutes. Remove cookies from oven and immediately press a chocolate chunk onto center of each. Cool completely on baking sheet or place in refrigerator 15 minutes to firm chocolate.
