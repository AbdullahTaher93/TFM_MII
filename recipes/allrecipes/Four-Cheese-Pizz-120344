On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 15-in. x circle. Transfer to a greased 14-in. pizza pan; build up edges slightly. Prick dough several times with a fork. Bake at 400 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from the oven. Reduce heat to 375 degrees F. Sprinkle chopped peppers, cheeses, parsley and basil over crust. Arrange tomato slices over top. In a small bowl, combine oil and garlic; brush over tomatoes. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until cheese is melted. Let stand for 5 minutes before cutting.
