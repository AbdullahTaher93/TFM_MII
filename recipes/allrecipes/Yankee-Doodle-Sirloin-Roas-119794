In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the first eight ingredients; add roast. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate overnight. Drain and discard marinade. Place roast on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1-1/2 to 2-1/4 hours or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F). Let stand for 10-15 minutes before slicing.
