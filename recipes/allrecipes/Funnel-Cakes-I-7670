In a mixing bowl, beat together egg and milk. Beat in flour, salt, baking soda, cream of tartar, and white sugar until smooth. Heat about 1 inch cooking oil in frying pan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Pour 1/2 cup batter through funnel into oil with a circular motion to form a spiral. Fry until lightly brown; turn over to brown the other side. Cook to golden brown, and remove to drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar while still warm.
