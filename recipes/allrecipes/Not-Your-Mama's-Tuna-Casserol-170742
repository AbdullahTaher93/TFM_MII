Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil. Cover pan, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in the hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from water; peel and chop. Combine the chopped eggs, spinach, onion powder, tuna, cream of mushroom soup, and sour cream in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Mix well. Scatter bread pieces over tuna mix; drizzle with melted butter. Bake in preheated oven until bread is toasted and casserole is hot, about 30 to 35 minutes.
