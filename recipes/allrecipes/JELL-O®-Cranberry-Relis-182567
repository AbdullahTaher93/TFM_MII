Mix juice, cinnamon and cloves in medium saucepan. Bring to boil on medium-high heat. Add to dry gelatin in large bowl; stir at least 2 min. until gelatin is completely dissolved. Refrigerate about 1-1/2 hours or until thickened (spoon drawn through leaves a definite impression.) Stir in fruit, walnuts and orange peel. Refrigerate 1 hour or until chilled. Spoon fruit mixture into 1-quart serving bowl. Serve with cooked chicken, turkey or pork. Or, serve as a dessert sauce spooned over ice cream or pound cake slices.
