Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the fava beans and cook until skins are translucent and easy to pull away, about 6 minutes. Transfer beans with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice water; cool to room temperature, 1 to 2 minutes. Squeeze each bean at one end to remove the bean from it's skin; discard skins and reserve beans. Whisk lemon juice, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl; slowly whisk 2 tablespoons olive oil into lemon juice mixture until dressing is thick and emulsified. Stir fava beans, butter beans, roasted red peppers, and mint into dressing; toss to coat beans completely. Drizzle remaining olive oil over the top and season salad with salt and black pepper. Cover and refrigerate until flavors blend, at least 1 hour.
