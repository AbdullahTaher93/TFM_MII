Cut dandelion leaf blades away from their midveins, which can be bitter. Chop leaf blades. Transfer to a large bowl; mix in feta cheese, onion, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, and garlic. Stir salad dressing, Worcestershire sauce, and Italian seasoning into the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and chill until flavors combine, about 1 hour. Stuff each tomato half with some of the dandelion mixture. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
