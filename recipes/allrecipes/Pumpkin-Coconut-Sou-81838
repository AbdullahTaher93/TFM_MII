Zest the lime and then juice it into a soup kettle. Remove any seeds. Add the chicken broth and shallots and bring to a boil. Add the pumpkin and coconut milk and bring to a very slow boil. Taste test and add salt and pepper as desired. Cook for about 15 or 20 minutes at a slow boil or simmer. The cilantro leaves can be left whole or given a course chop. The scallions should be thinly julienne. I like to first cut off the root end and any green tips that are a bit 'off.' Then I cut in half which basically give you a green end and a white end. The white end is easy to julienne cutting lengthwise 5 or 6 times. With the green end I like to cut thinly on a bias (about 15%). When ready to serve, add the cilantro and cook another minute. Ladle into individual bowls and garnish with a bit of the julienne scallions.
