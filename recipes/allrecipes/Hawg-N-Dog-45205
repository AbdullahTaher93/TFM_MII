Slice each hot dog 3/4 of the way through lengthwise. Cut each slice of cheese into 5 strips, and insert 1 strip of cheese into each hot dog. Wrap bacon snugly around each hot dog, securing each end with a toothpick. Preheat oil in a saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Carefully drop the hot dogs in the hot oil, and fry for 1 to 2 minutes, or until bacon is brown and crispy. Remove from oil, and drain on paper towels. Remove and discard toothpicks. Serve on buns with your favorite condiments.
