Whisk eggs, honey, Dijon mustard, soy sauce, and garlic together in a bowl. Mix bread crumbs, salt, and pepper together in a shallow bowl. Heat about 1 inch of oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan. Put chicken slices in the egg mixture and knead until fully coated. Press chicken in the bread crumbs until evenly coated. Carefully put chicken in the hot oil using tongs and cook until no longer pink in the center and browned on the outside, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Serve with lemon wedges.
