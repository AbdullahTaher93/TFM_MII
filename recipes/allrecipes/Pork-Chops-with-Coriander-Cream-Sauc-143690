In a large skillet heat oil over medium heat. Add pork chops to skillet. Cook chops, uncovered, for 18 to 20 minutes or until juices run clear and an instant-read thermometer inserted in chops registers 160 degrees F, turning once. If necessary, cut larger squash pieces into slices or halves. Add squash to skillet during the last 5 minutes of cooking chops. Remove chops and squash; keep warm. Pour off drippings from skillet.

If the sauce is too thick, stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons additional LACTAID(R) Whole Milk. Spoon sauce over pork chops.
