Cook manicotti according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a skillet, cook the sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Stir in spaghetti sauce. Drain manicotti and rinse with cold water. In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, 1/4 cup of mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, garlic powder and pepper. Carefully stuff manicotti. Place in a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Top with sausage mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until heated through. Sprinkle with remaining mozzarella. Bake 3-5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.
