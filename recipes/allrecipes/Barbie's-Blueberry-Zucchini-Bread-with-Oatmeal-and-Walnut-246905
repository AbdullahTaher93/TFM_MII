Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 standard loaf pans or 4 mini loaf pans with cooking spray. Beat sugar, oil, eggs, and vanilla extract in a large bowl until smooth. Fold in zucchini. Sift flour, cinnamon, salt, and baking soda together in another bowl. Stir in oats and coconut. Add flour mixture to zucchini mixture; mix slowly until combined. Fold blueberries and walnuts into the batter. Divide batter among prepared loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Cool for 20 minutes before serving.
