Wearing gloves, remove and discard seeds and veins from chilies. In a blender, whirl chilies and their sauce, maple syrup, and mustard until smooth. Oil and preheat barbecue grill. Rinse and dry pork. Trim excess fat and any thin, silvery membrane from tenderloin. Fold thin ends of meat under to make roast uniformly thick and tie cotton string crosswise around each end to secure. Set meat on a rimmed plate. Pour about 1/3 cup chipotle-maple syrup mixture over pork and turn to coat completely. Place roast on grill over indirect heat. Cover barbecue and open vents. Cook until a thermometer inserted into center of pork reaches 150 degrees, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer roast to a platter and, keeping it warm, let it stand 5 minutes. Cut into thin slices and add salt to taste. Serve with remaining chipotle - maple syrup mixture to add to taste.
