In a large bowl, combine corn pieces, tomatoes, zucchini, and onion. Drizzle with olive oil, then add basil, salt, and pepper; toss to combine. Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, medium-hot heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above grill level only 3 to 4 seconds). Cut four 12-inch squares of heavy-duty foil. In center of one piece, arrange 1/4 of the vegetable mixture. Bring the two opposite sides of foil together and fold to create a packet. Continue to securely fold remaining foil edges. Repeat with 3 remaining squares. Lay sausages and packets on grill. Grill sausages, turning occasionally, until browned and cooked through, about 15 minutes. Grill vegetable packets for the same length of time, flipping once half-way through cooking, about 15 minutes. Serve the vegetables and sausages together.
