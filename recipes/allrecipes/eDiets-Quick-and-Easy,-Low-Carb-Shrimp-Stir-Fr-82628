If you are using fresh shrimp, clean and shell. Defrost, rinse and pat dry frozen shrimp. You can choose a fresh vegetable like broccoli or green beans: chop into bite size pieces; mince garlic, set aside. Heat half of the oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat: saute garlic for 1-2 minutes. Raise temperature to medium high, add vegetable and fry until tender, continuously stirring about 3-4 minutes. Add remaining oil and shrimp to the pan and stir-fry until shrimp is pink, about 3-5 minutes. Add teriyaki sauce and heat through, about 1 minute. Serve.
