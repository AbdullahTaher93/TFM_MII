Place mint leaves in a large drinking glass. Add 1 lime wedge; crush together with a muddler to extract juices. Add 1 more lime wedge and sugar; mix with the muddler until sugar is dissolved. Remove lime peels from the glass. Stir lemon-lime soda, club soda, and mango-flavored rum together in a measuring cup. Pour soda mixture over the mint mixture in the glass. Mix in ice. Garnish with 1 lime wedge.
