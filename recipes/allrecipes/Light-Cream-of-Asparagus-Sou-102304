Bring asparagus, onion, and 1/2 of the chicken broth to a boil in a small saucepan. Cover, and steam until asparagus is just tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and pour in water. Puree in batches until smooth, and return to pan. Microwave remaining broth and milk in a 1-quart heat resistant glass measuring cup until steamy hot. Heat butter in a Dutch oven; whisk in flour, then hot broth mixture. Whisking constantly, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat. Whisk in asparagus puree, and continue cooking for 2 to 3 minutes or until hot. Stir in lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper. Ladle into soup bowls, and top with a dollop of sour cream.
