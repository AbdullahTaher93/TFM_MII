Combine all glaze ingredients, blend until smooth and reserve under refrigeration until needed. Marinate the ChickenStixx in the Agave-Pomegranate marinade overnight. Remove the ChickenStixx from Agave-Pomegranate marinade and pat dry. Reduce marinade to a glaze by slowly simmering until one (1) cup is left. Season the ChickenStixx with salt and pepper. Roast at 250 F. for 30 minutes. Increase heat to 375 F, and glaze the ChickenStixx with the Agave-pomegranate glaze and bake an additional 15 minutes. Glaze the chicken every 5 minutes while roasting until 165 internally. Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
