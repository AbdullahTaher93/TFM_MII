Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken breasts in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a blender, combine the soup, cream cheese, dressing mix and wine. Blend until smooth, then pour over chicken. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour, or until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside.
