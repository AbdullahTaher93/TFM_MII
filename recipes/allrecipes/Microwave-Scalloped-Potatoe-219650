Place potatoes, onion, and butter in a large microwave-safe dish. Mix flour and salt in a bowl; sprinkle over potatoes and gently toss until vegetables are coated. Pour milk over the potatoes. Cook in the microwave on high setting until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. Allow potatoes to rest for 5 minutes before sprinkling with parsley and paprika for serving.
