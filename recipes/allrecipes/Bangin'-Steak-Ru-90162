In a small bowl, thoroughly mix together the brown sugar, chili seasoning mix, ranch dressing mix, garlic salt, onion salt, ground black pepper, and steak seasoning. The rub should be smooth and granular, with no large lumps. Store at room temperature in an airtight container until ready to use. To use, rub the seasoning mix liberally onto the steak or meat of your choice before cooking.
