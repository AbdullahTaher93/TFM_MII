Place the tomatoes in a large shallow dish and sprinkle with the sugar. Cut the lemon in half lengthwise; set one half aside, then cut the other half lengthwise into 4 wedges. Holding the wedges firmly together on a board, skin side up, thinly slice them across, including the peel; discard the seeds. Arrange the pieces of thinly sliced lemon over the top of the tomatoes, then sprinkle with the scallions, cilantro, and mint. Squeeze the juice from the remaining lemon half and sprinkle it over the salad. Serve immediately, or cover and chill until ready to serve. Garnish with sprigs of mint just before serving.
