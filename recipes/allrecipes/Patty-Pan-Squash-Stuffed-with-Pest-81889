Choose squash that stand up well. Cut off the stem end about 1/4 to 1/2 an inch. Using a spoon or knife, cut out a small cavity enough to hold about 1 Tbsp of pesto. Place on a plate or shallow dish and cover. Zap in the microwave for about 4 minutes. Meanwhile mix together the pesto, toasted pine nuts (whole or chopped) and the shredded parmesan cheese. When the squash are done, spoon the pesto into the cavity and re-cover. Let rest for 1 minute covered then serve.
