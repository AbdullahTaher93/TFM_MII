Season the turkey with the salt and black pepper. Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the turkey and cook for 2 minutes or until browned on both sides. Remove the turkey from the skillet. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion and cook for 2 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and cook and stir for 30 seconds. Increase the heat to medium-high. Add the wine and heat to a boil, stirring to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Cook for 1 minute or until the wine is reduced by half. Stir in the soup and water and heat to a boil. Return the turkey to the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 2 minutes or until the turkey is cooked through. Serve the turkey and sauce over the fettuccine. Sprinkle with the parsley.
