Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook garlic and ginger for about 2 minutes. Add allspice, cloves, cinnamon, and star anise; stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add maple syrup, bourbon, and brown sugar to the saucepan. Cook and stir mixture until reduced and thickened to a glaze consistency, about 5 minutes. Whisk orange juice and ketchup into glaze until smooth. Strain glaze to remove spices.
