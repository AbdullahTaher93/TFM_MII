Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Spray a small nonstick baking sheet. In a medium-size bowl, stir together crab, onion, 2 Tbsp egg substitute, bell pepper, mayo, paprika, and cayenne. Divide the mixture in half. On a sheet of wax paper, shape each into a 3-inch-diameter patty. Pour remaining egg substitute into a medium, shallow bowl. Pour breadcrumbs into a second shallow bowl and set it next to the first. Carefully coat one cake with breadcrumbs. Transfer to bowl containing egg, coat with egg, then return to breadcrumbs. When completely coated with second layer of breadcrumbs, place on prepared sheet. Repeat procedure with second patty, then add it to baking sheet so they do not touch. Spray tops of both patties and bake for 5 minutes per side or until outsides are golden and insides are hot. Serve immediately.
