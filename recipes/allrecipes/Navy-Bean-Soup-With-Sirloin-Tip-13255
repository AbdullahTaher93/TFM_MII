In a large stock pot, brown sirloin, celery, onion, and garlic in olive oil until onions are translucent. Add wine, bay leaf, tomatoes, tomato paste, cumin, red pepper flakes, sugar, potatoes, and hot pepper sauce. Bring the mixture to a rapid boil, and then reduce heat. Continue to cook for 30 minutes, or until meat is tender. Stir occasionally to keep meat from sticking to the pan. Stir in navy beans, and heat through. Serve hot, garnished with parsley and cilantro.
