Combine the turkey, water and 2 teaspoons of the poultry seasoning and fold in gently. Shape the mixture into 4 patties and sprinkle remaining poultry seasoning evenly over both sides of the patties. Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat until the oil is almost smoking, about 3-4 minutes. Place the patties in the skillet, cover and cook, turning several times, until the patties are nicely browned on both sides and cooked through. (At least 160 degrees F in the center. Use a meat thermometer to be sure they are fully cooked.) Place on warmed hamburger buns and top with all your favorite hamburger fixings. Note: If you prefer a less seasoned dish, simply cut back the amount of seasoning blend.
