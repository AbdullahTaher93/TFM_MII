To Make the Cannoli Shells: In a large bowl, blend the butter and sugar. Add the egg whites, almond extract, and vanilla; beat to combine. Stir in the flour. Coat 2 baking sheets with nonstick spray. Place 3 mounds of batter (1 tablespoon or 15 mL each) on each sheet; spread each mound into a very thin 4-inch (10-cm) circle. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 6 to 8 minutes, or until set. Using a spatula, gently lift the cannoli off and wrap around thick dowels, a clean broom handle, or cannoli molds. Cool, then slide off the molds. Repeat until the remaining batter is used up. To Make the Ricotta Filling: In a medium bowl, use an electric beater to whip the ricotta with the sugar, orange peel, lemon peel, lime peel, and vanilla. Stir in the chocolate. To assemble, spoon the filling into the cannoli shells. Makes 20 cannoli.
