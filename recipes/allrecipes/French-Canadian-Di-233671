Heat butter in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour beef stock, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce into onion mixture; add bay leaves. Drop in Montreal smoked meat and Canadian bacon one slice at a time. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Use tongs to remove meat from the stock and distribute evenly inside sandwich baguettes. Remove bay leaves; ladle stock into individual bowls for dipping. Serve hot.
