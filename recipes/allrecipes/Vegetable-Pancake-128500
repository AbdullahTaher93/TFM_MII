Place the potatoes in a medium saucepan. Cover with cold water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender when tested with a sharp knife. Drain. Coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Add the onions, mushrooms, and garlic. Cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes, or until the onions and mushrooms are golden. Add the potatoes, zucchini, and carrots. Cook, stirring often, for 3 minutes, or until the zucchini is wilted. Add the flour, parsley, thyme, pepper, and salt. Cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and let cool for 2 minutes. Stir in the egg substitute and bread crumbs. For each pancake, scoop out 1/4 cup (60 mL) of the vegetable mixture and shape into a 1/4 inch-thick (0.6-cm) patty. Wipe out the skillet and coat with cooking spray. Place over medium heat until hot. Add the pancakes and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the bottoms are a deep golden brown. Coat the top of the pancakes with cooking spray and turn over. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until browned. Serve with the chutney and sour cream.
