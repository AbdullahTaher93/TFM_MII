Divide pastry in half and roll each half into a 10-in. circle. Transfer to two ungreased 12-in. pizza pans. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, score pastry into wedges (do not cut through). Brush one pastry with butter and the other with honey. Combine the sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon; sprinkle over butter. Combine pecans and remaining cinnamon; sprinkle over honey. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. Cut along scored lines; immediately remove from pan. Serve warm.
