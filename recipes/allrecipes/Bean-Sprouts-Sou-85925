Pour water into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add bean sprouts and cook for several minutes. Strain (you can use the boiled bean sprouts for salad). Mix rice flour and buttermilk into the bean sprout stock. Add sugar and curry leaf. Season with salt. In a separate pan, heat vegetable oil. Add pepper and cumin and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour mixture over the soup and bring to a boil. Serve hot. Garnish with chopped cilantro.
