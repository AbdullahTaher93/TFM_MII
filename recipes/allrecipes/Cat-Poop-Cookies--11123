Microwave honey on high until bubbly (about 1 minute). Stir in the margarine. Add the egg and mix well. Stir in the flour, cocoa and vanilla. Mix well and chill dough for several hours in the refrigerator. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll chunks of the chilled dough into cylindrical shapes in order to resemble cat poop.
