Place the sausage, corn, potatoes, and dry crab boil seasoning mix in a large pot filled with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Mix in the shrimp, and continue cooking until opaque, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain, season with salt, and serve hot.
