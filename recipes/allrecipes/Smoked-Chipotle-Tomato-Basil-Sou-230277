Heat olive oil in a 2-quart saucepan over low heat; cook and stir garlic until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and increase heat to medium; simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in chicken broth, tomato and clam juice cocktail, bloody mary mix, basil, hot sauce, garlic salt, and black pepper. Partially cover saucepan with lid and simmer until reduced, about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add half-and-half; stir until heated through, about 5 minutes more.
