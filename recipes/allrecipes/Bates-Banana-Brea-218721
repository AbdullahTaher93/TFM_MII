Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large loaf pan. Mash together the brown sugar and 1/2 cup of softened butter until smooth and creamy in a large bowl; beat in the eggs. In a bowl, combine the mashed bananas with lemon juice, and add them to the butter-sugar mixture. Beat in the milk and vanilla extract until smooth. In a bowl, whisk together 2 1/2 cups of flour, baking soda, salt, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Mix the flour mixture into the banana mixture in 2 or 3 increments, beating well after each addition. Scrape the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Mix together the white sugar, 1/3 cup of flour, 1/4 cup of unsalted butter, and 1 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon with a fork until the mixture is crumbly. Spoon the crumble mixture over the loaf. Bake in the preheated oven until the bread is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
