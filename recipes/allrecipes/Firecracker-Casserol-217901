Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the ground beef with the onion in the hot skillet until completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes; drain any excess fat. Stir the black beans, chili powder, cumin, and salt to the beef mixture; cook and stir until hot, about 5 minutes. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Arrange the tortillas atop the beef mixture. Mix the tomatoes with green chile peppers and cream of mushroom soup together in a bowl; spread over the tortillas. Top with the Cheddar cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and the cheese is melted completely, 25 to 30 minutes.
