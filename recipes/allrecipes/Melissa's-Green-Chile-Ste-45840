Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Crumble beef into pot and cook, stirring frequently, until well-browned. Drain excess fat, and return to the stove. Add potatoes, stewed tomatoes, green chilies, onion, and water to the pot with the beef, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 1 hour to blend flavors. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve.
