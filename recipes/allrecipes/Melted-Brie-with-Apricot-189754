Mix jam, orange peel, brandy (or orange juice), lemon juice and cinnamon in a shallow microwave-safe serving dish just large enough to hold the Brie. Cover apricot sauce and heat in a microwave oven at full power until sauce begins to bubble, about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Set Brie in apricot sauce. Return to microwave oven and cook, uncovered, until the cheese is hot and slightly melted, about 1 minute; check at 20-second intervals. Be sure to watch and not overcook the Brie. Place baguette slices on a platter and serve.
