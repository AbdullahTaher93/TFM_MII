In a large saucepan over medium heat, cook cottage cheese and butter until butter is melted. Cool to 110 degrees F to 115 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add eggs, sugar, onion, dill, salt, baking soda and cottage cheese mixture. Add 3 cups of flour; beat until smooth. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Form into 24 balls; place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan that has been sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes.
