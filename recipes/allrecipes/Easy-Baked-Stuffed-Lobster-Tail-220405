Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking pan with aluminum foil. Combine cooked lobster meat, bread crumbs, butter, Worcestershire sauce, and salt in a bowl. Fill the empty lobster tails with stuffing and brush with olive oil. Place stuffed lobster tails in the prepared baking pan; bringing the edges of the foil over the tails to cover. Bake until stuffing is completely cooked, about 50 minutes.
