In a 5-quart pot, combine chicken broth, canned tomatoes (including juice), bell peppers, potatoes, onion, tomato sauce, garlic, cinnamon, coriander, cumin, salt, pepper, and sugar; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook uncovered until potatoes are barely tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in Mann's Vegetable Medley, garbanzo beans, zucchini and lemon juice. Increase heat to high and return to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook partially covered, until potatoes are tender; about 10 minutes. Serve warm with couscous and sprinkle with chopped mint.
