Season catfish with Cajun seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Refrigerate fillets 1 to 3 hours. Mix saltine crackers and almonds in a large, wide bowl. Stir milk, beaten eggs, and garlic together in a separate bowl. Soak the catfish fillets in the milk mixture for 5 to 10 minutes. Heat peanut oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Gently press the catfish fillets into the cracker mixture to coat completely; shake to remove any loose breading. Fry fillets in hot peanut oil until cooked through and floats atop the oil, about 5 minutes.
