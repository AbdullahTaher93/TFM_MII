Whisk oil, lemon juice, garlic, parsley, and red pepper flakes together in a large bowl; add shrimp and marinate, about 15 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove shrimp from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Cook shrimp and sausage on the preheated grill until cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes.
