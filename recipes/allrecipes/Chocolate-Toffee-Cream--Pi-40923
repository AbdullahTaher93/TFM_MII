Place chocolate in a small bowl, set aside. Microwave 1/2 cup cream for 1-1/2 minutes on High (100%). Pour hot cream over chocolate, let stand 5 minutes, then stir until smooth. Using an electric mixer, beat cream cheese, brown sugar and vanilla in a medium bowl until smooth. Add remaining cream and gently beat in chocolate mixture. Fold in 1/2 cup of chocolate covered toffee bits. Pour the filling into crust. Spread 2 cups whipped topping over filling, top with remaining toffee bits, and place in refrigerator.
