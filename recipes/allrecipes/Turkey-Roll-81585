Soften the cream cheese by letting it sit out for an hour or by zapping it in the microwave for a few seconds. Dice the walnuts and celery into fairly small bits. You can try using a food processor if yours will actually dice and not puree. Blend together the cream cheese and the blue cheese. Add the walnuts and celery and stir together. Layout some paper towels to work on. Place several slices of turkey on the paper towels. It is easier to make several at a time instead of one after another. At the shorter end of the turkey slices place about 2 heaping tablespoons of the filling in a log shape about the size of a roll of dimes. Be sure the filling goes evenly across the small end. Carefully roll up the turkey slice, spending some time at the beginning to be sure to make a uniform thickness. When each is completely rolled up, check the ends and pack in any filling that is coming out or add more filling to the ends; again to assure uniformity. Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour (or overnight) before slicing. This will make it easier to slice without the filling gushing out. Use a serrated knife and be sure to cut carefully to keep the shape intact. First cut each roll in half then each of those in half. Display the rolls on a platter with the cut ends up.
