Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Generously coat baking sheet with cooking spray. Place waffles on baking sheet. Spoon egg over waffles, spreading to fill cavities. Bake in 400 degrees F oven until egg is set and waffles are crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Top one waffle with cheese. Cover with remaining waffle and press together. Let stand 1 minute to allow cheese to melt.
