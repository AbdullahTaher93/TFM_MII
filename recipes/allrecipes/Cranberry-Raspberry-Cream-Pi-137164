Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Make pie crust as directed on box for One-Crust Baked Shell using 9-inch glass pie pan. Bake 9 to 11 minutes or until light golden brown. Cool completely, about 25 minutes. In small bowl with electric mixer, beat whipping cream on high speed until stiff peaks form. In medium bowl with mixer, beat cream cheese and powdered sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy. Gradually fold in whipped cream. Gently stir in 1 tablespoon orange juice. If necessary, add remaining orange juice, 1 teaspoon at a time, until desired spreading consistency (mixture should be somewhat stiff). Spoon and spread filling into cooled baked shell. Refrigerate while preparing topping. In 2-quart saucepan, mix cranberry sauce, preserves and orange peel. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, just until preserves melt. Cool completely, about 30 minutes. Carefully spread topping over filling. Sprinkle pecans in 2-inch-wide strip around outside edge of pie. Refrigerate until firm, 3 to 4 hours. Store in refrigerator.
