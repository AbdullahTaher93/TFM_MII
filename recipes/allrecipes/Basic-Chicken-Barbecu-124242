In a small saucepan, combine the first seven ingredients. Bring to a boil; boil for 2 minutes. Allow to cool to lukewarm. Reserve 1/2 cup for basting; cover. Place chicken in a large resealable plastic bag or glass 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Pour remaining marinade over chicken. Cover or close bag and refrigerate at least 4 hours. Drain, discarding marinade. Grill, covered, over low coals, turning and brushing with reserved marinade, for 50-60 minutes or until juices run clear.
