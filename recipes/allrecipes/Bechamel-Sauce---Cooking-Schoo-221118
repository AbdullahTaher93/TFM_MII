Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; whisk in flour and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture is smooth, bubbling, and is a light golden color, 5 to 7 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high; whisk in 1/2 cup milk until smooth. Slowly add the remaining milk, whisking constantly. Bring mixture to a gentle simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and continue simmering until sauce is smooth, about 10 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Add salt, white pepper, and nutmeg to sauce; stir to combine.
