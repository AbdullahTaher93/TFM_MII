Preheat broiler and turn exhaust fan on. Season fish with salt and pepper and place on a pan lined with aluminum foil. Mix vinegar, honey, mustard, broth and ginger in a small bowl; set aside. Place fillets in oven and broil until lightly golden and fish flakes, about 6 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over high heat and add sauce to the hot skillet. Simmer until reduced by almost half, about 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in butter to form a smooth sauce. Remove from heat and stir in green onions. Spoon sauce over each portion of fish and serve immediately.
