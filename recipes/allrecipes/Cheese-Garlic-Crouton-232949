Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Put bread cubes in a large bowl; drizzle with melted butter. Toss to evenly coat. Spread onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until croutons are crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Mix Parmesan, salt, paprika, and garlic powder into a bowl; sprinkle over croutons. Toss to coat.
