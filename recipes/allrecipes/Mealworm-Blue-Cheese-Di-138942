Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add mealworms and cook until puffed and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Spread out onto a plate and place into the refrigerator to chill until cold, about 20 minutes. Mix together cream cheese and blue cheese until smooth; season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in blue cheese salad dressing. Roughly chop mealworms into 1/4 inch pieces. Fold into dip. Refrigerate dip for 2 hours before serving.
