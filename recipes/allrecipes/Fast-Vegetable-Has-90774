Melt olive oil in a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan. Tilt pan to coat bottom evenly. Brown the potato, onion, and carrot over medium heat, about 5 minutes. Mix corn into the hash, then lay apple slices around the edges. When slices brown, turn them over, but don't mix into the rest of the hash until the second apple side browns, 3 to 5 more minutes. Scatter spinach and cabbage over hash and turn with a wide spatula to mix. Cook until spinach leaves are bright green and limp, about 2 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Top with fried eggs if desired.
