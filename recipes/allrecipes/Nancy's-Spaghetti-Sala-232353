Mix tomatoes, Cheddar cheese, cucumbers, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, red onion, black olives, and Italian seasoning together in a large bowl. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and run under cold water. Toss spaghetti with tomato mixture; fold in chicken. Pour salad dressing over salad; toss to coat. Refrigerate until flavors have blended, about 2 hours.
