Pound the steaks out to 1/2 inch thickness. Coat steaks lightly with flour seasoned with salt and pepper. Dip steaks into lightly-beaten eggs, then coat with combined breadcrumbs and parsley, pressing on firmly. Place steaks on to tray, and refrigerate until ready to cook. In a large frying pan, heat 1/4 cup butter and oil over medium-high heat. Cook steaks until golden brown, and cooked to desired doneness. Remove from pan, and keep warm. In a metal bowl, whisk together egg yolks, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and mustard. Place the bowl over simmering water, and stir until sauce is thick and creamy. Whisk in the remaining 1/2 cup softened butter, and remove from heat. Place steaks onto serving plates, place two slices of avocado on each steak, and spoon the Mustard Sauce over each one.
