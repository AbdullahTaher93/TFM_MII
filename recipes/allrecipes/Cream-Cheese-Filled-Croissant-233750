Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking dish. Stir cream cheese, yogurt, and sugar together in a bowl until smooth. Fold strawberries into cheese mixture. Separate crescent roll dough into 8 triangles. Spoon cream cheese mixture into the middle of each triangle and roll dough around the filling, starting at the smallest end. Pinch to seal and place in the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and golden-brown, 13 to 15 minutes.
