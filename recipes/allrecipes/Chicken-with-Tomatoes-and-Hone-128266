In a 5-quart (5-L) nonstick Dutch oven or pot over medium-high heat, combine tomatoes, onion, garlic, cinnamon, ginger, and pepper. Stir in chicken and bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until chicken is very tender and cooked through, about 40 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate and keep it warm. Increase heat to high and boil sauce, stirring often, until it is very thick and tomatoes begin to caramelize. Reduce heat to low and stir in honey. Stir in chicken. In a 2-quart (2-L) saucepan over medium-high heat, bring broth and raisins to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in couscous. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork and serve with chicken mixture.
