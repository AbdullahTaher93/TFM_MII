Toast raisin bread in a toaster oven until lightly brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Spread peanut butter onto toasted bread. Top 1 slice with banana; top other slice with chocolate chips. Cover banana and chocolate chips with ricotta cheese. Sprinkle sugar and cinnamon on top. Toast in the toaster oven just until cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Sandwich slices together.
