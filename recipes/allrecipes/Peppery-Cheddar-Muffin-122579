In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, pepper and salt. Combine the egg, buttermilk, oil and honey; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in cheese. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 18-22 minutes or until muffins test done. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
