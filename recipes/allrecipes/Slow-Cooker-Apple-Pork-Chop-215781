Heat the canola oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and brown outsides of the pork chops thoroughly, about 5 minutes per side. Mix together the apple juice, cider vinegar, chicken broth, brown sugar, meat tenderizer, garlic powder, nutmeg, ginger, and black pepper in a slow cooker, stirring until the brown sugar has dissolved. Place the pork chops into the liquid. Top the chops with apple, onion, and cabbage. Set the cooker on Low; cook 4 to 5 hours, turning the chops over in the sauce once or twice. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
