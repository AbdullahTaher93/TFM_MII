For the Cheesecake: Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Wrap the bottom and sides of a 7-inch spring form pan with aluminum foil. Combine crust ingredients in small bowl. Press into pan. Set aside. Beat cream cheese and SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener in the bowl of an electric mixer. Add eggs, one at a time, and continue to beat slowly until smooth. Scrape down sides of bowl. Add sour cream and vanilla and mix well. Gently fold in strawberries. Pour filling into the crust lined spring form pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Place cheesecake into a large roasting pan. Pour boiling water into the roasting pan until the water reaches halfway up the sides of the spring form pan. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes (cheesecake will still jiggle in center). Allow to cool for 30 minutes and then place in refrigerator to cool completely. For the Topping: Mix all ingredients together. Refrigerate for 15 minutes. Stir and serve with cheesecake.
