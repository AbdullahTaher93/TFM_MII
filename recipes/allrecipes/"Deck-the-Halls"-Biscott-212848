Melt the chocolate in a bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. Stir until chocolate is 3/4 melted. Remove from water and continue stirring until all the chocolate has melted. Using a table knife, spread half the biscotti with the chocolate and set it on the baking sheet lined with parchment. Sprinkle with M&M'S(R) Brand Chocolate Candies and set aside until the chocolate hardens. For a gift: Wrap 2 to 4 biscotti in a piece of cellophane, and tie it closed with a piece of curling ribbon.
