Shape the beef into 6 (1/2-inch thick) burgers. Cook the burgers in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until well browned on both sides. Pour off any fat. Stir the soup and water in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until desired doneness. Top the burgers with the cheese and cook until the cheese is melted. Serve the burgers and sauce on the rolls. Top with the bacon and onion.
