In a small, rimmed baking pan, spread almonds in a single layer. Toast in a 400 degrees F oven, stirring often, 5 to 10 minutes or until golden. Let cool; set aside. Wash chicken pieces and pat dry. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and paprika. In a shallow oiled baking pan, arrange, skin side down. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven for 30 minutes. Turn skin side up and bake another 15 to 20 minutes or until browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Meanwhile, in a 10- to 12-inch frying pan, melt butter over medium heat. Add onions, separating into rings, and cook slowly, stirring often, until onions are limp and golden, about 30 minutes. The onions should not brown during the first 15 minutes; if they do, reduce heat. Sprinkle in the brown sugar and cinnamon and stir to blend. On a serving plate, place chicken pieces and cover with the cooked onions. Sprinkle with toasted almonds. Serve with lemon wedges to squeeze over onions and chicken.
