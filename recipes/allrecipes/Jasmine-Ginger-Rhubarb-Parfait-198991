In a medium saucepan, bring 1 cup water to a boil. Remove from heat and add tea. Cover and let steep 5 minutes, then discard tea bags or strain out loose tea. Add rhubarb, SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, and gingerroot, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 8 to 10 minutes, or until rhubarb is just tender. Stir in pepper and let cool slightly. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to 3 days. Combine yogurt, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, vanilla, and cinnamon. Divide 1/3 of yogurt mixture equally among four parfait glasses. Divide 1/2 of rhubarb mixture equally among glasses, spooning it over yogurt. Repeat layers, ending with final third of yogurt mixture. Sprinkle each with 1/4 of the granola.
