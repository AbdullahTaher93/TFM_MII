In a medium stainless-steel saucepan, heat the vinegar over moderate heat. Add the red cabbage and toss until it is starting to wilt, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the cabbage to a medium glass or stainless-steel bowl and toss with the carrots, mayonnaise, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper. Heat the broiler. Put the bread on a baking sheet and broil, turning once, until crisp on the outside but still slightly soft in the center, about 3 minutes in all. Sandwich the turkey, sliced tomato, and slaw between pieces of toast.
