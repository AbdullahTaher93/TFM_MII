Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sprinkle ribs with garlic salt and place into a roasting pan. Stir ketchup, vinegar, sugar, celery salt, chili powder, salt, dry mustard, paprika, and black pepper together in a bowl; pour over the ribs. Cook, basting with the pan drippings every half-hour, until the meat pulls away easily from the bone, about 90 minutes.
