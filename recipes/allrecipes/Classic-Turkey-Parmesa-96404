Heat oven to 350 degrees. Beat together eggs and milk in a shallow pie plate or dish; place bread crumbs in another pie plate. Combine flour, salt and pepper in a plastic or paper bag. Add turkey slices to bag one at a time; shake to coat lightly with seasoned flour. Dip in egg mixture, letting excess drip off; roll in crumbs to coat lightly. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add garlic cloves; cook 1 minute. Push garlic to edges of skillet. Add turkey slices to skillet in batches (do not crowd) and cook 3 minutes per side or until golden brown and no longer pink in center. Transfer turkey as it is cooked to a 13 x 9-inch baking dish. Repeat with remaining turkey adding additional oil to pan as necessary. Discard garlic; add spaghetti sauce to same skillet. Simmer 2 minutes or until heated through. Spoon over turkey; top with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Bake about 12 minutes or until turkey is hot and cheese has melted. Sprinkle with basil, if desired.
