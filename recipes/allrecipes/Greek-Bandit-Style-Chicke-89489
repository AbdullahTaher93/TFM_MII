Mix the garlic and olive oil, and brush on the chicken. Season with salt and pepper. Put each chicken breast in the center of a square of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Top each breast with 1/3 cup of diced potatoes, one tablespoon of crumbled feta, two slices of lemon and a sprig of oregano. Wrap the foil around the breasts to create a packet. Put the packets on the grill over moderate heat, cover the grill, and cook for 10 to 15 minutes or until the internal temperature of the chicken is at least 165 degrees F.
