Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook tri-colored pasta at a boil until tender yet slightly firm, about 10 minutes. Drain the pasta and rinse in cold water until chilled; drain again. Transfer the pasta to a very large salad bowl and toss with olive oil until coated. Mix broccoli florets, artichoke hearts, asparagus, parsley, spinach, and olives into the pasta until thoroughly combined. Stir Parmesan cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream, red wine vinegar, ranch dressing mix, black pepper, and salt together in a bowl until smooth. Pour the dressing over the pasta mixture and toss to coat. Cover bowl and refrigerate for 12 hours to blend flavors before serving.
