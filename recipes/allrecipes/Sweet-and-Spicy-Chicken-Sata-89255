In a medium bowl, stir together the sweetened condensed milk, teriyaki sauce, vinegar and curry paste. Coat chicken with the sauce, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 1/2 hours. Preheat a grill or broiler for high heat. Remove chicken from the marinade and thread onto skewers. Discard remaining marinade. Grill or broil chicken for 3 minutes per side, or until cooked through.
