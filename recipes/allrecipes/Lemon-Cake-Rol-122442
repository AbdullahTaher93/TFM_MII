In a mixing bowl, beat eggs and sugar until thick and smooth. Add water. Combine flour, baking powder and salt; stir into egg mixture just until moistened. Line a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan with waxed paper; grease the paper. Spread batter evenly in pan. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched in center. Cool cake in pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Turn cake out onto a kitchen towel. Dust with confectioners' sugar. Gently peel off the waxed paper. Beginning with short side, roll up cake, jelly-roll style. Cool completely on a wire rack. For filling, in a saucepan, combine sugar, flour, egg, water and lemon juice. Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture comes to a boil. Cook and stir 1 minute longer until thickened. Remove from the heat; cool to room temperature. Unroll cake; spread cooled filling to within 1 in. of edges. Roll up again. Cover and chill for 1-2 hours before serving. Store in the refrigerator.
