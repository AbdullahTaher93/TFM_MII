In a skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Add beans, tomatoes, rice, water, green pepper and seasonings; mix well. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat. Sprinkle with the corn chips and cheese. Cover and let stand for 3 minutes or until cheese is melted.
