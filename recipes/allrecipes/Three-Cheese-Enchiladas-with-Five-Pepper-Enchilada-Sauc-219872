To Make the Sauce: Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Add the onion and the serrano pepper and saute 5 minutes or until soft. Add all the pepper powders (chipotle, cayenne, paprika and chili) along with the garlic and saute for 1 minute. Add the diced tomatoes and the other ingredients. Bring it all to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer for at least 30 minutes. To Make the Enchiladas: Heat the Melt in a fry pan over medium heat. Add one tortilla at a time, flipping and cooking it in the oil until it softens and goes limp. Do not overcook or the tortilla will turn crispy. Take out each tortilla and proceed with the next until all dozen are softened. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Combine all the cheeses in one bowl. Place a small amount of cheese in each tortilla. Place the enchiladas in a 13 by 9 baking dish coated with cooking spray. Pour the enchilada sauce over them and bake at 350 for 30 minutes or until thoroughly heated.
