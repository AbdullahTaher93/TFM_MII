Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add sausage and ham hocks, and cook for 10 to 15 minutes (to reduce the amount of fat). Drain, and set aside. In a large pot, arrange potatoes, rutabaga, turnips, carrots and onions. Quarter cabbage with core intact, and add to pot. Season with salt and pepper. Place sausage and ham hocks on top. Pour in water. Seal pot with aluminum foil, then cover with a tight fitting lid. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 30 minutes, or until vegetables are tender.
