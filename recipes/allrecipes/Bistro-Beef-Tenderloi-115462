Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Tie kitchen string around tenderloin in three places so it doesn't flatten while roasting. Rub the tenderloin with oil; pat on salt and pepper. Place in a large roasting pan. Roast until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the tenderloin registers 140 degrees F for medium-rare, about 45 minutes, turning two or three times during roasting to ensure even cooking. Transfer to a cutting board; let rest for 10 minutes. Remove the string. Place herbs on a large plate. Coat the tenderloin evenly with mustard; then roll in the herbs, pressing gently to adhere. Slice and serve.
