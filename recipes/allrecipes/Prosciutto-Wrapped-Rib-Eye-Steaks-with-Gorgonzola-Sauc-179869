Trim off and discard any fat around edges of steaks. Lightly season each with pepper. Carefully wrap a piece of prosciutto crosswise around each steak; press prosciutto slightly onto meat so it sticks. Heat oil in a heavy 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook steaks, turning once, until meat is well browned and cooked to your liking, about 8 minutes total for medium-rare. (Be careful-oil splatters during cooking.) Transfer steaks to individual plates and keep warm. Mix together milk, cheese, broth, and rosemary. Add to pan and whisk constantly until cheese melts and sauce thickens slightly, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Drizzle a few spoonfuls over each steak; offer the rest of the sauce on the side, to taste.
