Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9 X 5-inch loaf pan. Dust with flour; tap out excess. Mix together flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Beat together butter and brown sugar at medium speed until light and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in mashed bananas and sour cream. At low speed, beat flour mixture into banana mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, until combined. Stir in coconut. Fold in chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan; smooth top. Bake cake until golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 50-60 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack to cool slightly. Loosen cake by running a metal spatula around sides of pan. Turn cake out onto rack to cool completely. To prepare frosting, mix together confectioners' sugar, lemon juice, and butter until smooth. Spread frosting over top of cake. To garnish, sprinkle with coconut.
