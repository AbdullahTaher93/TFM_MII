Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the potato, and fry for about 10 minutes, then add the jalapeno, onion and garlic. Cook and stir until the potatoes are browned. Crumble in the ground turkey, and season with cumin, salt and pepper. Cook and stir until turkey is cooked through and potatoes are tender.
