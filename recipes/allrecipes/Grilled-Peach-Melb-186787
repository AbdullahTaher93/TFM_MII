Melt raspberry jam in small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring until smooth, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat; let cool until barely warm. Meanwhile, heat grill. Grill peach halves on each side until grill lines appear and peaches have begun to soften, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Spoon peaches into serving dishes, cut side up. Top each with a scoop of ice cream, 2 tablespoons of melted jam and some of the raspberries.
