In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the flour, salt and baking powder. In a large bowl, mix together shortening and sugar until smooth. Then add egg, milk, vanilla, lemon zest and lemon juice. Stir dry ingredients into the batter. Gently fold in blueberries and strawberries. Chill dough for two to three hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Drop teaspoonfuls onto cookie sheet, spacing two inches apart. Sprinkle each cookie with white sugar. Bake for about 13 minutes in the preheated oven, until firm and slightly golden. Cool cookies for approximately five minutes on sheet before moving to cooling rack. Once cooled completely, store in covered plastic container.
