Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place French fries in a large casserole dish. Sprinkle lemon pepper, red pepper seasoning, garlic powder, and chili powder over the French fries, and stir to distribute seasonings evenly. Divide the butter into 4 pats, and place one pat in each corner. Bake French fries until crispy and lightly browned, about 15 minutes.
