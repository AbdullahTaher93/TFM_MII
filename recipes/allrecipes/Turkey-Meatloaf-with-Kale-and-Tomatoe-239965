Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix turkey, cracker crumbs, kale, onion, Cheddar cheese, barbeque sauce, eggs, mustard, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and salt together in a large bowl using your hands. Pat 1/2 of the turkey mixture into a loaf pan. Insert tomatoes into turkey mixture and top with the remaining turkey mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
