Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, stir together 1/4 teaspoon of cocoa and 1/4 cup of sugar. Grease 10 cups of a muffin tin, and sprinkle each cup with some of the sugar mixture to coat the bottom and sides. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, 1/2 cup of sugar, unsweetened cocoa powder, salt, baking soda, and baking powder. Pour in the friendship starter, egg, oil, and vanilla; mix until well blended. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each one about 1/2 full. Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the crown of a muffin comes out clean. Cool in the pans for about 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
