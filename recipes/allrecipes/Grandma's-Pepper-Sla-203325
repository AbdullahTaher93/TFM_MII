Toss the cabbage and bell pepper together in a large bowl. Season the mixture liberally with salt; stir. Allow to sit 45 minutes; drain and return to the bowl. Bring the vinegar and sugar to a boil together in a saucepan. Immediately remove from heat and stir into the cabbage mixture. Add the celery seed; mix thoroughly. Chill completely before serving.
