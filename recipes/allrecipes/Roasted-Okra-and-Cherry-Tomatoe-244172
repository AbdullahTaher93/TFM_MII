Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine okra and tomatoes in a bowl. Drizzle enough olive oil over okra mixture to coat; toss and season with salt. Mix bacon and garlic into okra mixture and transfer to a baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until okra is tender, about 40 minutes. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over okra mixture and bake until cheese melts, about 5 minutes more.
