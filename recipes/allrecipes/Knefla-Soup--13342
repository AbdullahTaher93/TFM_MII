In a large stock pot combine potatoes, onion, carrot, celery, chicken bouillon cubes, parsley, water, salt, pepper and butter. Simmer soup until vegetables become tender. In a separate bowl mix flour, egg, salt and milk. Mix until dough is uniformed and then form into long strips. Cut strips into small pieces. Once vegetables are tender add knefla pieces and let simmer for 30 minutes. Add evaporated milk, stir and serve.
