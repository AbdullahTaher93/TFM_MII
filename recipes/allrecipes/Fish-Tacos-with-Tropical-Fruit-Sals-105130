For the Tropical Fruit Salsa, combine the mango, tomato, cucumber, cilantro, green onion, jalapeno pepper and lime juice in a large mixing bowl. Cover and refrigerate until serving time. Serve with slotted spoon. Wrap tortillas in foil. Place at the edge of the grill. Heat for 10 minutes over medium-hot coals, turning occasionally. Meanwhile, cut fish into 3/4-inch slices; sprinkle with Jamaican jerk seasoning. Place strips in a light greased grill basket. Grill directly over medium-hot coals for 8 to 10 minutes or until fish flakes easily, turning the basket once. Fill each tortilla with spinach or lettuce, fish, and Tropical Fruit Salsa. If desired, serve on spinach leaves.
