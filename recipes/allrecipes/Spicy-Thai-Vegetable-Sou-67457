Bring the rice and water to a boil in a pot. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 45 minutes. Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat, and cook the onion, garlic, ginger, and carrots 5 minutes, until tender. Mix in broccoli, red bell pepper, coconut milk, broth, wine, fish sauce, soy sauce, Thai chile peppers, lemon grass, garlic sauce, and saffron. Simmer 25 minutes. Pour soup in batches into a blender or food processor, and blend until smooth and creamy. Return to the pot, and mix in yogurt and cooked rice. Top with cilantro to serve.
