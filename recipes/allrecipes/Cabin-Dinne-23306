Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Saute garlic, onion, bell pepper, parsley, chili powder, cumin, paprika, turmeric, salt and pepper, until onions are tender. Stir in kidney beans and some of the reserved liquid until desired consistency. Stir in tomato paste and hot sauce. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for an hour, stirring occasionally. Add more bean liquid and/or water if necessary so that beans don't dry out.
