Place sun dried tomatoes in a small bowl. Cover with warm water and let soak for 10 minutes. Drain, chop and set aside. In a large bowl, sift together flour and salt; stir in yeast. Add olive oil, warm water, and chopped sun-dried tomatoes; mix well. Knead on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Cover dough and let relax for 10 minutes. Roll dough into a rectangle approximately 7x11 inches. Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and make about 20 deep impressions in the dough with your fingers. Cover with plastic and leave in a warm place until doubled in size, about 40 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Brush dough with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt, basil, and thyme. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
