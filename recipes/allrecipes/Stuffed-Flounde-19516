Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large casserole dish or a baking sheet lined with tin foil. Heat butter over medium-low heat in a large saucepan. Stir in onion, green onions, bell pepper, celery and garlic. Cook slowly, stirring occasionally until onions are soft. Remove pan from heat and stir in shredded crabmeat, seasoning, bread crumbs, salt and pepper. Rub flounder skin and cavity with butter. Stuff with crab mixture and place in prepared pan. Bake for 30 minutes, or until flesh is firm and white at the thickest part of the fish.
