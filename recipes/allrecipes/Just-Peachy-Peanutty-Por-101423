Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a 15x10x1inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray. In small saucepan, melt together peanut butter and jam over low heat; remove from heat. Add pork and toss to coat. In a large resealable bag, combine coconut, cracker crumbs, curry powder, ginger and pepper; shake well to blend. Add pork to bag, a few pieces at a time; shake to coat.* Place pork in prepared pan and bake 8 minutes. Turn and bake 8 minutes more, until coconut is nicely toasted. Serve with hot rice or couscous and chutney, if desired.
