Bring chicken broth to a boil in a large Dutch oven. Add Yukon gold and sweet potatoes, bring back to a boil, and turn heat to medium-low. Simmer until tender, 10 to 20 minutes. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Add leeks; cook and stir until leeks are soft, about 5-10 minutes. Do not allow the leeks to brown. Stir leek and ham mixture into potatoes and broth. Add half-and-half; season to taste with salt and ground black pepper.
