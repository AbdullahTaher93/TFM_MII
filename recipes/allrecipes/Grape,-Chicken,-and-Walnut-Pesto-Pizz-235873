Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread pizza dough evenly onto a pizza pan. Bake pizza dough in preheated oven until slightly cooked, about 8 minutes. Spread pesto onto pizza crust in a thin layer, leaving edges exposed. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over pesto layer; add chicken. Arrange grapes, cut-side up, around the crust. Sprinkle walnuts over pizza and season with black pepper. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bottom of crust is lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
