In a large saucepan, saute stew meat and onions in oil. Add the diced tomatoes, HERDEZ(R) Salsa Casera, HERDEZ(R) Salsa Verde, chicken broth, salt, pepper, garlic powder and ground cumin. Cover and simmer over low heat until the meat is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. During the last 30 minutes of cooking, add the diced potatoes. To serve, spoon stew into warm bowls and serve with warm flour tortillas on the side.
