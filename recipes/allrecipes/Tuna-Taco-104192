Preheat grill to high (about 500 degrees F). Season tuna with Morton(R) Nature's Seasons(R) Seasoning Blend, gently pressing the spices into the fish to adhere. Grill tuna for 1 to 2 minutes per side, until just rare, or longer for desired doneness. Remove from grill, cool slightly and thinly slice. To assemble the taco place about 1/4 cup lettuce into the bottom of each taco shell. Top each taco with salsa and a few slices of grilled tuna. Serve immediately with a wedge of fresh lime.
