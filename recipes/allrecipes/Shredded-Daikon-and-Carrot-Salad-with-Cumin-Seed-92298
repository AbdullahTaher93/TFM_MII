In a medium bowl, mix daikon, carrots, cilantro, lemon juice, sugar, and salt. Let stand for 15 to 30 minutes, so the flavors combine and juices accumulate. Pour off juices and discard. Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat, add cumin seeds, and fry for about 15 seconds or until fragrant (don't let them burn). Immediately pour cumin seeds and hot oil over salad; stir to combine. Serve at once.
