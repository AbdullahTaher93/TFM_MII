In small bowl, combine 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, the cumin and pepper; rub on chicken. In large non stick skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add chicken; cook, turning occasionally, until no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in medium bowl, combine Avocado, tomato, cucumber, onion, cilantro, lime juice and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Serve over with whole grain couscous or rice, if desired.
