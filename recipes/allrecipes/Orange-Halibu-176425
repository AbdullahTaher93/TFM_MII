Pit and peel avocado and cut into 1/4-inch cubes. With a sharp knife, cut and discard peel and white pith from orange. Cut between membranes to release orange segments into a bowl. Meanwhile, rinse halibut and pat dry. Sprinkle lightly all over with salt and pepper. Pour oil into a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over high heat. When hot, add halibut and cook, turning once, until opaque but still moist-looking at the center of the thickest part (cut to test), about 6 minutes total. Spread about 1 teaspoon marmalade over each piece of fish. Mound quinoa on dinner plates. With a spatula, place a piece of fish on top of quinoa and arrange avocado and orange segments over fish. Sprinkle evenly with cranberries and hazelnuts.
