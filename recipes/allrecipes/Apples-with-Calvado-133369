In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the apples and lemon juice and cook for 10 minutes. Season the apples with the salt. Stir in the brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg and cook until the sugar melts, about 2 minutes. Add the brandy and carefully put a lighted long kitchen match to the sauce. When the flames subside, transfer the apples to serving plates and top with ice cream.
