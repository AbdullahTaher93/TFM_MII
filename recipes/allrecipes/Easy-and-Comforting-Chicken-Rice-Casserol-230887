Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Whisk cream of chicken soup, milk, rice, and seasoned salt together in a bowl. Pour into prepared baking dish; add chicken pieces. Cover dish tightly with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, stir, and continue baking until rice is nearly tender, about 60 minutes. Mix peas and carrots into dish and continue baking until rice begins to brown and chicken is cooked through, 15 to 30 minutes more.
