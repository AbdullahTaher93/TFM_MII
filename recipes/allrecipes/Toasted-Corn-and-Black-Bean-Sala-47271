In a large skillet, heat 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil and cook the ham and corn, stirring constantly over high heat, until the ham and corn are both tinged with brown, about 3 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil, red pepper and celery to the pan. Cook, stirring often over medium heat, until the vegetables are just softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in the beans, scallions and green chilies. Stir the cumin and chile powder into the pan, then add the remaining 3 1/2 tablespoons oil, cilantro, and vinegar. Cook, stirring for 30 seconds, tossing to coat with the dressing. Taste, and add salt and pepper as desired, and garnish with thyme sprigs. On a large platter or individual plate, make a bed of romaine or spinach. Spoon warm salad over greens.
