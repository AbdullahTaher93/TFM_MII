In a large pot over medium high heat, saute the sausage for 5 minutes, or until browned and crumbly. Pour in the water, stewed tomatoes, basil, onion soup mix and fresh tomatoes. Bring just to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes. Stir in the tortellini and cabbage. Simmer for 10 more minutes.
