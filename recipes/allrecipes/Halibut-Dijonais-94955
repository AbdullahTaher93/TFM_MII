Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 400 degrees. Coat a foil-lined baking sheet with vegetable cooking spray. Arrange fish fillets on the prepared baking sheet. Combine mayonnaise, mustard, horseradish and lemon juice in a small bowl. Stir in 1/4 cup bread crumbs and 1 tablespoon cheese. Spread mayonnaise mixture evenly over fish. Combine butter, remaining breadcrumbs and remaining cheese in a small bowl; sprinkle over fish. Bake until cooked through, about 18 minutes.
