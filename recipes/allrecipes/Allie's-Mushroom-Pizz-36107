Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place pizza crust on baking sheet. In a small bowl, mix together olive oil and sesame oil. Brush onto pre-baked pizza crust, covering entire surface. Stack the spinach leaves, then cut lengthwise into 1/2 inch strips; scatter evenly over crust. Cover pizza with shredded mozzarella, and top with sliced mushrooms. Bake in preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted and edges are crisp.
