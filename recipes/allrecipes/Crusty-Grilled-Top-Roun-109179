Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. In a medium bowl, mix oil, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper and sugar. Rub mixture all over the roast. Place roast on hot rack; grill, covered, until well seared, 6 to 8 minutes per side. Turn off all but one burner (leave it on high) and transfer roast to cooler side of the grill. Cover and roast until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest section of the roast registers 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) for medium, about 1 1/2 hours.
