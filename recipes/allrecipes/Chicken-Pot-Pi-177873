In a 4- to 5-quart pan over medium-high heat, combine butter, onion, thyme, and bay leaf. Stir often until onion is lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add 1/3 cup water; stir to release browned bits and cook until liquid evaporates. Mix broth with cornstarch. To pan, add chicken, carrots, peas, yogurt, and 2/3 of cornstarch mixture; stir until boiling. Let cool; stir in remaining cornstarch mixture. Remove bay leaf. Pour filling into a 9-inch pie pan or dish. Lay pastry round over filling; fold edges under and flush with pan rim, then flute edges firmly against rim. Pierce top with a fork in several places. Set pie in a 10- by 15-inch baking pan. Brush with egg. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven on the lowest rack until pastry is well browned and filling is hot in center (25 to 30 minutes). If rim browns excessively before center is bubbly, cover rim with foil. Spoon from dish to serve.
