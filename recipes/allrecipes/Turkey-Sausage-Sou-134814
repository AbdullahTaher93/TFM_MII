Spray the bottom of your pot with nonstick cooking spray. Add the onions, garlic, and sausage. Cook over medium heat until the sausage is browned, stirring occasionally. Stir in the broth, lentils, tomatoes (with juice), Worcestershire sauce, and spices. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat. Cover and let it simmer (tiny bubbles) for 15 minutes. In the meantime, wash and chop your vegetables - carrots, celery, and spinach. Add the vegetables to the pot and turn up the heat. Once the soup is boiling, reduce the heat and cover. Let the soup simmer for about 20 minutes while you set the table or kick back with a cold one.
