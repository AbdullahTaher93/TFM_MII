Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Trim potato halves so they sit flat on a baking sheet. Scoop out flesh into a bowl. Transfer potato skins to a baking sheet. Drizzle olive oil on top; season with salt and pepper. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Add potato flesh; cook until soft, about 10 minutes. Strain potato flesh into a bowl and mash with goat cheese, garlic, and rosemary. Fill potato skins with mashed mixture. Wrap a slice of prosciutto around each potato skin. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
