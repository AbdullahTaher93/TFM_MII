In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in applesauce and vanilla. Combine flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg; add to the creamed mixture alternately with milk (the batter will be thick). In an electric skillet or deep-fat fryer, heat oil to 375 degrees F. Drop teaspoonfuls of batter a few at a time into hot oil. Turn with a slotted spoon and fry until golden, about 1 minute on each side. Drain on paper towels; roll in sugar while warm.
