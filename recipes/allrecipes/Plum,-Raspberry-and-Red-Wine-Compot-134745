For compote: Combine plums and raspberries in large bowl. Combine wine, 1 1/2 cups water and sugar in large saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil until reduced to 2 2/3 cups, about 20 minutes. Pour hot wine mixture over plum mixture. Cool. Cover and chill overnight. For vanilla whipped cream: Beat whipping cream, sugar and vanilla extract in large bowl until firm peaks form. (Makes about 2 3/4 cups. Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover and chill.) Spoon fruit mixture into dessert glasses or bowls. Top with cream.
