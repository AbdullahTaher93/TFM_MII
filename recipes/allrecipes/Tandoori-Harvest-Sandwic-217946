Cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate, keeping the drippings in the skillet; reduce heat to medium. Combine the apple, kale, tandoori seasoning, cayenne pepper, and apple cider with the drippings in the hot skillet. Drizzle the oil over the apple mixture; cook and stir until the kale begins to soften, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. Divide the kale mixture between the bottom halves of the dinner rolls. Top with the bacon and the Asiago cheese; finish the sandwiches by topping with the top halves of the rolls.
