Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and return pasta to the pot. While the pasta boils, heat olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms and garlic in hot oil until the mushrooms are softened, about 10 minutes. Drizzle balsamic vinegar into the mushroom mixture while stirring. Stir mushroom mixture into the pasta in the pot; season with pepper and stir. Top with Pecorino Romano cheese and basil.
