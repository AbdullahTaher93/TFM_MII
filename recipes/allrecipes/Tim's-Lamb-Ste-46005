In a large saucepan over medium heat, mix the beef broth, lamb, parsley, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Cover, and cook 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir potatoes, carrots, and onion into the lamb mixture. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook 90 minutes, until all the vegetables are tender. In a small bowl, mix the flour and oil until smooth. Stir into the stew mixture, and cook 5 minutes, until thickened.
