Place ingredients except for the crystallized ginger in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select dough cycle; press Start. At end of cycle, remove dough onto a floured board. Knead dough briefly, shape into a ball, cover and let rest for 15 minutes. Flatten the dough and gently knead in the crystallized ginger. Form into a loaf shape, place in a lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pan. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Just before baking, slash top with a razor or sharp knife. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar if desired. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until bottom of loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Remove bread to a wire rack to cool before serving.
