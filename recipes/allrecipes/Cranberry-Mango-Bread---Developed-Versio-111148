Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, beat together eggs and SPLENDA(R) until smooth. Thoroughly blend in mango puree, orange zest, and canola oil. In a separate medium bowl, sift together flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Blend into the mango mixture. Fold in cranberries. Transfer to a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Bake 55 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack.
