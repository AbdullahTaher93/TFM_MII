Stir cranberry sauce, pineapple, brown sugar replacement, ground ginger, and sea salt together in a small saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes. Stir green onion and jalapeno pepper into the cranberry sauce mixture; transfer to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Chill sauce in refrigerator until cold, at least 30 minutes.
