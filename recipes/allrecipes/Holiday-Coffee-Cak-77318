Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In large bowl, beat biscuit mix, 1/4 cup butter, sweetened condensed milk, eggs, sour cream, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon at medium speed until smooth. Pour batter into a lightly greased 11x7-inch baking dish. In a small bowl, stir together brown sugar, chopped pecans, 1 tablespoon melted butter and remaining 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Sprinkle mixture evenly over batter. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool cake in dish on a wire rack 10 minutes, and cut into squares to serve.
