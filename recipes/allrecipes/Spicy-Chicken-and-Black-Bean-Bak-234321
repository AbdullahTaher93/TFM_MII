Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix chicken, red bell pepper, red onion, sour cream, cream cheese, taco seasoning, and salt together in a large bowl. Combine black beans, hot water, and cumin in a separate bowl; roughly mash with a fork until evenly mixed. Layer 3 tortillas into the bottom of a 9x9-inch baking dish. Top tortillas with 1/2 the salsa, 1/2 the black bean mixture, and 1/2 the chicken mixture. Repeat layering with remaining ingredients, ending with chicken mixture. Sprinkle casserole with mozzarella cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
