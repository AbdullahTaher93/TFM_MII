In medium bowl, combine Hidden Valley(R) Organic Ranch dressing, chipotle chile, adobo sauce, honey, lime juice and salt. Stir well. Assemble 4 skewers from ingredients in following order: onion, chicken, mango, chicken, pineapple, chicken, onion. Repeat twice more to complete the skewer. Lay skewers in shallow pan. Pour 1/4 cup of marinade into small dish and set aside. Brush remaining marinade over skewers, coating all sides evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate about an hour. Light charcoal fire and let burn until charcoal is covered with gray ash but still very hot. Or, if using gas grill or grill pan, set on medium-high heat. When grill grates or grill pan are quite hot, remove skewers from marinade (discard excess marinade in pan); brush lightly with oil. Lay oiled skewers on hot grates and grill until marked on all four sides and cooked through, 10 - 12 minutes total. Arrange skewers on serving platter, drizzle with reserved 1/4 cup marinade, garnish with chopped cilantro and serve with lime wedges.
