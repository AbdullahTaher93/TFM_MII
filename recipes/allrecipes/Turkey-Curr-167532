Place onion and bell pepper in a food processor and pulse just until chopped. Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion-pepper mixture and cook, stirring, until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Meanwhile, return the work bowl to the processor. With the motor running, drop garlic, ginger and jalapeno through the feed tube and process until finely chopped. Add the garlic mixture to the onions, along with curry powder and coriander; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add broth, coconut milk and bananas. Bring the mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to low; cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the bananas are very soft, about 10 minutes. Mash the bananas to incorporate them into the sauce. Add turkey, peas, cilantro and lime juice and simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
