Rinse turkey, pat dry, and cut into 8 equal pieces (no more than 1 1/2 inches thick). Mix minced cilantro, pepper, and 6 cloves of the minced garlic; pat mixture over turkey pieces, covering all sides. Place pieces well apart in a shallow, rimmed baking pan. Bake in a 500 degrees F oven until meat is lightly browned on outside and no longer pink in center; cut to test (10 to 12 minutes). Meanwhile, in a food processor or a blender, combine remaining 2 cloves minced garlic, tomato sauce, vinegar, sugar, and raisins; whirl until raisins are chopped. Offer raisin sauce to spoon over turkey to taste.
