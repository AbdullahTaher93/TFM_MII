Place fresh pumpkin in a small pan and fill with water. Boil pumpkin until soft, about 15 minutes. Drain and puree pumpkin. Measure 2 cups of pumpkin puree for use in this recipe. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans. In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and vegetable oil. Stir in the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition. Stir in the 2 cups pumpkin puree, then stir in the vanilla, almond, butter extract, and lemon extract. In a separate bowl, sift together all-purpose flour, wheat flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and mace. Stir flour mixture into pumpkin mixture; pour into prepared pans. Bake in preheated oven for 50 to 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool loaf in the pan for 15 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
