Pat potato wedges with paper towels to remove extra moisture and reduce splattering when frying. Add wedges to deep fryer when the canola oil has reached the appropriate frying temperature of 375 degrees F. Remove potato wedges from the canola oil with slotted spoon when they reach a golden brown color, drain them on paper towels, and season to taste. To prepare batter, mix together beer, egg, milk, and canola oil. Add baking powder, cayenne pepper, salt and flour all at once, mixing only enough to dampen the dry ingredients. Coat fish pieces in flour before dipping fish in batter and place in 375 degrees F canola oil to deep fry. Cook until golden, about 6 minutes. Remove from canola oil with slotted spoon, drain on paper towels. Serve immediately.
