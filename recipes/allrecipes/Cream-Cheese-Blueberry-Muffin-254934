Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease muffin cups with cooking spray or line with paper muffin liners. Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together with a sifter into a bowl. Combine sugar, cream cheese, table cream, eggs, and 1/4 cup vegetable oil plus 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a large bowl. Fold flour mixture into sugar mixture until batter is smooth. Stir in blueberries. Scoop batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
