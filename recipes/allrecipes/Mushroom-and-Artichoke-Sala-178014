Cook artichoke hearts according to package directions; drain and set aside until cool. Then, place in a large bowl and add mushrooms. In a small bowl, stir together oil, lemon juice, vinegar, garlic, salt, pepper, oregano, thyme, and bay leaf. Pour over artichoke mixture and stir lightly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or until next day. Just before serving, remove and discard bay leaf. Cut tomatoes in half and stir lightly into salad. Sprinkle with parsley.
