Wrap potatoes in paper towels. Microwave for 10 minutes on high, until firm but tender. Cut into 1-inch cubes. Cut 6, 12-inch squares of heavy duty aluminum foil. Spread potatoes evenly among the foil pieces. Season with salt and pepper. Mix onions, BUSH'S Country Style Baked Beans and Worcestershire sauce in a bowl and divide mixture among foil packets. Dot each packet with butter. Seal potatoes in foil and place on the grill. Cook 20 minutes over indirect heat.
