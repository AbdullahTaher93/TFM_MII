In a heavy saucepan, melt butter. Stir in sugar, milk and eggs. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in coconut, nuts and cracker crumbs. Line a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan with 12 whole crackers. Spread with the coconut mixture. Top with remaining crackers; press down gently. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, combine frosting ingredients; beat until smooth. Break each cracker into four portions; spread with frosting.
