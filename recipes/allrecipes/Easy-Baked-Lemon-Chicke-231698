Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange chicken breasts in a large baking dish. Pour water, olive oil, and lemon juice over chicken; sprinkle with bread crumbs, garlic powder, parsley, and paprika. Season with salt and pepper. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil and cut a few slits in foil to vent. Bake chicken breasts in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).
