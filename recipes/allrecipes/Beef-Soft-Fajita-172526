Toss sliced steak with 1/4 cup of the marinade. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook steak until medium rare (about 5 minutes, cut to test doneness). Let stand. Stem, seed, and cut peppers lengthwise in half. Arrange peppers on a rack in a broiler pan. Baste with remaining marinade. Broil 4 to 6 inches from heat until peppers are charred, about 5 to 7 minutes (check often), and remove when done. Combine remaining oil, onion, chili powder, and salt to taste in a 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Stir often until onion is tender, about 7 minutes. Transfer onion mixture to a serving bowl. Cut meat into bite-size pieces, and transfer to a serving bowl. Cut peppers into thin strips, and transfer to a serving bowl. To serve, offer warm tortillas to fill with meat, peppers, onions, cilantro, and sour cream as desired.
