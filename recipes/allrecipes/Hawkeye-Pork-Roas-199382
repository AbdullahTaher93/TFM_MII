Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Season the pork loin evenly with the onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper; place into a roasting pan. Cook until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 90 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
