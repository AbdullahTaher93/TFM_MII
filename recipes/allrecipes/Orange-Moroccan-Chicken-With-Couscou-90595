In a large skillet, preferably nonstick, heat oil over medium high heat. Add onions and saute 1 minute. Add chicken and saute, turning once or twice, until brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in orange juice, wine, cinnamon, allspice, cumin, marmalade and salt. Cover and simmer 5 minutes. Meanwhile, cook couscous as package directs. Remove cover and simmer chicken for 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally, until cooked through and sauce has thickened slightly. Stir in peas and cook until hot, about 2 minutes. Spoon couscous onto plates. Top with chicken and sauce. If desired, garnish with fresh orange slices and parsley.
