Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Combine the sirloin and brisket in a food processor and pulse until ground. Transfer the meat into a large bowl. Add the mayonnaise, shallot, and wild game rub; gently mix. Divide the meat into 4 equal portions; shape the "burgers" into hotdog shapes. Place on preheated grill and close the lid. Cook for 4 minutes. Lift lid; flip burger dogs and close lid. Lightly toast hot dog buns, then set aside. Sear the burger dogs on all four sides for extra char flavor, about 2 1/2 minutes per side for medium, or until internal temperature reaches 140 degrees F. During the final minute of grilling, top each burger dog with a slice of cheese. Transfer burger dogs from the grill to a grill bun. Salt and pepper to taste; serve with your favorite condiments.
