Bring the broth to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Add the barley and return to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes, or until tender. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large saucepot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the scallions and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 minutes, or until the scallions are wilted. Add the greens, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring, for 3 minutes, or until just wilted. Fluff the barley with a fork and stir into the greens.
