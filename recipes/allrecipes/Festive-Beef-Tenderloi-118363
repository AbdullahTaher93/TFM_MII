Place steaks on a greased broiler pan. Broil 3-4 in. from the heat for 8 minutes on each side. Combine cracker crumbs, mayonnaise, parsley, horseradish and pepper. Spread over steaks. Broil 2-6 minutes longer or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F).
