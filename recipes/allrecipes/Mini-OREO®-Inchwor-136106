Stack 8 of the cookies, spreading frosting between cookies to secure. Stand on edge to resemble a worm. Attach remaining cookie to 1 end of the worm with frosting, placing cookie slightly higher than the other cookies to form the 'worm's head.' Add 5 of the candy halves to each side of the worm with the remaining frosting for the 'legs.' Decorate face with frosting, if desired.
