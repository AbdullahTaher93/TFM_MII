Heat the oil in a large skillet; cook and stir the bell pepper in the hot oil until softened slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir the jalapeno peppers, ginger, garlic, and bay leaves into the bell pepper; cook until fragrant, about 2 to 3 minutes more. Season with the coriander, red pepper, turmeric, cumin seeds, cardamom, black pepper, and cinnamon; cook and stir another 2 minutes. Add the tomato slices and raisins to the mixture; continue cooking 3 more minutes. Mix the okra thoroughly into the mixture to coat with the spices. Stir the coconut milk and water together in a small bowl; pour into the mixture. Cover the skillet and cook covered until the okra is tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add water if needed to keep moist. Season with salt. Serve warm.
