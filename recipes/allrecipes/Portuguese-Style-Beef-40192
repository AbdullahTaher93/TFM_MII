In a glass bowl or baking dish, mix together the garlic, red wine, water, hot pepper paste, salt, and white pepper. Add beef cutlets, and turn to coat. Let the beef marinate in the mixture for 10 to 15 minutes. Heat a 10 inch skillet over medium-high heat. Fry 3 of the beef cutlets at a time, for 2 minutes on each side. Remove meat and meat juices to the bowl with the marinade. When all of the meat has been browned and removed back to the marinade, add oil to the skillet, and lower heat to medium. Allow the oil to heat up, then fry the beef again for 2 minutes on each side. Add the red pepper, and fry until fragrant. Drain off oil, and pour the marinade into the pan with the cutlets. Bring to a boil, and cook for 2 minutes. Serve with vegetables and potatoes or fries.
