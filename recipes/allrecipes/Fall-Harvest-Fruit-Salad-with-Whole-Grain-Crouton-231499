Trim crusts from bread slices and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Place bread cubes on a foil-lined baking sheet. Let stand for 2 hours or overnight. Place bread cubes in medium bowl; drizzle with butter and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon. Stir gently until evenly coated. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. Bake 8 to 10 minutes, stirring once, or until crisp. Cool completely. Combine pears, apples, cranberries and lemon juice in serving bowl. Top with nuts and cinnamon-sugar croutons. Serve immediately.
