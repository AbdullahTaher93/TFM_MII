Preheat an outdoor grill on medium heat, and lightly oil the grate. Toss asparagus and olive oil in a bowl until evenly coated. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese and salt onto asparagus until evenly distributed. Place asparagus spears on grill crosswise. Cook until tips are almost blackened, 20 minutes; turning spears over after 10 minutes.
