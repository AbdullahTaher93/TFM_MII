Make a marinade by whisking together the tequila, lime juice, water, 2 tablespoons salt, turbinado sugar, and 1 tablespoon chili powder in a large bowl. Set aside 1/4 cup of the marinade. Add the cod to the remaining marinade; cover and set aside. Stir together the reserved 1/4 cup marinade, black beans, and jalapeno; set aside. Mix together the mayonnaise, sour cream, 1 tablespoon chili powder, cider vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, sugar, and green onions in a large bowl. Add the coleslaw mix and green onion and mix until coated; set aside. Mix together the flour, 1 tablespoon chili powder, baking soda, and 2 teaspoons salt in a shallow dish. Remove pieces of cod from the marinade, shake off the marinade, and coat in the flour mixture. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Gently lie the coated fish in the skillet without crowding the pieces. Cook in the hot oil, turning once, until browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. While frying the cod, heat the black bean mixture in a saucepan over medium heat. Heat the reserved marinade in a separate small saucepan over medium-low heat. Assemble tacos by placing fish in the center of tortilla; top with coleslaw, black beans, and any other desired toppings. Drizzle some of the heated marinade over the fillings and fold the tortilla to close.
