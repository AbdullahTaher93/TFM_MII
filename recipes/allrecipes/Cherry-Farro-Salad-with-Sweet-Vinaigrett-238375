Whisk oil, maple syrup, vinegar, sugar, and salt together in a bowl until dressing is smooth. Cook and stir walnuts in a small skillet over low heat until toasted and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Bring chicken broth, farro, oregano, and basil to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat, cover with a lid, and let sit until all the liquid has been absorbed, about 30 minutes. Transfer farro to a glass bowl and cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes more. Mix walnuts, green apples, dried cherries, and parsley into farro. Drizzle dressing over farro mixture and toss to coat; refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes.
