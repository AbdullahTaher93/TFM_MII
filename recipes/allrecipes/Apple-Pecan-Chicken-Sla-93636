Melt butter in a small frying pan over medium heat. Add pecans and stir occasionally until nuts are a darker brown (about 5 minutes). Drain on paper towels. While nuts are toasting, combine mayonnaise, lemon juice, mustard, sugar, and pepper in a large bowl. Beat to blend smoothly. To dressing, add apple, cabbage, chicken, pimentos, olives, and celery; mix well. Season to taste with salt; sprinkle with pecans.
