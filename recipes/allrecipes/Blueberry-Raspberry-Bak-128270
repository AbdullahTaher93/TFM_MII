Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). In a medium bowl, combine the preserves, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the granulated sugar, the cornstarch, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Add the blueberries and raspberries, and mix gently with a rubber spatula. Transfer the berry mixture to a 9-inch (23-cm) pie plate, cover with foil, and bake for 20 minutes, or until the fruit is hot and bubbly. Remove from the oven and set aside, covered. While the fruit is baking, in a food processor, combine the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Pulse to mix and break up any lumps of sugar. Add the butter or margarine and pulse until very fine crumbs form. Add the buttermilk or yogurt and pulse just until a soft dough forms. On a lightly floured surface, give the dough five kneads. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough to a 7-inch (18-cm) circle. Uncover the fruit and place the dough on top. Sprinkle the surface with the remaining 1 teaspoon (5 ml) granulated sugar. Place the pie plate on a baking sheet. Bake for about 15 minutes, or until the dough is lightly browned and crisp, and the fruit bubbles up along the sides. Transfer to a wire rack to cool briefly. Serve warm.
