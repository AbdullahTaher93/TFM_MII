Heat a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add bacon; fry until crisp, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain bacon in a small colander set over a bowl to catch the drippings. Return 2 Tbs. drippings to the skillet. Add leeks; saute until tender, 5 to 6 minutes longer, then scrape into colander along with the bacon. Prepare filling ingredients and set aside. Grease a 9-inch Pyrex pie plate. Adjust oven rack to center position, and heat oven to 400 degrees. Whisk eggs, milk, mustard, salt, and pep- per. Stir in herb of choice, cheese of choice and prepared filling ingredients. Pour mixture into the prepared pie plate, and bake until just set, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and let rest 5 minutes. Cut into wedges and serve.
