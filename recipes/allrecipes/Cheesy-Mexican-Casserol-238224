Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Stir condensed soup, sour cream, green chilies, and milk together in a large bowl. Add chicken, tortilla pieces, and taco seasoning; stir. Mix tomato and 1 cup Mexican-style cheese blend into chicken mixture. Spread chicken mixture out into the prepared baking dish and cover the dish with aluminum foil. Bake casserole in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Discard aluminum foil. Sprinkle remaining cheese over the top of the casserole and continue baking until cheese melts and casserole is bubbling, 5 to 10 minutes more. Let rest for 5 minutes.
