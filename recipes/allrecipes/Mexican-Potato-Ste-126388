Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground beef. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain. Stir in the diced tomatoes, ranch-style beans, and garlic salt. Bring to a boil; reduce the heat to low. Layer the sliced potatoes evenly over the ground beef mixture; season with salt and black pepper. Cover; simmer until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.
