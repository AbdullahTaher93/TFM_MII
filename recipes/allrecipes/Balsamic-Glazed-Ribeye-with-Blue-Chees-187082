In a small sauce pan heat the Star Balsamic Vinegar and McCormick Rosemary; Simmer and reduce until just thickened. Let cool. Lightly oil a preheated grill. Add the ribeye steak. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on both sides, brushing the balsamic reduction several times on both sides during cooking. Spoon over some of the Wishbone Blue Cheese Dressing and place under a broiler until bubbling and lightly browned. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the Albertsons Elbow Macaroni and cook until just tender, about 10 minutes. Heat the Mezzetta Roasted Garlic Sauce and mix with the macaroni. Serve the steak with a side of the macaroni.
