Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread bread cubes in a single layer over two baking sheets. Bake until slightly dry, about 15 minutes. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook sausage, crumbling coarsely, for about 10 minutes or until evenly brown. Drain off grease, and transfer sausage to a large bowl. Melt butter in the skillet; add leeks, apples, celery, and poultry seasoning. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes. Stir in the rosemary and dried cranberries. Mix leek mixture and bread cubes with sausage in bowl. Lightly mix chicken broth into stuffing to moisten; season with salt and black pepper. Spoon stuffing into turkey, packing loosely. Bake remaining stuffing in a buttered baking dish, covered, at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 45 minutes. Uncover, and bake another 15 minutes to brown top.
