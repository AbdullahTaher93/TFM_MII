Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain and return to pot. Whisk olive oil, lime zest and juice, mint, chives, garlic, nutritional yeast, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Pour over hot pasta; add bean sprouts. Toss to coat. Serve topped with avocado slices and more freshly ground black pepper.
