Heat oil in a large soup kettle over medium-high heat. Cook onions in oil until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in garlic powder, cumin, and oregano; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add turkey; cook until it loses its raw color. Pour in broth and chiles; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for about 10 minutes. In a small bowl, mash the drained contents of one can of beans. Stir all beans and cilantro into soup; simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve topped with crushed tortilla chips and sour cream.
