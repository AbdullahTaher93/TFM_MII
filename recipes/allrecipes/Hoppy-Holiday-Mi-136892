Heat oven to 250 degrees F. Mix pretzels, cookies and peanuts in a large bowl and set aside. Combine sugar, butter and corn syrup in a large saucepan. Boil at medium heat for 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla and baking soda. Mixture will foam. Pour over pretzel mixture and stir to coat. Put in greased 15x10x1-inch pan and bake for 34 minutes. While still warm, break apart and toss with candy-coated chocolate pieces and dried cranberries.
