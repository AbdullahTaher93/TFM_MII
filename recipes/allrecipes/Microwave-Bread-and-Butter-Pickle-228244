Stir sugar and vinegar in a large microwave-safe bowl until sugar has dissolved; mix in salt, mustard seed, celery seed, and turmeric. Stir cucumbers and onion into the pickling mixture. Microwave on high, stirring twice, until cucumber slices are tender and onion is translucent, 7 to 8 minutes. Chill before serving.
