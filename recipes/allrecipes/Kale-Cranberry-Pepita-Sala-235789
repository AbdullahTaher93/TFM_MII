Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute kale and garlic in hot oil until fragrant and kale is bright green, 2 to 3 minutes. Add water to skillet; cook and stir until kale wilts, about 5 minutes more. Drain. Whisk 1/2 cup olive oil, vinegar, orange juice, soy sauce, onion, ginger, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Add kale mixture to bowl and toss until kale is evenly coated. Sprinkle cranberries, pepitas, and almonds over the top. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour, or overnight.
