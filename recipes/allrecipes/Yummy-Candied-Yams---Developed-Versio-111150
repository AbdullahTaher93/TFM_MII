In a large pot over medium heat, place potatoes in water. Top with butter and SPLENDA(R), cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, without stirring, until mixture is thick and syrupy and potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Mixture will thicken slightly as it cools. Remove from heat and serve warm.
