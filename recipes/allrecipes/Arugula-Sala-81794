Make the dressing first by adding the vinegar, oil and herbs in a small jar and shake well. It is best if this can be made an hour or so ahead of time. Rip the arugula and lettuce into bite sized pieces and place in a salad bowl. Cut the pepper in half and remove seeds and membrane. Slice the pepper and add to the salad bowl along with the halved tomatoes. When ready to serve, shake the dressing again and drizzle over salad just enough to coat (you may have extra dressing). Toss and serve.
