Cut the chicken breast in half, and pound until flat. Coat with flour. In a small skillet melt butter/margarine over medium low heat and saute the floured chicken breast on one side for 4 to 5 minutes. Flip chicken breast. Add mushrooms, scallions and salt and pepper to taste. Add cream and mustard, stir all together and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and serve.
