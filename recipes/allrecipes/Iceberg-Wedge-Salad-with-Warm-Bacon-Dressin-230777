Arrange lettuce wedges on serving plates and top each wedge with tomato and green onion pieces. Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels; chop when cool enough to handle. Transfer bacon to a bowl. Dissolve brown sugar with red wine vinegar, salt, and black pepper in the hot skillet over medium heat, whisking until brown sugar has dissolved. Stir bacon into dressing; adjust seasoning. Pour hot bacon dressing over lettuce wedges.
