Remove protective ice glaze from frozen breasts by holding under lukewarm running water about 1 minute. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Wash hands. Heat oil in large nonstick skillet with tight-fitting lid. Add chicken; sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook over medium-high heat until browned, 3 minutes per side. Pour enchilada sauce over chicken. Cover, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook, turning once, 15 minutes. Turn chicken again, smooth-side up; top with chiles and cheese. Cover and cook 2 minutes until cheese melts or juices run clear when thickest part of chicken is pierced or temperature on instant-read thermometer reaches 180 degrees F. Serve with tortillas. (Refrigerate leftovers.)
