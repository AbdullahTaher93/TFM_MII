In a mixing bowl, combine dry cake mix, butter, water and egg; mix well. Press into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 375 degrees for 20-22 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Sprinkle with marshmallows, M&M's and peanuts. Bake 2-3 minutes longer or until the marshmallows begin to melt. Cool on a wire rack before cutting.
