Soak onions in water in a large bowl until the water takes on some of the onion flavor, at least 1 hour. Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned completely, about 10 minutes. Stir onion-and-water mixture, diced tomatoes, and diced tomatoes with green chile peppers with the beef in the pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for about 90 minutes. Stir paprika, chili powder, sugar, seasoned salt, garlic powder, cumin, marjoram, and cayenne pepper into the liquid until dissolved; continue to cook at a simmer for 1 hour more. Stir cornmeal into the chili, 1 tablespoon at a time, simmering for a minute to check consistency before adding the next.
