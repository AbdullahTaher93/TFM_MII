Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Thaw frozen corn and pat dry with paper towels. Line a 15x10x1-inch baking pan with foil; lightly grease the foil. Spread corn in prepared pan. Bake in oven for 10 minutes; stir. Bake 5 minutes more until corn begins to brown. Remove from oven; set aside. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan cook onion and sweet peppers in hot butter over medium heat until tender. In a large screw-top jar combine chicken broth and the flour; cover and shake well. Add broth mixture to saucepan; cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 1 minute more. Add the roasted corn, LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, crab, thyme, and ground red pepper; heat through. Garnish with fresh thyme sprigs, if desired.
