Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion, stir to coat and cover. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring often, until the onion is soft and starting to brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Add leek, garlic and thyme and cook, uncovered, stirring often, until the leek begins to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add sherry and pepper. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring, until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 30 seconds. Stir in broth and chickpeas; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in chives (or scallion greens). Place bread in the bottom of 2 bowls; top with cheese. Ladle the soup over the bread and cheese and serve immediately.
