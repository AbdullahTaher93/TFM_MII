In a small bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt; cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add milk, tossing with a fork until a ball forms. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead 5-6 times. Roll or pat to 1/2-in. thickness; cut with a 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter. Place on a greased baking sheet. Brush tops with 1 tablespoon butter. Bake at 450 degrees F for 9-11 minutes or until golden brown. Brush with remaining butter. Serve warm.
