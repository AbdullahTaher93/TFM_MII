Combine meat, 1-1/4 cups cheese, 1/2 cup chili sauce, onion, tortilla chips, egg and salt. Mix well; shape into a 10 x 5-inch oval loaf on a foil-lined jelly roll pan or shallow roasting pan. Brush remaining 1/4 cup chili sauce over loaf. Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F oven 30 minutes. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup cheese over meatloaf. Continue baking 5 minutes or until cheese is melted and internal temperature of meat is 160 degrees F. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
