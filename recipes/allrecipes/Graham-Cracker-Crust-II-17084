Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and sugar. If desired, set aside 3 tablespoons of mixture for topping pie. Press remaining mixture firmly into bottom and sides of a 9 inch pie pan. Brush surface with beaten egg yolk. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes, until lightly browned.
