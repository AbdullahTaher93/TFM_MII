Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 15x10-inch baking pan with aluminum foil; spray aluminum foil layer with cooking spray. Beat butter and sugar together with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; gradually beat in flour until combined. Fold 3/4 cup chocolate chips and 3/4 cup peanut butter chips into dough. Press dough into the prepared pan; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup chocolate chips and 1/4 cup peanut butter chips. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 25 minutes. Cool in pan for 10 minutes. Remove brittle by lifting aluminum foil out of pan and transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Cut into 24 bars.
