Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil grate. Season one side of each steak with the Italian seasoning, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Lay the steaks with the seasoned-side down on the prepared grill. Cook on grill until the flesh flakes, turning once, 7 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle each steak with lime juice to serve.
