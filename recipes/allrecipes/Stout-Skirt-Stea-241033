Whisk beer, olive oil, vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, and hot sauce together in a glass or ceramic bowl until marinade is smooth. Add steak to marinade and turn to coat. Cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove steak from marinade and shake off any excess. Discard marinade. Cook steak on the preheated grill, turning once, until steak starts to firm and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 5 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Let rest for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.
