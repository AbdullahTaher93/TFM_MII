Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place sweet potatoes, olive oil, brown sugar, Cajun seasoning, and salt in a large resealable plastic bag; shake to coat potatoes evenly. Transfer mixture to a baking dish. Bake in preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until sweet potatoes are tender, about 1 hour.
