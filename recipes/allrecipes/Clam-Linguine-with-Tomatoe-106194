Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. In a large skillet, heat oil and butter over medium heat. Stir in garlic and cook until it starts to sizzle and turn golden. Add tomatoes and clam juice and boil until reduced to about 1 cup of liquid, about 10 minutes. Stir in clams and parsley; heat through. Add sauce and cheese to pasta; toss well. Serve with extra Parmesan cheese and freshly ground black pepper.
