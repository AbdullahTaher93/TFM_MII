Heat a soup pot over medium heat. Add bacon pieces and fry until crisp, about 8 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel to drain and pour off all but 3 tablespoons of the bacon grease from the pot. Return the pot to medium heat. Add the mushrooms to the pot; cook and stir for about 5 minutes. Add the onions and season with Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. Continue to cook and stir until onions are tender, about 3 more minutes. Pour the broth and water into the pot and add the orzo pasta. Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat to low. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until orzo is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the bacon pieces and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. Taste and adjust seasonings before serving.
