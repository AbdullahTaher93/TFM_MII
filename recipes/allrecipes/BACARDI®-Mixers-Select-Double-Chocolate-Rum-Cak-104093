Cake Directions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease 10-inch tube pan or spring form pan. Combine cake mix, pudding mix, 1/2 cup of BACARDI(R) Select Rum, water and oil in bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat at a low speed until moistened. Beat for 2 minutes at a medium speed then stir in 1 cup of chocolate chips. Pour batter into pan and cook 50 minutes. Cool in pan 15 minutes then remove from pan and cool on rack. Icing Directions: In small saucepan, heat preserves and BACARDI(R) Select Rum. Strain through sieve to remove seeds. Place cake on serving plate and prick surface of cake with fork. Brush glaze evenly over cake, until all glaze has been absorbed. In a glass bowl combine remaining chocolate chips and shortening. Microwave on medium high until melted, about 1 minute. Stir until smooth. (Or heat over hot, not boiling, water until melted.) Spoon chocolate icing over cake. Let stand 10 minutes. Melt white chocolate and drizzle on top of chocolate icing.
