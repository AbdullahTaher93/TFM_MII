Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Beat 1/4 cup confectioner's sugar and butter with an electric mixer until smooth. Add flour; beat for 5 seconds. Add oats; beat for 5 seconds. Add coconut; beat for 5 seconds. Add walnuts; beat for 5 seconds. Add salt; beat for 5 seconds. Mix cherries into the butter mixture, beating until dough comes together and turns light pink from cherries, about 25 seconds. Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until slightly golden, 18 minutes. Remove from oven. Pour remaining 1 cup confectioners' sugar into a shallow dish; roll warm cookies in sugar to coat. After rolling all of the cookies once, roll again in confectioners' sugar to coat.
