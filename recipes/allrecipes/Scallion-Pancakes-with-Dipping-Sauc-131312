Toast sesame seeds. Whisk together flour, egg, and water until smooth. Stir in scallions, garlic, and salt. In another bowl, combine seeds with all ingredients for dipping sauce and set aside. In a skillet, heat 1 teaspoon oil over medium-high heat. Ladle 3/4 cup batter into skillet and smooth it out into a thin pancake. Cook until golden brown on one side, about 3 minutes. Flip pancake and cook until golden brown on second side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining oil and batter.
