In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onions, and cook, stirring frequently until they have softened. Sprinkle in the ginger, garlic, coriander, cardamom, nutmeg, and cumin. Cook for 3 minutes more, stirring frequently. Pour the rice into the saucepan and saute the rice with the spices for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Pour the lentils and salt into the saucepan. Pour 3 cups of water into the pan, stir. Place the potatoes into the pan. Bring the mixture to a boil, cover the pan and turn the heat to low. Cook for 10 minutes. Place the bell pepper, peas, and raisins into the saucepan. Stir well, then cover the pan again. Cook 10 minutes more, or until the rice, potatoes, and lentils are tender. Stir in the butter, if you like. Serve and enjoy.
