Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Mix beef, water, ranch dressing mix, and onion soup mix together in a bowl; shape into 8 patties. Cook the burgers until they are very firm, hot, and grey in the center, about 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
