Place meat, carrots, celery, and tomatoes in a large pot over medium heat. Fill with water to completely cover meat, almost to the top of the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 90 minutes. In a frying pan, fry chopped onions until browned; put aside. To the soup pot, add kidney beans with their liquid, potatoes and fried onions; cook until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Add the beef bouillon cubes, and cook for 5 minutes. Add salt to taste. Serve.
