In a large saucepan, heat the oil over moderately low heat. Add the onions, carrots, and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables start to soften, about 10 minutes. Stir in the broth, tomatoes, tomato paste, potatoes, green beans, and salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, until the vegetables are almost tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in the egg noodles. Bring the soup back to a simmer and cook until the vegetables and noodles are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the parsley.
