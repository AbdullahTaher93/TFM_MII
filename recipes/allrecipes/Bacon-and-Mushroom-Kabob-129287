Place the oil in a small bowl and add the orange zest; set aside to infuse while you make the salad. Peel the grapefruit, removing all the pith. Holding the grapefruit over a large bowl to catch the juice, and using a small, sharp knife, cut the segments from between the membranes that separate them; drop them into the bowl. Squeeze the juice from the membrane before discarding it. Add the watercress, endive, prunes, and mint, and mix well; set the salad aside. Heat the broiler to high. Cut each bacon slice into thirds. Wrap a piece of bacon around each mushroom. Thread the lime quarters, bacon-wrapped mushrooms, tomatoes, squash or zucchini, and cooked potatoes onto 8 metal skewers, dividing the ingredients equally between servings (2 skewers to each serving). Brush the kabobs lightly with the orange-flavored oil and broil, turning once, until the bacon is golden brown and crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Under the broiler, toast the slices of ciabatta or French bread on one side. Brush the untoasted sides lightly with the remaining orange-flavored oil, then toast until light brown. Place on warm plates. Add a pair of kabobs to each plate, laying them across the bread slices, and spoon the salad alongside.
