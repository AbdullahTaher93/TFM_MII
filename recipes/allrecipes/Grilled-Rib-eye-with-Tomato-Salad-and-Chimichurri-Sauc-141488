Preheat grill to high. To prepare salad: Combine tomatoes, onion, oil and vinegar in a medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper. To prepare steak: Rub steak with oil. Season on both sides with salt and pepper. Grill the steak 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Allow the steak to rest 5 minutes; serve with the salad on the side and a dollop of chimichurri sauce on top. For chimichurri sauce: Chop parsley and garlic together on a cutting board until the parsley is finely minced. Transfer to a medium bowl, add vinegar, oil, salt and chipotle (or cayenne) pepper; stir to combine.
