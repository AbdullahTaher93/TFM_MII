Preheat the grill. Rinse the corn to moisten the husks. Pull back the husks, remove the silks, and pull the husks back over the kernels (some kernels will be exposed). Place the corn on the grill rack. Grill the corn, turning, for 15 minutes, or until the kernels are tender and charred in spots. Meanwhile, place a steamer basket in a saucepan with 1/2 inch of water. Place the green beans in the steamer. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 6 minutes, or until tender-crisp. Rinse briefly under cold running water and drain. In a large bowl, combine the lime juice, olive oil, flaxseed oil, cumin, salt, and pepper. Add the tomatoes, onion, cilantro, and green beans. Cut the kernels off the corn cobs and add to the bowl. Toss to coat well.
