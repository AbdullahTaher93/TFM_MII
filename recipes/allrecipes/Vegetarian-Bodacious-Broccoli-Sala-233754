Cook bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain fat and crumble bacon. Mix broccoli, cauliflower, Cheddar cheese, onion, and crumbled bacon together in a large bowl. Whisk mayonnaise, yogurt, red wine vinegar, sugar, ground black pepper, salt, and lemon juice in a bowl until thick and creamy. Pour dressing over broccoli mixture and toss to combine. Cover and refrigerate until serving.
