Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add green beans and cook until bright green and just tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water. Heat soy sauce in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic and ginger in soy sauce until fragrant; stir in honey. Add green beans and toss to coat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until beans are tender, about 5 minutes more.
