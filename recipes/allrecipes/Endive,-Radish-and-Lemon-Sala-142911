Using a sharp knife, peel the lemons, removing all of the bitter white pith. Working over a strainer, cut in between the membranes to release the sections; drain the juice and reserve for another use. In a large bowl, toss the endives with the lemon, radishes, mint and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and serve.
