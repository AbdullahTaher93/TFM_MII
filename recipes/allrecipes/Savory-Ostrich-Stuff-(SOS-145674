Place the ground ostrich in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring to crumble, until no longer pink. Add the shortening, flour, salt, and cayenne pepper, salt and stir until the shortening has melted entirely. When the mixture begins to bubble, slowly pour the milk into the skillet while stirring until the mixture thickens. Spoon the mixture over English muffins and garnish with paprika.
