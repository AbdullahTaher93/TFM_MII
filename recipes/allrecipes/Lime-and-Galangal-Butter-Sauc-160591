Place the garlic, shallot, galangal, and white wine in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and reduce the wine to 2 tablespoons. Remove from the heat, and whisk in the butter, one piece at a time, adding each piece after the last one has melted. Once the butter has been incorporated, whisk in the lime zest and juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in cilantro and serve immediately.
