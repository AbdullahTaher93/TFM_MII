Heat bacon drippings in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot drippings until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir diced apple and caraway seeds with the onion and cook until apple is just tender, about 3 minutes more. Add sauerkraut and stir. Stir white wine, chicken stock, and brown sugar together in a bowl; pour over the sauerkraut mixture. Put pork roast into the bottom of the crock of your slow cooker. Pour sauerkraut mixture over the pork. Cook on Low until the pork easily falls apart when pulled with a fork, 6 to 8 hours; add kielbasa sausage pieces and continue to cook until the sausage is heated through, 15 to 20 minutes more.
