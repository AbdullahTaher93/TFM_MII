Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8 inch baking dish. Combine crushed crackers, black pepper and garlic powder in a small bowl. Press scallops into mixture so that they are evenly coated, and place them in the greased baking dish. In a separate bowl, mix together melted butter, wine and lemon juice; drizzle mixture over scallops. Bake in preheated oven until scallops are lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Garnish with chopped parsley.
