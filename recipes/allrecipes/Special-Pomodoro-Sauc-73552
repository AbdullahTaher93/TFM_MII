Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat, add onion, bell pepper and garlic. Cook about 8-9 minutes, stirring frequently, or until onion is soft and liquid is evaporated to develop flavor.** Blend in tomatoes, vinegar and basil; cook about 1 minute or until heated through. Stir in almonds. Season to taste. Serve over pasta, seafood or chicken as a main dish. Or, serve on slices of French bread or wrapped in lettuce leaves for an appetizer.
