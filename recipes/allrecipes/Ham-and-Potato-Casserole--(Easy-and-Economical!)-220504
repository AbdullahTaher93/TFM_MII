Grease a heavy pot or Dutch oven. Layer about 1/3 of the potatoes into the bottom of the prepared pot. Spread 1/2 of the luncheon meat on top. Sprinkle with about 1/2 of the margarine and about 1/3 of the salt. Repeat the steps once more, then layer the remaining potatoes and margarine on top. Season with salt. Pour milk over potato mixture and cover. Heat pot over medium-high heat until milk begins to bubble, then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.
