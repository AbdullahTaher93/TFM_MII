In a skillet over medium-high heat, brown pork chops in oil; set aside. Combine the soup, milk, sour cream, pepper, 1/2 cu cheese and 1/2 cup onions; fold in potatoes. Spread in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Arrange chops on top; sprinkle with salt. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until pork is tender. Uncover; sprinkle with remaining cheese and onions. Return to the oven for 5-10 minutes or until cheese melts.
