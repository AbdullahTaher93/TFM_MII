Place the tapioca in a bowl with enough water to cover, and soak 8 hours, or overnight. Fill a large saucepan with the 2 quarts water, and mix in the prunes, raisins, sugar, and cinnamon. Bring to a boil, and stir in the soaked tapioca. Stirring often, cook 30 minutes, or until tapioca is clear and prunes are tender. Mix in the lemon juice and salt at the end of the cook time. Chill until completely cooled before serving.
