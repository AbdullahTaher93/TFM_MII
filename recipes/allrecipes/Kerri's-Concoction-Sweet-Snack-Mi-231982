Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Melt butter in large roasting pan over medium heat. Stir brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg into the melted butter. Add toasted oat cereal, shredded wheat biscuits, rice cereal squares, pretzels, and nuts; stir to coat with the butter mixture. Bake in preheated oven, stirring every 15 minutes, for 1 hour. Set aside to cool; transfer to a large bowl. Fold white chocolate morsels and dried cranberries through the cereal mixture; spread onto a large sheet of waxed paper to cool completely.
