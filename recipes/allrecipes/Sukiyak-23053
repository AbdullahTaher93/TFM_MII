Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Brown beef in hot oil, then stir in soy sauce, MSG, broth, and sugar. Mix in onion and celery, and cook until tender. Stir in bamboo shoots, green onions, mushrooms, and water chestnuts. Reduce heat to medium, stir in cornstarch, and simmer until sauce is thickened.
