Prepare and heat ham according to package directions. Meanwhile, prepare glaze. Combine marmalade, gingerroot and mustard in small bowl; mix thoroughly. Set aside. Remove ham from oven 30 minutes before meat is done. Brush marmalade mixture over ham. Pour ginger ale and 1/4 cup orange juice into pan bottom. Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees. Return to oven and bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes, basting ham with pan juices every 10 minutes. Let rest on cutting board, loosely covered, about 15 minutes. Pour cooking juices into small saucepan; stir in brown sugar and heat to simmer. Combine remaining 2 tablespoons orange juice and cornstarch in dish, stirring to blend. Add to simmering juices; cook and stir until slightly thickened, one to two minutes. Drizzle ham slices with warm sauce before serving.
