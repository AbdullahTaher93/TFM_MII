Heat the oil in a deep-fryer or heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Place the onion rings in a bag or bowl. Mix together the seasoned salt and flour, and pour in with the onion. Fry in the hot oil until lightly golden brown. You may need to gently stir the rings as the fry to brown them evenly. Drain on paper towels, and season with salt to taste.
