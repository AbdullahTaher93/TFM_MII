Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch roasting pan with cooking spray. Place the carrots and onion on one side of the pan, and the beets on the other side. Spray the vegetables with cooking spray. Cover pan with aluminum foil. Roast the vegetables in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, then uncover pan and roast until browned and tender, about 20 more minutes. Whisk together the honey, ground chipotle pepper, Dijon mustard, olive oil, tea, apple cider vinegar, and salt until the mixture is smooth and the salt has dissolved. Place the roasted carrots, onion, and beets into a large bowl, and pour the dressing over the vegetables. Gently toss vegetables to coat with dressing. To serve, place 1 cup of arugula on each of 5 salad plates, then top with 1 cup of the dressed vegetables and 1/2 ounce of goat cheese.
