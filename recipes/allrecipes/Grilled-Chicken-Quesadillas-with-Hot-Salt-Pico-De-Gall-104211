Preheat grill to medium-high. Rub the chicken breasts with Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM), pressing the hot salt into the meat. Grill chicken for 5 to 6 minutes per side, basting with 1/2 cup of the barbecue sauce until fully cooked. Let cool. Thinly slice or shred the chicken breasts into thin strands. Set aside. In a bowl, combine the grilled chicken, onion, green onion, cilantro, 1/4 cup of the barbecue sauce and the cheeses. Season to taste with Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM). Preheat grill to medium. Lay a flour tortilla on a flat surface. On one half of one flour tortilla, place one eighth of the chicken and cheese mixture. Fold the top half over the chicken and cheese, pressing firmly to seal. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling. Lightly spray both sides of the outside of each tortilla half moon with non-stick cooking spray. Sprinkle with Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM). Grill quesadillas for 2 to 3 minutes per side until the cheese is melted and the quesadillas are heated through. Serve with guacamole, sour cream and Hot Salt Pico de Gallo.
