Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 18 muffin cups with coconut oil. Beat coconut oil, brown sugar, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Beat 1 egg and vanilla extract into the coconut oil mixture. Whisk flour, baking soda, and coarse salt together in a bowl; beat into the coconut oil mixture until a dough forms. Fold oatmeal, raisins, and almonds into dough. Mix beaten egg into dough if needed for moisture. Spoon dough into prepared muffin cups to about half full. Bake in preheated oven until center is set and top is lightly browned, 12 to 14 minutes.
