Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge the cube steaks in a mixture of flour, salt and pepper, and brown them in the hot oil. Arrange steaks in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle the green pepper, onion, celery, mushrooms, oregano, and onion soup mix over the steaks. Stir together the tomato juice and ketchup; pour over everything in the dish. Bake for about 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until the meat is cooked through, and the sauce is thickened.
