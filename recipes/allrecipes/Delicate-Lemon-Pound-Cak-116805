In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter, shortening and sugar until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in extracts. Add flour alternately with soda, beating just until combined. Pour into a greased and floured 10-in. fluted tube pan (pan will be full). Bake at 325 degrees F for 1-1/4 hours or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10-20 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
