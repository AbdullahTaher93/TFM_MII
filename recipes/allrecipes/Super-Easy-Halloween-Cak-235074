Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan. Beat cake mix, pumpkin puree, and eggs together in a bowl using an electric mixer until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes. Fold chocolate chips into batter; pour into the prepared baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.
