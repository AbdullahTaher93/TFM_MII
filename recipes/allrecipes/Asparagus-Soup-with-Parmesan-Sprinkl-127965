Heat oil over medium heat in a medium saucepan. Add onion, garlic, and asparagus and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions soften, 5 to 7 minutes. Do not brown. Add broth, bring to a simmer, and cook until asparagus is just tender, about 10 minutes. Working in batches, puree the soup in a blender or food processor, or use a hand-held immersion blender. Return to the pan and gently reheat, seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. Serve in individual soup bowls with a sprinkle of Parmesan.
