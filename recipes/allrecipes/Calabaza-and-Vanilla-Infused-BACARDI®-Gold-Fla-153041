Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Cut the calabaza in quarters, using a spoon remove the seeds and place in a sheet pan, roast in oven until soft. Remove from the oven and set aside until cool enough to handle, peel the skin off and place in a food processor. Add the calabaza, BACARDI(R) Gold, both milks, eggs, and three tablespoons of sugar. Puree. Check for sweetness adding more sugar if necessary. Place the 1 cup sugar in a small skillet over medium-high heat and stir while it liquefies. Continue stirring until sugar boils and turns a brown color. Pour the caramel into the bottom of an 11-inch glass pan and working quickly, spread the caramel evenly with a rubber spatula over the bottom of the pan. Pour the calabaza mixture into the pan and place in a hotel pan in the center of a 350 degrees F oven. Carefully pour water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the pan. Bake for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and allow it to cool completely before serving.
