In a large nonstick skillet, saute the green pepper, onion and celery in oil until tender. Add sausage; cook and stir over medium heat for 3 minutes or until no longer pink. Stir in the remaining ingredients. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Transfer to an ungreased 1-qt. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until heated through, stirring once.
