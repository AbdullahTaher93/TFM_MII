Pour 1/4 to 1/2 inch oil in a heavy 10-inch skillet; bring oil to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C) over medium-high heat, about 8 minutes. Working in batches, gently arrange tortillas in the hot oil using a slotted spoon; cook, frequently turning tortillas with the slotted spoon, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove chips with slotted spoon and place a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
