Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir lamb until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Combine tomato sauce, black beans, and amber ale in a large pot. Stir contents of the chili seasoning kit, reserving the masa flour, into the tomato mixture; add onion, jalapeno peppers, garlic, and habanero pepper. Stir in lamb. Heat pot on low until lamb mixture begins to lightly simmer, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes. Cover and reduce heat to warm (lowest setting) and cook until chili flavors blend, stirring occasionally, 2 to 4 hours. If the chili is too thin, slowly stir in reserved masa flour. If the chili is too thick, add water.
