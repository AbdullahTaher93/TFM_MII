Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Rinse chicken breast and pat dry with paper towel. Brush surface of chicken with balsamic vinegar. Combine seasonings and melted butter. Brush over chicken, covering entire chicken breast. Insert meat thermometer into thickest part of chicken breast. Line roasting pan with foil. Combine Morton(R) Coarse Kosher Salt and water to form a thick, moldable paste, starting with 1 cup of water and adding 1/4 cup more as needed. Pat about 1 cup of paste to a 1/2 inch thick rectangle in foil-lined pan. Place chicken onto salt paste layer. Pack remaining salt paste around chicken, covering entire chicken. Turn oven to 375 degrees F and bake until temperature reaches 170 degrees F, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove from oven. Let stand 10 minutes. Remove and discard salt crust, brushing away any remaining salt.
