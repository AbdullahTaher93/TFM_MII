Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Combine the dry ingredients in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, peanut butter, egg and vanilla. Lightly mix the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients; the batter will be fairly thick. Pour enough oil into a small, deep saucepan to reach a depth of 1 1/2 inches and warm over medium-high heat until the oil registers 310 degrees F on a deep-fry or candy thermometer. Working in 3 or 4 batches, drop the batter by rounded teaspoon (fritters should be small enough to cook through without burning) into the hot oil and cook, turning once, until lightly browned, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Maintain the 310 degrees F oil temperature at all times. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fritters to paper towels to drain. Keep the fritters in the oven as you continue frying. Serve hot with the whipped cream and jam.
