Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a large bowl, combine turkey, 1 cup of the salsa, 1 cup of the cheese, yogurt, cilantro, cumin, and hot chili flakes to taste. Spoon a sixth of the turkey mixture down center of each tortilla; roll to enclose. Lay filled tortillas, seam side down, in an oiled 8- by 12-inch baking pan. Top enchiladas with remaining 1 cup salsa and 1 cup cheese. Bake, uncovered, until cheese is bubbly and enchiladas are heated through (about 25 minutes). Top each enchilada with 2 olive halves.
