Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion until translucent and soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, and cook and stir for 1 more minute. Stir in the tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, and sugar, and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the basil, red chile pepper, salt, and black pepper, and cook for 10 minutes more. Remove from heat, and stir in the mascarpone cheese.
