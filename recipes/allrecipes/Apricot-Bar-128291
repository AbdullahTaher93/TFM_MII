Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat a 7 x 11-inch (18 x 29-cm) baking dish with nonstick spray. In a medium saucepan, combine the apricots, apples, water, honey, and cinnamon. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes; reduce the heat slightly if the mixture starts to stick to the bottom of the pan. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, graham cracker crumbs, and brown sugar. With a pastry blender or two knives, cut in the margarine until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Evenly press half of the crumbs into the dish. Spoon the apricot filling over the crumbs and spread it evenly with the back of the spoon. Top with the remaining crumbs, spreading them out and lightly pressing them into place over the filling. Bake in the center of the oven until the top is lightly browned, 22 to 26 minutes. Place on a wire rack and cool slightly. Cut into bars while still warm.
