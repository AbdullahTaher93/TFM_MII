Heat olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Place the chopped kale, Swiss chard, rainbow chard, red, green, and yellow bell peppers, leek, salt, and stir fry seasoning into the skillet. Use tongs or two spoons to gently toss and stir the ingredients together. Continue to stir and cook until the kale and chard are bright green and wilted and the bell peppers are just tender, about 10 minutes.
