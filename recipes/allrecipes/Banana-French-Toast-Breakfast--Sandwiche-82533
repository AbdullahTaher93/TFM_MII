In a medium bowl, beat together egg substitute, water, milk, vanilla extract, and orange zest. Place 2 to 3 slices banana on six slices bread. Top with remaining slices of bread to make 6 sandwiches. Melt a small amount of butter in a skillet over medium heat. Dip one banana sandwich in the egg and milk mixture, allowing bread to become saturated, and place in the skillet. Cook, turning once, until both sides are golden brown. Dust with confectioners' sugar to serve. Repeat with remaining sandwiches.
