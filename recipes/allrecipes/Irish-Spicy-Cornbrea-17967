Preheat oven and skillet to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix together flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cayenne pepper. Cut in shortening until the mixture resembles coarse bread crumbs. In a small bowl, beat together milk, eggs and hot pepper sauce. Stir milk mixture into the flour/cornmeal mixture until just blended. Remove hot skillet from oven, spray with non-stick cooking spray and pour batter into skillet. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center of loaf comes out clean.
