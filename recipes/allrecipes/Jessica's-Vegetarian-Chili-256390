Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in the hot oil until onion starts to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add sweet peppers, yellow squash, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, zucchini, chili powder, oregano, parsley, paprika, cumin, bay leaves, salt, and pepper; cook and stir for 5 minutes. Stir crushed tomatoes, kidney beans, chili beans, and diced tomatoes into the pot. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook chili, stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, 30 to 45 minutes.
