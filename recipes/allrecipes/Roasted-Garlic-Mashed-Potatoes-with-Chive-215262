Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Wash and quarter potatoes, keeping them immersed in cold salted water as you work. Toss garlic cloves in Spectrum Organic Extra Vrigin Olive Oil and set on baking sheet, roast until garlic has turned golden brown, about 20 minutes. Put potatoes in a large pot filled with cold, salted water and cover with a lid. Bring pot to a boil over a high heat and then reduce to medium boil for 15 to 20 minutes, or until potatoes easily pierce with a sharp knife. Drain potatoes through a colander. Remove roasted garlic from oven and using the flat side of a chef's knife, crush the garlic and chop very finely. Transfer the potatoes and garlic to an electric mixer fitted with a paddle and mix at low speed to break up potatoes. Slowly add the Imagine Organic Free Range Chicken or Vegetable Broth, a couple of spoonfuls of the butter, the Hain Pure Foods Iodized Sea Salt and a few grinds of pepper - adjust seasoning to taste. Scrape down the side of the bowl and beat in more broth, butter and chives - continually adjusting seasoning to taste. Serve warm with your favorite entree or gravy.
