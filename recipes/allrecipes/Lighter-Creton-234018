Place ground turkey, 1 cup water, onion, cloves, sage, and cinnamon in a saucepan. Bring turkey mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 45 minutes, mashing ingredients occasionally with a spatula while cooking; remove from heat. Stir gelatin into remaining 1/2 cup water; stir gelatin mixture into turkey mixture. Transfer to a small container; refrigerate until cool, about 1 hour.
