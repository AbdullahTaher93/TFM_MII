In a 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat, combine oil, yellow onion, garlic, and cumin seed. Stir often until onion is limp, about 5 minutes. Add enchilada sauce and stir until simmering. Discard any solidified fat from beef and gravy. Scrape gravy from meat and stir into enchilada sauce mixture. Cut beef into 3/4-inch cubes and add to pan; cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until beef is hot, 5 to 8 minutes. Spoon chili into bowls. Serve with sour cream and green onions to add to taste.
