Rinse and pick over the yellow split peas and soak overnight in clear water. Saute the onions in the butter in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the soaked split peas, chicken stock, pumpkin, salt beef, chili pepper and bitters. Cover and simmer for 1 1/2 hours or until the peas are soft. Allow the soup to cool and then puree in a blender. Adjust the seasoning and reheat and serve with a little nutmeg sprinkled on top.
