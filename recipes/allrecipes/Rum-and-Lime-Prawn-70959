Stir together the rum and lime juice, and set aside. Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add prawns to the skillet, and cook until they are just starting to turn pink. Spoon the rum and lime juice mixture over the prawns one tablespoon at a time. Light the rum on fire after each tablespoon. Be careful!
