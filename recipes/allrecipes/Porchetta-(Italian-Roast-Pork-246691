Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Combine sage, garlic, thyme, rosemary, fennel pollen, salt, and black pepper in a small bowl. Make ten 1/2-inch incisions all over the pork. Stuff the incisions with 1/3 of the sage mixture. Brush olive olive over the pork and rub on remaining 2/3 of the sage mixture. Transfer to a roasting pan. Roast pork, skin-side up, in the preheated oven until golden, about 2 hours. Pour wine into the roasting pan. Continue roasting pork, basting with wine at regular intervals, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 3 hours. Let pork rest, covered in aluminum foil, for 10 minutes before slicing.
