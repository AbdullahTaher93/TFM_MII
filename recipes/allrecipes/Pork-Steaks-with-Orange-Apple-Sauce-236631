Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir apple, orange juice, cranberry sauce, and cloves in the melted butter until apples soften, about 2 minutes. Place pork in the skillet with apples. Cover skillet and cook until pork is browned, about 5 minutes per side. Remove cover and cook until pork is no longer pink in the center, about 6 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).
