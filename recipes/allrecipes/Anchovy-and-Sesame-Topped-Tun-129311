Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat a large nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray over medium heat and add the onion, peppers, and garlic. Cover and cook, stirring frequently until the onion has softened, about 3-4 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and their juice, the tomato puree, bay leaf, and chili sauce. Cover again and cook, stirring frequently until the peppers are just tender, about 7 minutes. Meanwhile, make the topping. Combine all of the ingredients in a blender or food processor and process until finely chopped. Or chop the bread crumbs, garlic, anchovies, and parsley, put in a bowl, and mix in the sesame seeds and oil with a fork until well combined. Spread the pepper mixture in the bottom of an ovenproof dish large enough to hold the fish in 1 layer. Lightly sprinkle the tuna steaks with salt and pepper, and cut each in half. Place the 4 pieces in the dish and cover evenly with the topping mixture. Bake until the fish is just cooked, about 10 minutes; it should be a little pink in the center. If you prefer tuna more well done, cook 1-2 minutes longer.
