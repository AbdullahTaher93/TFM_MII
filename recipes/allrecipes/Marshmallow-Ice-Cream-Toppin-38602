In a saucepan, combine sugar, corn syrup, butter and milk. Place over low heat, and stir until sugar is dissolved. Bring to a boil, then simmer 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in the top of a double boiler, melt the marshmallows with the water. When melted, stir into hot syrup mixture until no streaks remain. Remove from heat, and stir in vanilla.
