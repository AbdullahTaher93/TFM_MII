Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop. In a mixing bowl, combine the crab, bread crumbs, mayonnaise, milk, chopped eggs, onion, and salt. Mix thoroughly. Pour into a 1 quart casserole dish. Bake in a preheated oven for 25 minutes or until the top is lightly brown and bubbly.
