Line a baking dish with aluminum foil. Mix sugar, sweetened condensed milk, coconut cream, and butter together in a pot; bring to a simmer until temperature of milk mixture reaches 225 degrees F (110 degrees C), about 30 minutes. Stir coconut extract, ginger, vanilla extract, and bitters into milk mixture; continue simmering until temperature reaches 236 degrees F (113 degrees C), about 10 minutes. Remove pot from heat and let fudge stand for 2 minutes. Pour fudge into the prepared baking dish; refrigerate until set, about 2 hours.
