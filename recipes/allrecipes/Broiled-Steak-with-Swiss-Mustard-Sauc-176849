Slash through fat edging of steaks at 2- to 3-inch intervals, cutting just to the lean meat. Place steaks on a rack in a shallow pan. Broil 3 to 4 inches below heat, turning once, until cooked to desired doneness when cut (10 to 14 minutes total for rare to medium-rare). Meanwhile, in a small pan, melt butter over medium-high heat. Blend in mustard, vermouth, and Worcestershire. Transfer steaks to a cutting board, remove any fatty tissue, and slice thinly. Divide steak among plates. Pour sauce over and around meat, swirling pieces in sauce.
