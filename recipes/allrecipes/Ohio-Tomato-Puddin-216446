Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray an 8x8-inch baking dish with cooking spray. In a large bowl, toss the bread cubes with melted butter, and stir in the tomato puree, brown sugar, lemon juice, and orange juice. Lightly spoon the bread mixture into the prepared baking dish. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, about 1 hour.
