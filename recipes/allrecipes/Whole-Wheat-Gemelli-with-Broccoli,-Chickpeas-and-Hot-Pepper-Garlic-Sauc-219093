Boil a large pot of salted water to blanch broccoli. Once the water boils, add broccoli and cook for 5 minutes, or until tender. Remove broccoli with a slotted spoon. Rinse quickly with cold water and set aside. Add pasta to boiling water and cook for al dente texture, following package instructions. Drain pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of pasta water for finishing sauce. In the meantime, use a large saucepan on a medium-hot setting to heat Hot Pepper Garlic Sauce with olive oil, about 3 minutes. Add broccoli, sea salt and chickpeas to the pan. Cook until heated thoroughly, about 5 minutes. Introduce cooked pasta and a bit of pasta water to the saucepan with broccoli mixture. Toss well to combine. Cook together for another 2 minutes to marry flavors. Serve drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and topped with Parmesan.
