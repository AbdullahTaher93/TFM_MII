Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground pork in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir ketchup, water, vinegar, brown sugar, dry mustard, and salt into the ground beef; bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes. Serve on hamburger buns.
