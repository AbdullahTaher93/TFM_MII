Combine the ground chuck, chili powder, cinnamon, paprika, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, allspice, mustard, beef base, and 1 cup water in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; use a potato masher to break up the beef and mix the rest of the ingredients through the beef; bring to a simmer; reduce heat to medium-low and continue to simmer 2 to 3 hours, adding water occasionally to keep the mixture moist. Once the mixture is softened, stir in the crushed crackers to thicken.
