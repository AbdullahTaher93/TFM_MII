In a large skillet, brown the chicken pieces in oil and cook for about 15 minutes over medium heat. Crush garlic cloves and squeeze over chicken. Cover skillet and cook over low heat for 10 minutes each side. Remove cover, sprinkle with red pepper flakes and salt to taste, add water and simmer over low heat until water evaporates and the chicken pieces are sticky and yummy!
