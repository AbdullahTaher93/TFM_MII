Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Lightly brown pork chops on each side. Transfer chops to a roasting pan or casserole dish just large enough to hold chops in a single layer. Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in the same skillet. Add onions, chipotle chile pepper and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Saute until onions are lightly cooked. Distribute onions evenly over the pork chops. Set skillet aside for the sauce. Bake pork chops in a preheated 350 degrees F oven 20 minutes, or to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F. Add cream to the skillet; slowly bring to a boil while scraping the pan to release the caramelized pan juices. Add remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and cilantro. When cream comes to a boil, immediately reduce the heat to as low as possible and keep warm. Remove pork chops from the oven. Pour warm cream sauce over pork.
