Coat the pork with the flour. Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork and cook until well browned on both sides. Add the onion to the skillet and cook for 10 minutes or until the pork is cooked through and the onion is tender. Stir in the gravy and mustard and cook until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Serve the pork and sauce with the potatoes.
