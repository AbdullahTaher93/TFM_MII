Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in green onions, ginger, and garlic, and cook 5 minutes, until tender. Stir in sugar and soy sauce until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat, and mix in sesame oil. Place chicken pieces in a shallow bowl. Pour marinade over chicken. Cover bowl and marinate chicken 8 hours in the refrigerator. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Drain marinade into a pot and bring to a boil; set aside. Arrange chicken on a baking sheet and bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until juices run clear when chicken is pierced with a knife. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccini and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. In a large bowl, toss the cooked pasta with the boiled marinade. Top with chicken pieces to serve.
