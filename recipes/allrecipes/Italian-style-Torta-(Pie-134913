Preheat your oven to 425 degrees F. Coat a 10-inch pie plate with nonstick spray. Coat the sheets of phyllo dough with nonstick spray, and layer them on the pie plate until you've completely covered the tin. Bake for 7 minutes. Set the crust aside, and lower the temp to 350 degrees F. Saute the garlic and onion in olive oil until golden. Mix in the spinach and sauce, and heat it until it's cooked through. Season with salt and pepper and drain in a colander. Cook the beaten egg substitute and egg whites together in a nonstick skillet until they form a flat omelet. Set this aside. Spread the spinach mixture in the crust; top it with the omelet. Add the ham and peppers. Cover this with cheese and bake uncovered for 10 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes, then cut it into quarters.
