Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Arrange chile peppers on a baking sheet. Toast chile peppers in the preheated until browned, about 7 minutes. Remove stems. Mix avocados, onion, and roma tomatoes together in a bowl. Blend canned tomatoes, cilantro, toasted chile peppers, garlic powder, and salt in a blender until smooth. Pour about half the blended tomato mixture into avocado mixture. Reserve remaining tomato mixture for another use or for dipping. Squeeze lime juice into avocado mixture and gently stir until evenly combined. Transfer guacamole to a smaller serving bowl; place reserved avocado pit in the middle to prevent browning.
