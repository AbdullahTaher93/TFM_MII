Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chops until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Reduce heat to low; stir in beer, soy sauce, honey, Dijon mustard, and garlic. Add apple slices; simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer potatoes until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and return potatoes to the pot. Combine butter and milk in a saucepan over medium heat; heat until butter is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Add kale and simmer until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour over warm boiled potatoes; mash well. Season colcannon with salt and pepper. Serve pork chops and apple slices over colcannon.
