Heat grill to medium. Remove outer layers of husks from 8 ears corn. Grill corn, turning often, until kernels burst easily when pressed, 15 to 20 minutes (husks will be quite charred). Meanwhile, make Seasoned Butter: In a small bowl, mix together 1/2 cup melted butter and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, or a combination of 1/2 teaspoon paprika and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper. Peel back husks and silks from corn, brush with seasoned butter, and serve.
