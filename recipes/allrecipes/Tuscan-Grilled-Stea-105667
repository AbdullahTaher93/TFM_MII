In small bowl, mash garlic and oil until a paste forms (you may also do this in the food processor.) Pay steaks dry with paper towel, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Rub garlic paste over both sides of steaks. Let sit for 30 minutes. Preheat grill to high heat. Grill steak 5 to 7 minutes, until well-seared and browned. Flip; grill 3 to 5 minutes longer, until medium rare. To check, cut into meat with a knife and remove when meat is slightly less done than you want it to be. Transfer to cutting board; cover loosely with foil and let rest 10 minutes. Slice very thin, against the grain and at a slight angle. Arrange arugula on platter. Top with steak slices. Drizzle with any accumulated platter juices. Serve immediately.
