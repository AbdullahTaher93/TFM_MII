Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Wash beets. Individually wrap beets in a square of Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 45 minutes. Allow them to cool until they are able to be handled. Remove the skins by hand or by rubbing with a paper towel. Cut beets into chunks. Transfer to a food processor or heavy-duty blender. Add goat cheese, garlic, yogurt, tahini, thyme, lemon juice, salt, honey and olive oil. Pulse until smooth and thoroughly combined. Taste and adjust seasoning if desired. Transfer to a serving bowl or platter. Sprinkle with pistachios and drizzle with olive oil. Serve with crackers, raw veggies or crispy pita wedges.
