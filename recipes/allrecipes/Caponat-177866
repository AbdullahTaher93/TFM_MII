In a 12- to 14-inch nonstick frying pan with a lid, combine eggplant, onion, garlic, olive oil, sugar, and salt. Cover pan and place over medium-high heat. Cook vegetables, covered but stirring occasionally, until they are soft and eggplant is browned, about 15 minutes. Stir in pasta sauce and cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Use warm.
