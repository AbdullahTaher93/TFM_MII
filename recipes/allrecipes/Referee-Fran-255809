Before the big game heats up, heat your Hillshire Farm(R) Lit'l Smokies(R) according to package directions. Now, Referee Frank needs a jersey. Wrap white American cheese around each smoked sausage and give the referees their stripes using BBQ sauce. Stick a toothpick through the middle of the Lit'l Smokies(R) smoked sausage, and slide the grape tomato onto the toothpick, placing the football next to Referee Frank. Good catch ref! Almost game ready! Cut yellow American cheese into small slices and place them on the grape tomato to create football laces. Don't forget to use sea salt as the eyes. They're very important for making the tough calls.
