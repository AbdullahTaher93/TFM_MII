Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan. Soak chia seeds in warm water in a bowl for 5 minutes; drain. Blend chia seeds in a blender until smooth; add sucanat and agave nectar. Blend the mixture again until smooth. Sift cornmeal, spelt flour, baking powder, and salt into a large mixing bowl. Add frozen corn kernels and chia seed mixture to the cornmeal mixture; stir and pour into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
