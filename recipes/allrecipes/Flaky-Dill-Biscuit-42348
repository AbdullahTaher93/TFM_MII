In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, dill, salt and pepper. Cut in butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. With a fork, stir in eggs and 1/2 cup cream just until moistened. Drop by 1/4 cupfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet. Brush tops with remaining cream. Bake at 450 degrees for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.
