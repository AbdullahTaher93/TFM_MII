Steam beans over a pot of boiling water until tender but still firm. Rinse under cold water to cool. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter and saute onions. Add salt, soy sauce, hot pepper sauce, Worcestershire sauce and mushroom soup; mix well. In a small casserole dish, layer half the beans, chestnuts, cheese and soup mixture. Repeat layer. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 30 minutes or until hot and bubbly. Top with onions and heat 10 minutes longer.
