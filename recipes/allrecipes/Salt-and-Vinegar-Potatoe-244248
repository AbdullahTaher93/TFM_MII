Place potatoes into a pot and pour in enough vinegar to cover; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain well. Heat butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir potatoes in melted butter until crunchy and brown, 5 to 10 minutes; season with salt.
