In a shallow, nonreactive dish, mix red wine vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, onion, and pepper. Place steaks in the mixture. Cover, and marinate 1 hour in the refrigerator. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate. Grill steaks on the prepared grill 5 to 7 minutes per side, to desired doneness. Discard remaining marinade.
