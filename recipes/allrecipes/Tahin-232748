Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread sesame seeds onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until seeds are fragrant, stirring every few minutes, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer toasted seeds to a blender and add olive oil. Blend until completely smooth, adding additional oil if needed. Refrigerate in a sealed container.
