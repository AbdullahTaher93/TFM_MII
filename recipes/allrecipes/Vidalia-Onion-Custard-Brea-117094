In a large skillet, cook onion in 2 tablespoons butter over medium-low heat until very tender and lightly browned, about 15 minutes. In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Beat egg and milk; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Set aside 2 tablespoons onion mixture; fold remaining mixture into batter. Fold in 1/2 cup cheese. Pour into a greased 9-in. pie plate. Top with remaining cheese and reserved onion mixture. Sprinkle with poppy seeds. Melt remaining butter; drizzle over the top. Bake at 400 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes on a wire rack. Cut into wedges; serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.
