Prepare hollandaise sauce according to package directions; set aside and keep warm. In a bowl, beat eggs, milk, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Heat oil in a 10-in. skillet over medium-low; add half of the egg mixture. As the eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup cheese, 1 cup asparagus, 1 cup crab and another 1/2 cup cheese. Fold omelet in half. Cover for 1-2 minutes or until the cheese is melted. Repeat for second omelet. Serve with hollandaise sauce. Garnish with chives.
