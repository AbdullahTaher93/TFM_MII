Place egg whites in a small mixing bowl; let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside. Add cream of tartar and salt to egg whites; beat on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, on high until stiff peaks form. Spread into a 9-in. circle on prepared pan, forming a shallow well in the center. Bake at 225 degrees F for 1 to 1-1/4 hours or until meringue is dry and firm to the touch and lightly browned. Turn oven off; leave meringue in oven for 1 to 1-1/2 hours. Just before serving, beat cream and almond extract in a small mixing bowl until stiff peaks form. Spoon into meringue shell. Top with fruit.
