Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray large cookie sheet with CRISCO Original No-Stick Cooking Spray. In small bowl, stir powdered sugar, peanut butter, 2 tablespoons butter and 1/2 teaspoon banana extract until smooth; set aside. Unroll both cans of dough on cutting board; divide into 4 equal sections along center perforations. Spread about 1/4 cup peanut butter mixture over each of 2 dough sections. Place remaining dough sections over filling. Using sharp knife, cut along perforations into 12 strips. Gently stretch each strip until about 10 inches long. Twist each strip 4 or 5 times. Coil each strip into pinwheel shape; tuck end under. Place 2 inches apart on cookie sheet. Bake 12 to 18 minutes or until golden brown. Remove rolls from cookie sheet to cooling rack placed on waxed paper. Cool 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in 2-quart saucepan, melt chocolate chips, 3 tablespoons butter and the corn syrup over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until chocolate chips are melted and mixture is smooth. Stir in vanilla and 1/8 teaspoon banana extract. Drizzle glaze over warm rolls. Sprinkle each with 1 teaspoon pecan chips. Serve warm or at room temperature.
