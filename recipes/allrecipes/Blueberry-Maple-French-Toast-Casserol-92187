Butter or spray with cooking oil a 9- by 13-inch casserole dish. Pour frozen blueberries into dish. Stir in syrup, sugar, and cornstarch until well blended. In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, and vanilla. With a serrated knife, cut crusts off bread, if desired. Slice bread into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Dip each slice of bread into egg mixture to coat both sides. Place atop blueberries. Pour any remaining egg mixture over the bread. (Casserole may be baked immediately or covered and refrigerated overnight.) Place oven rack in upper third of oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Bake casserole uncovered for 35 to 40 minutes or until blueberries are bubbling and toast is lightly golden. With a spatula, remove toast to serving plates, spoon blueberries on top, and serve with additional syrup.
