Rinse mushrooms; trim and discard stems. Pat mushrooms dry with paper towels, and cut into 1/2-inch slices, if desired. Coat a shallow 10- by 15-inch baking pan with cooking oil spray. In a small bowl, combine 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar and the olive oil. Brush mixture evenly over all sides of mushrooms. Place mushrooms in baking pan in a single layer. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven, turning once after 10 minutes, until dark brown (20 to 25 minutes). Meanwhile, pour broth into a wide frying pan; add onion and polenta. Bring to a boil over high heat; cook, stirring often, until slightly thickened (about 10 minutes). Add corn and continue cooking until thickened to consistency of catsup (about 15 more minutes), stirring frequently. Season to taste with salt. Divide polenta onto 4 hot dinner plates; top each serving with a fourth of the mushrooms. Garnish with parsley. Offer additional vinegar to drizzle over each serving to taste.
