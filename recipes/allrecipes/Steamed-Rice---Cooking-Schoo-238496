Stir water, rice, and salt together in a heavy-bottomed pot. Bring water to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and cook until rice is tender and water is fully absorbed, about 18 minutes. Remove pot from heat and let stand, covered, for 10 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork.
