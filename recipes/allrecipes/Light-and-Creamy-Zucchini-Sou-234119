Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and carrots in hot oil until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add zucchini; continue cooking until the zucchini begins to soften, about 5 minutes more. Pour chicken broth over the zucchini mixture, place a cover on the pot, and bring to a boil and cook for 8 minutes. Stir spinach into the mixture; continue cooking until the zucchini is tender, about 2 minutes more. Mash the zucchini mixture with a potato masher until a desired texture is achieved. Pour potato soup into the zucchini mixture; bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Stir half-and-half and Pecorino Romano cheese into the zucchini mixture; stir. Continue cooking until heated through completely, 2 to 3 minutes.
