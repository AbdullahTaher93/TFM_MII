In a large bowl, combine the crumbs, marshmallows, nuts and sugar. In a saucepan, melt chocolate chips and milk over low heat, stirring often until blended and smooth. Remove from the heat; add extract if desired. Set aside 1/2 cup. Pour remaining chocolate mixture over crumb mixture; stir until well blended. Pour batter into a greased 8-in. square baking pan. Press down evenly. Frost with reserved chocolate mixture. Chill for 1 hour.
