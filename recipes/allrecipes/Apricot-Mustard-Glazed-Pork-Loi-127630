Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Season roast with salt and pepper. Place in a shallow uncovered roasting pan. Roast 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F. Pour water over roast and continue to roast 30 minutes longer. Meanwhile, stir together remaining ingredients. Spoon the glaze over the roast, spreading to cover it. Return to oven and roast 15 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F. Place roast on a warm platter and cover for 10 minutes before slicing.
