Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). In a medium bowl, toss potatoes with olive oil to coat, and place in a shallow roasting pan or baking dish. Season with salt and pepper. Bake for 1 hour, or until golden brown and tender. Remove from the oven, and transfer potatoes to a large bowl. Stir in yogurt and mayonnaise to coat. Serve immediately.
