Beat shortening and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth, about 3 minutes; stir in vanilla extract. Beat sugar, one cup at a time, into butter mixture on medium speed. Add milk and beat on high speed until light and fluffy. Keep icing covered with a damp cloth until ready to decorate. For best results, keep icing refrigerated when not using.
