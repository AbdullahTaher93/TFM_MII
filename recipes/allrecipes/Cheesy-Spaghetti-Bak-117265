Cook spaghetti according to package directions. Drain and place in two greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dishes; set aside. In two Dutch ovens or stockpots, cook the beef, onions and green pepper over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. To each pot, add 2 cups of milk, two cans of tomato soup, one can of mushroom soup and 1 cup of cheese. Bring to a boil. Spoon over spaghetti (spaghetti will absorb liquid during baking). Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until bubbly and top is lightly browned.
