Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium high heat. Saute onion and 2 cloves crushed garlic until onions are soft and translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in the broccoli coleslaw mix, and cook until tender. Add the cabbage and chicken and toss for a minute or two. Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper to taste. In a blender, combine garbanzo beans, mayonnaise, mustard, cumin, garlic, onion powder, lemon pepper, salt and pepper. Blend until smooth and creamy. Heat tortillas for a few seconds in the microwave for easier folding. Spread each tortilla with sauce, then put a large heap of the slaw mixture on top. Wrap like you would a burrito.
