In a shallow bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. Spritz both sides of fish with butter-flavored spray. Dip one side of each fillet in spice mixture; place spice side down in a large skillet coated with butter-flavored spray. Cook over medium-high heat for 8-10 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork, turning once.
