Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat ricotta cheese and eggs together in a bowl. Briefly pass each matzah sheet under warm running water; layer moistened sheets on a plate. Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce in the bottom of a deep 11x15-inch baking dish; top with a layer of moistened matzah sheets, breaking pieces as needed to completely cover marinara. Spread a layer of ricotta mixture over matzah mixture. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over ricotta mixture layer. Repeat layering with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of matzah, marinara, and mozzarella cheese, respectively. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and browned, about 45 minutes.
