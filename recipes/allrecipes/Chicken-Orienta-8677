Preheat oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Dredge chicken wings in flour and brown slowly in butter or margarine over medium heat. Place browned chicken in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Add the onion, orange juice, ketchup, brown sugar, soy sauce, ground ginger and garlic powder/salt to the frying pan. Bring to a boil. Pour mixture over chicken and bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Turn chicken and continue baking for 30 additional minutes or until very tender.
