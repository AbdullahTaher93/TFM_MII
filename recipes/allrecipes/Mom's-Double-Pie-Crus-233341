Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Cut shortening into flour mixture until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add orange juice a tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork, until the flour mixture is moistened. When you squeeze a handful of the moistened pastry mixture, it should form a ball. Divide the dough in half and shape into balls. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate before rolling.
