In a large pot, bring the water, garlic, lemon, Old Bay Seasoning, cloves, bay leaves, salt, and Tabasco sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the potatoes and onion and simmer until both are tender, about 15 minutes. Add the shrimp to the pot and bring back to a boil. Simmer until the shrimp are just done, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, put the shrimp, onion, and potatoes onto a large, deep platter or into individual shallow bowls. Ladle some of the liquid over all.
