Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat, and saute garlic 1 minute. Mix in broccoli, and cook 5 minutes. Pour in broth, and stir in rice. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes. Strain the broccoli and cooked rice from the soup, and place in a blender with 1 cup of the soup liquid. Blend until smooth. Return to pot. Serve with Cheddar cheese.
