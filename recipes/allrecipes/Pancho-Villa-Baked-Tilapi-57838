Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat one side of 4 (8x10 inch) pieces of aluminum foil with olive oil. Center each fillet on a foil square. Spoon a generous amount of diced tomatoes with juices over fish. Sprinkle with lime juice and cilantro. Position 2 slices of lime on top of each fillet. Close and seal foil packets, and place on a baking tray. Bake in preheated oven for approximately 20 minutes, or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
