In small bowl, combine 1/4 cup apricot preserves and curry powder. Brush over both sides of pork chops. Place on pre-heated medium-hot grill. Cook on both sides for 8 to 10 minutes or until internal temperature as measured with an instant-read thermometer reaches 160 degrees F. Meanwhile, combine apricots, preserves and cilantro. When ready to serve, spoon Chunky Apricot Sauce over pork chops. Serve with steamed brown rice and broccoli.
