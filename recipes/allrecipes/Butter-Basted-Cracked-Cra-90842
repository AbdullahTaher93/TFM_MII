Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a 1- to 2-quart pan, combine butter, lemon juice, green onion, soy sauce, parsley, and lemon peel over medium heat. Stir occasionally until melted and bubbling, about 7 minutes. Divide crab pieces between 2 large roasting pans. Brush or spoon butter mixture equally over crab; gently mix to coat evenly. Cover pans with foil. Bake crab, stirring occasionally, just until warm, about 20 minutes. Transfer crab to a large platter. Pour any butter sauce in pan over crab and serve. Offer lemon wedges to squeeze over crab to taste.
