Add oil to a medium saucepan. Stir in rice, and cook over medium heat until rice begins to have a golden color, about 5 minutes. Add 1/2 cup onion and 1/2 cup green pepper; cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in water and half of the chili sauce. Bring to boil. Mix in corn, lemon juice, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cover, and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, saute beef with remaining 1/2 cup onion and 1/2 cup green pepper until meat loses pink color and vegetables are tender. Add remaining chili sauce, tomato sauce, cumin, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Simmer uncovered 15 minutes. Turn rice onto a platter, and fluff with a fork. Sprinkle with cheese, and top with beef mixture. Serve immediately.
