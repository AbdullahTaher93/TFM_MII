Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until soft. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the broth, cream-style corn, fresh or frozen corn, tomatoes (with juice), and thyme. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in the milk, red peppers, black pepper, and hot-pepper sauce. Cook for 3 minutes, or until heated through.
