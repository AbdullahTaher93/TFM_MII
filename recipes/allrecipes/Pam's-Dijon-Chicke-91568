Adjust oven rack to center position, and heat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Coat a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper, and arrange in prepared baking dish. Whisk mustard, 3 tablespoons olive oil, lemon juice, thyme, and salt and pepper in a small bowl. Drizzle mixture over chicken. In the same bowl, mix remaining oil with bread crumbs; sprinkle over chicken. Bake until chicken is cooked through and crumbs are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes, depending on size of chicken breasts.
