Adjust oven rack to lowest position, and heat oven to 450 degrees. Place crust on a cookie sheet. Mix peanut sauce and peanut butter, then spread 2/3 of the sauce over the pizza crust; toss remaining 1/3 of the sauce with the shredded chicken. Spread chicken over pizza. Bake until the crust is crisp and golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from oven, and top with carrots, green onions, peanuts and cilantro. Cut into 6 slices and serve.
