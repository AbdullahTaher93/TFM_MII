Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Toast the pine nuts in the oven until golden brown, about 8 minutes. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the linguine until just done, about 12 minutes. Drain the pasta. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large nonstick frying pan over moderately high heat until very hot. Season the scallops with 1/8 teaspoon salt. Put the scallops in the pan and sear until brown on the bottom, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn and sear until brown on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove the scallops and cut them into quarters. In the same pan, heat the remaining 5 tablespoons oil over moderate heat. Add the tomatoes, garlic, 2 tablespoons of the parsley, the red-pepper flakes, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Toss with the pasta, scallops, pine nuts, and the remaining 4 tablespoons of parsley.
