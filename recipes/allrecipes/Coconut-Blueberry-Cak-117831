In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Beat the eggs, milk and oil; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in blueberries. Transfer to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with coconut. Bake at 375 degrees F for 22-24 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near center of cake comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. In a small saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch and lemon peel. Gradually add water until blended. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat; stir in butter and lemon juice. Cut cake into squares; drizzle with the lemon sauce.
