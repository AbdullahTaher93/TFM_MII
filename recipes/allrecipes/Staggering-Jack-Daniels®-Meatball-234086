Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread meatballs in a single layer in a shallow baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until hot, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile heat apple jelly and jalapeno pepper jelly in a saucepan over medium heat until melted, about 5 minutes. Stir roasted peppers into jelly mixture and remove from heat. Add whiskey; stir until sauce is combined. Stir hot meatballs into whiskey sauce. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Heat meatballs and sauce slowly over low heat until completely hot, being careful not to boil, 15 to 20 minutes.
