Spread onions and garlic on the bottom of a 5-quart slow cooker. Place roast on top. Mix beef broth, rice wine, and soy sauce together in a separate bowl. Pour over the roast; add ginger slices. Sprinkle sugar and black pepper over roast. Cover and cook on Low, flipping 2 to 3 times, until roast pulls apart easily with a fork, 12 to 18 hours.
