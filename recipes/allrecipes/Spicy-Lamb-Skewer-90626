In a medium-size pan, combine onion, oil, and vinegar. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring, until almost all the liquid has evaporated and onion is soft (6 to 8 minutes). Stir in curry powder, bay leaf, chili powder, salt, garlic, and apricot nectar. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low; simmer for 5 minutes. Place lamb in a bowl, pour in apricot nectar mixture, and stir to combine. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to 8 hours, stirring occasionally. Oil and preheat barbecue grill. Lift lamb from marinade and drain briefly; reserve marinade. Thread lamb onto 8 metal skewers. Place skewers on grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook, brushing with remaining marinade and turning as needed, until lamb is well browned on outside but still pink in center (8 to 10 minutes); cut to test.
