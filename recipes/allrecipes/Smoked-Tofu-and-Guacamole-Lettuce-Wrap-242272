Mix tofu, onion, pine nuts, red pepper flakes, black pepper, turmeric, and 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt together in a large bowl. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir tofu mixture until heated through, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low to keep mixture warm while preparing guacamole. Mix tomatoes, avocados, jalapeno peppers, garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt together in a separate bowl. Arrange lettuce leaves onto a platter. Spoon guacamole into each lettuce leaf; top with tofu mixture.
