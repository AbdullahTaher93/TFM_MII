Mix in the lamb and pork, and cook until evenly brown. Reduce heat to low, and pour in beef broth. Simmer 30 minutes. Transfer the skillet mixture to a large pot. Mix in the carrots, turnip, parsnips, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, green bell pepper, remaining onion, and celery. Pour in the beer. Cover, and cook 2 hours over low heat.
