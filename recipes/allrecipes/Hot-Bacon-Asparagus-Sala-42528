In a skillet, cook bacon until crisp; remove with a slotted spoon to paper towel. Drain, reserving 2-3 tablespoons drippings. Cut asparagus into 1-1/2-in. pieces; saute in drippings until crisp-tender. Add vinegar, sugar, mustard, pepper and bacon. Cook and stir for 1-2 minutes. In a large bowl, combine the salad greens and almonds. Add the asparagus mixture and toss gently. Top with eggs. Serve immediately.
