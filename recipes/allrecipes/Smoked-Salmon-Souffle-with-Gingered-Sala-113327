Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter six 1-cup ramekins. In a medium saucepan, boil the wine over high heat until reduced to 2 tablespoons, 6 minutes; transfer to a bowl. Melt the butter in the saucepan and stir in the flour. Add the milk and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Cook over low heat, whisking often, for 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and beat in the egg yolks and cream cheese. Fold in the salmon and reduced wine. Season with salt, pepper and cayenne; cover. In a large bowl, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar until firm peaks form. Fold one-third of the whites into the salmon mixture, then fold in the rest. Spoon into the prepared ramekins. Bake the souffles in the center of the oven for 20 minutes, or until puffed and browned. Let cool slightly; the souffles will sink. Meanwhile, in a blender, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, shallot, honey, ginger, orange and lemon zests and sesame oil; blend until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Toss with some mesclun, tomatoes and potatoes. Carefully unmold the souffles and serve with the salad.
