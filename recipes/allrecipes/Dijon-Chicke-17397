Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Season chicken with salt. In a small skillet or saucepan, saute butter, garlic, mustard, and wine together for 3 to 4 minutes over medium low heat; spread mixture over chicken. Place bread crumbs in a shallow dish or bowl and dredge chicken in crumbs, leaving skins on. Place coated chicken pieces in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
