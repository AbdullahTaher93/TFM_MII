Place the meat in a medium bowl. Blend the soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, sugar, and oil. Pour the marinade over the meat and refrigerate covered for 1 hour. Stir occasionally. Drain the meat, saving the marinade in a saucepan. Boil the marinade for 2 minutes; set aside for basting. Alternate pieces of meat, mushrooms, pepper, and zucchini on skewers. Grill kabobs 3-4 inches from hot coals for 4-5 minutes on each side, basting occasionally.
