Fire up your grill to medium. Pour 1/4 can of Sloppy Joe sauce into a big bowl. Mix in the jalapenos, egg, and Worcestershire sauce. Add the beef and mix some more. Squish the meat into 6 patties, each no more than 3/4 inch thick. Slap them on the grill and close the lid (with the vents open). Grill until they're done the way you like: 5 to 6 minutes per side for medium (160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer) or 7 to 8 minutes per side for well done (170 degrees F). If you like them rare or medium-rare, you're on your own. This is a Men's Health recipe, not a Men's Food Poisoning recipe. Toast the buns on the grill. Slide in the burgers, slather with the remaining 1/4 can Sloppy Joe sauce, and add your favorite fixings.
