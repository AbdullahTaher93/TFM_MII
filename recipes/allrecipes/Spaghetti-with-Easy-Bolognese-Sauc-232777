Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, carrot, celery, and garlic over medium-high heat in a large pot until sausage and beef are browned. Drain off fat. Stir tomatoes, tomato paste, wine, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper into meat mixture. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Cover and simmer 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove pot from heat. Stir in whipping cream. Cook spaghetti according to package directions in a large pot; drain. Serve sauce over hot cooked spaghetti and sprinkle with fresh parsley. [Cleaning tip: Once the stove top is cool, wipe up any oil splatters or spills with Clorox(R) Disinfecting Wipes*. Rinse hands once complete.]
