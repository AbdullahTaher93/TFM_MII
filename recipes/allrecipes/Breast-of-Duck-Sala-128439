To make raspberry vinaigrette: Place the jam in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high power for 1 minute, or until melted. Whisk in the vinegar, broth, oil, and mustard. To make the salad: Coat a grill rack or broiler pan with nonstick spray. Preheat the grill or broiler. Season the duck with the salt and pepper. Cook 4 inches from the heat for 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and let stand for 5 minutes. Cut the duck across the grain into 12 thin slices. In a small saucepan, combine the wine or cranberry juice and pears. Place over medium-high heat and cook, stirring often, for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the liquid has evaporated. Divide the lettuce among dinner plates. Sprinkle with the walnuts and blue cheese. Divide the pears and duck among the plates. Drizzle with vinaigrette.
