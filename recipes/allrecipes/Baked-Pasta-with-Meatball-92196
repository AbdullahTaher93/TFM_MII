To prepare meatballs, in a large bowl lightly beat egg, then stir in bread crumbs, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Add 1/2 cup of the pasta sauce, ground beef, onion, and parsley. Mix lightly to blend well. Shape mixture into 1-inch meatballs. Spray a shallow 10 1/2- by 15 1/2-inch baking pan with cooking oil spray; arrange meatballs, slightly apart, in pan. Bake in a 450 degrees F oven until meatballs are no longer pink in center, 12 to 15 minutes (cut to test). Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. While meatballs are baking, cook pasta in boiling salted water in a 5 1/2- to 6-quart pan according to package directions until almost tender to bite. Drain well. Return to pan, add remaining pasta sauce, tomato sauce, and meatballs with any pan drippings; mix lightly. Spread mixture in an oiled oval or rectangular 4-quart casserole. Cover evenly with mozzarella, then with parmesan cheese. Bake, uncovered, until top is dappled with golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.
