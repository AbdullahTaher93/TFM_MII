Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Heat a small skillet over medium heat; add macadamia nuts and cook, stirring often, until toasted, 3 to 4 minutes. Combine quinoa, macadamia nuts, apple, cucumber, green bell pepper, celery, lemon juice, green onion, garlic, agave nectar, and salt in a bowl.
