On a microwave safe plate, stack the corned beef then the caraway seeds, then the sauerkraut and then topped with the cheese. Microwave just until the cheese melts (about 1 minute or so). Spread the mustard in the middle of the low carb tortilla. Then place the heated corned beef, sauerkraut and cheese to one edge of the tortilla. Roll up the tortilla half way, tucking in all the goodies. Then fold over the two ends and finish rolling it up. This sandwich can get soggy quickly so serve it immediately.
