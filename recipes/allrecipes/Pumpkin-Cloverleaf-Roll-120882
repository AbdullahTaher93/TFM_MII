In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add 1 teaspoon brown sugar; let stand for 5 minutes. Add milk, pumpkin, butter, orange peel, salt and remaining sugar mix well. Add 2 cups flour. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 1 minute. Divide into six portions. Divide each into 12 pieces. Shape each into a ball; place three balls in each greased muffin cup. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Brush rolls with egg. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until browned. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
