Cook and stir ground beef in large pot over high heat until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste, water, carrot, onion soup mix, granulated garlic, oregano, basil, and thyme. Bring to a boil. Turn sauce down to a simmer and cook for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. When sauce has finished cooking, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the spaghetti, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta stirring occasionally, until cooked but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain. Serve Bolognese sauce over hot spaghetti.
