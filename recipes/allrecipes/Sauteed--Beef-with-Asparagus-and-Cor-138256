In a 12-inch skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over high heat. Add asparagus, mushrooms, and corn; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until asparagus are lightly browned and tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer vegetables to a bowl. In another bowl, toss together beef, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and cornstarch until coated. Reheat skillet over high heat with remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add beef and cook, without stirring, until browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Add asparagus mixture and 1 cup water; bring to a boil. Cook, tossing, until sauce has thickened slightly, about 30 seconds. Serve.
