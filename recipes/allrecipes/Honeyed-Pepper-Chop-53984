In a shallow baking dish or resealable bag, mix together the honey, soy sauce, and hoisin sauce. Place the lamb chop into the mixture; cover and refrigerate for 3 hours. Heat the olive oil in a shallow wok over medium-high heat. Add the anise seed, garlic, onions and green chilies, and saute until the onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Place the lamb chops and marinade into the pan, and stir. Turn heat down to medium-low, and cover. Cook for 20 minutes, then remove lid, and continue cooking until liquid has evaporated. Stir in green onions, and cook, stirring, until the internal temperature of the meat has reached 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
