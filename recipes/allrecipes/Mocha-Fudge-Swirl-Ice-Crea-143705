Prepare Fudge Sauce. In a small saucepan melt butter over low heat. Stir in 2/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder until nearly smooth. Stir in 1/2 cup LACTAID(R) whole milk. Heat and stir until mixture comes to boil and is smooth. Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla. Cool slightly; cover and chill. In a medium saucepan combine eggs and 2 cups of the LACTAID(R) Whole Milk. Stir in sugar, cocoa powder, and coffee crystals. Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture coats a metal spoon (about 5 minutes). Stir in remaining 2 cups LACTAID(R) Whole Milk. Cover the surface with plastic wrap. Refrigerate several hours or overnight until completely chilled. (Or, place the saucepan in a sink of ice water to chill quickly.) Freeze in a 4- to 5-quart ice cream freezer according to manufacturer's directions. Remove ice cream paddle. Stir in the chilled Fudge Sauce just until swirled.
