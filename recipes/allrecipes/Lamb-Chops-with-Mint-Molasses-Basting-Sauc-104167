Preheat grill to medium-high (about 450 degrees F). Rub lamb chops all over with Morton(R) Nature's Seasons(R) Seasoning Blend, pressing the seasoning into the meat to adhere. In a bowl whisk together the molasses, olive oil, vinegar, honey mustard, mint and fresh herbs. Season to taste with Morton(R) Nature's Seasons(R) Seasoning Blend and set aside. On well seasoned grill, grill lamb chops for 3 to 4 minutes per side, basting with reserved mint molasses sauce until lightly charred, glazed and cooked to desired doneness. (An instant read thermometer should register 145 degrees F for medium-rare.) Remove from grill and serve with extra basting sauce.
