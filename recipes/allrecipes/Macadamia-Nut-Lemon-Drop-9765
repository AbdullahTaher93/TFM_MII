Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Spread macadamia nuts on cookie sheet and bake until lightly browned. Set aside and let cool. In a large bowl, beat eggs until light and fluffy (this should take at least 5 minutes). Gradually add sugar and beat well. Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder and blend into egg mixture. Beat until smooth. Mix in the lemon zest, lemon juice and nuts. Mix until well blended. Drop by teaspoonfuls about 3 inches apart on parchment paper lined cookie sheets. Bake for 7 to 9 minutes until cookies are golden with dark edges. Let cool on wire rack.
