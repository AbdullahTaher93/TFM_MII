Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8x4 inch loaf pans. In a small mixing bowl, cover the raisins with hot water; let stand for 10 minutes and drain. Sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon, set aside. In a large bowl, combine apple juice, egg and oil; beat until well mixed, then stir in the applesauce. Gradually stir in the sifted ingredients until smooth. Add the drained raisins; mixing just enough to evenly distribute. Pour the batter into the prepared pans. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool loaf in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
