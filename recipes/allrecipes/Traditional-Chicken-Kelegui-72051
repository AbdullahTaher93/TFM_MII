Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place whole chicken into a roasting pan. Roast in the oven for 1 hour, or until the leg moves easily within its socket. Remove from the oven, and allow the chicken to cool slightly. Remove the skin from the chicken and discard. Tear the meat from the bones, and chop into small pieces. Discard bones, and place the chicken in a large bowl. Stir in green onions and grated coconut. Sprinkle liberally with lemon juice. Season with salt and red pepper flakes. Taste and adjust amounts of lemon juice, salt and red pepper so that one does not overwhelm the others.
