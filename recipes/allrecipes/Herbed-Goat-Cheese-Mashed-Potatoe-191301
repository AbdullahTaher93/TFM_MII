Place potatoes in a heavy saucepan, add 1 inch of water and cover with a tight fitting lid. Place over high heat. When you see steam escaping (don't take off the lid) reduce the heat to low and continue cooking for exactly 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes and put them back in the pot over medium heat. Shake the pan and cook for 1 minute to make the potatoes very dry. Mix the milk, olive oil, and Dannon(R) Plain Yogurt in a glass measuring cup and microwave until hot. Mash the potatoes and fold in the yogurt mixture and then add the goat cheese. Season with salt and pepper.
