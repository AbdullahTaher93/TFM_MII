In small saucepan combine apple cider and 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar. Heat to boiling and continue boiling until liquid is reduced to a syrup. Set aside to cool. Mix remaining vinegar with the shallots, olive oil, tarragon, Stevia Extract In The Raw, honey (optional), salt and pepper. Whisk vigorously to combine until stevia dissolves. In medium bowl toss together apples, celery, almonds and chives. Blend in vinaigrette. Assemble salad on small plates, stacking the apples mixture and cheese in alternating layers. Drizzle with cider reduction to finish and enjoy.
