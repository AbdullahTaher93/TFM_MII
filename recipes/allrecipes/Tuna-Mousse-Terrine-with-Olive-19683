Slicing crosswise, cut each stuffed olive into 3 or 4 slices. Spray a small 3-cup terrine, or decorative mold with a flat bottom, with non-stick spray. Carefully cover the bottom of the terrine with the sliced olives, making sure that the pimentos stay in the center of the olives. In a small saucepan over low heat, heat 1/2 cup of water. Stir in the gelatin until it completely dissolves, stirring constantly so that the gelatin does not burn. Place the tuna, mayonnaise, ketchup, paprika, white pepper and sugar in an electric blender. Process until smooth. Add the gelatin into the mixture and process again until it becomes a uniform paste. Carefully spoon the tuna mixture into the terrine over the olives until the dish is full to the rim. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. When ready, remove the tuna mousse from the mold and serve.
