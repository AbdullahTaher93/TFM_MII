In a small saucepan, heat the EVOO, 1 turn of the pan, with the butter over medium heat. Add the rice and toast for about 2 minutes, then add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Crumble in the ground chicken, add the cinnamon, and cover and simmer over low heat until cooked through, about 18 minutes; let cool.
