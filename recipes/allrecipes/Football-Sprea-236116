Break ramen noodles into a bowl into small pieces and add seasoning packets. Pour enough boiling water over noodles to cover; cover bowl and let sit until noodles are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir mayonnaise, chicken, jalapeno peppers, and hot sauce into noodle mixture. Refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.
