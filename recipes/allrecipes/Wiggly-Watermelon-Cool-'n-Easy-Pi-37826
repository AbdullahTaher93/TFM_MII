Mix 1 cup of the whipped topping and food coloring in small bowl until well blended. Refrigerate while preparing gelatin mixture. Stir boiling water into gelatin in large bowl 2 minutes or until completely dissolved. Mix water and ice to make 1-1/4 cups. Add to gelatin, stirring until slightly thickened. Remove any remaining ice. Stir remaining whipped topping into gelatin mixture with wire whisk until smooth. Refrigerate 10 to 15 minutes or until mixture is very thick and will mound. Spoon into crust. Refrigerate 4 hours or until firm. Garnish rim of pie with tinted whipped topping to make "rind." Decorate with sprinkles for "seeds." Store leftover pie in refrigerator.
