Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir cumin seeds until they sizzle, about 30 seconds. Stir in green chile peppers, ginger, and garlic; cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add onion and sugar; cook and stir until onion is almost browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir tomatoes, tomato paste, turmeric, coriander, and red chile powder into the saucepan. Cook until flavors combine, about 15 minutes. Transfer onion and tomato mixture to a food processor; process into a smooth paste. Pour paste back into the saucepan. Add jackfruit; cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in garam masala and salt. Serve garnished with cilantro.
