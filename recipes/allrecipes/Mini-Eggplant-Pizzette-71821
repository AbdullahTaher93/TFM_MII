Preheat the oven or toaster oven to 425 degrees F. Brush both sides of the eggplant with the oil and season with the salt and pepper. Arrange on a baking sheet and bake until browned and almost tender, 6 to 8 minutes, turning once. Spread 1 tablespoon of pasta sauce on each eggplant slice. Top, if desired, with the Canadian bacon (optional) and shredded cheese. Bake until the cheese melts, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve hot.
