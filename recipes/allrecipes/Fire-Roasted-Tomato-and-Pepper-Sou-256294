Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper. Place peppers, onion and garlic on prepared pan; drizzle with olive oil. Roast in preheated oven until peppers are soft and slightly charred, about 20 minutes. Heat broth in a large soup pot. Add chopped cilantro, oregano, cumin, sugar, freshly ground pepper, and Hunt's Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes. Bring to a simmer. Add roasted peppers, onions and garlic to the tomato mixture. Using a hand held immersion blender, puree the soup until smooth. Simmer over low heat until hot, about 10 minutes. Serve garnished with Cotija cheese, cilantro and drizzled with lime juice.
