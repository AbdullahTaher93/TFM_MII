Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Unroll phyllo dough. Stack six sheets out on a flat surface. Keep remaining phyllo covered with a barely damp paper towel. Working quickly, layer 6 sheets of phyllo, lightly coating each with butter-flavored cooking spray. With a sharp knife, cut sheets lengthwise into thirds and crosswise into fourths to make twelve 2 1/2 x3 1/4-inch squares. Press phyllo squares to fit into individual muffin tins. Repeat step until tins are full. Bake in preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove and set aside. In a large bowl, combine all remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly. Spoon 1 rounded tablespoon of spinach mixture into each phyllo cup. Return to preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until heated through.
