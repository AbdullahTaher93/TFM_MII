Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. In a small bowl, mix applesauce, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Spoon 1/2 cup mixture into each pumpkin. Place pumpkins in the prepared baking dish. Cover with foil, and bake in the preheated oven 1 hour and 45 minutes, or until pumpkins are tender.
