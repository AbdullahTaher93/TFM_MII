Prepare all your ingredients first. Mince the scallions and reserve 1/2 or more of the green portion to use as a garnish. The pork can be cubed or cut into strips. Slice and mince the veggies. In a bowl, whisk together the water, vinegar, soy sauce, Splenda, lemon juice and orange extract. Add guar gum and whisk until dissolved. Set aside. In wok or large non-stick skillet, heat the sesame oil over medium-high heat. Stir-fry the ginger, garlic, scallions, peppers and carrots for about 3 minutes. Add pork and stir-fry for 3 more minutes. Add the snow peas and toss. Add the sauce, stir and cook 1 more minute. Serve garnished with scallion greens.
