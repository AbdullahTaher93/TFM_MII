Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Mix cauliflower florets and garlic in a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil and lemon juice over the cauliflower mixture; season with salt and pepper. Toss cauliflower mixture to coat and spread into an even layer onto a jelly roll pan. Roast in preheated oven for about 15 minutes, turn the cauliflower, and continue roasting until soft, about 10 minute more. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the cauliflower to serve.
