Place in a microwave safe mug, 1/2 cup of the milk, the Splenda, cardamom, cinnamon, ginger and almond extract. Zap until it comes to a boil ( about 30 seconds). Remove and stir well. Add the remaining milk and stir. Depending on how warm you want your milk, you can zap it again for another 30 seconds. I like my milk just luke warm in the summer and quite hot in the winter.
