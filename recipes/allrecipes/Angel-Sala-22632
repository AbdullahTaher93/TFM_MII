In a small bowl, dissolve the lime flavored gelatin in hot water. Allow it to cool for 10 minutes. In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese, pineapple, pimento peppers, celery and pecans. Fold in the gelatin. Chill in the refrigerator 1 hour, or until thickened but not firm. Whip the heavy cream in a small bowl until thickened. Fold into the gelatin mixture. Refrigerate 3 hours, or until firmly gelled.
