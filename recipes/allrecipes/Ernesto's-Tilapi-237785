Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Season tilapia with the juice of 1 lime and salt. Arrange fish in a disposable aluminum pan. Layer onion, red bell pepper, orange bell pepper, green bell pepper, roma tomatoes, jalapeno pepper, garlic, and cilantro, respectively, over fish. Dot butter over cilantro layer, squeeze the juice from the second lime over cilantro, and season with salt. Cover pan tightly with a double layer of aluminum foil. Cook on the preheated grill for 15 minutes; rotate pan halfway-around and cook 5 minutes more. Rotate pan back around and cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes more. Carefully remove aluminum foil and ladle mixture into bowls.
