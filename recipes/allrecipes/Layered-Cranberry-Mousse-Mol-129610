Stir boiling water into dry gelatin in large bowl at least 2 min. until completely dissolved. Add cranberry sauce; stir until mixed. Stir in cold water. Pour 2 cups of the gelatin mixture into 6-cup mold sprayed with cooking spray. Refrigerate 45 min. or until set but not firm. (Gelatin should stick to finger and should mound.) Meanwhile, stir cinnamon and cloves into remaining gelatin mixture. Refrigerate 30 min. or until slightly thickened (consistency of unbeaten egg whites). Add whipped topping; stir with wire whisk until well blended. Pour over gelatin mixture in mold. Refrigerate 4 hours or until firm. Store leftover gelatin in refrigerator.
