Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cut the stem ends off the top of each garlic head. Place garlic cut side up in a baking dish and drizzle with olive oil. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until browned, and the garlic cloves are soft and remove easily from the skins, about 45 minutes.
