Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with liners. Mix gluten-free flour, protein powder, baking soda, cacao powder, and salt in a large bowl. Place mashed bananas, turbinado sugar, melted butter, and egg in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment; beat on medium speed until well-blended and airy. Add flour mixture; mix until batter is evenly moistened. Stir in chocolate chips and sliced almonds. Scoop the batter into the muffin tin, filling each liner 2/3 of the way full. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Let muffins cool on wire rack before serving, about 10 minutes.
