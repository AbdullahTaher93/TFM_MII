Pour oil into deep fryer or large heavy skillet, filling no more than 1/3 full. Heat to 375 degrees F on medium heat. Mix Batter Mix and Old Bay in medium bowl. Add beer or water; stir until smooth. Dip fish into batter. Shake off excess. Fry fish, a few pieces at a time, 3 to 5 minutes or until golden brown, turning once to brown evenly. Drain on paper towels.
