Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain most of the grease from the skillet and return to medium-high heat. Saute celery, onion, and carrots with the bacon in the hot skillet until tender, about 5 minutes; add flour, stir, and cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Stream chicken stock into the skillet while whisking to incorporate with the flour mixture, scraping sides of the skillet to assure complete integration. Add chicken, cream-style corn, whole kernel corn, poultry seasoning, salt, and black pepper to the mixture. Stir cream into the mixture. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until the chicken and corn is hot, 3 to 4 minutes.
