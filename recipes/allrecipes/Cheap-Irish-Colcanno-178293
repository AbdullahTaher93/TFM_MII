Place the cabbage and broccoli in a saucepan, and fill with just enough water to cover the vegetables. Cover, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes; drain. Stir in the prepared mashed potatoes, butter, garlic salt, and black pepper.
