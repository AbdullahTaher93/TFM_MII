Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Roll dough into two 7-inch circles; set aside. Mix cheeses and egg in medium bowl. Spoon cheese mixture onto centers of each circle. Fold each circle in half to form semicircle; press edges together to seal. Beginning at one end, stretch sealed edge and fold over, pinching to seal. Arrange on greased baking pan; poke 5 holes in top of each with toothpick. Bake 20 minutes or until golden and puffed. Let stand on wire rack 15 minutes before serving. Serve with Pasta Sauce, heated.
