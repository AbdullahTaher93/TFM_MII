Rinse and drain the greens. Grill the meat 5 to 6 minutes each side, turning once. (It should be about medium rare.) Allow to cool slightly, then slice thinly. In the meantime, combine dressing ingredients in a small bowl and stir until well combined. Combine the sliced beef, onion, red pepper, cucumber, tomatoes, cilantro, mint, garlic, chili pepper, and dressing in a large bowl. Divide the salad greens onto two plates and top with the beef mixture.
