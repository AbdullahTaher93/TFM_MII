Spray 1 side of tortillas with cooking spray. Sprinkle 1/4 of cheese, bacon and tomato on half of unsprayed side of tortillas; fold tortillas in half over filling. Heat grill pan or large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add quesadillas, in batches if needed, and cook 4 to 6 minutes, turning once, or until golden brown and cheese is melted. Meanwhile, stir together mayonnaise and salsa. To serve, cut quesadillas into wedges and place on serving plates. Top each with lettuce and drizzle with sauce.
