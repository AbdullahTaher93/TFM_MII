Spoon flour into measuring cup and level. Mix flour and salt in medium bowl. Cut in CRISCO(R) using pastry blender (or 2 knives) until all flour is blended in to form pea-size chunks. Sprinkle with water, one tablespoon at a time. Toss lightly with fork until dough will form ball. Divide dough in half, if making double crust. Press between hands to form one or two 5 to 6-inch pancakes. Flour dough lightly. Roll into circle between sheets of waxed paper on dampened countertop. Peel off top sheet. For single crust, trim one inch larger than inverted 9-inch pie plate. Flip into pie plate. Remove other sheet and press pastry to fit. Fold edge under. Flute. Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Thoroughly prick bottom and sides with fork (50 times) to prevent shrinking. Bake at 425 degrees F for 10 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Heat CRISCO(R) Oil in a large non-stick skillet over high heat. Add shallots; cook, stirring, until translucent but not brown, about 1 minute. Add mushrooms; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until mushrooms release their liquid, liquid evaporates and mushrooms are a dark golden brown, about 8-10 minutes. Sprinkle half the cheese evenly over the bottom of the baked crust. Sprinkle with mushrooms and top with remaining cheese. Whisk together milk, cream, eggs and egg yolk in a medium bowl. Season with nutmeg, salt and pepper. Pour over cheese. Transfer to oven, bake at 350 degrees F until just set in the center, 30-35 minutes. Cool on wire rack for about 10 minutes before slicing.
