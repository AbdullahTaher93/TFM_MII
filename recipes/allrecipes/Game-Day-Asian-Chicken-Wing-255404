Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Rinse chicken wings and pat dry. Add vegetable oil, salt, garlic and ginger to a large bowl and whisk to combine. Toss chicken wings in oil and seasoning mixture until well coated. Place on a foil-lined or greased baking sheet, separating them so that they are not touching. Bake for 50 minutes or until crispy and cooked through. About 10 minutes before wings are finished baking, prepare sauce. To a medium skillet, add apple butter, orange juice, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic and ginger. Place over medium-low heat and keep stirring until heated through. Set aside until wings are baked. Remove wings from baking sheet, add to the skillet, and toss to coat. Place on a serving tray and sprinkle with green onion tops and cilantro. Serve immediately.
