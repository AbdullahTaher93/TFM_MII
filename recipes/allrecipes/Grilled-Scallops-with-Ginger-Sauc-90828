Preheat barbecue grill. In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan, combine wine, broth, shallots, ginger, and lime peel. Bring to a boil over high heat. Continue boiling, uncovered, until reduced by about half. Stir in whipping cream and boil until reduced to 3/4 cup. Reduce heat to medium and add butter, stirring constantly until butter is completely blended into sauce. Remove sauce from direct heat but keep warm. Rinse scallops; pat dry with paper towels. Thread scallops equally on 8 bamboo or thin metal skewers, piercing them horizontally so they lie flat. Brush with olive oil. Place scallops on a well-oiled grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level for only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning once, until scallops are opaque throughout (cut to test), 5 to 7 minutes. Pour prepared sauce onto a platter or divide among 4 dinner plates. Lay scallop skewers in sauce and serve immediately.
