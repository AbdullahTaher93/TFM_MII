In a mixing bowl, combine butter and sugar; mix well. Add eggs and extracts; beat on high speed until thickened. Stir in bananas. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; gradually add to banana mixture. Fold in the chocolate, coconut and pecans. Transfer to two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 70-75 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
