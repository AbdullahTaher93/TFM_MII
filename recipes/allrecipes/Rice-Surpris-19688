In a saucepan bring salted water to a boil. Add rice, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Rinse, drain, and chill the cooked rice. In a small glass or metal mixing bowl, whip the cream, adding sugar gradually until the cream becomes fluffy. Then, fold the whipped cream and drained pineapple into the chilled, cooked rice. Spoon the mixture into dessert dishes and serve.
