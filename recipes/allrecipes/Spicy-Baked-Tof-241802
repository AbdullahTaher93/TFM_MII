Mix vinegar, ketchup, peanut butter, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, ground ginger, cayenne pepper, and black pepper together in a small, microwave-safe bowl. Heat vinegar mixture in microwave oven until the peanut butter is softened, 10 to 15 seconds; stir mixture until smooth. Put tofu into a large bowl. Pour sauce over the tofu and stir to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes to a full day, stirring occasionally to assure tofu remains coated in sauce. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread tofu onto a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake in preheated oven until slightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes.
