Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish. Dissolve chicken bouillon cubes in water in a large pot; bring to a boil. Cook macaroni in the boiling water until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain. Layer about half the macaroni in the bottom of the prepared baking dish; top with about half the diced smoked ham. Repeat layers. Whisk eggs, half-and-half, salt, and white pepper together in a bowl; pour over the noodle and ham layers. Top everything with Cheddar cheese. Bake in preheated oven until the cheese is melted and browning around the edges, about 35 minutes.
