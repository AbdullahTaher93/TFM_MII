Combine ancho, cumin, cinnamon, black pepper, oregano, and salt with 2 teaspoons vegetable oil. Rub on chicken to evenly coat. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken; sear 1 minute per side. Transfer to a baking dish (or leave in the pan if it is oven-proof), and roast in a 350 degrees F oven for about 20 minutes or until chicken is done. Serve whole breasts or slice diagonally.
