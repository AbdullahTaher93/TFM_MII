Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. Whisk almond meal, flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl; add blueberries and stir to coat. Make a well in the center of the blueberry mixture; pour applesauce, almond milk, honey, and coconut oil into well and stir until batter is just combined. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
