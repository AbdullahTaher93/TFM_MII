Spoon ice cream into pie crust; cover and freeze for 15 minutes. In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and confectioners' sugar until smooth; fold in whipped topping. Spread over pie. Using the back of a spoon, make an 8-in. diameter well in the center of the pie for the pie filling. Cover and freeze for 3-4 hours or until firm. May be frozen for up to 2 months. Just before serving, spoon pie filling into the well; drizzle with chocolate syrup. Serve immediately.
