Combine pickles, onion, and celery in a food processor; pulse to a medium-fine consistency. Add ham; pulse into pieces about 1/4 inch in diameter. Stir ham mixture, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, and Cajun seasoning together in a bowl. Divide ham salad mixture over 4 slices of rye bread; lay 2 lettuce leaves over each. Cover with remaining bread slices.
