Mix black beans, kidney beans, great northern beans, diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, feta cheese, red onion, Greek seasoning, and garlic powder in a bowl. Whisk olive oil, balsamic vinegar, honey mustard, and Worcestershire sauce in a separate bowl; pour over bean mixture. Toss to coat. Refrigerate for about 2 hours for best flavor.
