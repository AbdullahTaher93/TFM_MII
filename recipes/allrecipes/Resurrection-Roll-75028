Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Give each child a triangle of crescent rolls. The crescent roll represents the cloth that Jesus' body was wrapped in when he was taken off the cross. Give each child a marshmallow. This represents the body Jesus. Have the children dip their marshmallow in melted butter. This represents the oils of embalming. Now dip the buttered marshmallow in the cinnamon and sugar which represents the spices used to anoint the body. Then wrap up the coated marshmallow tightly in the crescent roll. Make sure all seams are pinched together well otherwise the marshmallow will 'ooze' out of the seams. This represents the wrapping of Jesus' body after death. Bake for 10-12 minutes in the preheated oven. (The oven represents the tomb - pretend like it was three days!) Let the rolls cool slightly. The children can open their rolls (cloth) and discover that Jesus is no longer there. When cooked, the marshmallow melts leaving only the puffed crescent roll and an empty inside. This demonstrates how Jesus rose from the dead. All that remained in the tomb were the linen wrappings.
