Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes; drain and run under cold water to prevent sticking. Whisk olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice, and honey together in a bowl until dressing is smooth. Mix pasta, avocados, green bell pepper, carrot, green onions, celery, garlic, basil, parsley, and cilantro together in a bowl. Drizzle dressing over pasta mixture and toss to coat. Add lemon zest, salt, and pepper to pasta salad. Serve at room temperature.
