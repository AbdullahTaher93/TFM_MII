Heat oil in a wok over high heat. Reduce heat to medium, and place beans in the wok. Cover, and cook 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with garlic salt, garlic powder, pepper, and minced onion. When beans are almost tender, mix in cocktail onions with liquid. Continue cooking 5 minutes, until heated through.
