Bring 2 quarts water to a boil in a large soup kettle. Add orzo and boil over medium-high heat until al dente, 9 to 11 minutes. Drain, then cool orzo under cold running water to prevent further cooking. Turn into a medium microwave-safe bowl; set aside. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken livers and saute until just cooked, about 5 minutes. Remove livers from pan and cut into small dice when they are cool enough to handle. Add to cooked orzo. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon butter in same skillet. Add red pepper and saute over medium-high heat until almost softened, about 2 minutes. Add scallions and continue to saute until softened, 2 to 3 minutes more. Add vegetables to pasta, add parsley and basil and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and ground black pepper. To reheat stuffing in microwave-safe bowl, cover with plastic wrap and heat in microwave on high power until very hot, 2 to 4 minutes. (Alternatively, place in a medium saucepan, add 1 to 2 tablespoons water and reheat on stovetop.) Spoon hot stuffing into Cornish hens.
