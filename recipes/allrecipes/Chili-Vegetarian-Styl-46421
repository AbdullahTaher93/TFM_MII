In a large, non stick, stock pot heat olive oil. Saute jalapeno pepper, onion, and red and yellow peppers over medium heat until onions are translucent (5-8 minutes). Add the remaining ingredients and slowly bring to a boil. Cover pot and simmer on low heat for 20 minutes. Serve hot. Chili tastes best when allowed to sit overnight. Refrigerate chili in covered pot overnight. Bring to a boil over a low heat, stirring constantly. Serve with SPLENDA(R) Hearty Corn Cakes.
