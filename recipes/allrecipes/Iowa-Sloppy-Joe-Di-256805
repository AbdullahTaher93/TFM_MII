Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Brown ground beef and onion in large skillet on medium-high heat, about 5 minutes. Drain fat. Stir in broth, seasoning mix, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes or until stock is absorbed, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat. Stir 1 cup of the shredded cheese and cream cheese into the beef mixture. Spoon into a 2-quart baking dish. Sprinkle with remaining 1 cup shredded cheese. Bake 10 to 15 minutes or until cheese is melted. Serve with wavy potato chips or mini toasts.
