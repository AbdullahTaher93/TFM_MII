Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brown turkey in a large skillet over medium heat. Drain fat. Place halved zucchini slices in a baking dish. Pour the ground turkey, spaghetti sauce, and corn on top. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven until zucchini are tender, about 20 to 25 minutes. Uncover, and sprinkle with cheese. Bake, uncovered, about 5 minutes.
