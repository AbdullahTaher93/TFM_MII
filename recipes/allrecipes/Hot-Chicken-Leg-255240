Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan with aluminum foil and place a wire baking rack on top. Fill a large pot with water. Add minced garlic, salt, and pepper; bring to a boil. Add chicken legs; cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain. Arrange chicken legs on the wire rack. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Flip and continue baking until juices run clear, about 20 minutes more. Transfer chicken legs to a slow cooker. Cover with hot pepper sauce and melted butter. Cook on Low until flavors combine, 1 to 2 hours.
