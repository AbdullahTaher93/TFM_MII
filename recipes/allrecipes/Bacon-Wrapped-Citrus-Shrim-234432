Place a pineapple chunk in the inner curve of each shrimp and wrap shrimp with bacon. Secure by threading a toothpick through the bacon. Arrange wrapped shrimp on a baking sheet and drizzle with lime vinaigrette dressing. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat; arrange shrimp on the skillet and fry until bacon is crispy and browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer shrimp to a serving tray and sprinkle with green onion.
