Drain artichokes, reserving marinade. Set aside. In a large skillet heat oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken and garlic. Cook and stir until chicken is brown. Add the reserved artichoke marinade, broth, wine, and dried oregano. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. Stir in artichokes, roasted peppers, olives, and fresh oregano. Heat through. To serve, spoon the chicken mixture over pasta. If desired, sprinkle with feta cheese.
