Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spread chips into a baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until chips are warm, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over chips and bake in the oven until cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Top chips with tomatoes, green onion, bacon, and sour cream.
