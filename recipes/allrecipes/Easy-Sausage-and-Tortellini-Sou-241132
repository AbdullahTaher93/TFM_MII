Stir together chicken stock and pasta sauce in large sauce pan over medium-high heat; bring to a boil. Add sausage and tortellini; stir. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until pasta is tender, 7 to 9 minutes. Stir frequently to prevent tortellini from sticking to bottom of pot. Gently stir chopped spinach into soup; stir gently. Continue cooking until spinach wilts, about 3 more minutes. Serve immediately.
