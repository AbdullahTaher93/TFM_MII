Freeze Camembert cheese for 30 minutes. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Pour flour into a bowl. Beat eggs and milk together in a separate bowl. Pour bread crumbs into a third bowl. Remove cheese from the freezer and cut each round into 6 wedges. Roll each wedge in flour and dip into the egg-milk mixture. Press each wedge into bread crumbs until evenly coated. Fry each breaded wedge in the hot oil until bread crumbs are browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer fried cheese to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon. Serve cranberry sauce on the side.
