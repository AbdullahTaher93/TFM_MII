In a medium bowl, stir together the liverwurst, butter, Worcestershire sauce and green onion. Spoon onto waxed paper and shape into a 3x5 inch rectangle. Chill for at least 30 minutes to set. When set, spread softened cream cheese over the top and sides. Return to the refrigerator and chill for 1/2 hour or until ready to serve.
