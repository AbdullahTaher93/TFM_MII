Heat the broiler. Mix yogurt, garlic, lentils, cucumber, bell pepper, tomato, mint, cumin, curry powder, lemon juice, and olive oil together and season with salt and cayenne pepper to taste. Sprinkle the naans with water, then place under the broiler and toast 1 minute on each side; transfer to individual plates. Spoon the lentil mixture over the warm breads, dividing it equally between them. Sprinkle with the fresh mint, cilantro, and arugula leaves and the grated carrots. Serve at once, with the chutney on the side.
