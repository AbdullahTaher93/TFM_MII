Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add rutabaga and boil until tender, about 30 minutes; drain. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Pour heavy cream into melted butter and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly. Stir Parmesan cheese, nutmeg, and salt into cream until cheese is completely melted, about 3 minutes. Whisk in egg yolk; simmer until sauce is thickened, about 3 more minutes, whisking constantly. Mix rutabaga into the sauce until well coated.
