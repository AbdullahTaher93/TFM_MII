Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper. Wrap bacon around feta cheese cubes and secure with a toothpick; arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Broil in the preheated oven for 3 minutes. Turn pieces and continue broiling until bacon is crispy, about 2 minutes.
