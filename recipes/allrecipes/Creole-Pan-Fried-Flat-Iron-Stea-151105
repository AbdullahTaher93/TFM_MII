Heat a skillet over medium heat. Season the steak with hot pepper sauce. Sprinkle or mist with a little lime juice and season lightly with just a portion of the garlic salt, salt, black pepper and blackened seasoning. Place the steak in the pan and cover with a lid. Cook for about 20 minutes, or to your desired degree of doneness, turning and adding more seasoning every 5 minutes. Remove steaks to a serving platter and keep warm. Stir butter and water into the pan, removing any browned bits from the bottom to make a gravy. Season with additional garlic salt, salt and pepper to taste. Serve steaks with gravy drizzled over them.
