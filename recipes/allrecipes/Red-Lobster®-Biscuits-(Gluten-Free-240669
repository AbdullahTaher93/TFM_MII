Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, 1 teaspoon parsley, onion powder, and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder together in a bowl. Add milk and vegetable oil; stir until smooth. Mix in Cheddar cheese until dough is combined. Roll dough into 2-inch balls and place 2-inches apart on prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir 1/4 cup parsley, melted butter, and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder together in a bowl. Brush butter mixture onto hot biscuits; let biscuits cool 10 to 15 minutes.
