In small bowl, whisk together Sesame Ginger Marinade, ginger and 1 tablespoon pineapple juice; reserve 1/4 cup. In large Ziploc(R) bag, combine pork, 1/2 cup marinade mixture and vegetables. Marinate in refrigerator for 1 hour, turning several times. Remove pork and discard used marinade. On skewers, alternate pork with vegetables and pineapple chunks until all are used. Place kabobs on grill or broiler pan, about 4 inches from heat source. Cook until lightly browned and pork is thoroughly cooked, turning and brushing with reserved marinade mixture.
