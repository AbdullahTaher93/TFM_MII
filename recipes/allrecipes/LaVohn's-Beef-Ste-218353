In a bowl, stir together the flour, black pepper, salt, and garlic powder. Heat canola oil in a skillet over medium heat. Dredge the pieces of beef in the seasoned flour, and brown the beef on all sides in the hot oil. Mix together the water, vegetable broth, beef broth, Cabernet wine, thyme, bay leaves, onion, and garlic in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot. Add the beef, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook the stew until beef is very tender and liquid has reduced, about 1 1/2 hours. Stir in the carrots and potatoes, bring back to a boil, and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 more minutes. Mix the cornstarch in a small bowl with a little water until smooth, and stir into the stew. Simmer until thickened, stirring constantly. Adjust salt and pepper before serving.
