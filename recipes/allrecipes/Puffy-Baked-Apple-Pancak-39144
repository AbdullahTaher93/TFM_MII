PREHEAT oven to 375 degrees F. Spray 10-inch ovenproof skillet lightly with nonstick cooking spray. Place in oven for 10 minutes. PLACE evaporated milk, baking mix, 1 tablespoon sugar, egg yolks, orange juice and cinnamon in blender; blend until smooth. Beat egg whites in large mixer bowl until soft peaks form; gradually add remaining sugar. Beat until stiff peaks form. Fold milk mixture into egg whites. POUR batter into hot skillet. Gently push each apple slice about 1/2 inch into batter, peel side up, to form a spoke-like pattern around batter. Sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until set. Serve immediately.
