Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Prepare 4 pieces of parchment paper or aluminum foil for papillotes. Put spinach, with water still clinging to its leaves, into a large pot. Cover; steam the spinach over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until just wilted, about 5 minutes. Drain; when cool enough to handle, press out excess liquid. Chop and place in a small bowl. Stir in garlic. Place one quarter of the spinach mixture in the center of one half of each opened paper heart. Lay a sole fillet over the spinach and arrange tomato slices over the sole. Season with salt and pepper. Seal the packages and place them on a baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the packages are puffed. (You may want to open one package to check that the fish is opaque.) Transfer the packages to individual plates; let each diner open his or her own package.
