To Make Plum Sauce: Combine the plum jam, plums and vinegar in 1-quart saucepan. Mix together and cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until plums are tender. Set aside and keep warm. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Cook chicken in oil for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until no longer pink in center. Stir in remaining ingredients except tortillas. Cook 4 to 6 minutes, stirring constantly, until cabbage is crisp-tender. Warm tortillas. Place 1/3 cup of the chicken mixture on each tortilla; roll tortilla around filling. Serve wraps with Plum Sauce.
