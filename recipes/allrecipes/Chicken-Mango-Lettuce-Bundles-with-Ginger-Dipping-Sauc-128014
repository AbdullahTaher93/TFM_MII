In a medium bowl, toss chicken with scallions, basil, mint, oil, lime juice, and salt and pepper to taste. In a small bowl, whisk together dipping sauce ingredients. Place about 1/3 cup chicken salad in a lettuce leaf. Top with strips of red bell pepper and mango, bean sprouts, basil and mint leaves, and a squeeze of lime. Roll lettuce up to enclose ingredients and dip into sauce before eating.
