In a large bowl, combine pecans, flour and 1 cup sugar; set aside. In a small mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add remaining sugar, beating until stiff peaks form. Fold in vanilla and half of the flour mixture. Fold in remaining flour mixture. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls 2 in. apart onto ungreased foil-lined baking sheets. Top each with a cherry piece. Bake at 325 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Cool completely before removing from pans.
