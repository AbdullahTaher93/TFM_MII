In a medium bowl, cover the cellophane noodles with hot water and let stand until soft, 30 minutes. Drain and cover with a damp paper towel until ready to use. Light a grill. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper and grill over moderately high heat until they're just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Let cool, then cut each shrimp in half lengthwise. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk the soy sauce with the rice vinegar, honey, garlic, ginger, sesame seeds and scallion, if using, and sesame oil. Soak 1 wrapper in hot water until pliable. Lay the wrapper on a cutting board and blot dry. Arrange 2 pieces of romaine on the bottom third of the wrapper. Top with some of the cellophane noodles, shrimp, mint, cilantro and carrot. Roll up the wrapper, tucking in the ends as you roll. Cover with a damp paper towel. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and fillings. Cut each roll in half and serve with the dipping sauce.
