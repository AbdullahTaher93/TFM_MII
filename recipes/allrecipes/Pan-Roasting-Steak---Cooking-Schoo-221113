Rub 1/4 teaspoon olive oil on each side of each steak. Season steaks with salt and pepper. Allow steaks to rest at room temperature for 15 minutes. Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Place a 10-inch oven proof skillet or cast-iron skillet in the oven as it preheats. When oven reaches 500 degrees F (260 degrees C), use a baking mitt to remove the pan from oven. Transfer the skillet onto the stove top over high heat. Arrange steaks in the middle of the hot, dry skillet. Cook until browned, 1 to 2 minutes; turn steaks with tongs, and cook another 1 to 2 minutes. Place the skillet on the center rack in the preheated oven. Roast to your desired degree of doneness, 3 to 5 minutes. For medium, an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Transfer the cooked steaks to a warm platter and tent loosely with aluminum foil. Let meat rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Heat the skillet used to prepare the steaks over medium heat. Add red wine and bring to a boil, scraping any browned bits off the bottom of the skillet. Let the liquid boil until reduced to approximately 1/3 cup, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove skillet from the heat. Add butter to the pan, swirling to incorporate into the sauce. Season with salt and pepper.
