Spray the inside of a large slow cooker with cooking spray. Stir butter and 1/2 the ranch dressing mix together in a bowl until completely combined. Carefully loosen each side of the skin of the turkey breast and spread the butter-ranch mixture under the skin. Transfer turkey, skin-side up, to the slow cooker. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 ranch dressing mix over turkey breast. Lay bacon strips evenly across turkey. Pour beer around turkey breast. Cook in the slow cooker set to High for 1 hour. Reduce heat to Low and cook until turkey is tender, 6 to 8 hours.
