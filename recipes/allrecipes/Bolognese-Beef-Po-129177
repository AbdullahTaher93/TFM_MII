Place the ground beef, onion, and garlic in a large saucepan over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the beef is broken up and evenly brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the potatoes, tomatoes with their juice, stock, half the lemon zest, the sugar, and a little seasoning. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat, and cover the pan. Simmer, stirring once or twice so the potatoes cook evenly, 10 minutes. Stir in the fennel, frozen beans, and lemon juice. Cover the pan again and simmer until the potatoes are tender and the fennel and beans are tender-crisp, about 5 minutes longer. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary. Spoon the mixture into serving bowls and garnish with the remaining lemon zest, the chopped fennel leaves, and flat-leaf parsley.
