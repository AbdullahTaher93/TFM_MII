In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, egg, sugar and salt until smooth. Stir in chocolate chips; set aside. For batter, combine water, oil, vinegar and vanilla in another mixing bowl. Combine remaining ingredients; add to the liquid mixture and beat well (batter will be thin). Spoon about 2 teaspoons of batter into greased or paper-lined miniature muffin cups. Top with about 1 teaspoon of filling. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-23 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in chocolate portion comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes; remove to wire racks to cool completely.
