Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. When cool, chop the bacon. Place the kernels of corn into a large skillet over high heat, and sprinkle the cumin, sea salt, and cayenne pepper over the corn. Turn the corn gently over with a spatula as it cooks, then stir in the onion, red bell pepper, and garlic. Stir the corn mixture every few minutes, until it begins to stick in the pan. Pour the beer into the pan to help unstick the corn, stir, and cook until the corn is dark with very dark spots, and the onion and red bell pepper are soft, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat, and sprinkle with chopped bacon, cotija cheese, and cilantro.
