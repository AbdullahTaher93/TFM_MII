Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium heat; saute onion and garlic until onion is tender, about 4 minutes. Add 1/2 cup coconut milk and stir continuously for 2 minutes. Stir curry paste into onion mixture until smooth, about 2 minutes. Pour chicken stock into onion mixture and increase heat to medium-high; cook until simmering, 3 to 4 minutes. Add soy sauce, fish sauce, and remaining 1/2 cup coconut milk; cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add angel hair pasta, cover pot with lid, and cook until pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Stir basil into soup.
