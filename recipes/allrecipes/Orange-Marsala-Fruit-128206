Halve the cantaloupe and remove the seeds. Using a melon baller, scoop the cantaloupe into balls or remove the rind and cut the cantaloupe into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces. In large bowl, combine the orange juice, Marsala (if using), sugar, and orange zest. Add the cantaloupe, peaches, nectarines, and cherries, and stir to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 15 minutes, or longer if desired, to macerate the fruits. To serve, spoon the fruit into a serving bowl or 4 dessert bowls or glasses. Garnish with mint leaves and strips of orange zest, if desired.
