In a 1- to 2-quart pan on medium-high heat, stir coconut milk and sugar until sugar dissolves; cover and refrigerate until cold (at least 45 minutes). Cut flesh from melon; discard seeds. Puree flesh in a blender or food processor; pour through a fine strainer into a glass measure (you will need 6 cups). In a large bowl, combine the 6 cups puree, coconut mixture, and lemon or lime juice. Pour mixture into 1 or 2 (for faster freezing) 9- by 13-inch metal pans. Cover airtight; freeze until solid, 6 to 8 hours, or up to 2 weeks. Let stand at room temperature to soften slightly, 20 to 30 minutes. With a heavy spoon, break into chunks. Beat with an electric mixer or in a food processor until you have a smooth slush. Return to 1 pan, cover, and freeze until firm, about 2 hours, or store up to 1 week. Scoop into bowls (if sorbet is hard, hold at room temperature 15 to 20 minutes).
