Peel shrimp. (If shrimp are frozen, do not thaw; peel in cold water.) Make a shallow cut lengthwise down back of each shrimp; wash out vein. In a saucepan bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil. Add 1/2 cup rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Melt butter in 3-quart saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour. Cook about 6 minutes, stirring constantly, until bubbly and brown. Stir in onion, bell pepper, celery and garlic. Cook about 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until vegetables are crisp-tender. Stir in shrimp and remaining ingredients except rice. Heat to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer uncovered about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are pink and firm. Serve over rice.
