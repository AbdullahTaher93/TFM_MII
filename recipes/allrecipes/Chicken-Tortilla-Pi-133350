In a medium nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon EVOO, 1 turn of the pan, over medium-high heat. Add the ground chicken and cook, stirring, until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the zucchini and bell pepper, then the cumin, coriander and pepper; season with salt. Cook over medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in the lime juice. In a medium saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon EVOO, 1 turn of the pan, over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, onion and jalapenos and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the beer and boil to reduce by half, about 3 minutes. Add the tomatillos and simmer for 6 to 7 minutes. Heat a large skillet over high heat and blister the tortillas, about 30 seconds on each side. Preheat the broiler to high. Brush the inside of an 8-inch round cake pan with the remaining 1 tablespoon EVOO, 1 turn of the pan. Place a tortilla in the pan, then top with one-third of the chicken, one-quarter of the tomatillo sauce and 1/2 cup cheese. Repeat the layering 2 more times. Top with the remaining tortilla, tomatillo sauce and cheese. Broil for 2 minutes until the cheese is melted.
