Cook the sausage in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until it's well browned, stirring often. Stir in the celery, onion, peppers, garlic and thyme and cook until the vegetables are tender. Stir in the brown rice, wild rice and stock and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 45 minutes or until the sausage is cooked through and the rice is tender. Stir in the parsley.
