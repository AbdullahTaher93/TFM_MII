In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil. Saute pecans until toasted. Remove to a small bowl. Stir 1/3 cup Honey Mustard Sauce into pecans. Set aside. Cut fish into serving size pieces. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spread one side with Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce. Saute sauce side down over medium-high heat until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Spread top with more sauce. If pan is too dry, add more oil. Turn and saute until brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes. Remove to plates. Top each fillet with Honey-Mustard Pecan Sauce.
