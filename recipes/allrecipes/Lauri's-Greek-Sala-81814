Cut the cucumber into bite-sized cubes. I like to retain the skin and the seeds, but you can remove them if you prefer. Remove the stems and the white membrane from the peppers and slice them into bite-sized pieces. Mince the scallions and rough chop the parsley. Cut the olives in halves. Mix all these together in a bowl. Whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, oregano and garlic powder. Pour 2/3 of the dressing over the vegetables and toss. Line 4 salad plates with the red leaf lettuce. Spoon the vegetables over the lettuce. Crumble 1 tablespoon of feta over each plate then drizzle the remaining dressing over each plate.
