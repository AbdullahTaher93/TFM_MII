Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Grease 14-inch pizza pan. Unroll dough; place in greased pan. Starting at center, press out dough to edge of pan. Bake at 425 degrees F for 6 to 8 minutes or until crust begins to brown. Meanwhile, in medium bowl, combine eggs, salt and pepper; beat well. Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat. Add eggs; cook 1 to 2 minutes or until firm but still moist, stirring frequently. Remove partially baked crust from oven. Spoon and spread eggs over crust. Top with ham, chiles and cheese. Return to oven; bake an additional 8 to 12 minutes or until crust is deep golden brown. Sprinkle with cilantro.
