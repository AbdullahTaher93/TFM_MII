Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl, stir together flour, brown sugar, baking powder, nutmeg and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. In a separate bowl, toss cranberries with sugar; add to flour mixture along with orange peel and nuts. Mix lightly. In another bowl, beat together cream and egg; slowly pour into dry ingredients, mixing with rubber scraper until dough forms. Knead dough 4 or 5 times, being careful not to over handle. Divide dough in half. Turn out onto lightly floured surface. Shape each half into a 6 inch circle. Cut each circle into 6 wedges. Place scones on lightly greased baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
