Stir beer, lemon juice, seafood seasoning, thyme, and hot pepper sauce together in a non-reactive saucepan; bring to a boil and add shrimp. Return liquid to a simmer and cook shrimp until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 3 minutes. Remove pan from heat and let shrimp sit in liquid at least 5 minutes more before draining. Let shrimp cool until cool enough to touch.
