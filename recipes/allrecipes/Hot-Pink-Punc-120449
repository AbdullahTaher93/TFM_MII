In a saucepan, combine the cranberries and 4 cups water. Cook over medium heat until berries pop, about 15 minutes. Cool slightly. Press through a strainer; discard skins. Set cranberry mixture aside. In a large saucepan, combine the sugar, red-hots, cloves, orange juice, lemon juice and 4 cups water. Cook and stir until sugar is dissolved and red-hots are melted. Stir in cranberry mixture. Add enough remaining water to achieve desired concentration; heat through. Discard cloves before serving.
