Lightly coat the inside of a slow cooker with olive oil and place the brisket in the bottom of the cooker. Sprinkle in the onion, garlic, and basil; season with salt and pepper. Pour the chicken broth and water. Cook on LOW, covered, until brisket is tender, 6 to 10 hours, basting meat several times to moisten.
