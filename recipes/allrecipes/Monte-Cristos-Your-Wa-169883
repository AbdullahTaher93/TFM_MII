Prepare desired sandwiches. Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, water and egg in shallow bowl. Heat 1/2 inch oil in large skillet over medium heat until a drop of batter sizzles. Dip sandwiches one at a time in batter, allowing excess to drip off. Cook sandwiches in hot oil 4 to 6 minutes, turning once, or until both sides are golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Serve sprinkled with powdered sugar, if you like.
