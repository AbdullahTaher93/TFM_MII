Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the almonds in a pie plate. Toast for about 5 minutes, or until the almonds are lightly golden. Let cool. Meanwhile, using a sturdy vegetable peeler, peel the peaches; transfer the skins to a small saucepan. Add the water, sugar and mint sprigs and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to moderately low and simmer for 10 minutes. Cut the peaches into small wedges and transfer them to a heatproof bowl. Strain the syrup over the peach wedges and let stand for 5 minutes. Divide the peaches among 4 bowls and spoon the syrup on top. Garnish each serving with the Petit Suisse, sprinkle with the toasted almonds and shredded mint and serve.
