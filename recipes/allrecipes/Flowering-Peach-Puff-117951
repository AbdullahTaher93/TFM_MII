On a lightly floured surface; roll pastry to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut out six circles with a floured 3-1/2-in round cookie cutter. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Cut leaves from the scraps, using a floured 1-1/2-in. leaf-shaped cookie cutter; place on baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks to cool. In a large bowl, toss peaches with sugar; set aside. In a small mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, confectioners' sugar and vanilla until smooth. Fold in the whipped topping. Split pastry circles in half. Spread about 2 tablespoons cream cheese mixture over the bottom half of each; replace tops. Spread about 1 tablespoon cream cheese mixture on the top of each. Arrange peach slices in an overlapping circular pattern on the cream cheese layer. Garnish each with a raspberry and puff pastry leaves.
