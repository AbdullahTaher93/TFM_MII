Cook rice according to package directions. Combine shredded chicken and buffalo sauce in a bowl. Microwave tortillas on microwave-safe plate covered with a damp paper towel on High until warm and pliable, about 20 to 30 seconds. Evenly divide rice among four tortillas and spreading out to within 1/2 inch of the edges. Top rice with chicken mixture. Sprinkle about 2 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese over chicken mixture; top with shredded lettuce. Fold in the sides of the tortilla and begin to roll tightly; repeat for each wrap. Cut in half, diagonally. (Or wrap in foil and refrigerate if serving later.) Serve each wrap with baby carrots and celery sticks and about 1/4 cup ranch dressing for dipping.
