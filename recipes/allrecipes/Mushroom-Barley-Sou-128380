In a small saucepan, bring the dried mushrooms and water to a boil. Remove and let stand for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, coat a Dutch oven with nonstick spray. Add the onion, carrots, and celery. Coat lightly with nonstick spray. Set over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes. Add the sliced mushrooms and oregano. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until all the vegetables are soft. Add the broth, barley, and salt. Cook for 10 minutes. Line a fine mesh sieve with a coffee filter or paper towel. Strain the dried mushroom water into the pot. Remove and discard the filter or paper towel. Rinse the dried mushrooms under running water to remove any grit. Chop and add to the pot. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the barley is tender.
