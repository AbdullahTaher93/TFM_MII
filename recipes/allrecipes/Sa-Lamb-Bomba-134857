Heat the oil in a skillet. Add the onion and saute over medium-low heat until soft (about 5 minutes), stirring occasionally. Add the tomatoes and lamb. Saute for 2 minutes. Add the chicken broth, coconut milk, spices, and almonds. Stir and bring to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 10 minutes or until the mixture is thick like gravy. Try eating this with brown rice or mashed potatoes.
