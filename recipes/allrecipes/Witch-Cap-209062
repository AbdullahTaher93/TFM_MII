Measure 1 cup of chocolate frosting. Frost the cookies and then place one chocolate ice cream cone on top of each cookie. Cover the cones with the frosting, and then arrange M&M'S Brand Chocolate Candies in random patterns. To make the brim of the cap as shown: sort 32 STARBURST Fruit Chews into 4 piles, making sure each pile is the same color. Unwrap them, flatten them slightly, and then snip into thin strips, resembling fringe. Arrange the fringe around the cones for hair. Otherwise, make the cap's rim with either candy corn or licorice laces that have been cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces and place them side-by-side around the base of the cone.
