Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a small loaf pan with cooking spray. Mix ice cream, flour, and sugar together in a bowl; pour into the greased loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool bread in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
