Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Remove crust from wrapper and spread pesto over crust; top with a layer of spinach leaves, chopped tomato, shredded mozzarella cheese and feta cheese. Place pizza on a baking sheet. Bake pizza in the preheated oven until the spinach leaves are wilted and the cheese is melted, bubbling, and beginning to brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
