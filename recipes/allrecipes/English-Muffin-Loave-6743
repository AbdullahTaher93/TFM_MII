In a small saucepan, heat the milk and water until very warm. Combine 3 cups flour, yeast, sugar, salt, and soda in a large bowl. Add the warm milk and water, and beat well. Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a stiff batter. Spoon into two 9 x 5 inch loaf pans that have been greased and dusted with the cornmeal. Cover, and let rise in a warm place for 45 minutes. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 25 minutes. Remove from pans immediately, and let cool.
