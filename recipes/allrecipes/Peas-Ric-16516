Wash and drain the rice. Heat a saucepan over a medium heat. Add butter or margarine and let melt. Stir in cloves, cinnamon, Serrano chile, and ginger. Saute briefly. Mix in rice and stir to coat it evenly. Stir in peas, salt, and sugar. Pour in water and bring the water to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer and let rice cook covered for 15 to 20 minutes; or until rice is tender.
