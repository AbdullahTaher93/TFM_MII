In a large heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, cornstarch and cinnamon. Stir in eggs, sour cream and raisins. Cook and stir over medium heat for 8-10 minutes or until a thermometer reads 160 degrees F; set aside to cool slightly. Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the flour oats, brown sugar, baking soda and salt. Cut in margarine until crumbly. Firmly press 3-1/2 cups of crumb mixture into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Spread with warm raisin filling. Sprinkle with remaining crumb mixture. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. Cut into bars. Refrigerate leftovers.
