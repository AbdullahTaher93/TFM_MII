Finely shred the cabbage in a food processor or with a sharp knife. In a large bowl, add 4 or 5 of the raspberries and smash them with the back of a spoon. Add the vinegar and Splenda and mix well. Whisk in the walnut oil, adding it slowly. This step can also be done in a food processor. Toss the cabbage in with the vinaigrette. Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour. Right before serving, toss in the walnuts. Garnish with the remaining raspberries and serve.
