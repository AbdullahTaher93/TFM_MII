Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Crumble ground beef into the pot; cook and stir until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add water, corn, tomatoes, ranch-style beans, potatoes, onion, green bell pepper, celery, chili powder, sugar, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper to the beef; stir. Cover the pot and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook at a simmer until potatoes are tender, about 1 hour.
