Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly oil an 8x8 inch pan. In a skillet over medium heat, brown the chorizo. Remove from heat, and set aside to cool completely. In a medium bowl, stir together chorizo and cheese. Divide mixture into four equal measures, and place a portion in the center of each chicken breast. Fold in the sides of the chicken breasts, and roll up. Roll stuffed breasts in masa harina, and place seam-side down into the oiled pan. Spray the tops lightly with cooking spray. Bake in a preheated oven until browned, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven, cool slightly, and top each chicken roll with 1/4 cup salsa.
