In a mixing bowl, cream butter and brown sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture. Stir in walnuts. Divide batter in half. Stir chocolate into one portion; spread into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Spread remaining batter evenly over top. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until brownies begin to pull away from sides of pan. Cool on a wire rack. In a saucepan, melt butter and chocolate. Remove from the heat. Stir in confectioners' sugar, vanilla and enough milk to reach spreading consistency. Frost cooled brownies; cut.
