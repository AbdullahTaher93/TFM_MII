Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Combine panko bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, lemon pepper, thyme, parsley, granulated garlic, and lemon zest in a bowl. Arrange salmon on the prepared baking sheet and brush with melted butter. Sprinkle bread crumb mixture evenly over salmon fillets. Bake in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes.
