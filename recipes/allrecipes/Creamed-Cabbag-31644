Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium saucepan over medium heat, blend milk, flour, butter, salt and pepper. Stir constantly until a thick white sauce has formed. In a separate medium saucepan over boiling water, steam cabbage until tender but firm. In a small baking dish, alternate layers of sauce, cabbage and Romano cheese. Bake approximately 30 minutes, until sauce and cheese are bubbly.
