Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Rinse squash and cut each in half lengthwise; scoop out and discard seeds. Place squash halves, cut side down, in a lightly oiled 10- by 15-inch pan. Bake until squash is just tender when pierced, about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, squeeze moisture from spinach. In a bowl, mix spinach, 1 cup of the cheese, the walnuts, and salt and pepper to taste. With tongs or a spatula, turn squash halves over and spoon spinach mixture equally into cavities. Sprinkle equally with remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Return squash to oven and bake until cheese melts and filling is hot in the center, 15 to 20 minutes.
