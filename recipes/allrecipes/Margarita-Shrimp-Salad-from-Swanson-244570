Grate 2 teaspoons zest and squeeze 1 tablespoon juice from the lime. Stir the lime juice, lime zest, and garlic in a 2-quart shallow, nonmetallic baking dish or a gallon-size resealable plastic bag. Add the shrimp and toss to coat. Cover the dish or seal the bag and refrigerate for 30 minutes, turning the shrimp over several times during the marinating time. Heat the broth in a 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat to a boil. Add the pepper and onion and cook until the vegetables are tender-crisp, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the shrimp and marinade to the saucepan and heat to a boil. Cook until the shrimp are cooked through. Stir in the cilantro. Divide the lettuce, tomatoes and shrimp mixture among 4 serving plates. Season with the black pepper.
