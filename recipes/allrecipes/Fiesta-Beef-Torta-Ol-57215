Prepare dough as follows: In a large bowl of an electric mixer, mix 3/4 cup flour, cornmeal, brown sugar, yeast, garlic salt and 1 teaspoon taco seasoning. In saucepan, combine milk, 1/3 cup water and margarine; heat over low heat until mixture is very warm (120 degrees to 130 degrees). Margarine does not need to be melted. Add mixture gradually to dry ingredients and beat 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a stiff dough. Turn out on a lightly floured board; knead until smooth and elastic, 5 to 8 minutes. While dough rises, prepare the beef filling. Brown ground beef slowly in large frying pan; drain, if necessary. Add remaining taco seasoning and 1 cup water; simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add beans and cheese, blend well. Cool slightly. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Generously grease a 9-inch springform pan. Fold a 30 x 6-inch piece of heavy tin foil in half lengthwise; fasten foil around top of the pan to form a collar extending about 2 1/2 inches above the rim of the pan (as for souffle); generously grease inside of foil. Dust bottom and sides of pan with cornmeal; discard excess. Punch down dough; divide into three pieces. Pat or roll our each piece of dough to form a 9-inch circle. Fit first round into prepared pan and press at the edge to form a slight rim. Spoon in half of the beef filling, spread evenly almost to edge of pan. Top with a second round of dough on the top; cover and let rise in a warm place until dough is puffed, 25-35 minutes. Score top of torta with a sharp knife into 8 wedges. Brush with reserved egg and sprinkle with pine nuts, if desired. Bake 40 minutes or until dough is deep golden brown. Remove foil and springform rim from torta; place torta on serving platter. Surround with a ring of shredded lettuce, garnished with cherry tomatoes and olives. Heat taco sauce; serve with torta.
