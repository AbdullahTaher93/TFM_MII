Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place potato chunks into a 9x13-inch baking dish, drizzle with olive oil, and toss potatoes to coat. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove from oven, and stir cremini mushrooms, onion, honey, rosemary, thyme, sage, mustard powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper into the potatoes. Return baking dish to oven and bake until mushrooms and potatoes are tender, about 15 more minutes.
