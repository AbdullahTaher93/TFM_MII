Place cheese wheel in a shallow ovenproof casserole or pan 2 inches wider than the cheese. Spoon prepared green salsa 1/2 inch deep around cheese. Dust cheese with chili powder (use a stencil if desired). Bake in a 400 degrees F oven until melted in center, 8 to 10 minutes. (Or heat in a microwave oven at full power, 100%, for 4 to 6 minutes.) Keep hot on an electric warming tray or over a candle warmer. To serve, offer tortilla chips so guests can spoon cheese and salsa on top.
