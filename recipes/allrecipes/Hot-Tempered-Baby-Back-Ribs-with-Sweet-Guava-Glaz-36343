Combine brown sugar and spices in a small bowl; reserve 2 tablespoons spice mixture. Rub remaining spice mixture on ribs; coat well. Place ribs in a single layer on an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet (17x11-inch) or roasting pan. Pour water into pan; cover with foil. Bake at 375 degrees F for 1 hour, or until meat starts to pull away from bones. Meanwhile, combine jelly and reserved spice mixture. Brush steamed ribs with jelly mixture. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour or overnight, if desired. Grill or broil 3-5 minutes per side, or until heated through and nicely browned.
