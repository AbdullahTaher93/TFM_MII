In a bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. Transfer to an 8-in. square baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle with cheese. In another bowl, whisk the biscuit mix, eggs and milk until smooth; pour over cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until set and a thermometer inserted near the center reads 160 degrees F. Let stand for 5 minutes before cutting.
