Mix Gravy Mix, flour and sage in large saucepan. Gradually stir in water, turkey broth and juice with wire whisk until smooth. Stirring frequently, cook on medium-high heat until gravy comes to boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer 5 minutes or until thickened, stirring occasionally. (Gravy will continue to thicken upon standing.)
