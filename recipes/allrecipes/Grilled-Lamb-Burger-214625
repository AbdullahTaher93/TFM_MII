Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Mix the lamb, egg, oregano, sherry, vinegar, red pepper flakes, garlic, green onions, mint, cilantro, bread crumbs, salt, and pepper together in a mixing bowl with your hands until evenly blended. Form into five patties. Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Serve on buns.
