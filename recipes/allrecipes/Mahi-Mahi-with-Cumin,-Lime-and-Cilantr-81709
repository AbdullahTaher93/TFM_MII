Rinse fish and pat dry. Mix the cumin, garlic salt and paprika. Sprinkle herbs over both sides of fillets. Lightly pat to be sure herbs stick to the fish. In a large nonstick skillet, melt 1/2 of the butter over medium-high heat. Add fillets and saute for 1-2 minutes, then turn over. Fish should be cook for a total of about 4 minutes per 1/2 inch thickness (at the thickest part). Transfer fish to a platter and cover. Add remaining butter, lime juice and cilantro to the skillet. Heat until butter melts. Pour sauce over fish and serve.
