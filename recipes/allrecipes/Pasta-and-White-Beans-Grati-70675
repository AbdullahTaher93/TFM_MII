Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling water until done. Drain, and set aside. Meanwhile mince basil and garlic with Parmesan cheese. Transfer to a medium bowl, and mix with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Mix in ricotta. In a saucepan, cook onions with thyme and bay leaf in 1 tablespoon olive oil. Stir in beans and balsamic vinegar, and simmer for 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine beans, tomatoes, and pasta in a well oiled 2 quart casserole dish. Place spoonfuls of the ricotta mixture in the pasta and beans, and press down to cover. In a small bowl, moisten bread crumbs with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and sprinkle over casserole. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until hot and bubbly.
