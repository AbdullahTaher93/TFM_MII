Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the oil over moderately high heat. Season the chicken thighs and drumsticks with 14 teaspoon of the salt and the pepper. Cook the chicken until browned, turning, about 8 minutes in all. Remove. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat from the pot. Reduce the heat to moderate and stir in the flour. Whisk in the cider and the broth and bring to a simmer, scraping the bottom of the pot to dislodge any brown bits. Add the onion, parsnips, carrots, thyme, and the remaining 12 teaspoon of salt. Simmer, partially covered, for 10 minutes. Return the chicken to the pot. Bring the stew back to a simmer, cover, and put in the preheated oven until the chicken is done and the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.
