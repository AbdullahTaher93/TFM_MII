Scrub potatoes, leave skin on. In a large saucepan, cover potatoes with water and salt, bring to a boil, over high heat. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until tender about 20 minutes. Drain. In a saucepan, over medium low heat, sautee green onions in margarine until soft, about 3 minutes. Add dill and sprinkle flour over onion, stir until blended. Slowly stir in milk, bring to a boil, and cook until thickened. Add potatoes, salt, and stir just until potatoes are coated.
