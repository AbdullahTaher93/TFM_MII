Combine flour, salt, sugar, dry milk, butter or margarine, yeast, and warm water. Gather into a ball. Turn out an a lightly floured surface, and knead until the dough is smooth. Place in a well oiled bowl, and turn to coat the surface. Cover with a damp cloth, and place in a warm spot for 2 hours. Punch down the dough. Roll out to fit a 14 inch pizza pan. Allow to rise until doubled in size. Bake at 375 degrees F ( 190 degrees C) until crust is a very light brown color. Remove from oven. Place desired toppings on the pizza. Bake for 20 minutes, or until toppings are done.
