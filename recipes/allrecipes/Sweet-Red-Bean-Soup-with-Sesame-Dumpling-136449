Rinse and pick over beans. Place beans in a medium saucepan and add 4 1/2 quarts cold water to cover beans. Bring water to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until very tender, about 2 hours, adding more water if needed to maintain water level at about 1 inch above the beans. Add brown sugar and lotus seeds and set aside. Fill another large saucepan with water and bring to a boil. Drop the dumplings into the water and carefully stir up the dumplings from the bottom of the pot to prevent them from sticking. When the water comes to a boil, add 1/4 cup cold water to the pot, and return to a boil. When dumplings rise to the top, about 3 minutes, remove with a slotted spoon and place 2 into each of the 10 individual bowls that have been filled with red bean soup.
