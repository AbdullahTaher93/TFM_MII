Beat butter and sugars in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Blend in melted chocolate and vanilla. Gradually add flour mixture, beating well after each addition. Stir in almonds. Divide dough in half. On floured board, shape each half into 10x2-inch log.
