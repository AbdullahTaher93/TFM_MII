Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until crisp. Stir in pasta sauce, black pepper and cooked pasta. Spread mixture in prepared dish. In a medium bowl, combine eggs, cream, milk and nutmeg and stir until smooth. Pour gently over macaroni mixture. Sprinkle with mozzarella. Bake in preheated oven 30 minutes, until set and golden brown.
