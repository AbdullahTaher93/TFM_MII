Drain pineapple; reserve 2 tablespoons juice. Soak wooden skewers in water. Stir together reserved juice and barbecue sauce in small bowl; set aside. Thread pineapple chunks, chicken, bell pepper and zucchini onto skewers. Grill or broil 10 to 15 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink, turning and brushing occasionally with barbecue sauce. Heat remaining barbecue sauce in saucepan or microwave until hot. Serve barbecue sauce with kabobs. Serve with coleslaw and green beans, if desired.
