Mix tilapia, avocados, garlic, habanero pepper, cilantro, salt, pepper, and ginger in a bowl. Pour enough lime juice over tilapia mixture to cover completely. Arrange onions over mixture without submerging into the lime juice. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until fish is tender and opaque, at least 4 hours. Spoon ceviche into tortillas.
