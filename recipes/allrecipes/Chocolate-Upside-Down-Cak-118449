In a small saucepan, heat water and butter until butter is melted. Stir in brown sugar; mix well. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Sprinkle with coconut, chocolate chips, pecans and marshmallows. Prepare cake batter according to package directions; carefully pour over marshmallows. Bake at 325 degrees F for 55-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before inverting cake onto a serving plate.
