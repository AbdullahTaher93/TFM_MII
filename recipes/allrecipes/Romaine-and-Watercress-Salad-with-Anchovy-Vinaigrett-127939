Wash and spin-dry the romaine and watercress. Combine the anchovy paste, mustard, and salt, if desired, in a salad bowl. Add the vinegars and mix with a fork. Add the olive oil slowly while whisking constantly. Taste for seasoning, adding more salt, pepper, vinegar, or oil to taste. When ready to serve, add the romaine and watercress, and toss to coat.
