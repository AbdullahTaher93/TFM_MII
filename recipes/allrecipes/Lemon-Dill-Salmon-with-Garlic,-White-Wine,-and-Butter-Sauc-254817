Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix butter, white wine, lemon juice, and garlic together in a small bowl. Pour a small amount of the butter mixture into an 8x8-inch baking pan until bottom is evenly coated; cover with a thin layer of dill. Place salmon, skin side down, into the baking pan. Sprinkle with remaining dill; pour remaining butter mixture over salmon. Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 25 to 35 minutes. Sprinkle generously with almonds before serving.
