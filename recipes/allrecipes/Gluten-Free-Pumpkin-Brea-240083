Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Mix pumpkin puree, sugar, eggs, oil, and applesauce together in a large bowl. Whisk flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger together in a separate bowl; add to pumpkin mixture and stir until just blended into a batter. Gently fold raisins through the batter; pour into prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
