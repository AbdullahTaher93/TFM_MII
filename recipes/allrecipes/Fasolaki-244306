Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until tender, about 10 minutes. Mix remaining olive oil, green beans, tomatoes, potato, mint, parsley, salt, and pepper into onion, adding enough water to cover the whole mixture. Bring liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 1 hour.
