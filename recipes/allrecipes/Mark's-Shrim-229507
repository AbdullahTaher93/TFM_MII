Stir mayonnaise and chili sauce together in a large bowl. Add chile-garlic sauce and stir. Spread cornstarch into a wide dish. Press shrimp into cornstarch to coat in a thin layer. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Deep fry shrimp in batches until the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 5 minutes per batch; drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Combine mayonnaise sauce and shrimp in the large bowl; stir to coat shrimp in the sauce. Line a bowl with lettuce leaves. Pile shrimp into bowl and garnish with green onion to serve.
