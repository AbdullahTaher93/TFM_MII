Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir chicken until juices start to run clear, about 4 minutes. Add zucchini, celery, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir diced tomatoes, chicken broth, sofrito, Cajun seasoning, and red pepper flakes into the pot. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer soup until flavors blend together, 10 to 15 minutes.
