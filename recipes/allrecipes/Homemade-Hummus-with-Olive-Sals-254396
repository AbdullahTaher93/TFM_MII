In food processor or blender, combine chick peas, olive oil, lemon juice, tahini, garlic, 1 tablespoon water, cumin, paprika and Adobo. Puree until mixture is smooth and creamy, about one minute. In medium bowl, combine olives, capers, tomatoes, shallots, parsley and hot sauce. This should make approximately two cups of salsa. Mound salsa in center of large serving dish. Spoon hummus in ring around salsa. (As an alternate presentation, layer hummus, and then salsa, alternating layers, in a shallow dish.) Drizzle with olive oil, if desired. Serve with crackers.
