Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix Mexican cheese blend, eggs, cottage cheese, baking mix, milk, margarine, and green chiles together in a bowl; transfer to the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and bubbling, about 40 minutes.
