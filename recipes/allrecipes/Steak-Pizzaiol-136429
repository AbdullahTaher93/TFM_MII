Generously season steaks on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Working in batches if needed to avoid crowding pan, add the steaks, and sear until browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side; transfer to a plate. Reduce heat to medium; add garlic. Cook, stirring, until golden, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes and oregano. Cook over high heat until sauce is thickened, scraping up browned bits from bottom of pan with a wooden spoon, 8 to 10 minutes. Return steaks and any accumulated juices from plate to skillet; cover, and cook until steaks are just heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. To serve, transfer steaks to plates, and top with sauce and mozzarella; garnish with more oregano.
