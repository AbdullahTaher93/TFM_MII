Place pasta in a large pot of lightly salted boiling water. Cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain. Combine the butter, cream cheese, and half and half in a saucepan. Season with garlic salt and lemon pepper. Bring to a low boil over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring, until thickened slightly. Serve over 12 ounces of pasta.
