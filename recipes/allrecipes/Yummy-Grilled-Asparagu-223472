Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Lay asparagus flat in a 9x9-inch pan. Add Italian dressing, lemon pepper, salt, and black pepper; toss to coat. Transfer asparagus using tongs to the grill. Grill asparagus on preheated grill until tender, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Return asparagus to pan and toss with remaining dressing mixture.
