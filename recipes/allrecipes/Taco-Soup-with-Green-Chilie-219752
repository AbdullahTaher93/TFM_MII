Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground beef and onion. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir the tomato juice, pinto beans, diced tomatoes, and green chiles into the skillet. Bring to a simmer, then stir in the processed cheese food until melted, about 5 minutes.
