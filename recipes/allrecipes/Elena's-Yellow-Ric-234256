Stir water, vegetable oil, garlic, vinegar, turmeric, and salt together in a 2-quart saucepan. Place a cover on the saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil. Slowly stir rice into the boiling mixture. Replace cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer rice mixture until the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Transfer rice to a large bowl. Gently fold peas and carrots into rice.
