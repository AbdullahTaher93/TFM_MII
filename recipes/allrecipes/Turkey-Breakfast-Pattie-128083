In a bowl, combine the turkey, onion, egg substitute, bread crumbs and fennel. Shape the turkey mixture into 8 patties. Coat a large nonstick skillet with nonstick spray and warm the skillet for 1 minute over medium heat. Add the patties and cook until they're browned and no longer pink, about 5 minutes on each side.
