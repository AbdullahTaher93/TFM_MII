Heat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cut chicken into 1/2-inch (1-cm) slices. Heat oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Saute peppers, onions, and chili powder in hot oil until vegetables are slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Place 4 tortillas on a large baking sheet. Evenly spread beans over tortillas. Top with pepper mixture, chicken, and cheese. Top each with another tortilla and press down lightly. Bake until heated through and cheese is melted, about 15 minutes. Cut each quesadilla into quarters and serve with salsa, sour cream, and cilantro, if desired.
