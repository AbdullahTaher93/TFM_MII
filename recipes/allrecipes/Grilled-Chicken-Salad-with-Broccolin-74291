Drop Mann's Broccolini into boiling water. After 3 minutes, drain and rinse with cold water to stop additional cooking. Remove 1/4 cup dressing from jar and toss with chicken breasts. Marinate 1 or 2 hours, if convenient. Discard marinade when ready to cook. If time is short, you can instead use the 1/4 cup dressing as a basting sauce during cooking. Grill or broil chicken until done. Slice crosswise. Line 4 plates with lettuces and arrange Broccolini, pear (or potato) and chicken on top. Sprinkle with nuts and goat cheese. Drizzle with dressing.
