In a medium bowl, whisk together soy sauce, honey, vinegar, ginger, garlic and oil. Place steak in a large, resealable plastic bag. Pour marinade over steak and marinate for 1 hour. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Place steak on grill, cover and cook turning once, until seared on both sides or internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 10 minutes per side. Remove from grill; let stand for 5 minutes. Slice across the grain on a slight angle and serve.
