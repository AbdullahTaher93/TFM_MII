Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Toss enoki mushrooms with garlic salt on a large plate. Heat oil in a large skillet or wok. Add enoki mushrooms; cook and stir until firm and lightly browned on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes. Return to the plate. Add shallot and garlic to the skillet; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add to mushrooms. Stir turkey into the skillet. Cook, stirring to break up clumps, until browned, about 5 minutes. Combine turkey with mushroom mixture; chop finely. Stir in yellow bell peppers. Beat eggs, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Stir in turkey mixture and pour into two 1/3-cup muffin tins. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
