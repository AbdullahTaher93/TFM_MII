Fill a shaker with ice and add the wine, apricot brandy, pineapple juice and simple syrup in a shaker and squeeze in the fruit slices and add the apple chunks. Tumble back and forth into a tall tumbler or wine goblet. Pour the sangria in the glass and top with a splash of club soda and garnish with additional fruit if desired.
