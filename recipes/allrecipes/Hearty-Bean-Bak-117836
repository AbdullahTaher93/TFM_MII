In a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Add the bacon and beans; mix well. Transfer to a greased 2-1/2-qt. baking dish. In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, ketchup, honey and vinegar. Pour over the bean mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until heated through and bubbly. Let stand for 10 minutes; stir and serve.
