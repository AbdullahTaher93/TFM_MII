Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, bell pepper and smoked sausage. Season with garlic powder, salt and pepper. Add the black-eyed peas and hog jowl for flavoring (and luck for the next year!) Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Simmer over low heat for 1 hour. When ready to serve, stir in cooked rice and cheese until cheese has melted.
