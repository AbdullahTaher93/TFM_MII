In a large saucepan, combine the ketchup, water, brown sugar, cider vinegar, sweet pickle relish and Worcestershire sauce. Season with cinnamon, black pepper, garlic salt and liquid smoke. Bring to a simmer over low heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Shred the ham and stir into the mixture. Simmer longer if desired, then serve hot on hamburger buns. The mixture can also be frozen.
