Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine brown sugar, water, and honey in a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high until sugar is completely dissolved, about 5 minutes. Stir in coconut oil, vanilla, and salt. Mix rolled oats, quick-cooking oats, almonds, puffed quinoa, chia seeds, and shredded coconut together in a large bowl. Pour in sugar mixture and mix thoroughly until granola is combined and starting to clump together. Spread granola mixture no more than 3/4-inch high on prepared baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and crunchy, 35 to 45 minutes. Allow to cool completely.
