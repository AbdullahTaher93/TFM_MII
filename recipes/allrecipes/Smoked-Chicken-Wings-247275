Place chicken wings in a large bowl. Pour in olive oil; toss with hands until coated. Coat wings evenly with dry rub. Light charcoal and heat smoker to 170 to 200 degrees F (77 to 93 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions. Drain wood chips and place half of them directly on the charcoal. Spread wings evenly on the cooking grate skin-side down. Smoke wings until fragrant, about 1 hour. Flip wings. Add remaining wood chips to the charcoal. Continue smoking until an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 1 hour more. Serve chicken wings with blue cheese dressing.
