Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Generously spray 15x10-inch baking pan with sides with cooking spray. Toss vegetables with dressing in large bowl. Spread vegetables in single layer in pan. Bake uncovered 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until crisp-tender. Remove from oven. Add chicken pieces to vegetables; spoon pan juices over chicken. Return to oven and heat about 5 more minutes or until chicken is warm.
