Combine cream cheese and sugar in a bowl; add strawberries and pineapple. Fold in the whipped topping. Line a loaf pan with parchment paper. Pour the strawberry mixture into the loaf pan. Place in the freezer until firm, about 6 hours. Set loaf pan in a warm water bath to loosen. Flip mixture onto a cutting board to remove; cut into slices.
