Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Arrange scallops in a single layer in a baking dish. Combine wine and lemon juice in a small measuring pitcher. Add salt and pepper to taste, and pour over the scallops. Combine cracker crumbs, pecans, and parsley in a small bowl. Spoon evenly over the scallops. Drizzle the crumb topping with melted butter. Bake in preheated oven until topping is golden and scallops are opaque, 10 to 12 minutes.
