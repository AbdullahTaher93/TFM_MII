Place the chicken into a roasting pan. Add the onions, peppers, potatoes and sausage. Sprinkle with the Italian seasoning. Pour the broth over all. Roast at 375 degrees F for 1 hour or until the chicken and sausage are cooked through, turning the chicken over once halfway through the roasting time and basting occasionally with the pan juices.
