Heat olive oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir turkey in the hot oil until completely browned, about 10 minutes; add sweet onion and continue cooking and stirring until the onion is translucent, about 10 minutes more. Add to the black beans. Stir tomatoes, corn kernels, maple syrup, molasses, Hungarian paprika, chili powder, garlic powder, chipotle chile powder, cayenne pepper, and sea salt into the black bean mixture; bring to a simmer and cook until heated through, 15 to 20 minutes.
