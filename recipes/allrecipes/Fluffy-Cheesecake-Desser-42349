In a large microwave-safe bowl, combine marshmallows and orange juice. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 1-1/2 minutes. Stir until smooth. In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese. Add marshmallow mixture; beat just until smooth. Fold in whipped topping. Combine wafer crumbs and butter; set aside 3/4 cup for topping. Press remaining crumbs into an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. pan. Spoon cream cheese filling over crust. Sprinkle with reserved crumbs. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or until set. Store in the refrigerator.
