Combine oil, onion and seasonings in heavy plastic bag; mix well. Add roast; coat well with marinade. Marinate in refrigerator 2 hours or overnight. Line roasting pan with aluminum foil. Combine Morton(R) Coarse Kosher Salt and 1 cup water to form a thick paste, adding more water as needed, up to 1 1/4 cups. Pat 1 cup paste to a 1/2 inch thick rectangle in pan. Pat roast dry with paper towels; insert meat thermometer. Place roast on salt layer; pack remaining salt paste around meat to seal well. Bake at 350 degrees F until thermometer registers 140 degrees F, about 1 hour 20 minutes, for medium doneness. Steam may cause salt crust to crack slightly during roasting. Remove from oven; let stand 10 minutes. Remove and discard salt crust.
