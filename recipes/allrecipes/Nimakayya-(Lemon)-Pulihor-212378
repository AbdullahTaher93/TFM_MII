Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add, in order, the peanuts, chana dal, urad dal, red chile peppers, cashews, mustard seed, curry leaves, green chile peppers, and turmeric to the hot oil in 30 second intervals, allowing each item to cook briefly before adding the next. Stir the lemon juice and salt into the mixture. Mix the rice into the mixture, breaking up the individual grains with a wooden spoon; cook and stir until no clumps of rice remain and the mixture is thoroughly heated. Serve hot.
