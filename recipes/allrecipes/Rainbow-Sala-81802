On a large platter, start arranging the veggies along the edge in an arc, rainbow style. Start with the tomatoes, followed by the orange bell peppers and then the yellow bell peppers. Lay out the avocado slices all aligned so that the yellow edge faces the yellow bell pepper. Then place the cocktail pickles next to the avocados, followed by the blue cheese and ending with the shredded purple cabbage. The cocktail dill pickles are optional as you don't really need more green in this salad. But the green coloration of the ones which I purchase from Wild Oats have a bluish hue to them. Besides, I love dill pickles. They can be whole, sliced or quartered. Pile the spinach under the rainbow. Serve the dressings on the side. It's good to offer several different types of dressings.
