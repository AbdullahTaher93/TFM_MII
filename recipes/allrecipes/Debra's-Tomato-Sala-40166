In a large bowl, combine tomatoes, red onions, yellow onions, and cucumbers. Mix together olive oil, vinegar, sugar, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper. Pour dressing over tomato mixture, and toss to coat evenly. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Arrange lettuce on plates, and place marinated tomato salad on top. Garnish with egg slices and anchovies (optional).
