Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray a wire rack with cooking spray and set on top of a baking sheet. Pour flour into a wide bowl. Whisk egg whites with water in a separate bowl until foamy. Mix saltine crackers, pecans, paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper together in a shallow bowl. Dredge chicken tenders in flour, dip in egg whites, then coat with cracker mixture. Arrange on the wire rack. Spray chicken tenders lightly with cooking spray; flip and spray the second side. Roast in the preheated oven, turning once halfway through, until crisp, 18 to 20 minutes.
