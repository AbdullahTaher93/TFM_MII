To make filling: Mash enough of the strawberries for 2 1/2 cups puree; set aside. Reserve remaining sliced berries. In a small pan, mix cornstarch and granulated sugar. Stir in the mashed strawberries and 1/2 cup water. Bring mixture to a boil; cook, stirring 1 minute, and remove from heat. Stir in the vanilla and brandy, if using. Cool to room temperature, then stir in the sliced berries. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight. To make topping: Beat cream with 2 tablespoons of the powdered sugar, adding more to taste, until soft peaks form. Chill. To make crepes: In a blender combine the flour, sugar, eggs, cardamom, and milk. Whirl until smooth. Place a 6-inch crepe pan or other flat-bottom pan over medium-low heat. When hot add 1/4 teaspoon butter and swirl to coat pan surface. Pour in 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons batter and quickly tilt pan so batter flows over entire flat surface. Cook until surface is dry and edge is lightly browned. Loosen with a spatula and flip to cook other side. Turn out onto a plate. Repeat with more butter and remaining batter, stacking crepes as they are made. Bring stacked crepes to the table and pass the strawberry filling and whipped cream, allowing guests to fill and top their own crepes.
