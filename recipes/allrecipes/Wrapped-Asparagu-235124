Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Combine lemon juice, olive oil and garlic in large bowl. Add asparagus; toss to coat. Place asparagus in baking pan. Bake 8 minutes, or until crisp-tender. Let cool to room temperature (about 15 minutes). Cut each prosciutto slice in half lengthwise. Spread each piece with about 1 teaspoon goat cheese. Wrap each slice in a spiral around each asparagus spear. Serve immediately, or cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
