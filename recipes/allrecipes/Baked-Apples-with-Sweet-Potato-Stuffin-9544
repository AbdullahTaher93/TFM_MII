Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large pot over medium heat, combine the candies and water. Stir until candies are dissolved. Add the apples and baste frequently until apples begin to soften. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Mix together the sweet potatoes, brown sugar, pineapple and pecans. Stuff the cooled apples with the sweet potato mixture. Mound any remaining mixture on top of apples. Place in 4 quart casserole dish and bake for 20 minutes; place a marshmallow on each apple, return to oven and cook until marshmallows are golden brown.
