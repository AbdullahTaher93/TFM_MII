Place sugar and tea bags in a heatproof bowl. Pour in boiling water; stir until sugar has dissolved. Let steep until cooled to room temperature, about 1 hour. Remove the tea bags, squeezing out liquid. Stir in lemon juice. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour or overnight. Pour the tea mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturers directions. (Alternatively, freeze the mixture in a shallow metal pan until solid, about 6 hours. Break into chunks and process in a food processor until smooth and creamy.) Serve immediately or transfer to a storage container and let harden in the freezer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Serve in chilled dishes.
