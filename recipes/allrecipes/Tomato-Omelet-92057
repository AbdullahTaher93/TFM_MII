Rinse tomato, core, cut in half crosswise, and squeeze out seeds. Chop tomato. In an 8- to 10-inch frying pan over medium-high heat, combine oil and shallots. Stir often until shallots are limp, 3 to 4 minutes. Add tomato, 2 tablespoons of the chives, and basil; stir until juices evaporate, 3 to 5 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm. In a bowl, beat eggs to blend with 1 tablespoon water and 1/8 teaspoon salt. On a plate, break goat cheese into small pieces. In a 6- to 7-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat, melt 1 teaspoon butter. When sizzling, add 1/2 the egg mixture. As eggs become firm, lift with a spatula to let uncooked portion flow beneath. Shake pan often to keep eggs moving freely. When eggs are softly set, in 1 to 2 minutes, spoon half the tomato mixture and chevre down center of omelet, in line with pan handle. To fold, tilt pan at about a 45-degree angle parallel to filling. With spatula, fold about 1/3 of upper side of omelet down over the filling. Hold pan over plate and shake so unfolded edge slips out onto it, then quickly flip pan over to fold omelet out onto dish. Keep warm and repeat from step 4 to cook remaining omelet. Sprinkle omelets with remaining chives. Add salt and pepper to taste.
