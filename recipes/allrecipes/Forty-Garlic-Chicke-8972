Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Put in chicken, boil until meat falls away at the bone. Pull out as many bones and as much skin as you like. Stir in the vermouth, garlic cloves (don't peel - you will use them for the bread), parsley and chicken stock. Reduce heat to low and let simmer and reduce for about 2 hours. Serve hot with slices of bread. Take the soft garlic and spread on fresh bread as 'garlic butter'. Yum!
