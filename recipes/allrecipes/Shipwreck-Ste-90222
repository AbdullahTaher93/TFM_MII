Crumble the ground beef into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until browned. Drain grease, and transfer beef to a slow cooker. Mix in the tomato soups (undiluted), onions, potatoes, and beans. Cover, and cook on the Low setting for 4 to 5 hours, until stew is thick and potatoes are tender.
