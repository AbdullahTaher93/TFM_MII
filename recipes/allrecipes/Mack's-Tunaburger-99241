Combine the tuna, teriyaki sauce, bread crumbs, and egg whites in a bowl until well combined, and no large pieces of tuna remain. Season with black pepper, garlic, and hot sauce. Mix well, then form into two patties. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the patties until brown on both sides, about 2 minutes per side.
