In a medium stock pot combine broth, corn and chicken. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and add pepper and salt. Bring back to a boil. In a separate bowl mix the corn starch with water. While the soup is boiling add this mixture, and stir constantly until well mixed. Season with sesame oil by adding a few drops at a time. Reduce heat, and slowly add egg white while swirling the soup with a fork in order to break egg pieces apart. Add chopped scallion to garnish, and serve hot.
