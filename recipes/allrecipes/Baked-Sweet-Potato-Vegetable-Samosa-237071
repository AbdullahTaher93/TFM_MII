Heat vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Saute sweet potato, eggplant, and onion in hot oil until the onion is softened, 7 to 10 minutes; season with curry powder, cumin, and garam masala. Pour stock into the pot. Bring liquid to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until vegetables are completely tender, adding more broth as needed to keep mixture moist, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove pot from heat and set aside to let mixture cool completely. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lie each pie crust onto a lightly-floured surface. Cut each crust into 8 wedges. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the vegetable mixture into the middle of each triangle. Bring two corners of each triangle together, pressing the dough along the edges to seal. Bring up the last corner and seal the last edge. Arrange samosas onto a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 45 minutes.
