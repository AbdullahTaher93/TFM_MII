In a blender, puree enough of the strawberries, about 1/2 cup (125 mL), to make 1/4 cup (50 mL) of puree. Transfer to a small bowl and stir in the mint, honey, and sour cream or yogurt. Line individual salad plates with the lettuce. Arrange the remaining strawberries and other fruits on the lettuce. Top with the strawberry-cream dressing.
