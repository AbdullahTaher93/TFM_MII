Place barley in a 1-quart glass jar. Cover with warm water. Let soak at room temperature until doubled in size, 8 hours to overnight. Drain and rinse barley; transfer to a large bowl. Mix cucumbers, tomatoes, onion, parsley, lemon juice, olive oil, paprika, salt, garlic, and black pepper into the barley.
