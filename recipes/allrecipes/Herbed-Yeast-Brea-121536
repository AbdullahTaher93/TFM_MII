In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in 1 cup water. Add butter, eggs, sugar, milk powder, salt and remaining water; mix well. Beat in 8 cups flour until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Roll to 1/2-in. thickness; cut with a 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter. Combine herb butter ingredients; brush over circles. Fold in half with buttered sides out. Place circles with folded edge down in five greased 8-cup fluted tube pans or 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.
