Mix cream and chicken bouillon granules together in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on medium until granules are soft, 20 to 30 seconds; set aside. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until very tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain and place in a large bowl. Mash cauliflower using a hand mixer on low speed, about 1 minute. Add cream mixture and increase speed to high; mix together until creamy, 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle in shredded Cheddar cheese, seasoned salt, and garlic powder. Stir by hand until well-mixed and serve.
