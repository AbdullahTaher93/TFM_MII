Place egg yolks, lemon juice, and hot sauce in a blender. Blend until eggs are a pale yellow, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. While the motor is running, add the butter in a slow steady stream until it is all incorporated. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Combine the balsamic vinegar and honey in a small pan. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium and let simmer until reduced by about half, 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat. Combine corned beef hash, beaten egg, breadcrumbs, and parsley in a mixing bowl. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Measure corned beef mixture into 6 patties using a 1/4-cup measuring cup. Place them in skillet; Reduce heat to medium. Fry until just starting to brown, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from heat. Fill a large saucepan with 2 to 3 inches of water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, pour in vinegar, and keep the water at a gentle simmer. Crack an egg into a small bowl then gently slip egg into the simmering water, holding the bowl just above the surface of water. Repeat with the remaining eggs. Cook eggs until the whites are firm and the yolks have thickened but are not hard, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Remove the eggs from the water with a slotted spoon, dab on a kitchen towel to remove excess water, and place onto a warm plate. To plate, place one hash cake on a plate, top with a handful of arugula. Place a poached egg over the arugula and drizzle with hollandaise and glaze. Season with salt and pepper.
