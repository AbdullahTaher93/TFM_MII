Simmer water with rice and cinnamon sticks for 20 minutes. Discard the rice and cinnamon, reserve the water. Return the water to the stove, and add the apple; simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. Add the cherries and raspberries, then bring to a boil before removing from the heat. Allow to stand for at least 30 minutes before refrigerating. Serve cold, garnished with a dollop of whipped cream.
