Place the cinnamon stick, cloves, and peppercorns in a medium saucepan. Add 2 cups water. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes. Off the heat, add the tea bags and steep, covered, for 5 minutes. Remove the tea bags. Add the cider and Sweet'N Low to the spiced tea and warm over medium heat until Spiced Cider Tea is steaming hot. Divide between two mugs and serve, garnished with a long cinnamon stick, if desired.
