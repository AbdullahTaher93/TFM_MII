In a small bowl, beat together cream cheese, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 egg, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla until smooth. In a separate bowl, combine flour, 1 1/3 cup sugar, baking powder, soda, salt, milk, shortening, 1 egg, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, and 3 squares melted unsweetened chocolate in large mixing bowl. Beat for 1/2 minute with an electric mixer on low speed. Beat 2 minutes on medium speed. Grease a 9 inch square pan. Pour half of the batter into the pan. Spread cream cheese mixture evenly over the batter, and top with remaining cake batter to cover completely. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 to 55 minutes, or until cake tester inserted in center comes out clean. Cool. Melt 3 squares semisweet chocolate with butter, water, and oil; blend until smooth. Spread evenly over cooled cake.
