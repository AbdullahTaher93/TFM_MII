Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Melt butter in a Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Mix onion, brown and wild rice mix, and water in the melted butter. Layer tomatoes over rice mixture; top with zucchini. Cover zucchini with Colby cheese. Mix sour cream, garlic, salt, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, and black pepper together in a bowl; spread over Colby cheese layer. Cover Dutch oven. Bake in the preheated oven until rice is tender and cheese is bubbling, about 45 minutes.
