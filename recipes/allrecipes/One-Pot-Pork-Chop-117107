Coat pork chops with flour. In a large skillet, brown chops on both sides. Add potatoes and carrots. In a small bowl, combine the water, Worcestershire sauce, salt and oregano; pour over pork and vegetables. Cover and simmer for 25 minutes. Stir in the soup; cover and simmer 10-15 minutes longer or until meat and vegetables are tender.
