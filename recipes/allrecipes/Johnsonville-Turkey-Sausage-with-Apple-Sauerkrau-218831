Cook sausage on an outdoor grill or grill pan over medium-high heat for about 3 minutes per side. While sausage is cooking, heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add cabbage, onion, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until the cabbage has wilted slightly, about 4 minutes. Add the beer, vinegar, apples, mustard, brown sugar and sage; stir until incorporated. Bring to a simmer for 5 minutes. Add the sausage to the cabbage mixture. Cover partially with lid to allow some steam to escape. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until the cabbage and apples are tender, about 8 minutes. Serve as-is or on grinder rolls.
