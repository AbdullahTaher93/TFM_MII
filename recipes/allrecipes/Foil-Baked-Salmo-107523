Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place salmon on large piece of foil; brush with 2 tablespoons of oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Mix remaining oil with tomatoes, green onions, dill, lemon peel and lemon juice. Pour oil mixture over salmon, seal foil and bake until cooked through, about 20 minutes.
