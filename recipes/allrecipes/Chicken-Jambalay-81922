Grate the cauliflower. This is accomplished best by using your grating wheel on your food processor. But you can also do it by hand with a cheese grater. Set aside. Cut off the top 1/3 of the green part, mince and set aside for a garnish. Mince the rest of the scallions and the garlic. Dice the celery and the bell peppers. Remove casing from chorizo and cut into bite-sized pieces. Cut chicken into bite sized pieces. In a large heavy pot over medium heat, cook the chorizo until it renders its fat and starts to turn brown (about 5 minutes) transfer to a bowl. Add the chicken to the pot and stir fry until cooked through (about 5 minutes depending on size of pieces), transfer to the bowl. Pour off the fat, except for about 1 Tbsp worth. Add the celery, the white part of the scallions, the garlic and the bell peppers. Saute for about 2 minutes. Add the cauliflower and cook another 2 minutes stirring frequently. Add the chicken stock and Cajun seasoning and cook for about 1 minute letting the stock boil. Add the ketchup, stir to incorporate. Add the chorizo and chicken and heat through. Garnish with the reserve scallion tops and serve.
