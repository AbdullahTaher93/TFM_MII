To prepare pastry, in a bowl, mix all-purpose and whole-wheat flours and salt. Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in butter and shortening until fine particles form. Add egg and stir with a fork until dough clings together. With your hands, gather dough into a ball. Roll pastry out on a floured surface to about a 13-inch circle. Ease pastry into a 10-inch quiche dish; trim pastry even with rim. Line pastry shell with foil, molding it against sides. Half-fill crust with raw dried beans, rice, or pie weights and bake in a 425 degrees F oven for 10 minutes. Carefully lift out foil and beans; continue to bake for 5 more minutes. Remove from oven, place on a rack, and reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. While pastry is baking, prepare filling. In a wide frying pan over medium heat, melt butter. Add onions and cook, stirring often, until soft and golden (15 to 20 minutes). Mix in salmon, then spoon mixture evenly into pastry shell. In a bowl, combine eggs, half-and-half, salt, pepper, and nutmeg; beat until well combined. Pour over onion mixture. Bake until custard is set and lightly browned (30 to 35 minutes). Let stand for about 5 minutes; then cut into wedges.
