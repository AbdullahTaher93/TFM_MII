Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a bowl, stir together the sugar, wheat flour, all-purpose flour, oatmeal, salt cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, and baking soda, until well mixed. Set aside. In a separate bowl, stir persimmon pulp with applesauce, vegetable oil, and eggs until well blended. Combine the wet and dry ingredients, stirring until free of lumps. Divide batter between two greased 9x5 inch loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven for one hour, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaves comes out clean.
