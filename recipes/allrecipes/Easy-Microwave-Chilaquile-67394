Cover the bottom of a shallow microwaveable dish, with some of the enchilada sauce. Arrange a layer of tortilla chips on top. Follow with another layer of sauce, then a layer of sour cream. Sprinkle cheese over the top. Repeat layers to use up all ingredients, finishing with cheese on top. Cook in the microwave on high for 2 minutes, or until cheese has melted throughout. Serve immediately.
