In a large bowl, combine the tomato, green pepper, cucumber, black olives, corn, and green onions. Pour the Catalina dressing over, and toss to coat. Stir in the cheese and corn chips just before serving. If the salad won't be eaten in one meal, serve corn chips on the side as a topper so they don't get soggy.
