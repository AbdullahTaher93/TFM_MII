Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rotelle in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain. Stir rotelle, broccoli, carrots, tomatoes, Parmesan cheese, olives, and pepperoni together in a large bowl. Pour 1/2 of the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight. Pour remaining dressing over the salad and stir.
