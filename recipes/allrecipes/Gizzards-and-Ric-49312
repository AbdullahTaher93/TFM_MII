Place chicken gizzards in a large saucepan, and add enough water to cover them. Cover, and bring to a boil. Boil over medium-high heat for 10 minutes. Drain, reserving the water, and chop into bite size pieces. Cook rice according to package directions using gizzard water. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute onion, garlic and mushrooms until onion is tender. Add gizzards, and saute for 5 more minutes. Stir in the chicken broth, onion soup mix, and tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, and cook until reduced by 1/2, about 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in rice, heat through and serve. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
