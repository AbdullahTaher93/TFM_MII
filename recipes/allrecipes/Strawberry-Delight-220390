Fold remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and confectioners' sugar into thawed whipped topping in a separate bowl until thoroughly combined. Gently fold the whipped topping mixture into the cream cheese mixture until combined. Layer the bottom of a glass serving bowl with 1/4 angel food cake pieces.
