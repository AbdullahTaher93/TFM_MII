In a large frying pan, heat the oil over moderately low heat. Add the onion and saute until it begins to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in the garlic, oregano, and chili powder and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the chorizo, tomato paste, and broth to the pan and stir. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Add the black beans, the lime juice, and the salt and remove the pan from the heat. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the cavatappi until just done, about 13 minutes. Drain; toss with the sauce and parsley.
