Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mash the eggplant in water; drain off excess water. Thoroughly mix eggplant, butter, eggs, cheese and soup. Season with sage, thyme, oregano, salt and pepper. Pour mixture into a medium casserole dish, crumble cornbread onto the top of the casserole, and bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven.
