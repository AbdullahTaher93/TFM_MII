Bring 2 quarts of water and salt to boil in a large soup kettle. Add pasta; cook, stirring frequently until almost cooked, about 9 to 10 minutes. Stir in spinach; cook until spinach wilts and pasta is tender, about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, heat oil and garlic in a large deep skillet until garlic starts to sizzle and turn golden. Add tomatoes, baking soda, red pepper and chicken; simmer to blend flavors, about 5 minutes. Add basil and half-and-half; simmer to reduce slightly, about 5 minutes. Drain pasta and return to pot. Add sauce and cheese; toss to coat and then serve.
