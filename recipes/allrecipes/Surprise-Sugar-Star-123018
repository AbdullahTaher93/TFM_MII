In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in vanilla. Combine the dry ingredients; add to the creamed mixture alternately with buttermilk. Refrigerate for 2-3 hours or until easy to handle. On a floured surface, roll out dough to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with 2-in star cookie cutter or the cutter of your choice. Place half of the stars on ungreased baking sheets. Spoon 1-1/2 teaspoonfuls of pie filling into the centers of each. Top with remaining stars. Pinch edges to seal; cut a small slit in top of each cookie. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on wire racks. For icing, combine confectioners' sugar, milk and extract in a bowl; whisk until smooth. Spread over cookies. Sprinkle with colored sugar if desired.
