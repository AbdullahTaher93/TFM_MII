In a large bowl, beat eggs; add sugar, sour cream, butter and vanilla. Combine flour, baking soda, salt and nutmeg; add to sour cream mixture alternately with buttermilk. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; roll to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with a 2-1/2-in. doughnut cutter. In an electric skillet or deep-fat fryer, heat oil to 375 degrees F. Fry doughnuts, a few at a time, until golden, about 2 minutes; turn once with a slotted spoon. Drain on paper towels. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
