Remove the skin and bones from the chicken. Cut into bite sized pieces. Rinse the chipotle peppers (unless you want your soup super hot). Alternatively, you can use mild green chili peppers or even a green bell pepper for no spicy heat at all. Dice the peppers. In a large soup kettle over medium-high heat, add the butter and onions. Stir frequently. When the onions just begin to become translucent (about 2 minutes) add the minced garlic and the cubed zucchini. Stir frequently for about 1 minute. Add the chicken stock, chicken pieces, chipotle peppers, black olives, cumin and thyme. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, cover and cook for 15 minutes. Just before serving, add the cilantro leaves and the lime juice.
