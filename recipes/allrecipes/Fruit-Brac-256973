Soak dried fruit in brewed tea in a bowl, at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan. Mix flour, almond meal, and baking powder together in a bowl. Stir brown sugar and egg into the dried fruit-tea mixture. Mix in flour mixture, 1 spoonful at a time, until smooth. Spoon mixture into the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
