Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour the butter in the bottom of a baking dish. Arrange the halibut fillets in the dish, and season with lemon pepper. In a bowl, mix the salsa, mayonnaise, sour cream, and garlic oil. Spoon over the halibut fillets. Bake halibut 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until easily flaked with a fork.
