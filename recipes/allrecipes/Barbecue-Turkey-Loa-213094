To make Barbecue Sauce, measure catsup, honey, mustard and vinegar into small mixing bowl; stir to combine. Set aside. In large mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Add cereal, onion, salt, pepper and 1/2 cup Barbecue Sauce; beat well. Add ground turkey; mix until combined. Shape turkey mixture into loaf in foil-lined shallow baking pan. Score top by making diagonal grooves with knife; fill grooves and brush top of turkey loaf with remaining Barbecue Sauce. Bake at 350 degrees F about 1 hour or until done (160 degrees F). Cool slightly; slice to serve.
