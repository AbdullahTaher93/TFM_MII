Prepare Dressing. Combine all of the dressing ingredients in a large bowl, mixing until smooth. (The cheese might still be somewhat lumpy, but that is fine). Refrigerate until ready to use. Blanch String Beans. Bring water to a boil, and cook string beans for approximately 2 minutes. Drain and dry with paper towels. Make Salad. Combine the lettuce, string beans, croutons and bacon in a large bowl. Pour about half of the dressing overtop and toss gently to coat. To Serve: Evenly divide salad onto 12 individual plates. Divide the beets evenly and sprinkle with goat cheese.
