Combine squash, onion, carrots, and garlic in a high-powered blender; pulse until vegetables are minced. Transfer vegetables to a skillet and add coconut oil, Chinese five-spice powder, salt, and soy sauce. Saute vegetable mixture over high heat until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Spoon tofu-based sour cream into vegetable mixture and mash until filling is smooth. Remove skillet from heat and cool filling. Spoon about 1 teaspoon filling onto 1 half of each wonton wrapper. Wet the border of the wrapper and fold in half over the filling, sealing the edges together. Take 2 opposite corners, wet with water, and press together to seal. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Working in batches, fry wontons until golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer cooked wontons to a paper towel-lined plate; cool slightly.
