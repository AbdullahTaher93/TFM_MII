Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). In a small bowl, combine the green chiles, chili powder, oregano, cumin, garlic and salt. Place roast on a large sheet of heavy foil. Make 8 cuts in the meat and insert the garlic halves. Rub chili mixture all over roast and enclose in foil to seal. Place in a roasting pan and cook in preheated oven until meat is fork tender, about 3 1/2 hours. Remove from oven. When cool enough to handle, shred meat into a large bowl. Stir in meat juices and serve in warm flour tortillas.
