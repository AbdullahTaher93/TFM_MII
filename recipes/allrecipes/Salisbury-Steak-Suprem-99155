Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, salt, pepper and 1/3 cup of the condensed soup. Form into four patties. Whisk remaining soup and flour in a small bowl; stir in ketchup, water, Worcestershire sauce and mustard. Increase the heat under the skillet to medium-high and add the beef patties. Cook for about 5 minutes per side, until nicely browned and cooked through. Pour off fat. Pour onion soup sauce over patties. Cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, about 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer burgers to plates, pour a portion of sauce over each and serve.
