Bring a large pot of water to a boil, salt it, add the pasta and cook until al dente. Drain. While the pasta is working, in a large skillet, melt 1 tablespoon butter in 2 tablespoons EVOO, 2 turns of the pan. Place the flour on a plate. In a shallow dish, beat the eggs and cream. Season the fish with salt and pepper and dip in the flour and then the eggs. Add to the skillet and cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Flip and cook for 3 minutes longer. Transfer to a pan and keep warm in a 250 degree F oven. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet. Add the almonds and toast for 3 minutes. Add the nutmeg. Spoon the nuts over the fish. Add the garlic and the remaining 2 tablespoons EVOO, 2 turns of the pan, and 1 tablespoon butter to the skillet. Add the artichokes and cook for 4 minutes. Discard the garlic and add the wine; cook until reduced. Stir in 1/2 cup water, the lemon peel, lemon juice and parsley. Place the sole on 2 plates and spoon some sauce on top. Toss the pasta with the sauce and artichokes; season with salt and pepper. Serve alongside the fish.
