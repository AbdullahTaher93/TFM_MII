Mix 1 cup panko, egg, 2 tablespoons mayonnaise, sesame seeds, 1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce, ginger, sesame oil, and soy sauce together in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper. Fold crabmeat into the panko mixture. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 hour. Spread 1/4 cup panko onto a plate. Shape crab mixture into 6 small, thick patties; press into the panko to coat. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook crab cakes in the melted butter until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Put 1 cup arugula on each of 6 plates. Top each pile of arugula with a crab cake. Whisk 2 tablespoons mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon chile-garlic sauce, rice vinegar, and lemon juice together in a bowl until smooth; drizzle over arugula and crab cakes.
