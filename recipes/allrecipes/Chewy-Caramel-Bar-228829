Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. For crust, beat butter in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Add sugar and salt; beat until combined, scraping sides of bowl occasionally. Beat in the flour on low speed until combined. Press two-thirds of the crust mixture into the bottom of an ungreased 13x9x2-inch baking pan. For filling, combine sweetened condensed milk and Werther's Chewy in medium saucepan. Stir over low heat until Werther's Chewy melts and mixture is smooth. Remove from heat. Stir in nuts and vanilla. Spread hot mixture over the crust. Dot with remaining crust mixture. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until crust is golden. Cool in pan on a wire rack. To ensure even squares, cool the layered bars thoroughly before cutting.
