Pie: Prepare fresh pomegranate juice.* Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Beat eggs with a whisk in a medium-sized bowl. Add pumpkin and whisk to combine. Mix in granulated sugar, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. Stir in pomegranate juice and heavy cream. Pour into the prepared pie crust. Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce oven heat to 375 degrees F and bake 35 to 45 minutes, or until knife inserted comes out clean. Allow pie to cool about 2 to 3 hours before cutting. Serve with whipped cream and arils if desired. Whipped Cream with Arils: Score fresh pomegranates and place in a bowl of water. Break open the pomegranates under water to free the arils (seed sacs). The arils will sink to the bottom of the bowl and the membrane will float to the top. Sieve and put the arils in a separate bowl. (Refrigerate or freeze any remaining arils for another use.) In a medium sized bowl, beat heavy cream with a wire whisk or electric mixer until slightly thickened. Add powdered sugar, vanilla and cinnamon, and whip until mixture doubles in volume and soft peaks form. Gently fold in the arils. Serve immediately.
