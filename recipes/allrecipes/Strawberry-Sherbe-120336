In a large bowl, combine strawberries and sugar; let stand for 1-1/2 to 2 hours or until very juicy. Process in small batches in a blender until pureed. Strain seeds; pour strawberry juice into a bowl. Stir in milk, orange juice and cinnamon if desired. Freeze in batches in an ice cream freezer according to manufacturer's directions. Refrigerate remaining mixture until it can be frozen.
