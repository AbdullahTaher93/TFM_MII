Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly spray a 9-inch pie dish with cooking spray. Combine oats, confectioners' sugar, butter, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt together in a bowl; press into the prepared pie dish. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool completely.
