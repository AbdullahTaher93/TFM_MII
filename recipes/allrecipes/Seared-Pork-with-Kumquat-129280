Cook the potatoes in a saucepan of boiling water until tender, about 15 minutes. Steam the green beans in a steamer basket or colander over the potato pan for the last 5 minutes of the cooking time. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large ridged, cast-iron grill pan over very high heat. Add the slices of pork in batches and saute until brown, about 1 minute on each side. Lift the slices out of the pan and set aside. Add the onion to the pan and saute over high heat, stirring, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat slightly, then return the pork to the pan and saute 5 minutes longer. Thinly slice the kumquats, skin and all. Add to the pan together with the honey and stir 1 minute. Mix the mustard, wine and stock together, and pour the mixture into the pan. Season with salt and pepper to taste and simmer 3 minutes longer. Drain the potatoes and mash them with the milk. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste. Spoon the mashed potato into the middle of 4 plates. Arrange the pork slices on top of the potatoes and pour a little of the sauce over. Add the kumquats and beans and pour the remaining sauce over. Garnish with chives, if using.
