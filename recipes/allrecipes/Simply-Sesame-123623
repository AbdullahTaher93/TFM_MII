In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add flour; mix just until combined. Stir in coconut, sesame seeds and almonds. Chill for 15 minutes. Divide dough in half. Shape each half into a 2-in.-diameter roll. Wrap each roll in waxed paper, twisting ends to seal. Refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight. Remove waxed paper. Cut into 1/4-in. slices; place on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 300 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool for 2 minutes; remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
