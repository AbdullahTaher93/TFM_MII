Line large cookie sheet with waxed paper or parchment paper. Unroll fruit snack and cut 3/4" long fringe on one long side of snack roll. Cut fringed roll into 2" pieces. For broomstick, wrap a piece of fringe around one pretzel end and press to seal. Place on cookie sheet. Drop rounded 1/2 teaspoons of melted white vanilla chips crosswise onto pretzels and shape to resemble ghosts seated on broomsticks. Press 3 miniature chocolate chips into each ghost for eyes and mouth. Let stand at room temperature for about 45 minutes or in freezer for about 5 minutes, until set. Peel candies from waxed paper.
