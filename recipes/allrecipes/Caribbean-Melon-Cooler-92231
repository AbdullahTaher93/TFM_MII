Spread melon cubes on a baking pan in a single layer. Cover with plastic wrap; freeze until solid, 4 hours or up to 2 days. If desired, spread 3 tablespoons of the brown sugar out on a small plate for coating glass rims. Rub the rims of 4 margarita glasses with lime wedges to moisten, then dip the glass rims in the sugar to coat. Set aside. Just before serving, combine the frozen melon in a blender with the remaining brown sugar, orange juice, rum, lime juice, and orange liqueur. Whirl on high speed until smooth. Pour into 4 margarita glasses (sugar rimmed, if desired) and serve immediately.
