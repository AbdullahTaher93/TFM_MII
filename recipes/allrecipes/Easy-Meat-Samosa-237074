Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute potato and onion in hot oil until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Break beef into small pieces and add to the skillet; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Season beef mixture with 2 1/2 tablespoons curry powder, garlic, ginger, salt, and pepper. Pour chicken stock over the beef mixture; add peas and stir. Bring mixture to a simmer and cook until the stock is nearly evaporated and the potatoes are tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Moisten edges of each pie crust triangle with wet fingers. Spoon about 1/3 cup of the beef mixture into the middle of each dough piece. Fold dough over the filling into a triangle; crimp edges together with a fork to seal beef inside the triangle. Arrange samosas onto the prepared baking sheet. Beat egg with turmeric and 1/4 teaspoon curry powder in a bowl; brush over the samosas. Bake samosas in preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
