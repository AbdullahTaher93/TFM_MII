Stir boiling water into dry gelatin in large bowl until completely dissolved. Add 2/3 of the frozen whipped topping (about 2 cups); stir with wire whisk until whipped topping is melted and mixture is well blended. Refrigerate remaining whipped topping for later use as garnish. Pour gelatin mixture evenly into 5 dessert cups. Refrigerate 2 hours or until set. Top with remaining thawed whipped topping just before serving.
