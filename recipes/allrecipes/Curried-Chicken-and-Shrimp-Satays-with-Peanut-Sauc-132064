Soak 8 (6-inch) wooden skewers in water for 15 minutes to prevent them from burning. Preheat a grill or grill pan. To prepare pesto sauce: In a mortar and pestle, pound the basil, garlic, nuts, and salt until thoroughly mashed. To prepare the chicken: In a medium bowl, combine the curry powder, pepper, salt, cumin, and oil. With a sharp knife, cut the chicken breast lengthwise into 6 long, thin strips. Cut the chicken crosswise into bite-size chunks. Put the chicken pieces in the marinade, tossing to coat evenly. To prepare the shrimp: In a medium bowl, combine the pesto, oil, and lemon juice. Put the shrimp in the pesto marinade, tossing to coat evenly. Thread 3 or 4 pieces of chicken onto each skewer. Thread 1 or 2 shrimps onto each skewer. Arrange the skewers side-by-side on a large platter. Grill the satays for 2 minutes on each side, turning with tongs, until nicely seared and cooked through. Do not overcook. To prepare the peanut sauce: In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the coconut milk, peanut butter, sugar, peanut oil, lime juice, rice vinegar chili sauce, and soy sauce. Gently cook and stir until the sugar has melted and the sauce is heated through, about 2 minutes. To serve: Put a banana leaf across a serving platter. Arrange the skewers decoratively on top of the leaf. Drizzle the peanut sauce over the chicken. Garnish with edible flowers and cilantro sprigs.
