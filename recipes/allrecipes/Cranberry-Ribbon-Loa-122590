Line the bottom and sides of a 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan with heavy-duty foil; set aside. In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar and salt. Beat in cranberry sauce. Fold in the whipped cream. Spread one-third of the mixture in prepared pan; top with three cake slices (cut cake if needed to fit). Repeat layers. Top with remaining cranberry mixture. Cover and freeze. Remove from the freezer 15 minutes before serving. Use foil to remove loaf from pan, then discard foil. Cut into slices.
