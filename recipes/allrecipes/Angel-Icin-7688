Combine the egg whites, sugar, corn syrup, water, cream of tartar, and salt in the top of a double boiler over water that is at a hard boil. Start beating right away with a beater until the mixture stands in stiff peaks. Remove from heat and add vanilla or your favorite flavoring and keep beating until it is thick enough to spread easily.
