Soak skewers in water for 1 hour. Pound breasts between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. It should be about 1/4 inch thick. Cut in half lengthwise. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and garlic powder on both sides. Cut cheese in to strips to fit lengthwise on pounded breast. Put a slice of jalapeno beside the piece of cheese. Roll the breast from the bottom, and set it down with the overlap down. Wrap with a whole piece of bacon around the ends to keep the cheese in as it cooks. Put on soaked wooden skewer. Grill over medium heat until done.
