Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet, or donut baking pan. In a medium bowl, mix sugar, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon and flour. Mix buttermilk, eggs, honey and butter in a separate medium bowl, and stir into the dry ingredients. Spoon the mixture onto the prepared pan in doughnut shapes. Bake 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown.
