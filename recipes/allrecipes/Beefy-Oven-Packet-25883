Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut squares out of aluminum foil. Form beef into small, round flat hamburgers and place one (seasoned to taste) on each square. To each burger add a bit of corn, beans, mushrooms and a spoonfull of cheese sauce. Fold foil over so that there is no leaking during baking. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour.
