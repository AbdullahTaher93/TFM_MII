Combine the cheeses; sprinkle into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. In a large skillet, saute the mushrooms, onions and res pepper in butter; stir in ham. Spoon over the cheese. In a bowl, combine the flour, eggs, milk, salt and pepper. Pour over ham mixture; cover and refrigerate overnight. Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 35-45 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
