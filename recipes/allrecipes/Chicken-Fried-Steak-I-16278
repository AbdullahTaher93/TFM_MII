Combine the milk, hot pepper sauce and salt in a medium bowl. Measure one cup of flour into a second medium bowl. In a third medium bowl, combine the remaining flour, paprika, garlic powder, salt and ground black pepper. First coat the steak in the unseasoned flour, then dip in the milk mixture, and finally coat meat in the seasoned flour. Repeat as necessary if there's more than one piece of meat. Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Fry the coated meat in the oil for 3 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Drain meat on paper towels. (Note: Make sure the oil is fully heated before deep frying.)
