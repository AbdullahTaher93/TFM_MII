Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, salt, and nutmeg. In a large bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the butter and brown sugar for 3 minutes, or until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and molasses. Beat in the flour mixture, a little at a time, until well-blended. Shape into 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) balls. Arrange about 2 inches (5 cm) apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake for 10 minutes, or until tops are slightly rounded and lightly browned. Cool on a rack to cool for 2 minutes. Remove to the rack to cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar, if desired.
