In medium bowl, combine ground turkey, egg, garlic, onion, bread crumbs, chili powder and cumin; shape into approximately 36 3/4 inch balls. Place crushed chips on plate. Roll each meatball in chips, coating thoroughly. On 10x15x1 inch baking pan, lightly coated with vegetable cooking spray, arrange meatballs. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes or until meat is no longer pink in center. In small bowl, combine sour cream and salsa; use as dip.
