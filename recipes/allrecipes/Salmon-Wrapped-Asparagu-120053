Cut salmon widthwise into 1/4-in.-thick slices. To form one bundle, place three to four slices cut side down, overlapping edges slightly; wrap around five to six asparagus spears. Secure with toothpicks. Repeat for remaining bundles. In a large skillet, bring 1-1/2 cups water, wine or broth, onion, chives, salt and peppercorns to a boil. Using a spatula, carefully add bundles. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 7-8 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Meanwhile, for sauce, in a skillet, saute mushrooms and green onions in butter and oil until tender. Stir in flour, salt and pepper until blended. Gradually add milk. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Add chives. Serve over bundles.
