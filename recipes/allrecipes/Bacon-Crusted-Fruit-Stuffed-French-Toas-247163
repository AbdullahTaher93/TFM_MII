Place bacon slices in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon slices to paper towels; dice. Reserve bacon grease. Blend cream cheese, 2 tablespoons butter, and sugar in a separate bowl. Fold strawberries and lemon juice into the filling. Divide filling between 2 slices of bread, spreading it out to the edges. Cover with remaining 2 slices of bread. Press sandwiches lightly together. Mix eggs, coconut milk, vanilla extract, ground nutmeg, and salt in a shallow bowl to make egg wash. Melt 1 1/2 teaspoon reserved bacon grease and 1 1/2 teaspoon butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle half the diced bacon evenly in the skillet. Dip 1 side of each sandwich in the egg wash. Place on top of the bacon in the skillet; cook until eggs are set and slightly browned, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Melt remaining 1 1/2 teaspoon bacon grease and 1 1/2 teaspoon butter in the skillet. Sprinkle remaining diced bacon in the skillet. Dip the second side of each sandwich in egg wash and return to the skillet; cook until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Cut sandwiches in half and garnish with mint.
