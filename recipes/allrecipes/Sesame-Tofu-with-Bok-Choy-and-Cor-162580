Place sesame seeds in medium bowl. Add tofu and gently roll around to coat cubes. Heat 2 teaspoons of the oil in medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add tofu and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil in wok or large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add bok choy, ginger, and garlic and stir-fry 4 minutes. Add baby corn and stir-fry 2 minutes longer. Toss in tofu and heat through.
