In a small mixing bowl, stir together mayonnaise, mustard, and relish. Mix well until it becomes a nice pastel color. In a separate bowl, stir together pineapple and Cajun pepper. Place shredded lettuce into a large bowl. Pour pineapple mixture on top of the lettuce. Place bay leaves as a garnish around the edge of the bowl. Drizzle dressing lightly over the salad.
