Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch baking pan. In a large mixing bowl, stir together brown sugar, oil, egg, buttermilk, salt and vanilla. Gradually stir in flour just until moistened. Fold in rhubarb and walnuts. Pour batter into prepared pan. Combine 1/4 cup sugar, melted butter and cinnamon; sprinkle on top of batter. Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 75 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center of loaf comes out clean.
