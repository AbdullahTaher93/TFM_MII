In a bowl, combine the milk, egg and butter. Add biscuit mix, 1/2 cup cheese and onion. Spoon into six greased muffin cups. Sprinkle with poppy seeds and remaining cheese. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
