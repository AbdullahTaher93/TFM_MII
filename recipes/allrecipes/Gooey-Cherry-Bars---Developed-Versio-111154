Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a medium bowl, mix flour, SPLENDA(R) and 3/4 cup butter until crumbly. Press into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven 12 to 15 minutes, until light brown. In a food processor, combine egg substitute, SPLENDA(R), molasses, vanilla and baking powder and process until smooth. Pour in maraschino and dried cherries and pulse until just chopped and incorporated, but not pulverized. Pour over crust. Bake 25 minutes, until center is set.
