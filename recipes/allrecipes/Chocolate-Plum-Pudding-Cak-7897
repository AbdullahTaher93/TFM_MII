Soak raisins in boiling water to cover for 5 minutes. Drain. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan. Sift together all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cocoa; set aside. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, then the applesauce. Beat the flour mixture into the applesauce mixture. Stir in the raisins and walnuts. Turn batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 80 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely. Chill in refrigerator.
