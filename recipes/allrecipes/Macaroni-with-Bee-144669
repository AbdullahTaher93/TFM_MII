Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add macaroni, and cook until tender according to package instructions. Drain in a colander, and set aside. Meanwhile, heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and onion; cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until meat is no longer pink and onion is soft and translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper; stir to combine. Stir tomato sauce and corn into mixture in pan. Cook until sauce comes to a boil, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in reserved cooked macaroni. Scoop onto plates, and serve warm.
