Heat oil in large skillet on medium-high heat. Add chicken and onions; cook and stir 5 to 7 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. Add water, mushrooms with their liquid, the bouillon cubes and noodles; mix well. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover. Simmer 10 to 12 minutes or until noodles are tender and only a small amount of liquid remains. Stir in peppers. Cook an additional 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat.
