In a bowl, mix together the flour and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Add butter and, with your fingers or a pastry blender, rub or cut in until mixture forms fine crumbs. Add 3 to 5 tablespoons of ice water, one tablespoon at a time, and stir after each addition until dough sticks together. Gather dough in your hands and knead briefly just to form a ball. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill at least 1 hour or up to 1 day. Meanwhile stem, seed, and dice red, green, and yellow peppers. Dice zucchini. Seed tomatoes, then dice them. Combine peppers, zucchini, tomatoes, eggplant, and garlic in a 12- to 14-inch frying pan along with 1/4 cup olive oil. Stir often over medium-high heat until vegetables are softened and lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in basil. Season to taste with additional salt and pepper. Set aside to cool slightly. (If making ahead, package airtight and chill up to 1 day. Bring to room temperature before using.) When dough has chilled, unwrap it and, with your fingers, press it evenly over the bottom and up the sides of a 10-inch tart pan with removable rim. Fill crust with pie weights (or dried beans) and bake in a 450 degrees F oven until rim begins to brown, about 20 minutes. Pour off the weights (or beans) and continue baking until crust bottom is lightly browned, about 10 minutes more. Fill crust with vegetable mixture. Arrange goat cheese slices on top. Beat together eggs and cream until smooth. Carefully pour over vegetables and cheese. Place filled tart pan on a baking sheet. Bake tart in a 325 degrees F oven until filling is firm when gently pressed in center and edges are lightly browned, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool slightly, then carefully remove pan rim. Serve warm or at room temperature. Cut into wedges to serve. Mix arugula with remaining oil and the lemon juice and serve a portion alongside each tart wedge.
