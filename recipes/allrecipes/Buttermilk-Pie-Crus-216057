Whisk the flour and salt together in a bowl. With a pastry cutter, cut the shortening and butter into the flour until the chunks are the size of small peas. Stir in buttermilk and vegetable oil with a fork until the dough is moistened and beginning to gather together. Form the dough into a compact shape. Divide the dough in half, and shape each half into a ball. Roll out each pie crust between 2 sheets of parchment paper.
