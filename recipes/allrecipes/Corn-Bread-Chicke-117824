In a large resealable plastic bag, combine corn bread mix and salad dressing mix. Pour milk into a shallow bowl. Dip chicken in milk, then place in bag and shake to coat. In a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, brown chicken in oil on both sides. Cook, uncovered, over medium heat for 6-7 minutes on each side or until juices run clear.
