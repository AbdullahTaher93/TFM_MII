Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Place carrots in a large bowl; add cornstarch and toss, using your hands, until evenly coated. Sprinkle coconut sugar, cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, oregano, and thyme over carrots. Drizzle olive oil over seasoned carrots and toss to coat. Spread carrots onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes; flip and continue baking until lightly browned and crispy, 10 to 15 minutes more.
