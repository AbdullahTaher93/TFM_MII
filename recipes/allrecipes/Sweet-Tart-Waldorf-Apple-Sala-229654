Toss diced apples with lemon juice in a salad bowl. Beat Neufchatel cheese, whipped cream, brown sugar, mayonnaise, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until dressing is smooth and creamy. Stir grapes and celery into apples and toss lightly with dressing to coat. Top salad with walnut halves and sweetened dried cranberries.
