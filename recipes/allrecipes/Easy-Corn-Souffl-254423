Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 4-cup souffle dish with butter. Dust dish with flour; tap out excess. Beat cream-style corn, egg yolks, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat egg whites with cream of tartar in another bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Fold a large spoonful of whipped egg whites into corn mixture until incorporated. Fold corn mixture into remaining egg whites. Pour into the prepared souffle dish. Bake in the preheated oven until souffle is golden brown and center is set, 25 to 30 minutes.
