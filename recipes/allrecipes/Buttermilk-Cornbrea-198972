Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a 10-inch round cast-iron skillet or other 1 1/2-quart baking dish with non-stick cooking spray. In a small bowl, combine cornmeal and flour. Set aside. In a large bowl, whisk egg, egg whites, buttermilk, oil, SPLENDA(R), and salt until blended. Scatter baking powder over top and whisk just until blended. Stir in dry ingredients just until moistened (some lumps are okay). Scrape into prepared skillet or dish. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, or until a knife inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pan 10 minutes. Cut into 8 wedges. Serve warm or completely cool.
