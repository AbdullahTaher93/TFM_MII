Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir shallot and garlic in butter until soft and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Pour lemon juice and white wine into the skillet; season with kosher salt and black pepper. Cook the liquid at a simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid reduces enough to stick to the back of a spoon, 20 to 30 minutes. Stir tomatoes and artichoke hearts into the reduced sauce; cook until warmed, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove skillet from heat, add cold butter pieces, and swirl skillet off heat until the butter melts and emulsifies into the sauce. Stir flour and seasoned salt together in wide, shallow bowl. Dredge mahi mahi fillets in flour mixture to coat. Heat olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry mahi mahi in the oil until the fish flakes easily with a fork in the center, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer mahi mahi to a platter; top with the sauce.
