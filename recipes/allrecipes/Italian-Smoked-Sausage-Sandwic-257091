Preheat oven at 425 degrees F. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the sausage, onions and peppers in the tomato sauce for 8-10 minutes, stirring often. Spoon the mixture into buns and place on a baking sheet, top with shredded cheese. Bake for 3-5 minutes, just until the cheese has melted.
