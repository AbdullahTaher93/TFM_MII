Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange chicken breast halves in a single layer in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Top each breast half with a half slice of Provolone cheese. In a medium bowl, blend cream of chicken soup and white wine. Pour over the chicken. In a separate medium bowl, mix the butter and stuffing mix. Top the chicken with the stuffing mixture. Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
