In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs, buttermilk, oil and sugar. Stir in cereal and raisins. Sift together flour, baking soda and salt; add to egg mixture. Stir just until all ingredients are moistened. If desired, store batter, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 7 days. To bake, gently stir batter; fill greased muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm. (All of the batter does not need to be baked at once.)
