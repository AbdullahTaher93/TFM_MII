Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Trim excess fat from the lamb chops and place them into a greased 2 quart casserole dish. Cover the lamb with a layer of sliced onion, then sprinkle with 1/3 of the parsley, salt and pepper. Cover the onions with the sliced carrots, then sprinkle with another 1/3 of the parsley, salt and pepper. Cover the carrot layer with a layer of potatoes, and sprinkle with remaining parsley, salt and pepper. Add enough cold water to fill the dish halfway. Bake, covered, for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, then remove the cover and continue to bake for an additional 30 minutes.
