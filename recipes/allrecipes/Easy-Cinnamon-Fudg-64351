Line an 8-inch square baking pan with foil, allowing foil to extend over sides. Butter foil. In bowl, mix together sugar, cocoa and cinnamon. In a saucepan, heat butter and milk until butter melts. Remove from heat; add vanilla extract. Combine with sugar mixture. Stir in nuts. Pour into prepared pan. Refrigerate at least 1 hour. Use foil to lift out of pan. Cut into 2-inch squares. Diagonally cut each square in half, making triangles. Garnish with nut halves, if desired.
