Wash beets and trim off greens. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil, add beets and cook, covered, until beets are tender. Remove from heat, drain, and peel and slice when cool. In a large bowl, whisk together the water, vinegar, caraway seeds, sugar, onion, horseradish, cloves, salt, pepper and oil. Add beets and toss to coat. Let stand for several hours, stirring occasionally. Serve at room temperature or chilled, as desired.
