Cook the pasta as directed on package until just tender; drain, cover and keep warm. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, add shrimp; saute until just cooked, about 2 to 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon. Add remaining oil to the empty skillet; add garlic and pepper flakes; cook until garlic starts to sizzle. Add tomatoes; bring to a boil. Lower heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally and adding water if necessary, until flavors blend and sauce is thick enough to coat the pasta; about 10 minutes. Add shrimp and parsley to the tomato mixture. Cook to heat through. Drain pasta. Add about 2/3 of the sauce to pasta and toss. Serve with remaining sauce spooned over pasta and topped with Parmesan cheese.
