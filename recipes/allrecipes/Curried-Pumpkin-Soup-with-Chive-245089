Whisk pumpkin puree and Swanson(R) Chicken Broth together in a medium saucepan. Stir in half-and-half, curry powder, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Cook over medium heat for about 10 minutes until mixture begins to steam; do not bring to a boil. Adjust seasoning, if needed. Keep warm over low heat until ready to serve. Ladle into small bowls. Garnish each serving with a dollop of sour cream and chopped chives.
