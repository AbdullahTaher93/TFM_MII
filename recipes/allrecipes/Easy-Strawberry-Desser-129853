Stir boiling water into dry gelatin mix in large bowl at least 2 min. until completely dissolved. Add two thirds of the frozen whipped topping (about 2 cups); stir with wire whisk until whipped topping is completely melted and mixture is well blended. Refrigerate remaining whipped topping for later use. Spoon strawberries evenly into five dessert cups; cover evenly with the gelatin mixture. Refrigerate 2 hours or until set. Top evenly with the remaining whipped topping just before serving. Store leftover desserts in refrigerator.
