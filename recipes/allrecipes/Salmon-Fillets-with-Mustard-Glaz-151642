Heat oil in medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add salmon, skin-side up, and cook for about 5 minutes or until browned. Turn salmon and season with black pepper. Add 1/2 cup broth. Heat to a boil. Cover and cook over low heat 5 minutes or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Remove salmon and keep warm. Add remaining broth, vinegar, mustard and brown sugar. Heat to a boil. Cook over medium heat 10 minutes or until mixture is slightly thickened and reduced to 1/4 cup. Serve over salmon.
