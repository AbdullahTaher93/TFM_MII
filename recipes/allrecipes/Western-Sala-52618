Place the shredded lettuce in a large, flat dish. Layer with cucumbers, green onions, green bell pepper, cauliflower, baby carrots, broccoli, and radishes. Pour drained beans over the vegetables. Cover with Ranch-style dressing, and top with nacho-flavor tortilla chips. Cover, and chill until serving.
