Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10x15x2 inch baking dish. Place ground sirloin in a large skillet over medium heat and saute 1 minute. Add chopped onion and continue to cook until meat is no longer pink and onion is beginning to brown. Pour mixture into greased baking dish. Top meat layer with green beans and cauliflower. Sprinkle cheese over vegetables, then spread evenly with cream of mushroom soup. Place potatoes in a large pot. Cover them with water and bring to a boil. Boil 10 minutes, or until tender. Drain. To potatoes add softened cream cheese and butter or margarine. Whip until all ingredients are combined. Pour in milk and continue to whip until potatoes are smooth and fluffy. Add garlic powder, salt, and pepper to taste. Spread potatoes over soup layer. Sprinkle lightly with chives. Bake uncovered in preheated oven for 35 to 45 minutes, until potatoes are golden brown.
