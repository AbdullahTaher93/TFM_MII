Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Line the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish with slices of chipped beef. Wrap bacon slices around chicken breasts, and place on top of chipped beef. In a medium bowl, mix together condensed soup and sour cream. Pour sour cream mixture over chicken breasts, and sprinkle with paprika. Bake in preheated oven for 2 hours.
