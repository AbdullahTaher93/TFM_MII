Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix ground venison, onion, stuffing mix, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, vegetable juice cocktail, and yellow mustard in a large bowl with your hands until thoroughly combined. Place half the venison mixture into a 9x11-inch casserole dish; pat the meat mixture into an even layer. Spread morel mushrooms over meat; top with Cheddar cheese slices. Spread remaining half of venison mixture over cheese slices; pat down to form an even layer and press the edges together to seal in the mushrooms and cheese. Arrange bacon slices over the meatloaf; spread barbeque sauce evenly over the loaf. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until the meatloaf is browned and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the loaf reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Drain excess grease and allow loaf to stand for 5 minutes before serving.
