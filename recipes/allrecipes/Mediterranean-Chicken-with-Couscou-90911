In a 2- to 4-cup microwave-safe container, combine broth, tomato paste, cumin, cayenne, and garlic. Cover and microwave on full power (100%) for 2 to 4 minutes, or until mixture boils. Meanwhile, rinse chicken, pat dry, and cut into 3/4-inch pieces. Evenly arrange chicken around perimeter of a shallow 4-quart microwave-safe dish; place zucchini in center. Top evenly with bell peppers and beans. Pour hot broth mixture over all. Cover tightly and microwave on full power (100%) for 10 more minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink in center; cut to test. Meanwhile, in a 1-quart serving dish, combine couscous, cinnamon, and raisins; pour in 1 1/2 cups boiling water and stir to blend. Immediately cover tightly and let stand until almost all liquid has been absorbed (about 5 minutes). To serve, fluff couscous with a fork. Spoon onto individual plates and top with chicken, vegetables, and sauce.
