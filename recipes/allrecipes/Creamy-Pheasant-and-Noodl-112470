Place carrot, onion, celery, parsley, and bay leaf into a large (4-quart) slow cooker. Add cubed pheasant meat, then stir together cream of mushroom soup, water, thyme, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; pour over pheasant. Cover and cook on Low for 8 to 9 hours, or on High for 4 to 4 1/2 hours. Stir frozen peas into pheasant and season to taste with salt, pepper, and paprika. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Serve creamy pheasant on a bed of noodles.
