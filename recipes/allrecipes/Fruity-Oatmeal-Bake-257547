Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Combine oats, brown sugar, wheat germ, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Whisk milk, melted butter, and eggs together in a bowl. Pour over oat mixture; mix until blended. Fold in apple, peach, and blueberries. Pour mixture into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cut into squares.
