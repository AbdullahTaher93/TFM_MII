Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Place paper baking cup in each of 24 regular-size muffin cups. Beat cream cheese, sugar and 1 egg in medium bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Stir in 1 cup of the chocolate chips; set aside. Beat cake mix, water, oil and 3 eggs in large bowl on low speed 30 seconds. Beat on medium speed 2 minutes. Divide batter among muffin cups (1/4 cup in each). Top each with 1 tablespoon cream cheese mixture. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until tops spring back when touched lightly. Cool 10 minutes in pan. Remove from pan; cool completely, about 30 minutes. Frost tops with frosting. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips.
