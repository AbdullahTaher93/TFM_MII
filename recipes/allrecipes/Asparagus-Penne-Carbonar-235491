In a skillet, melt butter over medium heat and add asparagus and lemon rind. Cook for about 5 minutes or until tender crisp. Stir in lemon juice and mint; set aside. In large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta according to package directions or until al dente. Drain and set aside. Meanwhile, in a bowl, whisk together eggs, Parmesan cheese, parsley and pepper; add to drained pasta and toss for about 45 seconds until pasta is creamy and coated well. Add asparagus mixture and toss to combine. Top with grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.
