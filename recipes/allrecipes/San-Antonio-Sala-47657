In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown the ground beef. Season with chili powder, cumin, salt and pepper. Remove from heat when beef is cooked through. In a large salad bowl, toss together the lettuce, tomato, Cheddar cheese, cilantro and pinto beans with their juice. Mix in the ground beef and corn chips. Toss in the jalapeno, green onion, and salsa, if desired.
