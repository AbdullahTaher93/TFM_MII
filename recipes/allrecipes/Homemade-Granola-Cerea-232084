Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Mix oats, flour, honey, wheat germ, cashews, almonds, vegetable oil, coconut, brown sugar, vanilla, and salt together in a large bowl; spread onto a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, stir, and increase heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Continue cooking until the granola is golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Cool granola completely before storing in an air-tight container.
