Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Coat a 9-inch cake pan with non-stick cooking spray. Drain apricots and pat dry using paper towels. In a large bowl, combine flour, ginger, 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, and salt. In another large bowl, whisk egg, egg whites, SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, trans-free spread, milk, and vanilla. Add dry ingredients and stir just until combined. (Batter will be thick.) Spread a little less than half the batter in prepared pan. Arrange apricots, cut side up, over batter. In a small bowl, combine SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice. Sprinkle over apricots. Spoon remaining batter evenly over the top. Bake 35 to 40 minutes, or until edge of cake pulls away from pan and a tester inserted in center of cake comes out clean. Cool in pan for 15 minutes. Serve warm or room temperature.
