In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat, stir flour until medium-brown in color, 6 to 7 minutes. (If making ahead, cool and store airtight for up to 2 days.) Skim off and discard most of fat from drippings in turkey roasting pan. Whisk toasted flour into drippings in pan until smooth. Slowly add broth and wine, whisking until smooth. Set pan over high heat and stir, scraping drippings free from pan until gravy boils vigorously. Simmer and stir until smooth 5 minutes more. Add salt and pepper to taste.
