Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil. Roast pumpkin until tender, about 45 minutes. Combine pumpkin, coconut beverage, chicken broth, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, sage, and salt in a stockpot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes. Blend soup using an immersion blender or hand mixer until smooth. Serve with a dollop of yogurt, if desired, and a sprinkling of nuts.
