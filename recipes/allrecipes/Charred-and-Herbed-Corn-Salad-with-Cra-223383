Place corn kernels in a colander to filter out small pieces; transfer to a bowl. Add leeks and garlic; stir to combine. Toss diced avocado with lemon juice in a separate bowl to avoid browning. Heat vegetable oil in a wok over high heat; cook and stir corn mixture until corn is uniformly browned, 4 to 8 minutes. Fold corn mixture, avocado, rice vinegar, basil, salt, and tarragon together in a serving bowl. Sprinkle with crabmeat.
