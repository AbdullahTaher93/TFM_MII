If using dried mushrooms, place in a small bowl. Add enough boiling water to cover and let stand for 30 minutes; drain. Rinse and drain again. Cut any large morels into bite-size strips. Set mushrooms aside. In a shallow dish combine the 3 tablespoons flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and lemon-pepper seasoning; coat turkey with flour mixture. In a large skillet cook turkey in 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes or until tender and no longer pink and an instant-read thermometer registers 170 degrees F, turning once. Remove turkey; cover to keep warm. For sauce, in the same skillet cook morels, green onion, and garlic in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter for 3 to 4 minutes or until tender. In a small bowl combine LACTAID(R) Whole Milk and the 1 tablespoon flour; stir with a whisk or fork until combined. Stir into mushroom mixture in skillet. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. If desired, stir in sherry. Cook and stir for 1 minute more. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Place turkey on serving plates. Spoon some of the sauce over turkey. If desired, garnish with fresh herbs. Pass remaining sauce.
