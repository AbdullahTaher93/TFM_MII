Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Prepare a 9-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Stir pork and beans, brown sugar, ketchup, barbeque sauce, bacon, and dry mustard together in the prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven, stirring every 20 minutes or so, until bacon fat is rendered throughout the beans mixture, 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 hours.
