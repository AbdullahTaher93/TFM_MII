Cut the sausage into 1/4 thick slices. Place a large skillet over medium high heat, coat with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and cook and stir the onion for 1 minute, until just golden. Add the roasted garlic puree, stir together. Add the spicy jalapeno slices, brown on both sides, about 2 minutes. Add the asparagus, tomatoes and chick peas, toss with the sausage mix, and season with the salt, pepper and fresh basil. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 2 minutes with the reserved pasta liquid. Toss in the cooked pasta and heat through, for 2 more minutes. To serve, top with the mozzarella balls, and lightly drizzle with the remaining olive oil.
