Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 11x7 inch pan. In a medium bowl, cream the butter, sugar, egg and vanilla until well blended. Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and nutmeg and slowly add to mixture, alternating with 1/3 cup orange juice and 2 teaspoons of rind. Stir in the coconut and carrots. Pour batter into baking pan. Bake for about 35 minutes in the preheated oven. Let cool on wire racks. Combine 1/2 cup of orange juice, 1 teaspoon of orange rind and 1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar. Warm slightly and pour over cooled bars.
