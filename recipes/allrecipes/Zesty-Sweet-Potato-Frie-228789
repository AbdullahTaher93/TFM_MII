Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add sweet potato pieces, and boil until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Drain and run cold water over the sweet potatoes. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat; stir in garlic and sweet potato fries. Place a lid over the skillet and let fries steam for about 5 minutes. Remove lid and sprinkle sweet potatoes with paprika, chili powder, and seafood seasoning. Continue to fry sweet potatoes, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 more minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
