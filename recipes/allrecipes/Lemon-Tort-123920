In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar until stiff and glossy. Gradually beat in 1 cup sugar. Add vanilla. Spread in a well-greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 300 degrees F for 1 hour. Remove to a draft-free spot to cool. Meanwhile, in the top of a double boiler, beat egg yolks until lemon-colored. Add remaining sugar, lemon juice and peel. Cook over hot but not boiling water, stirring occasionally, until thick. Cool thoroughly. Spread half of cream over meringue shell; cover with custard. Spread remaining cream on top. Cover and refrigerate. Torte is best made a day ahead.
