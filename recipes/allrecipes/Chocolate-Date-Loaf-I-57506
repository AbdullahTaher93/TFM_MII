Place dates in a small bowl with boiling water and baking soda. Let stand until cooled. Melt chocolate chips with margarine in a bowl over a pan of simmering water, or in the microwave. Stir frequently until smooth. In a medium bowl, beat egg and stir in sugar, salt and vanilla. Stir in the melted chocolate and date mixtures. Combine the flour and baking powder, and stir into the date mixture until just blended. Scrape into a greased 9x5 inch loaf pan. Let stand for 20 minutes while you preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted into the crown of the loaf comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from the pan. Wrap in aluminum foil, and refrigerate overnight, as the loaf will cut better on the second day.
