Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan. Stir together flour, baking powder, salt, and cheese in a large bowl. Mix in milk and melted butter. Stir to form a soft dough. Spoon dough into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 34 to 40 minutes. Remove from pan to cool.
