Melt the butter with the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the shallots or onion and garlic and saute until soft, but not brown, about 2 minutes. Add all the mushrooms to the pan and fry, stirring frequently, until just becoming soft and the juices are beginning to run, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the sherry, tomato paste, and chunks of turkey and stir to mix well. Reduce the heat to low and leave to heat through. Meanwhile, prepare the polenta. Bring the stock to a boil in a saucepan. Gradually pour in the polenta, stirring constantly. When all the polenta has been added, stir in the parsley. Reduce the heat to medium and stir until the polenta is thick, about 2 minutes. Season to taste. Add the cream to the turkey and mushroom sauce and stir to mix; remove from the heat. Taste and add seasoning, if required. Spoon the polenta to one side of 4 warm plates and serve the sauce alongside. Garnish with parsley sprigs.
