Heat a cast-iron or other heavy skillet over medium heat. When hot, add bacon strips in a single layer. Cook until browned on bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip bacon, using tongs, and cook until browned on both sides, about 2 minutes. Drain and reserve fat for another use, and repeat with remaining bacon. Drain bacon on paper towels. Serve immediately.
