Cook sausage links according to package directions. Set aside. In a bowl, combine pancake mix, 1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons water and vanilla. Stir until large lumps disappear. Do not over mix. Pour 1/2 cup of batter into the shape of a football onto a hot nonstick griddle. Place one sausage link lengthwise in the center of the football. Cut two additional links into thirds; arrange 3 sausage pieces on each side of the whole link to form the laces. When bubbles form on top of pancake, carefully turn with a large spatula. Cook until the second side is golden brown. Remove to a serving plate; keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter and sausage. Serve.
