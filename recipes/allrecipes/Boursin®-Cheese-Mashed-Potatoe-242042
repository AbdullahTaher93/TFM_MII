Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain and return potatoes to the pot. Pour buttermilk over the potatoes and mash until creamy. Stir cheese into the potatoes until melted completely and smooth.
