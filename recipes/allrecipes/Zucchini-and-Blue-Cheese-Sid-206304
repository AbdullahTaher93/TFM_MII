Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place the zucchini and garlic in the skillet, cover. Cook until zucchini is just tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes; heat until warmed through. Remove from heat; sprinkle immediately with blue cheese. Cover, and allow cheese to soften before serving.
