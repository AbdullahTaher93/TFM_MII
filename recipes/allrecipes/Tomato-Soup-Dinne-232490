Crumble sausage into a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain excess grease from the skillet. Stir tomato soup, heavy cream, sun-dried tomatoes, basil pesto, garlic, dill, 1/2 teaspoon dried parsley, salt, and black pepper together in a saucepan; bring to a simmer and stir sausage into the soup mixture. Cook until hot, about 5 minutes. Garnish with Parmesan cheese and a sprig of parsley to serve.
