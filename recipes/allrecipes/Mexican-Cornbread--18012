Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x9 inch baking pan. In a large bowl, mix together cornmeal, flour, Cheddar cheese, onion, green pepper and jalapeno. Stir in eggs, creamed corn and milk. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted into center of a loaf comes out clean.
