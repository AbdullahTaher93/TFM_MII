In a bowl or mold, add 1 cup of the water and the contents of all four gelatin packets. Stir and let it sit while you brew the tea. In a microwave safe bowl, add the remaining 3 cups of water and the 10 tea bags. Zap it in the microwave until the water comes to a boil (typically 3 minutes). Stir and cover the tea (I cover with plastic wrap and then put a pot holder on top to help keep in the heat). Let the tea steep for 3-5 minutes. Add the Splenda to the tea and stir. Then pour the tea into the dissolved gelatin and stir well. Be sure to get up all those little bits sticking to the sides and bottom of the bowl (otherwise the will form a very rubbery skin). Refrigerated for several hours.
