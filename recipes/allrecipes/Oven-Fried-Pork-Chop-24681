Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Pour butter into a 9x13 inch baking pan. Stir together egg, milk and pepper. Dip pork chops in egg mixture, coat with stuffing mix and place in pan. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes. Turn chops and bake for another 10 minutes, or until no pink remains in the meat and juices run clear.
