Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Rub pork with rosemary, thyme, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Heat oil in a medium oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat; add the pork and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 4 minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the pork registers 145 degrees F for medium, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer the pork to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes. Return the pan to medium-high heat. (Use caution because the handle will still be very hot.) Add sugar, vinegar, sherry and ginger; cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar is melted, about 1 minute. Stir in mango and remove from the heat. Transfer the mixture to a blender or food processor. Puree until smooth. Slice the pork and serve with the sauce.
