Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees F. Cut pork crosswise into 12 equal pieces. Place pieces, a few at a time, between sheets of waxed paper or plastic wrap. Pound with a flat mallet until pieces are 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Pour flour, eggs, and bread crumbs into three separate wide, shallow bowls for dipping. Working with one piece of pork at a time, dip each first in flour, then egg, then bread crumbs, turning pork in each to coat all sides. Place pieces as coated in a single layer on a large platter or divide among 2 plates. Combine 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a 12- to 14-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. When butter melts and pan is hot, add half the pork pieces (or as many as will fit in a single layer). Cook until golden brown on bottom, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Turn pieces over and cook to brown other sides, about 1 minute more. Transfer browned pork to a 12- by 17-inch baking pan. Repeat to brown remaining meat. Bake pork until meat is no longer pink in thickest part (cut to test), 8 to 10 minutes. Serve immediately; add salt to taste.
