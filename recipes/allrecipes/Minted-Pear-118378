In a skillet, bring the sugar and water to a boil. Reduce heat; add food coloring and mint extract. Carefully place pears in syrup. Simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until tender. Place pears in a deep bowl; pour syrup over pears. Make sure pears are completely covered in the syrup to prevent browning. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or until serving. Garnish with fresh mint.
