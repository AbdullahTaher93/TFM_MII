Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners. Mash bananas and sugar together in a bowl; add egg and vanilla extract and mix well. Stir whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl; stir into banana mixture just until batter is mixed. Stir oil into batter and fold in cranberries. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 22 to 26 minutes.
