Heat oil in large, heavy pan over medium heat. Stir in onion, jalapeno peppers and garlic. Saute until onion is translucent; about 8 minutes. Stir turmeric, cinnamon, and rice into the pan; stir for 2 minutes. Mix in the chicken broth, water and bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and cook 20 minutes. Turn off the heat altogether and let sit for 5 minutes. Garnish with chopped green onion.
