Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Thoroughly mix the beef, bread crumbs, egg and 1/4 cup soup in a large bowl. Season with salt and black pepper, if desired. Shape the beef mixture into a 10x4-inch loaf. Cut the loaf crosswise into 6 mini meatloaves. Place the mini meatloaves, cut-side down, into a 13x9x2-inch baking dish. Pour the remaining soup over the meatloaves. Bake for 25 minutes or until the meatloaves are cooked through.
