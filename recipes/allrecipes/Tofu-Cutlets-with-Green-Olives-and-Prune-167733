Cut tofu crosswise into four 1/2-inch-thick slices. Pat with paper towels to remove excess moisture. Whisk cornstarch, flour, salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a shallow dish. Heat oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge the tofu in the cornstarch mixture. Add the tofu to the pan and cook, turning once, until crispy and golden, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and cover to keep warm. Add broth and vinegar to the pan; bring to a simmer, stirring often. Add olives, prunes and pepper and simmer until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. To serve, spoon the sauce over the tofu.
