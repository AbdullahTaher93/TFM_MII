Stir together flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt and baking powder; add alternately with water to butter mixture, beating until blended. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes; remove from pan to wire rack. Cool completely. Add blue food color to about 1/2 cup frosting; add yellow food color to about 1 tablespoon frosting; set aside. Frost top and sides of cake, if desired, with white frosting. Spread blue frosting to resemble water over white frosting at bottom one-third of cake. Yellow frosting will be used to create the sun. Use candy-coated peanut butter pieces for the sun rays.
