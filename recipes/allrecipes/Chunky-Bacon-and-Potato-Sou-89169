In large saucepan over medium heat, cook bacon until crisp. Remove and set aside. In bacon drippings, saute leeks until softened, about 3 minutes. Add potatoes and chicken broth. Cover and bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Lightly mash with a potato masher. Add milk, corn, parsley and reserved bacon. Heat until hot, about 5 minutes. Refrigerate leftovers.
