Melt butter in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When butter foams up, add carrots. Season with salt and cook, stirring, until liquid from carrots evaporates and carrots begin to brown around the edges, 5 or 6 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Carefully pour in bourbon. Cook and stir until bourbon is almost evaporated, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle in brown sugar. Stir until carrots are almost cooked through, about 5 minutes. When carrots are nearly tender, raise heat to medium-high to thicken the glaze, 15 to 30 seconds. Season with cayenne pepper and ground black pepper. Transfer to serving dish and garnish with fresh thyme leaves, if desired.
