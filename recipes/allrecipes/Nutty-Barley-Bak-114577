In a large skillet, saute the onion, barley and nuts in butter until barley is lightly browned. Stir in the parsley, green onions, salt and pepper. Transfer to a greased 2-qt. baking dish. Stir in broth. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1-1/4 hours or until the barley is tender and the liquid is absorbed. Sprinkle with parsley if desired.
