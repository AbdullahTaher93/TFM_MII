Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place chicken in the melted butter, skin-side down; cook chicken skin in hot butter until beginning to brown and crisped, about 5 minutes. Flip chicken breasts. Arrange potatoes, carrots, and celery around the chicken. Chop rosemary and lemon thyme together; sprinkle over the chicken and vegetables. Season everything with paprika, garlic powder, seasoned salt, white pepper, salt and black pepper. Place a lid on the skillet and cook until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 45 to 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
