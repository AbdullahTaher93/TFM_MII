Preheat an outdoor grill for indirect medium heat and lightly oil grate. In a small saucepan over medium low heat, combine the vinegar, oil, poultry seasoning and salt. Stir often, until the sauce just starts to bubble. Place the chicken halves on the grill and brush with the sauce, turning them every 7 to 10 minutes. Continue this over indirect medium heat for about 45 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches 180 degrees F (80 degrees F).
