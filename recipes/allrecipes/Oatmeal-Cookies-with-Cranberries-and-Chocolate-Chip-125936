Preheat the oven to 350. Coat 2 large baking sheets with cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine the oats, flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk the brown sugar, oil, egg whites, and vanilla extract until smooth. Stir in the cranberries and chocolate chips. Add to the flour mixture; stir just until blended. Drop the batter by scant tablespoons onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake for 10 minutes, or until the cookies are golden brown. Cool the cookies on racks. Store in an airtight container.
