Put shiitakes in a bowl, cover with hot water, and set aside until soft, about 30 minutes. (Cover bowl to keep water hot.) Drain; remove and discard stems. Heat oil in a large pan or a wok over medium heat. Stir-fry garlic until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Add shiitakes, cabbage, scallions, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low, cover, and braise until cabbage is tender, about 20 minutes.
