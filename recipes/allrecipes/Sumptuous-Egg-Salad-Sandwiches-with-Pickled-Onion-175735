In a 4- to 5-quart pan over high heat, bring 4 cups water and the vinegar, mustard, cumin, and coriander seeds to a boil. Add onion, stir, and cook for 2 minutes. Pour mixture through fine strainer, discarding liquid. In a bowl, combine onion and spice seeds with lemon juice. Set aside to cool. Place eggs in a large bowl. Mash with the back of a fork until they are the desired texture. Mix in 1/2 cup mayonnaise (add more if desired), then stir in mustard, tarragon, and thyme. Add salt and pepper to taste. Place mixed greens in another bowl. Add oil and vinegar and mix just to coat leaves evenly. Add salt and pepper to taste. Place two slices of bread on each plate. Top slices with equal amounts of sliced cucumber, egg salad, and pickled onion salad. Mound equal amounts of mixed greens alongside sandwiches.
