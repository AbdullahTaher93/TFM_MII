Dip chicken in egg whites, then in bread crumbs, turning to evenly coat both sides of chicken. Place in greased 13x9-inch baking pan. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. Top with 2 cups of the spaghetti sauce and cheeses. Sprinkle with oregano. Bake an additional 5 minutes or until mozzarella cheese is melted. Serve over hot pasta tossed with remaining 1 cup spaghetti sauce, heated.
