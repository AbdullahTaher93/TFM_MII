In a large nonstick frying pan, melt the butter over moderate heat. Add the pecans and cook, stirring, until beginning to brown, about 4 minutes. In a small bowl, combine the sugar, ginger, and salt. Sprinkle the mixture evenly over the pecans in the pan and cook, stirring, until the pecans are coated with the sugar mixture and are browned and crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Don't cook them too long or the sugar will begin to melt. Put the pecans on a baking sheet and spread them out to cool.
