Rinse and pat dry the chicken pieces. Mix together on a plate, the chili powder, cumin, garlic powder and salt. Roll the chicken into the spices. In a deep skillet, heat the oil on medium-high heat. Add the chicken and brown on each side. About two minutes per side. Add to the skillet the chilies, onion, garlic and chicken broth. Stir. Once the broth comes to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer and cover. If the skillet doesn't have its own cover then use aluminum foil. Simmer for 40 minutes (25 minutes for boneless). Remove the chicken to a deep serving dish (a casserole dish works nicely). Cover. Skim off any excess fat from the sauce. This step is not necessary if you used skinless chicken. Turn up heat and reduce the liquids to about 1/2 cup, scraping up any yummy browned bits and scraping down the sides. Turn off the heat and add the cilantro. Stir. Then add the sour cream. Mix well. Pour the sauce over the chicken. Serve immediately.
