Open 2-liter bottle of seltzer and pour out 1/2 cup to make room for soda flavor mixture. Add vanilla extract and Stevia Extract In The Raw. Careful! The carbonated water will react 'excitedly' with the natural ingredients in flavor mixture. Allow for ingredients to mix with water and for some gas to be released from bottle prior to uncapping - by unscrewing cap just a small amount to hear 'hissssss.' Pour over ice and enjoy!
