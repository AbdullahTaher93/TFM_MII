Rinse fiddleheads thoroughly; trim stems. Soak in cold salted water for 5 minutes; rinse again. Place fiddleheads in a large skillet; pour in enough water to cover and bring fiddleheads to a boil. Simmer for 10 minutes; drain. Melt butter in same skillet over medium low heat; stir in fiddleheads and toss to coat. Cook fiddleheads until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir vinegar into fiddleheads; season with salt and pepper.
