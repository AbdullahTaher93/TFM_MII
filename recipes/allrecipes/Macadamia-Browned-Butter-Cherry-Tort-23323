Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease and flour 9-inch round or square cake pan. (If using round pan, make sure it is at least 1 1/2 inches deep.) Set aside. Melt butter in small saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until butter foams and turns a delicate golden color (5 to 10 minutes). Remove from heat. Set aside. Place flour, brown sugar, macadamia nuts and salt in food processor bowl fitted with metal blade or 5-cup blender container. Cover; process until nuts are very finely chopped (30 to 60 seconds). Beat egg whites in large mixer bowl at high speed until foamy (1 to 2 minutes). Continue beating, gradually adding sugar, until glossy and stiff peaks form (1 to 2 minutes). Very gently stir nut mixture into egg whites. (Do not over-stir.) Gently stir browned butter and vanilla into egg mixture. (Do not over-stir.) Spread batter into prepared pan. Sprinkle with sliced almonds. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cover with aluminum foil during the last 10 minutes of baking. Run knife along inside of pan. Cool 15 minutes. (Center will sink slightly upon cooling.) Invert onto cooling rack. Invert again onto serving plate so torte is right-side up. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Serve warm or cool with cherry pie filling and whipped cream, if desired.
