Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat and saute onion 10 minutes or until caramelized. Combine garlic, cayenne, turmeric, and cumin in small bowl with 1 tablespoon of the water to make a thick paste. Add to onions and cook, stirring, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring to break up tomatoes, about 2 minutes (do not allow to scorch). Add chicken and turn to coat with spice paste. Stir over medium heat 10 minutes. Add remaining 1 cup water and salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes or until a thermometer inserted in the thickest part of chicken registers 165 degrees F. Stir in vinegar and sugar and simmer 1 minute.
