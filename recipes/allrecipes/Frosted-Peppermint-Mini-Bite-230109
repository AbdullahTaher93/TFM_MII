For Bites: Line mini-muffin tins with mini-paper liners. Mix all ingredients (except crushed peppermint candies) to create a chocolate batter. Divide batter among muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full. Bake until a toothpick inserted into centers comes out clean, about 10 minutes. Let cool in tins on wire racks. For Frosting: Beat butter with a mixer on medium-high speed until pale and creamy, about 2 minutes. Reduce speed to medium. Add sugar, cup at a time, beating after each addition, about 5 minutes. Add vanilla, and beat until buttercream is smooth. Frost each mini bite with buttercream frosting and garnish with peppermint candy.
