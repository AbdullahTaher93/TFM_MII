To make peanut sauce: Place the ingredients in a bowl and stir well. Microwave for 30 seconds. Pound chicken breasts between pieces of plastic wrap to a uniform thickness. Rub each breast with about 1 tablespoon of light soy sauce. Then season both sides of each breast with a couple pinches of salt and pepper. Place in a skillet and grill a couple minutes per side. Remove and cut into strips or cubes and thread onto skewers. Dip into peanut sauce and enjoy.
