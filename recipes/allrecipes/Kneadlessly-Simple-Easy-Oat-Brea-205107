FIRST RISE: In a very large bowl, thoroughly mix flour, 1 cup oats, sugar, salt and yeast. Stir together honey, oil and ice water in a separate bowl; add to dry ingredients and stir vigorously. If too dry, stir in just enough additional water to mix together; dough should be slightly stiff. If dough is very soft, stir in more flour to stiffen. Brush top of dough with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. If desired, for best flavor or convenience, refrigerate dough 3 to 10 hours; this is optional. Then let rise in a cool room 12 to 18 hours. SECOND RISE: Vigorously stir dough. If necessary, stir in enough additional flour to yield a hard-to-stir consistency. Generously grease two 8-1/2 x 4-1/2-inch loaf pans. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon oats in each; tip pans back and forth to spread oats. Using oiled kitchen shears or serrated knife, cut dough in half. Put each half in pan, smoothing top of dough. Brush tops with oil. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon oats over each; press down to imbed. Cover pans with greased plastic wrap. LET RISE USING ANY OF THESE METHODS: For a 2 to 3-hour REGULAR RISE let stand at warm room temperature; for a 45 minute- to 2-hour FASTER RISE, put in a turned-off microwave with 1 cup boiling water; for SLOW RISE, refrigerate up to 24 hours, then put in warm room. As dough nears plastic, remove it; continue until dough is 1/2-inch above pan rim. BAKING: Bake in a preheated 375 degree F oven for 50-60 minutes, until tops are well browned. Cover with foil, bake 10-15 minutes more, until skewer inserted in center comes out with only a few particles on tip (or until center registers 208 degrees to 210 degrees F). Bake 5 minutes more to ensure center doneness. Cool 15 minutes in pan. Turn loaves onto rack to finish cooling. SERVING/STORING: Best served at room temperature or toasted. Store airtight at room temperature 3 days; may be frozen, airtight, for up to 2 months.
