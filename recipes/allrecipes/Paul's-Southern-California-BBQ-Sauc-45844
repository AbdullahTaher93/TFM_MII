Place the apple cider vinegar in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil. Mix in the ketchup, onion, garlic, dry mustard, chili powder, seasoning salt, and cayenne pepper. Stir in the brown sugar. Cook, stirring often, 10 to 15 minutes. Reduce heat, and, stirring occasionally, allow the mixture to simmer about 45 minutes, until thickened. Cool before serving.
