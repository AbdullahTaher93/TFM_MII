In a small saucepan, heat the milk over moderate heat until it comes to a boil. In a blender or food processor, pulse the egg, 2 tablespoons of the sugar, the salt, chocolate chips and liqueur to combine. Turn the blender setting to low or turn the processor on. Pour the hot milk into the blender in a very slow stream. Process the chocolate mixture for 1 minute, until smooth. Pour into 4 chilled demitasse cups and chill in the refrigerator until set, about 1 hour and 30 minutes. When ready to serve, beat the cream until soft peaks form. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar and beat to combine. Top the chocolate cups with an edible flower or candied violet. Place the cups on saucers and serve with demitasse spoons. Serve the whipped cream on the side.
