Line a 9 x 13-inch baking pan with heavy foil, letting it extend 2 to 3-inches over the rim of pan. Grease the foil with non-stick spray. In a 4 quart saucepan over low heat, stir butter, marshmallows, chips and milk until melted and smooth. Stir in Safeway Cinni-Mini Cereal and peanuts. Stir until well coated. Pour into prepared pan, spreading evenly. Let set until firm. Remove from pan by pulling up on foil. Place on cutting board and cut into squares.
