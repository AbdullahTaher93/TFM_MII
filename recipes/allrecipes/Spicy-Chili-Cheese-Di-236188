Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine refried beans, chili, cream cheese, and green chile peppers in the bowl of a stand mixer; mix well. Pour bean mixture into a 9-inch square baking dish and top with Cheddar cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until dip is bubbling and cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.
