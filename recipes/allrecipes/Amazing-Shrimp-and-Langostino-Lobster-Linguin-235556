Bring a large pot of lightly salted and oiled water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; saute bacon, onion, garlic, and red pepper flakes in hot oil until onion is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir white wine into bacon mixture; cook and stir until wine is absorbed, 2 to 4 minutes. Stir shrimp and langostino lobster into bacon mixture; saute until shrimp and langostino are pink, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and stir cooked linguine into shrimp mixture. Stir peas, pesto sauce, and half-and-half into shrimp-linguine mixture; cook and stir until linguine absorbs the liquid, 5 to 10 minutes. Top servings with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
