In a medium sized stock pot, over medium heat, combine soup mix and water, stirring constantly until well mixed. Add broccoli florets, partially cover and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes stirring often. Once broccoli is tender, place soup in a food processor or blender and puree. Once blended return soup mixture to stock pot, add milk and stir. Add cheese to soup mixture keeping 1/2 cup set aside. Stir soup until cheese is melted and then sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup cheese on top of individual soup servings.
