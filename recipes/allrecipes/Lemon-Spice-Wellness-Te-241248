Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add ginger, star anise, cardamom pods, and cinnamon stick. Zest lemons over the saucepan. Slice lemons in half and squeeze juice into the water. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until desired flavor is reached, 5 to 15 minutes. Stir honey into tea and strain tea through a fine-mesh strainer as you ladle into mugs. Add contents in strainer back into saucepan.
