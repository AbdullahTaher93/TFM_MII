Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Mix olive oil, garlic powder, parsley, and salt together in a large bowl; add potatoes and stir until coated. Mix bacon and onion into potato mixture. Spread potato mixture onto a baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and crisp, about 30 minutes. Toss potatoes with Parmesan cheese and top with lemon zest.
