Place the biscuit mix in a large bowl. Combine the remaining ingredients; stir into biscuit mix just until moistened. Fill greased muffin cups three-fourths full. Bake at 350 degrees F for 17-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from the pans to wire racks. Serve warm.
