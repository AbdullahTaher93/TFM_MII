Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pat scallops dry with paper towels and place in a lightly greased 1 quart casserole dish. Bake scallops in preheated oven for 5 minutes. In a small bowl, combine lemon juice and garlic. Remove scallops from oven. Spoon lemon/garlic mixture over scallops and sprinkle generously with lemon pepper. Return scallops to oven and bake until firm, about 10 minutes. Serve warm.
