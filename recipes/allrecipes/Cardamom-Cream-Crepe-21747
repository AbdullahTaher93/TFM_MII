To make crepes: Mix flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in medium bowl. Stir in remaining ingredients. Beat with hand beater until smooth. Lightly butter 6 inch skillet; heat over medium heat until bubbly. For each crepe, pour slightly less than 1/4 cup batter into skillet; immediately rotate skillet until batter covers bottom. Cook until light brown. Run wide spatula around edge to loosen; turn and cook other side until light brown. Stack crepes, placing waxed paper between each; keep covered. Beat cream, brown sugar and cardamom in chilled small bowl with electric mixer on high speed about 2 minutes or just until soft peaks form. Fold in sour cream. Spoon about 2 tablespoons cream mixture onto each crepe; roll up. Place 2 crepes, seam sides down, on each plate. Top with a dollop of cream mixture and cranberry sauce.
