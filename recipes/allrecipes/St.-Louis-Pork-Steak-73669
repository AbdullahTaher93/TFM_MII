Preheat grill to medium-low heat. Season the pork steaks on both sides with seasoned salt and seasoned pepper. In a large bowl, stir together the vinegar and water, and season with seasoned salt and seasoned pepper to taste. Lightly oil the grill grate. Place pork steaks on the grill. Baste steaks with the vinegar mixture on both sides during the first 15 minutes of grilling. Continue to cook steaks to desired doneness, 10 to 15 more minutes. Discard remaining vinegar mixture.
