Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Pour the Hidden Valley(R) Original Ranch(R) Dressing into a large bowl. Add the chicken to the bowl of dressing and mix until the chicken is evenly coated. In a shallow bowl, add the breadcrumbs, Cheddar and Parmesan cheeses and stir until well combined. Dredge each breast in the bread crumb and cheese mixture. Arrange the chicken on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake the chicken for 20 to 25 minutes until the chicken is crisp and an internal temperature of 165 degrees F is reached.
