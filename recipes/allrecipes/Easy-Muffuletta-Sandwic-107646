Mix together vinaigrette, green olives, red peppers, garlic, and parsley. Set aside. Slice loaf in half horizontally. Slightly scoop out insides to make room for filling. Spread half of the vinaigrette/olive mixture on bottom half of loaf. Alternate layers of salami, cheese, and ham. Top with remaining vinaigrette/ olive mixture. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, up to several hours. Unwrap, cut into quarters, and serve.
