In a bowl combine red pepper, red and green onion, jalapeno pepper and leek. Season to taste with Morton(R) Nature's Seasons(R) Seasoning Blend. Mix well and set aside. Season tilapia fillets with 1 tablespoon Morton(R) Nature's Seasons(R) Seasoning Blend. Place one foil sheet over the other to create a double layer. Place 1/8 of the pepper mixture onto the center of the foil. Place 1 tilapia fillet over pepper mixture. Top tilapia with 1 tablespoon butter and 1/8 of the remaining pepper mixture. Add 1 tablespoon orange juice. Fold up the sides of the foil, folding over 3 times on each side to create an airtight seal. Repeat with remaining tilapia fillets. Preheat grill to medium high (about 350 degrees F). Place foil pouches onto the grill and close lid. Grill-bake the pouch for 15 to 18 minutes, turning once. Remove from grill and allow fish to rest for 2 minutes. Carefully cut open each pouch, allowing the steam to escape. Fish should be opaque and flake with a fork.
