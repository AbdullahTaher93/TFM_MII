Preheat the oven broiler. Place quartered jalapenos on a baking sheet, and broil just until they start to brown, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from heat, and allow to cool enough to handle. Leave the broiler on. Stuff each jalapeno quarter with a pepperjack cheese strip, and wrap with chicken and bacon strips, securing with toothpicks. Arrange on the baking sheet. Broil wrapped jalapenos until cheese is melted and bacon and chicken are cooked through, about 5 minutes on each side. Serve on a platter with buffalo wing sauce and bleu cheese dressing for dipping.
