In a small bowl make the vinaigrette: mix together mustard, celery seed, sugar, salad oil, and vinegar. Cover and set aside. Cut off and discard peel and white membrane from grapefruit. Cut between membrane and fruit to release segments; discard seeds. Cut off and discard peel and white membrane from oranges. Cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices; discard seeds. Peel and rinse jicama. In a food processor with a shredder blade (or using a hand grater), finely shred jicama. Pit and peel avocado, and cut into thin wedges; moisten with a little vinaigrette to prevent darkening. Lay lettuce around edges of a platter. Group grapefruit, oranges, jicama, avocado, and kiwi fruit separately on platter, then separate onion slices into rings and scatter them over fruit. Add dressing and salt to taste to individual portions.
