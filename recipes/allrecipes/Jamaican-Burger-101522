Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and garlic; cook and stir for a few minutes. Mix in the habanero pepper and continue cooking until tender. Remove from the heat and transfer to a bowl. Pour in the beans, rice and bread crumbs. Season with ginger, salt, allspice and nutmeg. Mix thoroughly using your hands. Form into 6 patties. Heat the remaining oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat (you can use the same one). Fry the patties until golden on each side, about 10 minutes total. Serve on buns with your favorite toppings.
