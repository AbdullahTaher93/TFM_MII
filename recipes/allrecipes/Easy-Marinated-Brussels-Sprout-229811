Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook Brussels sprouts in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Pour Italian dressing and hot sauce over Brussels sprouts; toss to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator, stirring occasionally, for 4 hours.
