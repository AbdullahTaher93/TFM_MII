In a large bowl, whisk the flour, eggs, milk, butter, onion, Parmesan cheese, garlic, salt and cayenne until combined. Fold in spinach and Monterey Jack cheese. Transfer to a greased 1-1/2-qt. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Serve immediately.
