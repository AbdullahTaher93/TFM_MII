Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add corkscrew pasta and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain and rinse under cold water until cool. Drain well. Place drained pasta into a large bowl, and add artichokes, olives, salami, provolone cheese, bell pepper, Parmesan cheese, and Italian dressing. Stir until well mixed, then cover, and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before serving.
