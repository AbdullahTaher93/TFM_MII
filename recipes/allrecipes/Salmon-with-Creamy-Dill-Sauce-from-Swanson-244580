Season the fish with the salt and black pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the fish and cook for 3 minutes. Turn the fish over and cook for 1 minute. Remove the fish from the skillet. Wipe the skillet clean with a paper towel. Heat the remaining oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and garlic and cook and stir for 3 minutes or until tender. Stir in the wine and cook for 3 minutes or until the wine is almost evaporated. Stir in the stock and heavy cream and heat to a boil. Reduce heat to medium. Cook for 15 minutes or until the mixture is reduced to about 3/4 cup, stirring often. Stir in the dill. Return the fish to the skillet. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the fish flakes easily when tested with a fork.
