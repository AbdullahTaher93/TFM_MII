In a large pot combine apricots, prunes and water and let rest 30 minutes. Stir in the cinnamon stick, lemon slices, tapioca and sugar and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cover, reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes. Stir in raisins, currants and apple and simmer 5 minutes more, until apples are tender. Remove from heat and let cool completely. Remove cinnamon stick and refrigerate until cold.
