Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil; spray with cooking spray. Combine sugar, fennel seeds, crushed red pepper and salt in a medium-sized bowl. Mix in nuts and water. Stir to evenly coat. Spread mixture on prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Bake about 15 minutes, stirring frequently, until nuts are a deep golden brown. Cool. Separate nuts with fork.
