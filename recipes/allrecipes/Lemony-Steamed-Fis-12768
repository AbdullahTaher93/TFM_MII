Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cut 6 foil squares large enough for each fillet. Center fillets on the foil squares and sprinkle each with dill weed, onion powder, parsley, paprika, seasoned salt, lemon pepper, and garlic powder. Sprinkle lemon juice over each fillet. Fold foil over fillets to make a pocket and fold the edges to seal. Place sealed packets on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 30 minutes.
