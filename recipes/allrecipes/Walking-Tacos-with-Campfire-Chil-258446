Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Season beef chuck and pork shoulder generously with salt. Cook in the hot oil in batches until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes per batch. Stir onions, jalapeno chile pepper, and garlic into the Dutch oven; cook until soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, orange juice, lime juice, chili powder, lime zest, cumin, and oregano. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover partially with the lid, and simmer until beef and pork fall apart when pressed, about 3 hours. Divide corn chips among serving bowls. Spoon chili on top. Garnish each serving with cotija cheese, pickled jalapeno peppers, limes, and cilantro.
