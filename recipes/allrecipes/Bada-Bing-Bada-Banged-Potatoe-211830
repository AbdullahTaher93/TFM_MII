Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place the potatoes in a large saucepan of water. Cover; bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat; gently cook potatoes until tender but still firm, about 20 minutes. Drain. Place potatoes on a greased, rimmed baking sheet. Smash the warm potatoes with the heel of your hand or a small pan to flatten slightly and break the skin. Mix together the olive oil, butter, 1 cup Parmesan cheese, basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; add the potatoes and toss well. Return coated potatoes to baking sheet, leaving 1/2 inch space between each potato. Roast potatoes in the preheated oven until lightly browned and slightly crispy; about 30 minutes. Place hot potatoes on a large platter; sprinkle with parsley and the remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.
