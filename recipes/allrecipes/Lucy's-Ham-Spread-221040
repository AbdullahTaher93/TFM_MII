Place ham into a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and boil ham gently for 15 minutes. Drain and allow ham to cool. Place ham into a food processor and pulse several times to grind the meat to your desired texture. Stir tomato sauce, tapioca, ketchup, mustard, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce in a large saucepan over low heat; melt cheese food in the tomato sauce mixture and stir all ingredients smoothly together. Do not allow to simmer. Combine melted cheese food mixture with ground ham in a large bowl; stir thoroughly. Chill before serving.
