Cook bacon in a wide frying pan over medium heat until crisp, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove bacon from pan and drain on paper towels; set aside. Spoon off and discard all but 1 tablespoon of the drippings from pan. Add onion, garlic, and chili powder. Cook over medium heat, stirring often until onions are lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add beans and beer. Cook, stirring often, until hot, then coarsely mash beans with a potato masher. Reduce heat to low and keep warm. Meanwhile, lightly brush both sides of each tortilla with oil (make sure to oil edges). Arrange tortillas well apart on two 12- by 15-inch baking sheets. Bake in a 475 degrees F oven until crisp and golden brown, about 5 minutes (switch position of baking sheets halfway through baking time). To assemble tostadas, set one hot tortilla on each individual dinner plate. Spread tortillas equally with heated beans, then top with equal portions of cheese, lettuce, and salsa. Decoratively arrange avocado and papaya slices in a fan or other attractive pattern atop each tostada. Scatter bacon over fruit.
