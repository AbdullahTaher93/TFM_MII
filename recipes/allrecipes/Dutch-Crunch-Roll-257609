Combine 1 1/4 cup warm water and 2 teaspoons yeast in a large bowl; stir until yeast is dissolved. Stir in 2 1/2 teaspoons sugar. Let stand until yeast forms a creamy foam, about 10 minutes. Sift 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 cup bread flour, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a separate bowl. Stir into the yeast mixture. Add remaining all-purpose and bread flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until dough pulls away from the side of the bowl. Place dough on a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down and cut into 9 equal pieces. Press down on each piece with your palm and roll against the work surface to form into a ball. Place balls of dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover with greased plastic wrap; let rise until puffy, 40 to 50 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine rice flour, 1 cup warm water, vegetable oil, 2 tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons yeast, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a bowl to make topping. Let rest for 5 minutes. Spread topping thickly over tops and sides of the rolls. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
