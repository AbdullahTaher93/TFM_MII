Peel potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Peel and mince or press garlic. Rinse chili; stem, seed (if desired, for less heat), and thinly slice. In a 3- to 4-quart pan over high heat, combine potatoes, garlic, chili, and broth. Cover pan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes. Meanwhile, rinse and coarsely chop broccoli. Add to broth mixture and return to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until potatoes and broccoli are tender when pierced, about 5 minutes longer. In a blender, puree soup in batches. Return to pan. Add fish sauce to taste. Stir often over high heat until steaming. Ladle into soup bowls. Garnish with dollops of sour cream.
