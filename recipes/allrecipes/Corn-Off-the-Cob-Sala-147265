Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Grill corn on preheated grill until the kernels are tender and have browned in spots, about 8 minutes. Set aside to until cool enough to handle. Whisk together the melted butter and lime juice in a large bowl. Slice the kernels off of the corn and place into the bowl along with the red pepper and sun-dried tomatoes. Season with salt, pepper, parsley, and garlic powder. Toss until well combined.
