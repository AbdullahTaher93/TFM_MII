In a large skillet, saute mushrooms in butter for 2 minutes. In a small bowl, combine the sour cream, flour, salt and pepper; stir into mushrooms. Cook just until bubbly, stirring frequently. Spoon the mushroom mixture into a greased 8-in. square baking dish. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 425 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or until golden brown. Sprinkle with parsley before serving.
