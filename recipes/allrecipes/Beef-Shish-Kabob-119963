In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the first seven ingredients; mix well. Remove 1/3 cup for basting; cover and refrigerate. Add beef to bag; seal and turn to coat. Refrigerate overnight. In a skillet over medium heat, partially cook the bacon. Wrap each piece around a water chestnut slice. Drain and discard marinade from beef. On metal or soaked wooden skewers, alternately thread bacon-wrapped water chestnuts, pineapple and beef. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 10-15 minutes or until meat reaches desired doneness, basting frequently with reserved marinade.
