Melt butter with olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir green onions, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper in the hot oil until vegetables are softened, about 2 minutes. Stir lemon juice and 1/4 cup brown sugar into green onion mixture, stirring constantly until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes more. Place catfish fillets into the skillet; cook until catfish easily flakes with a fork, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer catfish to a plate and pour remaining lemon juice sauce on top. Sprinkle with remaining brown sugar.
