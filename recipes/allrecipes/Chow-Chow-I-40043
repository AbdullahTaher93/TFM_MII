Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add green beans, cauliflower, lima beans, and corn. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes or just until tender; drain. Return vegetables to pot, and mix in onions, bell peppers, and green tomatoes. Heat vinegar in a saucepan until boiling. Stir in sugar, salt, celery seed, mustard seed, ground mustard, and ground turmeric until the sugar has dissolved. Pour over vegetables in pot, and bring to a boil. Simmer 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour into 12 sterilized pint jars, and seal.
