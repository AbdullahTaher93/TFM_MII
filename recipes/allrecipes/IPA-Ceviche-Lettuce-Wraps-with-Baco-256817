Combine shrimp and albacore tuna in a small bowl; cover with 1/2 cup lemon juice and 1/2 lime juice. Cure in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Combine remaining lemon juice and lime juice, mango, pale ale, tomato, yellow onion, jalapeno pepper, mango hot sauce, and sriracha sauce in a bowl. Refrigerate until flavors combine, at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spread bacon pieces on the lined baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crisp, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain shrimp and tuna; toss with mango mixture to combine. Divide mixture among napa cabbage and radicchio leaves. Sprinkle bacon on top.
