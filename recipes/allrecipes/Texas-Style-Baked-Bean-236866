Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with 1 tablespoon butter. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in hot oil until onion begins to soften, 5 to 7 minutes. Add bacon, bell pepper, and jalapeno peppers; cook and stir until bacon is browned, 7 to 10 minutes more. Stir beer, barbeque sauce, brown sugar, and molasses together in a large bowl; add pinto beans and bacon mixture. Season with garlic salt and black pepper. Pour beans mixture into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and browned, about 45 minutes.
