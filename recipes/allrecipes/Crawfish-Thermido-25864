Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease 4 small to medium sized ramekins. In a skillet, melt the butter and add mushrooms and white wine; simmer for about 8 minutes. Add the crawfish tails and simmer for another 5 minutes. Gradually blend in flour, salt, and red pepper flakes. Slowly drizzle in the milk, stirring constantly and cook until mixture thickens. Pour mixture into the prepared ramekins. Sprinkle the top of each with a pinch of paprika. Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes or until heated through.
