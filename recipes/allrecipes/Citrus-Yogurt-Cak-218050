Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour a bundt pan. Mix together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Combine the yogurt, citrus zest, and vanilla. Cream the sugar and the egg; add the oil. Alternately, add the flour mixture with yogurt, and mix until just combined, being careful not to over mix. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and bake for 50-55 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool in pan on a rack for 10 minutes. Sprinkle the cooled cake with confectioners' sugar if desired, and serve with orange or lemon slices.
