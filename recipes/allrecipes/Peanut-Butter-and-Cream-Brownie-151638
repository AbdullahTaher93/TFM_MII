Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray an 8 or 9-inch round springform pan with no-stick cooking spray. Prepare brownie mix according to package directions. Spread batter evenly into springform pan. Bake 45 to 48 minutes for 8-inch or 36 to 38 minutes for 9-inch pan. Cool. Beat cream cheese with an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy. Gradually beat in peanut butter, powdered sugar and 3 cups whipped topping until well combined. Keeping dessert in springform pan, spread mixture evenly over cooled brownies. Top with remaining whipped topping. Use the tines of a fork to create swirls in the whipped cream. Sprinkle chocolate shavings on top of whipped cream. Refrigerate 2 hours before serving.
