Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking dish with cooking spray. Mix the flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow dish. Press pork chops in the mixture to coat. Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and brown the pork chops on both sides. In a saucepan over medium-low heat, whisk together the chicken broth, vinegar, sour cream, sugar, savory, and bay leaves. Arrange the pork chops in the prepared baking dish. Pour sauce over the pork chops. Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven.
