Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Sift all-purpose flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside. In a large bowl, whisk egg, brown sugar and canola oil together until smooth. Stir in dry ingredients, then add mashed bananas and Unsweetened Vanilla Almond Breeze. Mix until batter comes together. Fold in chopped white chocolate and pomegranate arils. Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners, then fill about 2/3 full. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until light golden brown and toothpick inserted in muffins comes out clean. Let cool.
