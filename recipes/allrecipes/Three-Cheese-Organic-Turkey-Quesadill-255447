Spray skillet with olive oil and heat over medium heat. Place one wrap on the bottom of the skillet. Top wrap with 2 slices of cheese, shredded; 4 slices of Dietz & Watson Originals Organic Turkey, shredded; half of chopped sage; and 1 slice of cheese, shredded. Top with the second wrap. Grill for about 5 minutes, then flip to the other side and grill for another 5 minutes or until cheese has melted. Serve with 1/2 cup of Dietz & Watson Cranberry Honey Mustard, for dipping. Take off heat and cut into fourths to serve. Repeat for second quesadilla.
