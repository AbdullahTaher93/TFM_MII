Marrow: Dust bones with flour and season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover the bottom of the frying pan with vegetable oil and cook the bones over medium heat, turning them until browned. Transfer the bones to a baking dish with 3/4 of the onion, 2 bay leaves, 4 garlic cloves, celery, fresh ground black pepper and salt to taste. Add beef stock and red wine and cover with aluminum foil, then roast bones for 3 hours. Pull roasting pan from oven and place bones aside to cool. Drain the surface fat and strain stock into a sauce pan over medium heat, reducing stock to one quarter. When bones are cool, scoop out and add marrow to reduced stock and set aside. Marinade: Puree the 4 remaining garlic cloves with the remaining onion, oil, bay leaf, thyme, parsley and cilantro in blender. Season the puree with salt & pepper. Place steaks in a dish and rub marinade over steaks. Cover the dish and refrigerate the steaks for about an hour. Marmalade: Combine water, orange juice, papaya, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and habanero in a sauce pan over medium heat until boiling. Lower the heat and cook for about 8 more minutes while stirring. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. Pour marmalade mixture into blender and mix until smooth. Strain with a china cap or fine sieve. Stir in bone marrow stock to finish marmalade. Potatoes: Place potatoes in a roasting pan and toss with olive oil. Season the potatoes, to taste, with salt and black pepper, then roast in preheated oven for 30 minutes at 350 degrees F. Remove from oven and cool for a couple minutes. Cut potatoes in half. Steaks: Grill steaks to desired doneness. Serve potatoes on a platter topped with steaks and drizzle marrow marmalade on top.
