Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a wide nonstick omelet pan or frying pan over medium-high heat. Stir in apples, onion, and thyme; cook, stirring often, just until apples begin to brown (6 to 8 minutes). Remove to a plate and keep warm. Wearing gloves to protect your hands from the heat, wipe pan clean with a paper towel. In a medium-size bowl, beat eggs and 2 tablespoons water to blend; sprinkle in salt and pepper to taste. In omelet pan, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Pour in eggs and cook, gently lifting cooked portions with a wide spatula to let uncooked eggs flow underneath, until omelet is softly set (3 to 4 minutes). Remove from heat. Spoon two-thirds of the apple mixture down center of omelet; sprinkle with 2/3 cup of the cheese. Top evenly with apricot spread. Fold a third of omelet over filling; slide unfolded edge onto a serving plate, then slip folded portion over top. Spoon remaining apple mixture over omelet and sprinkle with remaining 1/3 cup cheese. Serve at once.
