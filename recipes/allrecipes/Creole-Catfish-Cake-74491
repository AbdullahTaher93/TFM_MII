Broil or grill catfish fillets over medium-high heat, about 5 minutes per side, or until flesh flakes with fork. Allow fillets to cool. Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan. Add the flour. Stir constantly for 2 to 3 minutes, while the roux bubbles. Add the milk slowly, continuing to stir until the cream sauce is thick, 10 to 12 minutes. Add salt, pepper, and mustard, mixing well. Flake the catfish fillets into a bowl. Add the cream sauce and the remaining ingredients, mixing thoroughly. Use the fish mixture immediately or refrigerate for up to 2 days. Using a large spoon, make cakes with the fix mixture and coat them completely with more fresh breadcrumbs. Using a heavy skillet, saute the patties gently in 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter, until they are browned. Keep warm while you continue cooking the cakes, adding more oil and butter as needed.
