In a 6- to 8-quart pan on high heat, bring about 4 quarts water to boiling. Add pasta and cook, uncovered, just until tender to bite, 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a wide bowl stir together oil, dill, and lemon juice. In a small bowl, make dressing. Stir together yogurt, dill, and caraway seed. Cover and chill dressing (up to one day). Drain pasta in a colander and rinse with cold water; drain again. Add cooled, drained pasta to oil mixture and mix gently. Serve, or cover and chill up to 6 hours. To each portion, add yogurt-dill dressing to taste.
