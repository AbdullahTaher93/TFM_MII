In a blender, combine the eggs, milk, pumpkin, sugar, biscuit mix, butter, allspice and vanilla. Cover and process until smooth. Pour into a greased 9-in. pie plate (dish will be full). Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-55 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Serve with whipped topping if desired.
