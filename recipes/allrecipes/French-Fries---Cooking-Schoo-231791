Place potatoes in a large bowl of cold water; refrigerate and allow to soak for at least 30 minutes. When ready to fry, pat potatoes dry with paper towels. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with paper towels. Cook potatoes in batches in hot oil, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender but not browned, about 3 minutes. Allow to temperature of the oil to return to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) between batches. Transfer potatoes to one of the prepared baking sheets. Increase oil temperature to 350 degrees (175 degrees C). Cook potatoes again, working in batches and stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Allow oil temperature to return to 350 degrees (175 degrees C) between batches. Transfer potatoes to remaining prepared baking sheet and season with salt.
