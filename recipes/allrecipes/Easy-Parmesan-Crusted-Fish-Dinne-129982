Preheat broiler. Place fish on rack of broiler pan. Spread fish evenly with mayo; top with Parmesan cheese. Broil 5 to 6 inches from heat source, 6 to 8 min. or until fish is golden brown and flakes easily with fork, depending on thickness of fish. (If your broiler does not allow you to position fish 5 to 6 inches from heat source, follow Baking Directions below.) Meanwhile, prepare stuffing mix as directed on package. Cook green beans. Serve fish with stuffing, green beans, lemon wedges and whole grain roll.
