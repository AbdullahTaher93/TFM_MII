Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Rub the roast with the salt and pepper. In an ovenproof Dutch oven, bring the broth, wine, orange juice, and allspice to a boil over high heat. Place the roast in the pot and return to a boil. Cover the pot and place in the oven. Bake, turning the roast several times, for 2 hours. Add the onions, prunes, and apricots and cook for 1 hour, or until the roast is very tender. Place on a cutting board, cover, and let stand for 15 minutes. Remove the strings from the roast and cut into thin slices. Arrange the meat on a platter and spoon the pan juices and fruit over top.
