Stir bread crumbs, flour, seafood seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and ground black pepper together in a large bowl. Beat half-and-half and eggs together in a bowl until completely blended. Stir in 1/2 cup pickles and toss to coat completely. Place coated pickle slices into the bread crumb mixture and toss to coat. Return breaded slices to egg mixture and repeat the entire breading process. Remove slices to a sheet of wax/parchment paper and repeat the entire process for the remaining 1/2 cup of pickle slices. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place 10 to 15 pickles slices in skillet. Cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining slices.
