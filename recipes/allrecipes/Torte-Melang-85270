Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prepare a 10 inch springform pan with nonstick cooking spray. Layer 8 sheets of phyllo dough into the bottom and sides of the pan, allowing the phyllo to hang 1/4 inch over the sides. Sprinkle 1/3 of the bread crumbs evenly into the bottom of the pan. Layer with 1/3 each of the prosciutto, spinach, provolone, green onions, and banana peppers. Repeat twice more to form three layers. Lay the edges of the exposed phyllo over the torte, then layer the remaining 6 sheets of phyllo dough over the top. Tuck the edges of the phyllo dough into the sides of the pan. In a small cup, mix together the egg and water. Brush over the top of the pastry. Bake for 30 minutes, then cover loosely with aluminum foil. Continue baking until brown, about 45 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before removing from pan and serving.
