In a microwave-safe bowl, combine milk and chocolate. Microwave on high for 2 minutes or until chocolate is melted; stir until smooth. Stir in raisins; set aside to cool slightly. In a mixing bowl, cream butter and brown sugar. Beat in vanilla. Combine the remaining ingredients; gradually add to creamed mixture (dough will be crumbly). Set aside half for topping. Press remaining crumb mixture into an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Spread with the chocolate raisin mixture. Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture; press down lightly. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. Cut into bars.
