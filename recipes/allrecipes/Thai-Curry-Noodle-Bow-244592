Heat the oil in a 2 1/2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook and stir for 45 seconds. Add the broth to the saucepan and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the carrot and cook for 5 minutes or until tender-crisp. Add the noodles to the saucepot and cook until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Serve topped with the green onions, cilantro and peanuts with the lime wedges on the side.
