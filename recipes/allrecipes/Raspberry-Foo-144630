Process 1 1/2 cups raspberries in a food processor until smooth. Using a rubber spatula, press through a sieve set over a bowl; discard solids. In a mixing bowl, whip cream with sugar to stiff peaks; gently fold in raspberry puree. Spoon into glasses, topping or layering with remaining 1 1/2 cups raspberries. Cover; refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to overnight.
