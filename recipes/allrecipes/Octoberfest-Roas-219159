Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat; brown the pot roast on all sides in the hot Dutch oven, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Mix the Dijon mustard, brown sugar, garlic, and nutmeg together in a small bowl; spread evenly over the browned pot roast. Layer the onion slices atop the pot roast. Pour the beer and beef stock over the pot roast; season with salt and black pepper. Cover the Dutch oven. Roast in the preheated oven until completely tender, about 3 1/2 hours. Remove the cover from the Dutch oven during the final 20 minutes of cooking time. Transfer the roast to a platter, and cover with aluminum foil; allow to rest for 10 minutes. While the meat rests, whisk the cornstarch and water together in a small bowl; stir the cornstarch slurry into the juices left in the Dutch oven. Place the Dutch oven over medium heat; bring the gravy to a low boil, and cook and stir until thickened. Serve on the side as gravy, or slice the beef and pour over the slices on a platter.
