Prepare gingerbread as directed on package; cool completely. Cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Pour milk into large bowl. Add dry pudding mixes and cinnamon. Beat with wire whisk 2 min. or until well blended. Gently stir in 2 cups of the whipped topping. Layer one-third each of the gingerbread cubes, pears and pudding mixture in 3-qt. serving bowl; repeat layers twice. Refrigerate at least 1 hour. Top with the remaining 1 cup whipped topping just before serving. Cover and refrigerate any leftover dessert.
