Place sausage in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until no longer pink, about 8 minutes. Drain excess grease from the skillet. Combine diced tomatoes and cream cheese in a saucepan over medium-low heat; cook and stir until cream cheese is melted and smooth, about 5 minutes. Mix in sausage. Transfer to a serving bowl.
