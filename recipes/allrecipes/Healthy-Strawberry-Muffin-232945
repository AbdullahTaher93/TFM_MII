Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 6 muffin cups with paper liners; spray the inside of each paper liner with cooking spray. Mix flour, sugar substitute, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk almond milk, egg substitute, applesauce, butter, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; stir almond milk mixture into flour mixture. Fold in strawberries. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes.
