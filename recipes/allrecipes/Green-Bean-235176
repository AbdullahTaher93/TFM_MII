Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Put green beans in a baking dish. Mix butter, brown sugar, and garlic powder together in a bowl; pour over green beans. Arrange bacon strips atop the beans. Bake in preheated oven until the bacon is cooked and the green beans are tender, about 30 minutes.
