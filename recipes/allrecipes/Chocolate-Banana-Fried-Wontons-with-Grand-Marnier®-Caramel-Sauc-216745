Place the bananas, 1/3 cup chocolate chips, clove, cinnamon, and vanilla into a mixing bowl, and mash until evenly blended. Alternatively, chop the mixture in a food processor until the chocolate chips have been reduced in size. This will help prevent the chips from poking through the wonton skins as you handle them. It will also change the texture of the filling - you will not have pockets of melted chocolate in the wontons. To make the wontons: Separate and place the wonton wrappers onto your work surface. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of the banana filling onto the center of each wrapper. Use your finger or a pastry brush to lightly moisten the edges of the wonton wrappers with water. Fold one corner of the wrapper over the filling onto the opposite corner to form a triangle. Press the edges together to seal. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Prepare the sauce by combining the butter, brown sugar, orange liqueur, and corn syrup in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, and cook until the sugar has dissolved and the sauce is smooth, about 4 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly. Fry the wontons in the hot oil a few at a time until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Turn the wontons over halfway through cooking so they brown evenly. Remove, and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Serve warm with the caramel sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons chocolate chips to garnish.
