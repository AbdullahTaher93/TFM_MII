Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Sift the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar and sugar into a bowl. Rub in butter until it is in crumb-sized pieces. Make a well in the center and pour in the treacle and milk. Stir into a soft dough. Roll out on a floured surface and cut in to rounds with a biscuit cutter. Place on a baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the bottoms are lightly browned.
