Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Toss sugar snap peas and olive oil together in a bowl; spread in an even layer on prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until tender but still crisp and beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with chives and salt.
