Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spread the bread cubes on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for 10 minutes, or until golden. In a large skillet, melt the butter over moderately high heat. Add the scallions and garlic and cook, stirring until the scallions are crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs with the heavy cream and sour cream. Gently fold in the bread cubes, scallions, basil and half of the goat cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Let stand until all of the liquid has been absorbed, about 30 minutes. Transfer the bread pudding to a 12-by-8-by-2-inch baking dish. Sprinkle the remaining goat cheese on top. Set the baking dish in a roasting pan and add enough hot water to the pan to reach halfway up the side of the baking dish. Bake for 40 minutes, or until the pudding is set and the top is golden brown. Serve hot or warm.
