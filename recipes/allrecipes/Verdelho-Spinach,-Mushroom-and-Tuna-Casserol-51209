Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, and saute until tender. Season with paprika, chili powder, and oregano. Pour in the wine, and let simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the spinach, and simmer until heated through. Stir the spinach mixture into the drained macaroni. Mix in the tuna. Combine the condensed soup and milk; stir into the mixture until evenly coated. Transfer to a 9x13 inch baking dish. Crumble toasted bread over the top. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until the top is crispy and browned.
