Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly coat several cookie sheets with non-stick cooking spray. On a sheet of waxed paper, combine flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, and salt. Stir with a fork to blend. Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat margarine until smooth. Add SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend, molasses, and egg white. Mix slowly to incorporate, then beat until smooth. Gradually stir in the reserved flour mixture until well blended. Dough will be soft but not sticky. Using your palms, roll dough into 3/4-inch balls (1 level teaspoon). Place, separated, on prepared pans. Use the back of a fork to press down on tops of cookies in an X, making a crosshatch pattern. Bake for 8 minutes, or until edges are set. Let stand on the sheet for 5 minutes, then remove to a rack to cool. Continue until all the dough is baked.
