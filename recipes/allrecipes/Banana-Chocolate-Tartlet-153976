Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Line large baking sheet with parchment. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to a 15 inch diameter. With a 4 inch round biscuit cutter, or the top of a wide mouthed jar, cut out 12 circles, re-rolling scraps if necessary. Discard any leftover dough. Top each circle with 1/2 teaspoon of the chocolate. Add a layer of banana, leaving a 1/2 inch border around edges. Fold sides of dough and pleat edges, pressing firmly with fingers to seal pleats, forming a rustic tart. Place jelly in small microwaveable bowl and microwave on high 15 to 20 seconds. Lightly brush bananas with jelly. Sprinkle tops with the remaining chocolate. Bake until lightly browned and bananas have softened, 14 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on baking sheet 15 minutes before serving.
