Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place mushrooms in a food processor; pulse until finely chopped. Transfer to a roasting pan. Drizzle 2 tablespoons olive oil on top and mix. Sprinkle with salt. Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 10 minutes. Cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add kale; cook and stir until just wilted, 2 to 4 minutes. Let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Transfer kale to the food processor; pulse until finely chopped. Combine mushrooms, kale, Italian sausage, and harissa in a bowl; mix together by hand. Form into 4 patties, taking care not to pack them too firmly. Heat an oven-safe grill pan or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add patties; cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Flip. Transfer grill pan to the oven and continue cooking until second side is browned, about 8 minutes. Place a slice of mozzarella cheese on top of each patty and broil until cheese melts, about 1 minute. Serve patties on toasted buns with marinara sauce.
