Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and return potatoes to the pot. Mash potatoes with a potato masher until smooth. Stir in milk, feta cheese, butter, garlic, oregano, and rosemary. Season with salt and pepper.
