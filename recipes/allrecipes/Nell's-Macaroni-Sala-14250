In a large pot of boiling salted water cook pasta until al dente. Drain and cool under cold water. Place eggs in a saucepan, and cover completely with cold water. Bring water to a boil. Cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool and slice. Place pasta in a large bowl and add the celery, corn, onion, and eggs; mix. In a separate bowl, combine the mayonnaise, mustard, pickle juice, salt and pepper together until smooth. Pour dressing over the macaroni and mix well. Sprinkle with paprika and keep the salad refrigerated until ready to serve.
