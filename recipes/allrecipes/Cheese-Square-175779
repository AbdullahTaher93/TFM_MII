Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the eggs into a food processor, and process until light and frothy. Add Cheddar cheese, onion, and jalapeno peppers, and process until smooth. Pour into an ungreased 8x8 inch baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until set, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes; cut into squares to serve.
