Place yams into a medium saucepan with water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until tender. Remove from heat, drain and mash. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together yams, milk, 1/4 cup butter and salt. Spread into the bottom of a 9 inch square pan. In a small saucepan over low heat, melt remaining 1 cup butter and brown sugar together. Spread over the top of the mashed yams. Arrange pecans decoratively over the top. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly.
