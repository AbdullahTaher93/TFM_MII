Preheat broiler. Place rolls cut side down on foil-lined baking sheet. Broil 30 seconds to crisp bread. Remove from broiler. Turn rolls over so cut side is up. Distribute chicken evenly on one half of roll and top with red peppers. Place cheese on other half. Return to broiler 1 minute or until cheese is melted. Remove and place basil leaves on top. Close sandwich and press down. Cut in half and serve immediately.
