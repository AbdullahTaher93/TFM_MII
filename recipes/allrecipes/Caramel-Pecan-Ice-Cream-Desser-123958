In a large bowl, combine flour, pecans, sugar and oats. Add butter; mix well. Spread in a thin layer on a large baking sheet with sides. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until golden. Crumble while warm; cool. Press half of crumb mixture into a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Drizzle with half of caramel sauce; spread with ice cream. Top with remaining caramel sauce and crumbs. Cover and freeze. Remove from freezer 10 minutes before serving.
