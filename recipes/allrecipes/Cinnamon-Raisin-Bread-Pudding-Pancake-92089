Trim crusts from bread and cut bread into 1/2-inch cubes. Place in a large bowl. Pour milk over bread and let stand until very soft and beginning to fall apart, stirring occasionally, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into bread-milk mixture. Stir in eggs and melted butter until blended. Lightly coat a griddle with oil or nonstick spray. Place over medium heat. When hot, drop 1/4 cup batter onto griddle for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on top and underside is golden, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook on other side until cooked through and bottom is golden, 2 minutes. Serve with syrup.
