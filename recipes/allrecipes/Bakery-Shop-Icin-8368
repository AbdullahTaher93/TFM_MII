In a large bowl, cream butter, shortening, sugar and vanilla together. Stir cornstarch into milk and add to butter mixture. Beat at low speed until well blended. Beat another 5 to 7 minutes until icing is creamy. Note: This icing will appear curdled at first, but continue beating and it will become smooth.
