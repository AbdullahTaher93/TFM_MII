Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Arrange French bread cubes in a single layer on a baking sheet with a rim. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir 1 clove garlic until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour butter mixture over bread cubes; season with salt, black pepper, and parsley. Toss to coat. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned on the outside and crisp in the middle, 10 to 15 minutes. Whisk lemon juice, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, kosher salt, anchovy paste, 1 clove garlic, and black pepper together in a bowl. Slowly drizzle in canola oil, while whisking lemon mixture with opposite hand until emulsified. Combine romaine lettuce, Parmesan cheese, and half the dressing in a bowl; toss to coat. Add croutons and remaining dressing; toss to coat.
