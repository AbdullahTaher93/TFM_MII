Beat margarine until fluffy. Add the sugar replacement, egg, and vanilla. Mix for one minute. Now add the flour and water to get a thin batter. Heat iron griddle and pour one tablespoon batter for each cookie. Cook till golden brown and turn, repeat when brown and remove to rack. Eat the crunchy cookie now or pour fresh fruit mixture over top and serve with sugar free ice cream. Very Good! NOTE: I use the waffle iron sometimes also - just don't burn them.
