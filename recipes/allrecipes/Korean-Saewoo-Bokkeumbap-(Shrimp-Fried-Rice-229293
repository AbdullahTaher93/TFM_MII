Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook and stir carrot and green bell pepper until slightly softened, about 5 minutes; stir shrimp, onion, corn, and garlic into carrot mixture. Cook and stir until shrimp turn pink and are no longer translucent, 5 more minutes. Pour off any liquid. Turn heat to low and let mixture simmer. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; pour 2 beaten eggs into hot oil and scramble the eggs until firm and no longer runny, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix scrambled eggs lightly into shrimp and vegetables. Stir rice, oyster sauce, soy sauce, 1 tablespoon butter, and salt into shrimp mixture, tossing until rice is thoroughly combined with shrimp and vegetables and coated with sauce. Heat 1 teaspoon butter in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat until butter stops foaming; break 1 of the 4 remaining eggs into the hot butter. Cover skillet and let egg cook until the bottom is slightly browned, the yolk is runny, and the top of the white is slightly firm, about 3 minutes. Set egg aside. Repeat with remaining 3 eggs. Serve shrimp fried rice topped with fried eggs. For a nice presentation, fill a bowl with 1/4 of the fried rice, press lightly to compact, and turn fried rice out onto a serving plate in a dome shape; top with a fried egg. Repeat with remaining rice and eggs.
