Zest the lemon enough to get about 2 tsp of zest. Juice the lemon into a small bowl and remove all the seeds, but leave the pulp. Steam the lobster tails for 6 minutes. You can use plain water or you can add white wine or crab boil herbs (such as Old Bay seasoning) to the water. When cool enough, crack open shell and carefully remove the meat. Cut each lengthwise and set aside until ready to add it to the next step. Don't worry if the meat is not yet cooked through. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt 1 Tbsp of the butter with the shallots. Add the asparagus (or broccoli) spears and cook for 3 - 5 minutes or until heated through but still crunchy (you don't want to cook away all the vitamins), stir occasionally. Add the remaining butter, lemon juice and lemon zest. Cook until butter is melted and then add the lobster meat. Coat the lobster tails with the butter. If the meat was cooked through when you cut it in half then cook for only 30 seconds to one minute just to warm it. If the flesh was still translucent then cook for about 3 minutes while you pull out the vegetables, to arrange on the plates. Divide the spinach between two plates and arrange the asparagus so they all align. Lean the lobsters against the asparagus at an angle for a pretty presentation. Drizzle the remaining butter sauce over each plate. Serve immediately.
