Put the bulgur wheat in a saucepan with 3 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then simmer until the bulgur is tender and all of the water has been absorbed, about 10 minutes. Spread in a flat dish and allow to cool slightly. Combine the onion, carrot, tomato, corn, cucumber, and shrimp in a large salad bowl. Add the bulgur and stir together. For the dressing, place the oil, lime juice, garlic, and chilies in a small bowl; add salt and pepper to taste. Whisk with a fork. Stir the dressing into the salad, tossing to coat all the ingredients evenly. Cover the salad and keep it in the refrigerator if not serving immediately.
