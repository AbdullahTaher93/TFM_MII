In large saucepan melt butter over low heat. Add marshmallows and stir until completely melted. Remove from heat. Add KELLOGG'S RICE KRISPIES cereal. Stir until well coated. Cool slightly. Using buttered hands shape mixture into twelve small drumsticks. Spread peanut butter on large end of each drumstick, then dip in KELLOGG'S COCOA KRISPIES cereal. Refrigerate until firm.
