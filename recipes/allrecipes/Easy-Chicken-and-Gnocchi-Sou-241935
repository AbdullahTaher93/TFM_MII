Combine chicken broth, garlic, butter, and sugar in a large saucepan; bring to a simmer and cook until garlic is tender, about 2 minutes. Stir carrot and celery into simmering broth; cook until vegetables are almost tender, about 2 minutes more. Bring broth mixture to a boil and stir gnocchi into the saucepan; cook until gnocchi rise to the top and are tender yet firm to the bite, 2 to 3 minutes. Add peas and corn to broth mixture; simmer until heated through, about 30 seconds. Stir chicken and spinach into broth mixture; remove from heat and season soup with salt and black pepper. Ladle soup into bowls and top with Parmesan cheese.
