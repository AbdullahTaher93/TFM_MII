Bring vegetable broth to a boil in a 2-quart saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, add rice, cover the saucepan, and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Beat eggs and lemon juice together in a small bowl. Ladle some of the hot soup into the egg mixture and stir to temper the eggs. Stir egg mixture into the broth and rice. Reduce heat to low and cook until the soup is hot, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
