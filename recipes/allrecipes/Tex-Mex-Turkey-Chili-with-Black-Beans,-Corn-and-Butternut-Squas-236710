Heat oil in large 4 to 6-quart saucepan over medium heat and add turkey. Brown turkey for 5 to 7 minutes, breaking apart. Add onions, garlic, chili powder, cumin and bouillon powder and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until onions soften. Stir in vegetables, tomatoes, water and ketchup. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes. To serve, ladle into bowls and top with desired garnishes. Recipe note: If using fresh butternut squash, microwave for 1 to 2 minutes before adding to the chili or allow extra cooking time to ensure tenderness.
