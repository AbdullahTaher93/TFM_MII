In a saucepan, heat the candy bar and chocolate syrup over low heat until melted; set aside to cool. In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in chocolate mixture and vanilla. Combine flour, salt and baking soda; add to creamed mixture alternately with buttermilk. Pour into a greased and floured 10-in. fluted tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 65-70 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool in pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Remove from pan and cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar if desired.
