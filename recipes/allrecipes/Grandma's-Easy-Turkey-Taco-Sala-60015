Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, and stir in the ground turkey. Cook and stir until the turkey is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Mix in taco seasoning mix as directed on package. Remove from heat. Combine the turkey, black beans, lettuce, tomatoes, and tortilla chips in a large bowl. Toss with salad dressing. Serve immediately, or refrigerate for an hour before serving.
