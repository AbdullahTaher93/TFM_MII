Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl, beat eggs. Wrap spinach in several layers of paper towels and squeeze out excess moisture. Chop finely. Stir spinach, orzo and goat cheese into egg mixture, and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a small, ovenproof skillet (preferably nonstick) over medium heat. Pour in egg mixture. Cook, without stirring, over medium heat about five minutes or until bottom of frittata is firm. Run a small spatula around edge of frittata to make sure it's not sticking to the pan. Transfer skillet to oven, until top is firm and just beginning to brown, about 15 minutes more. With a spatula, loosen frittata from skillet; cut into wedges and serve.
