Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners. Mix flour, 1/2 cup sugar, and baking powder in a large bowl. Whisk milk, vegetable oil, egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract together in a separate bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture; pour in milk mixture. Stir until batter is just blended and slightly lumpy; gently fold in cherries and cherry juice. Fill muffin cups 2/3 full with batter. Mix oats, brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, and butter together in a bowl until crumbly; sprinkle oat mixture over batter. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
