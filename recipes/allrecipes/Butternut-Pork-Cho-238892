Place butternut squash into a pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain. Saute bacon in a skillet and over medium-high heat until starting to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add parsley to bacon; cook and stir until bacon is browned and parsley is hot, 3 to 5 minutes more. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook pork chops in hot oil until browned on one side, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip pork chops and pour wine into skillet. Continue cooking until wine evaporates and pork chops are cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Mash butternut squash, brown sugar, butter, onion powder, and white pepper together in a bowl until soft and smooth. Place pork chops on plates; top each chop with avocado slices, butternut squash mixture, and bacon.
