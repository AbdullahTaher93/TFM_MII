Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; spray with cooking spray. Spread pumpkin seeds onto the prepared baking sheet; sprinkle with salt, cumin, chili powder, cayenne pepper, and oregano; toss to coat evenly. Bake seeds in the preheated oven for 5 minutes; stir seeds. Return to oven and bake until seeds are toasted, about 15 more minutes.
