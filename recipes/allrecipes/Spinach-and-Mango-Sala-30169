Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Arrange almonds in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and lightly toasted. In a small bowl, mix red wine vinegar, maple flavored balsamic vinegar, olive oil, dry mustard, tarragon, salt, and pepper. In a medium bowl, toss the red wine vinegar mixture with the spinach and mangos. Top with the toasted almonds.
