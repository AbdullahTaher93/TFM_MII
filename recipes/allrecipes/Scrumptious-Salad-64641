Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne pasta, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente, and drain. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large casserole dish, toss the pasta with the mango, tomatoes, avocado, olives, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, Parmesan cheese, and pesto. Place the salad in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes, just until warm.
