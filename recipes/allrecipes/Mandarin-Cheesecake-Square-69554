Drain mandarin oranges; reserving 1/4 cup syrup. Sprinkle gelatin over reserved syrup, in small bowl; let stand 2 minutes. Microwave mixture on HIGH 30 seconds or until gelatin dissolves (or heat mixture in a saucepan, stirring until gelatin is dissolved).

Sprinkle half mandarin oranges over filling. Spread remaining filling over oranges. Garnish top with remaining oranges. Cover; refrigerate 3 to 4 hours or until firm.
