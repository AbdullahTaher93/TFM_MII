Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Rinse and dry zucchini; cut each in half lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. In a bowl, mix zucchini with olive oil, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Divide mixture equally between two 12- by 15-inch baking sheets and spread zucchini in a single layer. Bake until zucchini is tender when pierced, 8 to 10 minutes. Pour back into bowl. Rinse and dry one baking sheet. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Put walnuts on clean baking sheet and bake until pale gold beneath skins, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat, bring broth to a boil. Add orzo, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until orzo is tender to bite and liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Stir zucchini, walnuts, lemon juice, and walnut oil into orzo. Add more salt and pepper to taste before serving.
