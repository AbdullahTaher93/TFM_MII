In a medium skillet, heat 1/2 tablespoon of the olive oil. Add the apple and cook over high heat until browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Add the vinegar, brown sugar, mustard seeds, allspice and cayenne and simmer over moderate heat until thickened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Add the jalapenos, red and yellow peppers, onion, garlic and ginger. Cover and cook over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the pepper relish to a bowl and wipe out the skillet. In the same large skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Season the pork tenderloins with salt and pepper and add to the skillet. Cook them over moderate heat on 4 sides until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Cover and cook, turning once, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center registers 145 degrees F, about 10 minutes. Transfer the tenderloins to a carving board, cover loosely with foil and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice the pork 1/3 inch thick and serve with the chutney and pepper relish.
