Make a pocket in each pork chop with small knife by cutting horizontally from outside edge almost to bone. In a medium bowl combine apple, shallot, bread crumbs and peanut butter; mix well. Shape stuffing mixture into four equal patties. Place one stuffing patty into each pork chop pocket. Using wooden toothpicks (2 to 3 per chop), close each pocket to prevent stuffing from falling out during cooking. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Lightly coat baking pan with the no-stick cooking spray. Season chops with salt and pepper. Lightly coat oven-proof frying pan with the no-stick cooking spray. Season chops with salt and pepper. Place large, oven-proof frying pan over medium-high heat until hot. Fry pork chops in pan, cooking about 8 minutes, turning once, or until well browned on both sides. Remove pan from stove and place in hot oven to cook for another 20 minutes. Baste pork chops with melted jelly during last 5 minutes of cooking. Remove toothpicks before serving.
