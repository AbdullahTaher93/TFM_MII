Thaw bread dough according to package directions. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray baking sheet with cooking spray; set aside. Pat out dough into 12x10-inch rectangle on prepared baking sheet. Brush lightly with olive oil; sprinkle evenly with salt and pepper. Spoon tomatoes lengthwise down center third of dough; sprinkle evenly with Cheddar cheese and mozzarella cheese. Fold long sides of dough over filling; press seams together to seal. Using sharp knife, cut 3 diagonal slices, about 2 inches apart, in top of dough, cutting only through first layer of dough. Repeat with second set of cuts in opposite direction, criss-crossing first cuts, to form diamond pattern. Bake 25 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool slightly. Cut into 12 slices to serve.
