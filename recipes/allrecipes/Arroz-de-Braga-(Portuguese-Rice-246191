Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, chicken thighs, and drumsticks; cook and stir until starting to brown, about 10 minutes. Add ham, smoked sausages, and fresh sausages. Cook and stir until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Stir rice, tomatoes, red bell pepper, spring onions, salt, and parsley into the saucepan. Pour in water and add chicken bouillon cubes. Reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, until flavors are combined, about 15 minutes. Stir in sliced cabbage. Continue to cook until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, about 15 minutes more. Drizzle olive oil over rice before serving.
