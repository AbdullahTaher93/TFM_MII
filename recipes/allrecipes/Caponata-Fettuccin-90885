In a 6-quart pan, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil over high heat. Meanwhile, in a 12- to 14-inch nonstick frying pan with a lid, combine eggplant, onion, garlic, olive oil, sugar, and salt. Cover pan and place over medium-high heat. Cook vegetables, covered but stirring occasionally, until they are soft and eggplant is browned, about 15 minutes. To boiling water, add fettuccine and broccoli; cook, uncovered, until both are tender to bite, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain well, rinse with cool water to stop cooking, then drain well again. Add pasta sauce to eggplant mixture and cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Add garbanzos and wine and heat until simmering. Stir often until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer pasta and broccoli to a large serving bowl. Add caponata mixture and mix well. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
