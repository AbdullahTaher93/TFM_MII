Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, stir together brown sugar, butter, flour, salt, and mace. Arrange squash in an ungreased 9x13 inch baking dish. Top with slices of apple, then sprinkle with the sugar mixture. Cover with a lid or aluminum foil. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes in the preheated oven, or until squash is tender.
