In a small frying pan, toast the walnuts over moderately low heat, stirring frequently, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Or toast them in a 350 degrees F oven for 5 to 10 minutes. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the linguine until just done, about 12 minutes. Drain. Meanwhile, in a large frying pan, heat the olive oil over moderate heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in the tuna and its oil and break up the tuna with a fork. Remove from the heat. Toss the linguine with the tuna mixture, the lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, pepper, herbs, and the toasted walnuts.
