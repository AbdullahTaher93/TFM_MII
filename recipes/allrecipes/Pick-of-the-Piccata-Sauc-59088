Combine the chicken broth and garlic in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium to simmer. Stir in the artichoke hearts, lemon juice, and capers; simmer for 3 minutes. Whisk in the butter. In a separate dish, mix together the cornstarch and cold water. Stir the cornstarch mixture into the sauce and continue cooking until the sauce is thickened and bubbly, about 30 seconds.
