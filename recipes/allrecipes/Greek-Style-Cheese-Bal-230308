Stir cream cheese, mayonnaise, and balsamic vinegar together in a bowl until smooth. Mix Cheddar cheese, feta cheese, Parmesan cheese, oregano, onion powder, and garlic powder together in a separate bowl. Stir Cheddar cheese mixture into cream cheese mixture. Pulse pecans and 1/4 cup pine nuts in a food processor or blender until crumbly. Mix remaining 1/2 cup pine nuts into pecan mixture. Spread about 1/4 of the pecan mixture onto a plate. Form cheese mixture into two 5-inch balls. Roll each ball in the pecan mixture until fully coated, adding more pecan mixture as needed.
