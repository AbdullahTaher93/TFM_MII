Preheat oven to 250 degrees with rack in center. Place puffed rice, peas, pepitas, sesame sticks, and coconut in a large bowl. In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add brown sugar and ginger; heat until sugar has melted. Pour over puffed-rice mixture. Season with salt; toss well with a wooden spoon to coat evenly. Spread on a rimmed baking sheet, and bake 30 minutes. Remove from oven; let cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature up to 5 days.
