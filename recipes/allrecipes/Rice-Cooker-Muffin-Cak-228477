Spray rice cooker bowl with cooking spray. Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Combine bran flakes, milk, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla extract together in a separate large bowl; allow bran flakes to slightly absorb the milk, about 5 minutes. Add egg and oil to bran mixture; stir to combine. Stir flour into bran mixture until just combined. Gently fold apple, banana, and raisins into batter. Pour into sprayed rice cooker. Cook in the rice cooker for 3 cycles or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
