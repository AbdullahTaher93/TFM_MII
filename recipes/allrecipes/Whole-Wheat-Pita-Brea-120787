In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup warm water. Add honey; let stand for 5 minutes. Add the oil, salt and remaining water; mix well. Stir in enough whole wheat flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a surface dusted with all-purpose flour; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 475 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until browned. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool. To serve, cut in half an split open. Stuff with fillings of your choice.
