Combine tomatoes, mango, nectarine, red onion, and garlic in a large bowl. Stir in lemon juice, basil, lime juice, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Grease a skillet lightly with cooking spray. Pour in tomato mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 15 minutes. Refrigerate salsa for 30 minutes before serving.
