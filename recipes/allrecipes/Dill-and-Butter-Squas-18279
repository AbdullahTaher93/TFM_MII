Slice the zucchini and yellow squash. Place the sliced vegetables in a large skillet or saucepan with the butter. Saute over a medium-low heat for 10 minutes before seasoning with salt, pepper and dill. Continue to saute for 10 additional minutes before adding the lemon juice. Stir the vegetables well and remove from heat. Serve hot.
