In a shallow bowl or large resealable plastic bag, combine dry ingredients. Dredge chicken. Heat oil in a large skillet, fry chicken, a few pieces at a time, until brown on all sides. Add water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 45 minutes or until juices run clear. Thicken gravy if desired.
