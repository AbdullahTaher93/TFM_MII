Unroll the dough. Separate into strips. Twist each strip on a flat surface. Place 1 inch apart on a large ungreased cookie sheet. In a small bowl, combine margarine or butter, honey, orange juice, and orange rind. Mix well. Brush this mixture on the breadstick twists. In a small bowl, combine sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle over the twists. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 15 to 18 minutes, or until golden brown.
