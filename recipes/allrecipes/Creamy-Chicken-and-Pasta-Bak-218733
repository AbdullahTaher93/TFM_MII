Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 13 x 9-inch baking dish with no-stick cooking spray; place cooked pasta in the pan and set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Season chicken pieces with salt and pepper; add to pan. Saute for 2-3 minutes or until lightly browned; transfer chicken pieces to baking dish with pasta. In the same skillet, combine the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil with the butter; add the garlic and onion, saute 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, basil and chicken broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes. Stir in the half and half and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Pour tomato mixture over the pasta and chicken. Sprinkle with remaining parmesan cheese. Bake, uncovered, about 20 minutes or until bubbling and golden brown.
