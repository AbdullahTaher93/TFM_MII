Place cucumber in a food processor; pulse 5 to 6 times to chop into very small pieces. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with red bell peppers, red onion, and celery, pulsing each into very small pieces in the food processor and transferring to the bowl. Combine plum tomatoes and garlic in the food processor; pulse until finely diced. Pour over cucumber mixture in the bowl. Pour tomato juice, white wine vinegar, and olive oil over tomato and cucumber mixture in the bowl. Add sea salt, black pepper, basil, parsley, and red pepper flakes; stir well. Chill until flavors combine and deepen, about 2 hours.
