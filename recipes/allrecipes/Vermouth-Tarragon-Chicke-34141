Generously sprinkle the chicken breast halves with lemon pepper. Place chicken, vermouth, 3 tablespoons olive oil, and tarragon into a large resealable plastic bag. Place in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 6 hours, or overnight. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown chicken breasts on both sides in the hot oil. Pour 1/2 cup of the marinade into the skillet, reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink.
