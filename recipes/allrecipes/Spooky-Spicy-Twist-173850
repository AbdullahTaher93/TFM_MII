Heat oven to 250 degrees F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper or foil. Place pretzels on sheet. Set one unwrapped candy on top of each pretzel. Bake 1 to 1 1/2 minutes or until candy is soft, but not melted. (The candy will start to shine and collapse when ready.) Remove from oven and gently press pecan onto candy. Cool, serve and enjoy.
