Mix raisins, golden raisins, mixed fruit peel, and molasses with black tea in a bowl; cover and let soak, 8 hours to overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and line a loaf pan with parchment paper. Stir flour, turbinado sugar, egg, and pumpkin pie spice into raisin mixture until well mixed; pour into the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until barmbrack is firm to the touch, about 1 1/2 hours. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
