Heat oven to 400 degrees. Remove and discard top third of each squash, as well as the pulp and seeds. Coat inside of each squash with 1 tablespoon brown sugar; sprinkle with orange zest and ginger. Bake on a parchment-lined baking pan until tender, about 30 minutes. Fill each squash with about 1/2 cup puree. Bake until puree is heated through, 15 to 20 minutes. Melt butter and granulated sugar in a skillet over medium heat. Stir until sugar has begun to caramelize. Add kumquats; cook until glazed, 3 to 4 minutes. Add sage leaves; toss to coat in glaze. Garnish squash with kumquats and sage.
