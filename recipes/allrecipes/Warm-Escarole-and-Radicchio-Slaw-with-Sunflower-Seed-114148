In a large bowl, toss the radicchio, escarole, sunflower seeds and tarragon. In a medium skillet, heat the oil. Add the pancetta and cook over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pancetta to a plate. Add the apple and shallot to the skillet and cook over high heat, stirring, until softened and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the vinegar and boil. Pour the hot dressing over the greens, add the pancetta and toss well. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.
