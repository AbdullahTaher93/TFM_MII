Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Line 12 muffin pan cups with paper baking cups. In a medium bowl, mix the crumbs, 4 tablespoons sugar, and jam or jelly. Press 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the crumb mixture into the bottom of each paper-lined muffin cup. In a large bowl and with a mixer set at medium speed, beat together the two types of cream cheese until they are light and fluffy. Add the 3/4 cup sugar, egg whites, egg, lemon juice, and lemon peel, and beat until the mixture is smooth. Spoon the batter into the muffin cups, filling each cup three-quarters full. Bake the cakes for 25 minutes. Cool them on a wire rack for 30 minutes, then refrigerate them until cold. Spoon 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of the preserves onto each cake before serving.
