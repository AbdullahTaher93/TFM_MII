Place asparagus in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water. Cover and cook until tender but still firm, about 2 to 4 minutes. Drain, and set aside. Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir in flour and cook for about 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Gradually whisk in cream and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly, or until lightly thickened. Season to taste with salt and white pepper. Remove from heat, and stir in orange pieces. Arrange asparagus on a serving platter, and season lightly with salt. Pour cream sauce over asparagus, and sprinkle with chopped cashews and orange zest. Serve immediately.
