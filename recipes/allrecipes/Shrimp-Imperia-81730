Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the butter. Once melted, add the celery, bell pepper and onions. Cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the shrimp and garlic. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until shrimp just turn pink (do not over cook). Stir frequently. Remove from heat and add a pinch of salt. Toss. Let cool. In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, sour cream, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, parsley, thyme and lemon extract. To assemble, divide shrimp into 4 ramekin (or gratin dishes or large scallop shells). Spoon the mayonnaise mixture over each dish and sprinkle with a dash of paprika. Place ramekins on cookie sheet and bake in 400 degrees F oven for about 15 minutes or until bubbling and starting to brown.
