Rinse fillets in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Mix together the cream, water and lemon juice. Pour this into a large skillet and bring to a slow boil over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. Add fillets to skillet. They should be completely covered by the liquid. Poach for 3 minutes then transfer to a platter and cover. Add the mushrooms, nutmeg, paprika and salt to the poaching liquids in the skillet and cook for about 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to low and return the fillets to the skillet. Cook for another 2 minutes, then serve.
