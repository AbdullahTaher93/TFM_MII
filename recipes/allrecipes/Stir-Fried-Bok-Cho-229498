Cut 1/2 to 1 inch slice off the root-end of bok choy; discard stem. Cut stalks diagonally into 1/8-inch pieces; cut or tear leaves into bite-sized pieces. Heat oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat; add onion, cashews, garlic, bok choy, Chinese five-spice, and sugar to the hot oil-butter mixture. Cook and stir bok choy mixture until tender, 8 to 10 minutes.
