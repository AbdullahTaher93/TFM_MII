Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Oil two 6-ounce ramekins and sprinkle with sugar. Roll sugar around the sides and bottom of each ramekin to coat completely, shaking out any excess sugar. In a small metal bowl set over a pot of simmering water, melt chocolate, olive oil, and heavy cream, stirring occasionally until blended. Remove bowl from heat. In a medium bowl, whisk egg whites with cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Add granulated sugar and continue whisking egg whites until peaks are stiff. Whisk egg yolks into chocolate mixture one at a time. Fold in egg whites, a little at a time, and blend until smooth. Pour into prepared ramekins. Place ramekins on a baking sheet and bake until souffles rise, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately with confectioners sugar and fresh berries as garnish.
