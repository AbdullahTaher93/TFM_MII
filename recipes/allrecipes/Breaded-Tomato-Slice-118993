In a shallow bowl, combine the bread crumbs, onion, Parmesan cheese, salt and Italian seasoning; mix well. Place milk in another bowl. Dip tomato slices in milk, then coat with crumb mixture. In a large skillet, heat oil. Fry tomato slices for 2 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.
