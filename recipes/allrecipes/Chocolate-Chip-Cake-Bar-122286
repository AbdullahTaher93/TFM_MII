In a mixing bowl, combine the first five ingredients. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Stir in 1-1/2 cups of chocolate chips and nuts. Spread in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until lightly browned and a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. Melt shortening with the remaining chocolate chips; drizzle over the top. Cut into bars.
