Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a 2-quart Dutch oven over medium-high. Stir in garlic. When garlic starts to sizzle and smell fragrant, stir in tomatoes. Simmer, adding water if necessary for a spaghetti sauce consistency, to blend flavors, about 15 minutes. Place sausage, remaining tablespoon oil and 1/2 cup water in a medium skillet. Cover and cook over medium-high heat until cooked through, about 8 minutes. Uncover and reduce heat to medium. Cook turning sausage frequently, until remaining water evaporates and sausages brown well, about 5 minutes. Bring 1 quart of water and salt to boil in a medium saucepan. Whisk in polenta and cook, stirring frequently, until mixture swells to a thick oatmeal consistency, about 2 minutes. Stir in butter. Spoon a portion of polenta on each plate with a sausage alongside. Top with tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese and serve immediately.
