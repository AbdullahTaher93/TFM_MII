Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 300 degrees F (168 degrees C). Beat water, flour, Cajun seasoning, Italian Seasoning, cayenne pepper, and salt with a whisk in a large bowl until smooth. If batter is too thick, thin with up to 1/4 cup water. Grind French-fried onions and panko crumbs in a food processor until fine; transfer to a bowl. Stir about half the cubed cheese into the batter to coat; remove with a slotted spoon to the breading, and toss to coat. Carefully add a coated cheese cubes to the hot oil in small batches, and fry until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer fried cheese cubes to a paper towel-covered dish. Reheat oil to 300 degrees F (168 degrees C) and repeat process with remaining cheese cubes.
