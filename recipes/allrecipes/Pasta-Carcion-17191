Remove stems from spinach and stack leaves together; chop thin longer strips instead of square chops and set aside. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and place in a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil over pasta and add salt and pepper to taste, spinach and tomatoes; gently toss. Add goat cheese and serve warm or room temperature.
