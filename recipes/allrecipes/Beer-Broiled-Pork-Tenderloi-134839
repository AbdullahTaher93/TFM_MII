Dump the beer, thyme, onion, garlic, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag (or two bags if necessary). Add the pork and marinate in the fridge for 1 to 6 hours, turning occasionally. Place the oven rack 4 inches from the broiler element and heat it up. Remove the pork from the marinade and put it on a roasting rack set in a roasting pan. Scatter the potatoes around the pork. Cook 4 inches from the heat for 10 to 15 minutes, turning occasionally and basting with marinade, until the meat registers 155 degrees F and its juices run clear. Let the meat rest for 10 minutes. Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. For a nice touch, serve with pine nut instant cous-cous.
