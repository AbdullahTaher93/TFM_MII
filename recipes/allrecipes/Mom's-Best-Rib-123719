Cut ribs into serving-size pieces. Place ribs, meat side up, in a roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 2 hours; drain. Combine remaining ingredients; pour over ribs. Reduce temperature to 300 degrees F; bake, uncovered, basting occasionally, 1 to 1-1/4 hours longer or until ribs are tender and a small amount of sauce remains in the bottom of the pan.
