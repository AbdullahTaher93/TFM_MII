Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Trim and discard root ends and tough green tops from leeks; remove tough outer leaves. Split leeks in half lengthwise and rinse well. Thinly slice leeks crosswise. In a 12- to 14-inch frying pan, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat. Add leeks and cook, stirring often, until soft but not browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in lemon juice and thyme. Place salmon pieces slightly apart in a lightly oiled casserole dish or baking pan (approximately 9 by 13 in.). Melt remaining tablespoon of butter and drizzle equally over salmon. Top each with equal portions of leek mixture. Bake until salmon is opaque but still moist in thickest part (cut to test), 10 to 15 minutes. Carefully transfer salmon and leeks to individual serving plates and garnish with lemon wedges. Add salt and pepper to taste.
