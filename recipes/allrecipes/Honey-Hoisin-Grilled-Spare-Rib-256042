Preheat the grill to 300 degrees F or medium heat. In a medium-sized pot whisk together the hoisin, soy sauce, honey, sherry, ketchup, and apple cider vinegar. Place the ribs on a sheet pan and thoroughly rub the 5-spice, salt and pepper into the meat and let sit for 1 hour. After the ribs have marinated, place them bone side down on the coolest parts of the grill. Baste with the honey-hoisin sauce every 30 minutes. After 90 minutes flip the ribs over and cook for 60 minutes while basting every 30 minutes. Flip the ribs over, bone side down, for the remaining 60 minutes and continue to baste every 40 minutes. Remove the ribs from the grill and let them rest for 5 to 7 minutes. Slice in between in each bone and place them in a large bowl. Garnish with green onions, cilantro leaves, and sesame seeds.
