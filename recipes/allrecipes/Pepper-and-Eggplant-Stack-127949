In a small bowl, mix the mushrooms, red peppers, cheese, tomatoes, capers, garlic, vinegar, and parsley. Preheat the broiler. Coat the broiler rack with no-stick spray. Cut the eggplant into 4 lengthwise slices, about 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick. Brush both sides of each slice with the oil. Place on the broiler rack. Sprinkle with black pepper. Broil about 5 inches from the heat for 3 minutes per side. Remove the rack from the oven. Divide the mushroom mixture among the eggplant slices and spread it evenly to coat each piece. Broil for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the cheese has melted and the eggplant is tender.
