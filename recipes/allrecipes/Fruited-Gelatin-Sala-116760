In a bowl, dissolve gelatin in boiling water. Stir in the juices, apricots and pineapple. Transfer to a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Refrigerate for 30 minutes or until partially set. Sprinkle with marshmallows; refrigerate. For topping, combine sugar and flour in a saucepan. Gradually whisk in juices. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Removed from the heat. Stir a small amount into egg; return all to the pan, stirring constantly. Cook and stir until a thermometer reads 160 degrees F and mixture is thickened. Remove from the heat; stir in butter. Cool to room temperature. In a mixing bowl, beat cream on high speed until stiff peaks form. Gently fold into custard. Spread over gelatin; sprinkle with cheese. Refrigerate 1 hour or until chilled.
