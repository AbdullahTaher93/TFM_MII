In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add chocolate syrup. Beat in flour, nuts and salt until blended. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean (brownies may appear moist). Cool on a wire rack. In a small saucepan, melt butter. Add sugar and milk. Bring to a boil; boil for 30 seconds. Remove from the hear; stir in the chips until melted. Beat until frosting reaches spreading consistency. Frost cooled brownies; cut.
