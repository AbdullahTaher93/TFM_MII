Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Season chicken with salt and pepper to taste, and place in a microwave-safe dish. Cover, and cook in microwave for 5 to 6 minutes. Turn, and cook another 2 to 3 minutes, or until juices run clear. Let cool. In a 9x13 inch baking dish, mix together chicken, rice, and soup. Top with cheese, then with bread cubes. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly, and bread is toasted.
