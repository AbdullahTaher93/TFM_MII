Combine soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, lime juice, chile paste with garlic, sesame oil, ginger root, and mint in a jar with a tight-fitting lid; cover and shake until sauce is well blended. Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add noodles and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain, cool, and place in a serving bowl. Cut noodles using kitchen shears. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir pork in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain, discard grease, and cool on paper towels. Add pork to noodles. Mix green onions, cilantro, snow peas, and red onion with pork and noodles. Place peanuts in a heavy resealable bag; seal and lightly crush using the bottom of a jar or large glass. Add peanuts to noodle mixture. Add sauce and toss well.
