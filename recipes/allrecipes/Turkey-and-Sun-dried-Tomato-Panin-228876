Preheat a panini press according to manufacturer's instructions for medium heat. Butter one side of each piece of bread. Lay 1 slice bread, butter side down, on the preheated panini press; layer with turkey, provolone cheese, and sun-dried tomatoes. Sprinkle with Italian seasoning. Top with second slice of bread. Press panini maker down and cook until provolone cheese has melted and bread is toasted, about 5 minutes. Cut in half and serve warm.
