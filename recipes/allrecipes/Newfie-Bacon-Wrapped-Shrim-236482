Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Boil water with butter in a saucepan; stir in stuffing mix. Remove saucepan from heat, cover, and let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Lay out halved bacon strips. Place about 1 teaspoon stuffing on end of each strip, top with a shrimp, and roll up. Secure with a toothpick. Place bacon wraps on prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crisp, about 30 minutes. Remove with tongs to a paper towel-lined plate to cool slightly before serving, about 2 minutes.
