Spray a large skillet with nonstick cooking spray. Brown chicken in heated skillet. Add chicken broth, jam and soy sauce. Simmer for 20 minutes or until chicken is done (no longer pink in the center). Remove chicken from skillet. Add 1 tablespoon cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water to sauce to thicken (equal amounts more of each if you like it thicker). Return chicken to skillet and turn to coat thoroughly with sauce.
