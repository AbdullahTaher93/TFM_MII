Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add red bell peppers and shallots; saute until soft. Stir in white wine and chicken broth, and simmer over low heat until reduced by half. When the mixture is reduced, stir in sour cream, and transfer the mixture to a blender. Puree until smooth. Reheat before serving if necessary.
