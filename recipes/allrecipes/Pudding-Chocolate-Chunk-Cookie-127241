Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Beat butter, sugars, dry pudding mix and vanilla in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Add eggs; mix well. Gradually add flour and baking soda, beating until well blended. Stir in chocolate chunks. (Dough will be stiff.) Drop teaspoonfuls of dough, 2 inches apart, onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from baking sheets. Cool completely on wire racks.
