Put apples, sugar, lemon juice, and cider in a large heavy pot. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring occasionally, until apples have absorbed all the juices and are soft but still holding their shape, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat, and serve warm or at room temperature.
