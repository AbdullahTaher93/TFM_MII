In a medium saucepan, boil the chicken stock over high heat until reduced to 1 cup, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the farfalle until it is al dente. In a large, deep skillet, heat the olive oil. Add the bacon and cook over moderately low heat until slightly crisp, about 7 minutes. Transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat. Add the endives and garlic to the skillet and cook over moderately high heat, tossing, until the endives are just wilted but still crisp, about 4 minutes. Drain the farfalle and add it to the skillet. Add the reduced chicken stock, parsley, lemon zest and bacon and toss well. Remove from the heat. Stir in the Parmesan and season the pasta with salt and pepper. Transfer to a large bowl and serve at once.
