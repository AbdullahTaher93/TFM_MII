Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place 1 tablespoon each of butter and oil in a large ovenproof or cast-iron skillet. Preheat skillet in oven for 5 minutes. In a large mixing bowl stir together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, salt, and, pepper, if desired. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture; set aside. In a medium bowl stir together the LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, the 1/4 cup cooking oil, and the eggs. Add egg mixture all at once to flour mixture. Stir just until moistened. (The batter will be slightly lumpy.) Carefully spoon batter into the prepared hot skillet and spread with spoon. Bake about 20 minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Serve warm.
