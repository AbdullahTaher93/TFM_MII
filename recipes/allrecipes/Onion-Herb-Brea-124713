In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add the milk, butter, sugar, rosemary, salt, dill, garlic powder, onion and 1 cup of flour. Beat until smooth. Add the remaining flour and stir for about 1 minute. Transfer to a greased bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. Stir the batter down, about 25 strokes. Spread into a greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pan. Cover and let rise until almost doubled, about 15 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 40-45 minutes. Remove from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm.
