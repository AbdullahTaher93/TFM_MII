Crumble lamb into a wide nonstick frying pan or 5- to 6-quart pan; add chopped onion. Cook over high heat, stirring often, until lamb is browned and onion is soft (about 6 minutes). Spoon off and discard any fat from pan. Return pan to heat; add 1/4 cup water and stir to scrape browned bits free. Then add pilaf mix (including seasoning packet) and amount of water specified in package directions for making entire mix. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover, and simmer until rice is tender to bite and liquid has been absorbed (about 15 minutes). Meanwhile, coarsely chop cucumber. In a bowl, stir together yogurt, parsley, green onion, chopped mint, and lemon juice; add cucumber and mix gently. Season to taste with salt. Garnish with mint sprigs, if desired. Transfer pilaf to a platter and garnish with almonds, if desired. Serve with cucumber salad.
