Allow the bread to become stale overnight. Break stale bread into pieces and place in a large bowl. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Slowly cook and stir the celery and onions until the onions are soft. Transfer to the bowl with bread and mix by hand until well blended. Sprinkle the mixture with sage seasoning and use to stuff the bird.
