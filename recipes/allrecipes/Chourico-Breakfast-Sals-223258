Spray a medium-sized nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Heat skillet over medium heat and stir in onion; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Thinly slice sausage and then chop it into 1/4-inch cubes. Stir sausage into skillet with onions. Stir tomato into sausage mixture and adjust heat to medium-high. Stir in chile pepper, if using. Mix in hot sauce. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes have broken down and most of the liquid has evaporated, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lime juice. Serve warm.
