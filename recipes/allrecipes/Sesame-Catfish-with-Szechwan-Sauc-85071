Bring soy sauce, sugar, rice wine vinegar, 1 teaspoon Szechwan seasoning, and cornstarch to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and cook, whisking constantly, 1 minute or just until thickened. Set sauce aside. Sprinkle catfish evenly with remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons Szechwan seasoning. Dredge fillets in flour; dip in egg whites, and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Pour oil to a depth of 1/4-inch in a large skillet; heat to 350 degrees F. Fry fish, in batches, 3 to 4 minutes on each side or until fish flakes with a fork. Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately with sauce.
