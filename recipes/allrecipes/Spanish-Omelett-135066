In a nonstick skillet, cook the onion, pepper, and ham over medium heat until warm. Empty the mixture onto a plate and then add the eggs and milk to the skillet. Stir until the eggs begin to solidify. Using the tines of your fork, mash the egg/milk mixture until it's cooked all the way through. Add the filling to the center, sprinkle with cheese, and fold. Top with salsa. Cut the omelette in half.
