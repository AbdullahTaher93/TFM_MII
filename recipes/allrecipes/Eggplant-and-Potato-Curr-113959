Heat the broiler. Put the whole eggplants on a baking sheet and broil, turning occasionally, until charred and soft, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. In a Dutch oven, heat the oil over moderately low heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the coriander, cumin, fennel seeds, and jalapeno and cook, stirring, for 1 minute longer. Add the potatoes, salt, and water and bring to a simmer. Cook, covered, until the potatoes start to soften, about 10 minutes. Cut each eggplant open and spoon the pulp into the potato mixture. Simmer, uncovered, until the potatoes are tender, about 5 minutes more. Add the tomatoes and heat through, about 2 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and cilantro.
