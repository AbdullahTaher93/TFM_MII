Stir together the lime juice, soy sauce, minced chipotle, and 1 tablespoon olive oil; stir in chile powder, paprika, cumin, and garlic. Toss venison strips until well coated with marinade, set aside, and marinate for 20 minutes. Drain venison strips in a colander, pressing out any excess liquid. Place the flour in a plastic bag, season to taste with seasoned salt and pepper. Toss venison strips with the flour until each piece is coated. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Shake excess flour from the venison strips, and cook until well browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side.
