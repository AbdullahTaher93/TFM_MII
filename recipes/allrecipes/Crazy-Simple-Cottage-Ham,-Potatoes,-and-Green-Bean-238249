Put ham into a Dutch oven. Arrange potato halves, green beans, and onion slices around the ham. Pour enough water into the pot to cover the vegetables completely. Place a cover on the pot and bring the water to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer mixture until potatoes are completely soft, about 55 minutes. Remove ham to a cutting board to slice to desired thickness; serve with vegetables.
