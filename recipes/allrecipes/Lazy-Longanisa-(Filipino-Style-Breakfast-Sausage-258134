Combine sliced sausage, brown sugar, white vinegar, and soy sauce in a large plastic bag. Seal and marinate in the refrigerate, 2 hours to overnight. Pour sausage mixture into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add water and vegetable oil; cook and stir until liquid is reduced and sausage is browned, about 15 minutes.
