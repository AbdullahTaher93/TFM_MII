Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a muffin tin with cooking spray. Combine peanut butter, banana, honey, egg white, almond extract, baking soda, and sea salt in a blender; blend until smooth. Stir chocolate chips into the batter with a wooden spoon. Pour batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup 3/4 full. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 9 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes; transfer to a baking rack to cool completely.
