Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil; cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and cut into quarters. In a large bowl, combine the mixed greens, green onions, red onions and parsley. Add enough salad dressing to coat and toss evenly. Place 1 cup of salad mixture on each plate and garnish with olives, chopped eggs and bread cubes.
