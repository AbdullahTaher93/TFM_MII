Place the pomegranate juice in a small pan and reduce to cup over medium high heat. Combine the juice and the remaining vinaigrette ingredients in a small glass jar and shake vigorously to combine. Arrange 5 cuts of the figs in a circle on the 4 salad plates. Toss the greens in a large bowl with 2 ounces of the vinaigrette. Divide the salad evenly between each plate. Shave the goat cheese on top of the salad, finish with the toasted pepitas and serve immediately.
