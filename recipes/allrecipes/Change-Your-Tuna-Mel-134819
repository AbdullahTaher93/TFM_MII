Cook the celery and onion in a large nonstick skillet. Add the cheeses, tuna, mayonnaise, and lemon juice to the skillet and cook the mixture just long enough to warm it up. Spread one-sixth of the mixture on each English muffin half. Put the muffin halves on a cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes.
