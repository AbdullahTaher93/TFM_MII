In a small skillet over medium heat, toast pine nuts, stirring often, until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook 3/4 pound fettuccine (or other thick-stranded pasta) until al dente, according to package instructions, adding asparagus during last 5 minutes of cooking. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water; drain. Return pasta, asparagus, and reserved pasta water to the pot. Toss with goat cheese, mustard, dill, and toasted pine nuts. Season with coarse salt and ground pepper.
