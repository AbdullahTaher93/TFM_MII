Rinse the barley in a strainer under cool water. Drain and place in a saucepan. Cover with 2 cups of cold water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover. Simmer very gently until most of the water has been absorbed and the grains are tender but still firm, about 30 minutes. Drain the barley well. While the barley is cooking, bring a second pot of water to a boil. Add the broccoli florets, zucchini, and peas, and bring back to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer the vegetables until they are just tender but still crisp, about 3-4 minutes, then drain well and rinse briefly with cold water. Whisk all dressing ingredients together in a large bowl. Stir in the apricots. Add the barley and vegetables as soon as they are cooked, and mix well to coat with the dressing. Cover and allow to cool until just warm. Add the pumpkin seeds just before serving, and salt and pepper to taste.
