Cover pinto beans with water in a large bowl; allow beans to soak overnight. Place onion, green bell pepper, celery, garlic, Black Forest ham, soaked pinto beans, cumin, oregano, bay leaves, and lard in a slow cooker. Pour enough chicken broth into the slow cooker to cover the other ingredients. Cook on High until beans are very tender, 5 to 6 hours.
