In a saucepan, combine the water and raisins. Bring to a boil. Remove from the heat; cool to room temperature (do not drain). In a large mixing bowl, cram butter, shortening and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Combine the dry ingredients; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Stir in chocolate chips and raisins with any liquid. Drop by heaping tablespoonfuls 2 in. apart onto greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks to cool.
