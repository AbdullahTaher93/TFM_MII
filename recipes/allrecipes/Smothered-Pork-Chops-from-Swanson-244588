Stir the broth and cornstarch in a small bowl until the mixture is smooth. Season the pork, if desired. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork and cook for 5 minutes or until well browned on both sides. Remove the pork from the skillet. Heat the remaining oil in the skillet. Add the onion and cook for 3 minutes or until tender-crisp, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute, stirring often. Stir the broth mixture in the skillet. Cook and stir until the mixture boils and thickens. Return the pork to the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the pork is cooked through.
