Coat a baking sheet with nonstick spray. Combine flour, oregano, garlic powder, and pepper in a self-sealing plastic food-storage bag. Whisk egg whites and water in a pie plate. Combine crumbs and Parmesan in another plastic bag. Shake zucchini in flour mixture until slices are coated. Dip slices into egg-white mixture; then shake in crumb mixture. Place slices in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Turn slices; bake until golden brown, about 8 minutes.
