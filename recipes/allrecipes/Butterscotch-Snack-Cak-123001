In a large saucepan, combine pudding mix and milk. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat; stir in dry cake mix. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Sprinkle with butterscotch chips and nuts. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
