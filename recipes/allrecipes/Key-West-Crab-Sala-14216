In a large bowl, combine spinach, lettuce, cabbage, oranges, and onions. Add crabmeat, and gently toss until combined. Set aside. In a small jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine orange zest, orange juice, vinegar, oil and tarragon. Cover, and shake until well mixed. Pour orange dressing over spinach salad, and gently toss until salad is well coated.
