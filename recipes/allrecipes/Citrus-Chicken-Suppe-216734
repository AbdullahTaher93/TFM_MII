Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the chicken breasts in the skillet until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). While the chicken cooks, stir the chicken broth, orange marmalade, and ranch dressing mix together in a bowl; pour over the chicken. Add the cornstarch to the liquid in the skillet and stir. Bring the mixture to a low boil, reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the skillet, and cook another 10 minutes. Serve over the cooked rice.
