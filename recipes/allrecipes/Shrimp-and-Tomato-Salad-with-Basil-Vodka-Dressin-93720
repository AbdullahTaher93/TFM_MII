With a toothpick or skewer, pierce each tomato through the middle and through the stem end to the base (this will allow the dressing to penetrate the tomatoes.) Lay the basil leaves atop one another. Roll into a tight cylinder. Cut into thin crosswise slices; reserve. In a bowl, whisk the oil, vodka, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper. Add the shrimp, celery, tomatoes, and basil. Toss gently. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, stirring occasionally, for up to 24 hours. Allow to sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. Serve on salad plates lined with lettuce leaves.
