In a mixing bowl, stir together flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt; make a well in the center. Combine eggs, oil and buttermilk; pour all at once into the well. Stir just until dry ingredients are moistened. Do not overmix. Gently fold in jam (a few lumps will remain). Place in a well-greased or paper-lined muffin tins. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20 minutes.
