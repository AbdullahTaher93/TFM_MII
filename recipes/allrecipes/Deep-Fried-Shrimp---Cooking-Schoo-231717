Heat oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Put flour, panko bread crumbs, and beaten eggs into separate bowls; season flour and panko with salt and pepper. Gently press the shrimp into the flour mixture to coat and shake off the excess flour. Dip into the beaten egg, then press into bread crumbs. Gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place breaded shrimp on a baking sheet while breading the rest; do not stack. Fry 8 to 10 shrimp at a time in hot oil until golden brown on the outside and opaque through the center, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with paper towels. Repeat with remaining shrimp. If needed, allow to temperature of the oil to return to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) between batches.
