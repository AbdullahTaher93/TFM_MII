Combine vinegar, salt, and sugar in a non-reactive saucepan over low heat; stir until salt and sugar are dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in water. Let cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Place sugar snap peas, tarragon, garlic, lemon zest, dill seed, and red pepper flakes in a 1-quart Mason jar. Pour vinegar mixture into the jar. Cover jar and refrigerate until peas are lightly pickled, at least 1 day and up to 2 weeks.
