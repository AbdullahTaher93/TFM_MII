In a mixing bowl, combine the first seven ingredients; beat until smooth. In another bowl, combine the flours, wheat germ, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add raisins, walnuts and 3 teaspoons sesame seeds. Stir into sugar mixture just until moistened. Stir in zucchini. Pour into a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Sprinkle with the remaining sesame seeds. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minute before removing from pan to a wire rack.
