Place chicken in large saucepan with 4 cups salted water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Turn off heat, cover, and let stand 15 minutes or until a thermometer inserted into thickest portion registers 160 degrees F. Remove peel and pith from grapefruit with knife while chicken cooks. Working over a bowl to catch juice, free each segment from its membrane and cut segments into bite-size pieces, dropping them into bowl. Add avocado, radishes, basil, and salt. Toss gently to mix. Drain chicken (discard liquid) and cut crosswise into 1/2" slices. Divide grapefruit mixture into 4 portions and add a quarter of the chicken to each, drizzling chicken with grapefruit juice. Serve over lettuce leaves (if using) and garnish with additional basil leaves, if desired.
