Heat grill, if used. Shape ground beef into eight (4-inch) patties. Top 4 patties with olives. Cut cream cheese into 4 cubes. Flatten each cube into a patty and center one on each olive-topped burger. Top cheese with remaining patties; press edges together tightly to seal. Cook in large heavy skillet or on gill over medium-high heat 3 to 4 minutes. Turn patties and cook an additional 4 minutes for medium well or to desired doneness. If patty puffs during cooking, pierce with a toothpick to release the steam. Serve on buns with your favorite condiments.
