Stir sugar, orange juice, triple sec, and water together in a saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves; add cranberries and cook until the berries begin to pop, about 10 minutes. Pour cranberry sauce into a serving bowl; stir nuts into the sauce. Let sauce cool until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.
