Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion and garlic; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add zucchini, yellow squash, and chayote. Cover, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped jicama; cover and cook 3 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, chili powder, cumin, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Cover and let cook for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the shredded cheese. Serve immediately.
