Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12 cup muffin tin, or line with paper liners. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the buttermilk, yogurt, and lemon juice. Combine the flour and baking powder; stir into the yogurt mixture until just blended. Fold in strawberries. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top springs back when lightly touched. Cool in the pan over a wire rack.
