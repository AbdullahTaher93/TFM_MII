Coat 3 large jelly-roll pans with nonstick spray. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) In a large bowl, mix the oats with the wheat germ and dry milk. In a small saucepan, heat the honey and oil until the honey is runny; add to the oats and mix well. Spread the granola into the jelly-roll pans. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, gently stirring every 5 minutes to prevent burning and ensure even browning. When the granola is lightly browned, remove from the oven. Sprinkle raisins over hot granola mixture. Allow to cool to room temperature. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
