Spread potato chips on a flat surface. Spoon sour cream into a small resealable plastic bag. Press the sour cream into a corner and cut the corner of the bag off with scissors. Pipe about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon sour cream into the center of each chip. Top sour cream with about 1/2 gram trout caviar; garnish caviar with a few pieces of chopped chive.
