Bake sweet potatoes for 40-50 minutes at 350 degrees F. Cut off top 1/3 of potato and scoop out flesh, leaving 1/4 inch in shell. Mix potato with butter, cream, 2 tbsp brown sugar, nutmeg, salt and pepper and spoon back into reserved potato shells. Top each with 1 strip bacon cut into pieces, 1 tablespoon marshmallow creme, and then sprinkle all with remaining brown sugar. Broil for 3-5 minutes or until marshmallow creme is toasty brown. Serve hot!
