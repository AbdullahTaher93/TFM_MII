Line a 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan with plastic wrap; set aside. In a large saucepan, bring rhubarb and 1 cup sugar to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 12-14 minutes or until thickened and rhubarb is tender, stirring several times. Remove from the heat. Cool completely, about 25 minutes, stirring several times to break apart rhubarb. In a small mixing, combine whipping cream, 2 tablespoons sugar and vanilla; beat until soft peaks form. Fold into rhubarb mixture. Transfer half to a prepared pan. Cover and freeze for 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate remaining rhubarb mixture. Stir ginger into ice cream; spread 1-1/2 cups over rhubarb layer. Cover and freeze for 30 minutes. Refrigerate remaining ice cream mixture. Spread remaining rhubarb mixture over the ice cream layer. Cover and freeze for 1 hour. Spread with remaining ice cream mixture. Freeze until firm. For sauce, drain raspberries, reserving juice. In a blender, combine raspberries and 2 tablespoons of juice; cover and process until pureed. Press through a fine sieve; discard seeds and pulp. Stir remaining sugar into raspberry mixture. Add enough of the remaining juice to measure 1-1/2 cups. Remove terrine from the freezer 15 minutes before cutting. Serve with raspberry sauce.
