Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the ground venison and cook, stirring to crumble, until no longer pink. Mix in the celery and onion; cook and stir until tender. Season with red pepper flakes, garlic powder and chili powder. Cook and stir for a minute to intensify the flavors. Pour in the tomatoes, tomato sauce, tequila and orange juice; simmer over low heat, uncovered, for 2 hours. After 2 hours, mix the beans into the chili and simmer for another 30 minutes.
