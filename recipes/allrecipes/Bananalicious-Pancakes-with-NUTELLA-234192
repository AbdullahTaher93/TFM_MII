In a large bowl, whisk together whole-wheat flour, oats, all-purpose flour, and baking powder well. In a smaller bowl, whisk together eggs, buttermilk, milk, brown sugar, and vanilla until sugar is dissolved. Pour egg mixture into flour mixture and whisk just to combine. Heat a non-stick griddle or fry pan sprayed with cooking spray over medium heat. Spoon small dollops of batter (approximately 2 to 3 tablespoons) onto the pan and cook until small bubbles appear on the edge of the pancake and surface appears slightly dry; flip and cook the other side until lightly golden brown. Spread each pancake with a little NUTELLA(R). Layer a few slices of banana on each pancake and then stack three or four of them one on top of the other.
