Put the rice noodles into a large bowl of hot water, cover, and soak for 15 minutes or until soft. Drain and set aside. Heat the oil over medium-low heat in a 12-inch skillet. Add the garlic and shallots. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shallots are translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. During the last minute, add the curry paste and blend it into the mixture. Turn up the heat to medium and stir in the beef. Using a spatula to break up the clumps, cook it until it begins to brown, about 4 minutes. Stir in the fish sauce, chicken stock, and sugar. Bring this up to a simmer and add the basil. When the basil has wilted, add the noodles to the skillet. Gently mix them with the sauce and cook for another minute or so.
