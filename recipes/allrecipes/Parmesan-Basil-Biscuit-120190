In a large bowl, combine the flour, cheese, basil, baking powder, baking soda, salt and pepper; mix well. Add the buttermilk and oil; stir just until combined. Turn onto a floured surface; gently knead three times. Roll dough to 1/2-in. thickness; cut with a floured 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter. Place 1 in. apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F for 16-18 minutes or until lightly browned. Serve warm.
