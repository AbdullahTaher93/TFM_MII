Cook garlic in the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large saucepan until lightly browned and fragrant. Add the ground pork and brown, stirring frequently to break it up. Stir in the tofu, reduce the heat to medium, and cook to reheat, stirring occasionally, about three minutes. Season with black bean sauce, soy sauce, sherry, and green onions.
