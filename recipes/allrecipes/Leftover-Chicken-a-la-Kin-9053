Combine chicken, vegetables and broth or wine in a medium saucepan over medium low heat. Stir all together and let simmer until heated through. In a small bowl beat cornstarch into evaporated milk and add to chicken mixture. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste, unless leftover chicken has enough of its own seasoning already. Serve hot.
