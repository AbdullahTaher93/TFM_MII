Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Cook and stir beef in a large skillet until browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain excess grease. Stir in water and taco seasoning mix. Cover and keep at a simmer over low heat. Unroll crescent dough triangles onto the prepared baking sheet. Cut each triangle in half. Top dough triangles with pepper Jack cheese slices. Divide beef mixture evenly over cheese; top with tomato and cilantro. Fold up dough to enclose filling. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 13 to 15 minutes.
