In a large skillet, cook sausage over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes or until sausage is thoroughly cooked; drain off excess fat. Spray a 5 to 6 quart slow cooker with cooking spray. Add sausage and remaining ingredients except cheese. Cover and cook on LOW for 5 to 6 hours. Stir chili well before serving. Top each serving with cheese.
