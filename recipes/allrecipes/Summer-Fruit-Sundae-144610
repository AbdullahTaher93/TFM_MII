Combine sugar and 1/4 cup water in a medium-sized heavy-bottomed saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat until sugar is dissolved. Cover pan; bring to a boil. Leave cover on until condensation washes down insides of pan. If syrup crystallizes, let crystallize completely, and push around bottom of saucepan with the back of a wooden spoon until it melts again. Raise heat to medium high; cook, swirling pan occasionally, until the sugar turns medium-dark amber. Carefully add cream, standing back in case sugar boils over, and scrape in vanilla seeds. Stir until cream is incorporated, and remove from heat. Let cool; transfer to a glass jar, bottle, or bowl for storing and serving. Scoop sorbets and ice cream into serving dishes, drizzle with caramel, and spoon fruit over sauce; Serve, garnished with toasted pecans.
