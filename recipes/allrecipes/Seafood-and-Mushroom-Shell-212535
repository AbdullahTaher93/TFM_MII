Heat the butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and cook until tender, stirring occasionally. Stir the soup, wine, lemon juice and fish in the skillet. Cook for 5 minutes or until the fish is cooked through. Spoon the fish mixture into the pastry shells. Sprinkle with the cheese.
