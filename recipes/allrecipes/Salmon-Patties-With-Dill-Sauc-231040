Mix salmon, breadcrumbs, onion, Dijon mustard, egg, and lemon juice together in a bowl; form into 2 patties. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties in the hot oil until lightly browned and cooked through, 4 minutes per side; season with sea salt and black pepper. Mix sour cream, dill, garlic powder, and sea salt together in a bowl; serve alongside salmon patties.
