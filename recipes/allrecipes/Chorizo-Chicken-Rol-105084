Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a glass baking dish with vegetable oil cooking spray. Lay the chicken breasts on a work surface and spread evenly with the chorizo. Sprinkle with dill, breadcrumbs, and pine nuts. Roll tightly, brush with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Place seam side down into prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until chicken has cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove chicken rolls from oven, and slice into 1 inch thick slices. Pour 1 1/2 teaspoons of olive oil in a frying pan and place over medium-high heat. Fry chicken pieces for 1 to 2 minutes on each side until lightly browned.
