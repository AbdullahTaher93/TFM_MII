Place lentils into a pressure cooker, and cover with about 1 inch of water. Add onion and oil, cook for 10 minutes and then turn off heat and let set for 10 minutes. Place lentil mixture, cumin, and pepper into a food processor or blender and puree until smooth. Transfer pureed soup into a large stock pot and return to heat. Right as soup is ready to boil add onion soup mix, stirring until well mixed. Simmer until soup has a thick creamy consistency. Prior to serving add lemon juice and chopped parsley for a little flavor and garnish.
