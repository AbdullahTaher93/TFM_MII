Combine bourbon, honey, soy sauce, canola oil, ginger, red pepper, and black pepper in a large bowl. Add pork and peaches; toss well to coat. Heat a nonstick grill pan over medium-high heat. Coat pan with cooking spray. Remove pork and peaches from bowl, reserving marinade. Place pork and peaches on grill pan; cook 4 minutes on each side or until pork is done. While pork cooks, place marinade in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave on HIGH for 2 minutes. Spoon over pork and peaches.
