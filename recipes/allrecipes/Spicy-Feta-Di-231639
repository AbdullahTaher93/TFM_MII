Pulse feta cheese in a food processor just enough to get uniformly small crumbles; transfer to a bowl. Puree red peppers, pepperoncini peppers, and cayenne pepper in the food processor until smooth. Mix pepper puree, ricotta cheese, and lemon juice into feta cheese until dip is an even texture and color. Transfer to a sealed container; refrigerate 2 hours to overnight.
