Preheat a grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Mix pork, feta cheese, cilantro, curry paste, garlic, ginger, cumin, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Divide mixture into fourths and form a burger from each portion. Refrigerate for 10 minutes (up to 4 hours). Place burgers on preheated grill, close lid, and grill until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted sideways into the center of a burger reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 5 minutes per side.
