Heat the broiler to high. Melt the butter in a skillet. When the butter starts to sizzle, add the garlic and saute 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and saute over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly cooked, 4 to 5 minutes. Place the ciabatta slices on the broiler pan and toast until lightly brown, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Turn them over and toast the other side until it is lightly brown, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Remove from the broiler and keep warm. Add the mustard to the mushrooms, and stir in. Reduce the heat slightly and add the Worcestershire sauce and seasoning to taste. Cook 1 minute longer, then remove the pan from the heat. Place 2 slices of ciabatta bread on each plate. Spoon the mushrooms and their cooking juices over the bread. Sprinkle with the Parmesan shavings and garnish with sprigs of parsley.
