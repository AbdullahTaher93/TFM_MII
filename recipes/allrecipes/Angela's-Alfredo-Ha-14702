To Cook Tortellini: Add pasta to a large pot of boiling salted water. Let cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain and set aside. Heat a skillet to medium heat. Add the ham, peas and mushrooms and toss together until heated through. Add sauce and reserved tortellini and stir all together. Let all simmer for 3 to 5 minutes and serve.
