Cook and stir chicken pieces in 3 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat until chicken is white outside and slightly pink inside, 5 to 8 minutes. Add tomatoes, mango, sweet onion, serrano peppers, white pepper, dry mustard, curry powder, and salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until chicken and onion are very tender, about 45 minutes. While curry is simmering, bring rice and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and fluffy and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Bring a skillet of lightly-salted water to a boil, reduce heat, and place asparagus into the boiling water. Cook until asparagus are tender and still bright green, about 12 minutes; drain water and drizzle asparagus with 3 tablespoons melted butter. To serve, spoon rice onto serving plates and top each serving with several asparagus spears; top with chicken curry.
