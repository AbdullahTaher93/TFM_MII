Bring the water to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Add the salt and slowly stir in the grits. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, or until the grits are creamy and thickened. Remove from the heat. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes, or until fragrant. Add the bell peppers, paprika, thyme, and black pepper and cook, stirring frequently, for 8 minutes, or until very tender. (Add a tablespoon of water to the pan if it gets dry.) Stir the bell pepper mixture and the cheese into the grits, stirring until the cheese melts.
