Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add nettles; cook until wilted, about 4 minutes. Drain, reserving cooking water. Transfer drained nettles to a blender; blend until smooth. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add shallots; cook and stir until very soft, about 10 minutes. Stir in heavy cream, salt, and pepper. Simmer until cream coats the back of a spoon, about 2 minutes. Stir in Parmesan cheese and blended nettles until well-combined.
