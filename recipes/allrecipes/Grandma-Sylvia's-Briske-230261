Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown brisket on both sides and transfer it to a deep pot. Stir in tomato paste, water, onions, carrots, mushrooms, garlic powder, sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until meat is tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Transfer to a baking dish, cool, and refrigerate overnight. About 1 1/2 hours before serving, preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Skim off fat residue from sauce and slice brisket across the grain. Layer beef, vegetables, and sauce in a baking dish. Cover pan with foil and bake in preheated oven until hot, about 1 hour.
