Whisk the honey mustard, and balsamic vinegar together in a small bowl until combined. Drizzle in the olive oil while whisking to make the dressing; set aside. Place the salad greens, tomatoes, strawberries, walnuts, and feta cheese into a large salad bowl. Tear off the dill fronds and add to the salad. Toss gently to mix, then pour on the dressing, and toss to coat.
