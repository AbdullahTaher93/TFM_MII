Combine the pumpkin, water, and chicken bouillon cube in a soup pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until the pumpkin is tender, about 30 minutes. Stir in the chili powder. Pour the mixture into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the pumpkin mixture moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot. Return the soup to the pot and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat; stir in the cream, pumpkin pie spice, ginger, and orange zest and simmer for 10 more minutes. Return the hot soup to the blender and puree as before.
