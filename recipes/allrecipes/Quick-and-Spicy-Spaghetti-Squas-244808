Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat the inside of squash with about 1 tablespoon olive oil. Place squash, cut-side down, on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until squash is tender, about 30 minutes. Cool squash for 10 minutes. Shred the inside of squash with a fork and transfer to a bowl. Add remaining olive oil, parsley, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper to shredded squash and toss to coat.
