In a shallow bowl, beat together eggs and milk. Dip each slice of bread in the egg mixture, one at a time. Cook in a lightly oiled skillet over medium heat until both sides are golden. Set two of the slices of toast on a plate. On each slice, spread a thin layer of jam and add four Hershey's Kisses pointy-side up. Top with the other slices. Put a small puddle of jam in the center of each top slice, place the last two Kisses in the center of each puddle. Sprinkle with cinnamon and serve.
