In a large glass or stainless-steel bowl, toss the tomatoes with the garlic, oil, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, the pepper, and basil. Set the mixture aside. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the fettuccine until just done, about 12 minutes. Drain, return to the hot pan, and toss with the tomato mixture, the watercress, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt.
