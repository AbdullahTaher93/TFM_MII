Place bacon in a deep skillet and cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Cool and crumble. Cut broccoli into bite-size pieces and cut onion into thin bite-size slices. Combine with the bacon, raisins, and almonds and mix well. To prepare the dressing, mix mayonnaise, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, and vinegar together until smooth. Stir into the salad, let chill and serve.
