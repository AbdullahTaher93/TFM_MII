In a bowl with a mixer, beat butter with 1 1/2 cups of the sugar until mixture is smoothly blended. Beat in 2 of the eggs, then beat in pumpkin and 1/3 cup water. In another bowl, combine flour with cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, and nutmeg; add to butter mixture. Beat until well mixed. Evenly spread batter in a buttered, floured 10- by 15-inch pan. In a bowl with a mixer, beat cream cheese with remaining egg and 1/4 cup sugar until smooth. Drop cheese mixture in 24 evenly spaced 1-tablespoon portions over batter. Pull knife tip through filling to swirl slightly into batter. Bake in a 350 degrees F oven until center of cookie batter (not cheese) springs back when lightly touched, about 30 minutes. Cool in pan on rack. When cool, cut into 24 pieces with a sharp knife. Use a small spatula to lift from pan. Serve, or chill up to 3 days.
