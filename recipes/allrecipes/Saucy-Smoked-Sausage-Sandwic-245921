Cut onion, carrot and celery into equal size pieces and pulse in a food processor until finely chopped. Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat and cook smoked sausage until brown. Add the onion, carrot and celery and cook until veggies are soft, about 5 minutes. Add ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar and cook for 6 - 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Spoon filling onto buns with cheese, and serve.
