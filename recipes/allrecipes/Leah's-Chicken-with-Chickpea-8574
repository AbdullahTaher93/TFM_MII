In a large skillet, saute onion in oil until golden. Sprinkle turmeric in pan, and mix well. Put chicken on top, and brown on all sides. Add about 2 cups water, chickpeas, lemon juice, garlic, and salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Simmer gently for about 1 hour, or until the chicken is tender and the liquid is reduced. Taste to adjust seasonings.
