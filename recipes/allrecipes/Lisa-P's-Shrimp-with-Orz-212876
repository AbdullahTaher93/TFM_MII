Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease an 11x15-inch baking pan. Cook orzo according to package directions; drain and toss with 1 Tbsp. olive oil. Stir in spinach and drained diced tomatoes. Spoon into prepared pan. Cook garlic in remaining oil. Add shrimp; saute until just pink. Add crushed tomatoes and oregano; simmer until slightly reduced. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon over orzo mixture; top with cheese. Bake 15 minutes or until heated through. Garnish with parsley, if desired.
