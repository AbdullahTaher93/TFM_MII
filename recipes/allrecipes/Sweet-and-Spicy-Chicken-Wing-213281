Stir the picante sauce, honey and ginger in a large bowl. Cut the wings in half at the joints to make 24 pieces. Toss the wings with the picante sauce mixture. Place them in a foil-lined shallow baking pan. Bake at 400 degrees F for 55 minutes or until they're glazed and cooked through, turning and brushing often with the sauce during the last 30 minutes of baking time. Discard any remaining sauce.
