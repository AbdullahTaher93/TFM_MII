In a large frying pan, melt the butter over moderately low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the prosciutto and tomatoes. Cover, reduce the heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the cantaloupe, cream, and the salt and pepper. Cook until heated through, about 3 minutes longer. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the orecchiette until done, about 15 minutes. Drain the pasta and toss it with the sauce.
