Whisk vinegar, water, vegetable oil, sugar, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until the solids are completely dissolved into the liquid. Add kohlrabi to the liquid; marinate overnight to 12 hours. Pour into a saucepan and cook over medium heat until the kohlrabi is tender, about 25 minutes. Set aside to cool completely before eating.
