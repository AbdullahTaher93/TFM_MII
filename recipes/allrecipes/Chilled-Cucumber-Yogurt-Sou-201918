Combine the grated cucumber, lemon juice, mint, dill, garlic, yogurt, olive oil, and salt in a large mixing bowl; stir with a large spoon. Pour the mixture into a blender; blend on high speed until smooth. Serve immediately or chill in refrigerator until ready to serve. Divide the soup between four bowls; top each serving with about 1 tablespoon raisins.
