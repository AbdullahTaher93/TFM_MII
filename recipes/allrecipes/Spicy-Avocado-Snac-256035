Slice the meat of each avocado half 3 or 4 times in one direction, turn avocado and slice 3 or 4 more slices perpendicular to the first slices creating 8 to 12 small cubes still attached to the peel. Drizzle lemon juice over each avocado and top with kosher salt. Drizzle hot sauce over each. Eat with a fork or spoon.
