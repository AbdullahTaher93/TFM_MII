Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Move an oven rack to the center position in oven. Mix cream-style corn, cornmeal, buttermilk, corn oil, Cheddar cheese, eggs, jalapeno peppers, salt, and baking soda in a large mixing bowl. Put butter into a 9-inch square baking dish. Melt butter in preheated oven, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour corn bread batter into the baking dish over melted butter. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 35 minutes.
