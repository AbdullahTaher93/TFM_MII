Process celery, green onions, and crab in a food processor until finely chopped, about 30 seconds. Sprinkle gelatin over cold water in a small bowl; let stand until softened, about 10 minutes. Bring chicken soup to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat; stir gelatin mixture into soup, dissolving completely. Remove from heat and cool until slightly warm. Stir cream cheese and mayonnaise into soup mixture until smooth; stir Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce into soup mixture. Pour soup mixture into food processor with crab mixture and process until smooth, about 1 minute. Pour into a 5-cup mold. Chill in refrigerator until set, about 4 hours.
