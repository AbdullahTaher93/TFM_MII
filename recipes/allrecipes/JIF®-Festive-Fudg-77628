Grease 8-inch pan. Combine sugar, marshmallow creme, milk, JIF(R) Reduced Fat Peanut Butter and salt in a large saucepan. Stir constantly on low heat until blended and mixture comes to a boil. Boil 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Add semi-sweet chocolate chips. Stir until well blended. Stir in vanilla. Pour into pan. Cool. Cut into squares or with cookie cutters. Melt white chocolate chips with CRISCO(R) Butter Flavor All-Vegetable Shortening in microwave, stirring at 20-second intervals, until smooth (1-2 minutes). Place mixture in zip top bag. Cut a tiny piece off bottom corner to create a pastry bag. (If chocolate hardens, place in microwave for 7-10 seconds). Decorate fudge to look like gifts.
