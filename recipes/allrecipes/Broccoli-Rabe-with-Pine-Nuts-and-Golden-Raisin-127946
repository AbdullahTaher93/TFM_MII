Trim large stems from broccoli rabe and discard. Wash leaves, but do not dry (the moisture will help the greens to steam). In a large skillet with a tight-fitting lid or in a Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Add raisins and pine nuts, and cook uncovered, stirringly constantly, until pine nuts just start to turn brown and raisins swell, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove raisins and pine nuts from skillet with a slotted spoon, and set aside. Raise heat to medium-high and add broccoli rabe. Sprinkle with salt and cover. Cook, stirring every 2 minutes, until the greens are tender, about 5 minutes. Return raisins and pine nuts to pan and toss to combine. Drizzle with remaining tablespoon olive oil. Season with pepper and more salt, if desired. Serve hot.
