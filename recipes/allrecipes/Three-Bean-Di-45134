Spread the refried beans in a layer in the bottom of a 9 inch square baking dish. In a small bowl, stir together the taco seasoning mix and cream cheese. Spread the mixture over the refried beans. In a separate bowl, toss together the tomatoes, green onions, cubanella pepper, black beans and navy beans. Spread over the layer of cream cheese. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours before serving to blend the flavors.
