In a 4- to 5-quart nonstick pan over high heat, stir serrano chilies, cumin, onion, and turkey until meat is crumbled and onion is soft (about 8 minutes). Add beans, milk, and corn. Cook, stirring, just until hot (1 to 2 minutes). Ladle chili into wide bowls. Sprinkle with ground chili and season to taste with salt. Serve with lime wedges to squeeze over portions to taste.
