Whisk rice vinegar, lime juice, honey, ginger, peanut butter, garlic, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, and sriracha sauce together in a small bowl to make dressing. Slice red onion into spirals with a spiralizer fitted with a straight-flat blade. Spiralize cucumbers into thin, curly ribbons; snip into serving-size lengths with kitchen shears or a knife. Transfer to a shallow bowl. Drizzle dressing over onion and cucumbers; mix gently to combine. Garnish with peanuts and jalapeno pepper.
