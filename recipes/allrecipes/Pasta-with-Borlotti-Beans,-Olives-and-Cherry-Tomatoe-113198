In a medium saucepan, cover the beans with 2 inches of water and bring to a boil. Simmer over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 2 hours. Keep adding water as necessary so the beans are always submerged in 1 inch of water. Remove them from the heat and season with salt. Drain the beans, reserving the cooking liquid. Heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil in a large saucepan. Add the garlic and cook over moderate heat until golden, about 2 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the cherry tomatoes and oregano and cook for 3 minutes. Add the beans and 1/4 cup of their cooking liquid and simmer for 5 minutes. Add 1/4 cup more of the bean cooking liquid and simmer for 3 minutes. Season with salt. Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta until al dente. Drain well. Add the pasta to the beans along with another 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid. Simmer for 1 minute and add the olives. Add more cooking liquid if necessary to coat the pasta and beans with a sauce. Ladle into bowls and serve, passing the pecorino and olive oil at the table.
