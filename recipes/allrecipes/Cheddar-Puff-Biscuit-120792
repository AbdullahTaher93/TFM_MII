In a saucepan, bring milk and butter to a boil. Add flour all at once and stir until a smooth ball forms. Remove from the heat; let stand for 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the cheese, onion, garlic powder and pepper; beat until mixture is smooth and shiny. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls 2 in. apart onto greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.
