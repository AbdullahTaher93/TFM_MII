Fill a 1-quart pot with water; boil plantains with a pinch of salt until easily pierced with a fork, about 25 minutes. Mash plantains with tomato sauce, cilantro, sofrito, 1 tablespoon olive oil, garlic, and sazon in a mortar or glass bowl. Incorporate the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and enough vegetable broth to ensure that mofongo sticks together but is dry enough to easily slip out of a container. Season with salt and pepper. Serve mofongo on top of the remaining 5 tablespoons vegetable broth in a bowl.
