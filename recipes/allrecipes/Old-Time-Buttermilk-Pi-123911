In a bowl, mix flour and salt. Cut in shortening until smooth. Gradually add milk and egg; blend well. On a floured surface, roll dough out very thin. Place in a 10-in. pie pan; set aside. For filling, cream butter and sugar in a mixing bowl. Add flour. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in remaining ingredients and mix well. Pour into crust. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes. Cool completely before serving.
