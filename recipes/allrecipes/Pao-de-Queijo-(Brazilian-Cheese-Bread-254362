Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Pour tapioca starch into a wide bowl. Combine 1 cup water, vegetable oil, and salt in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Slowly pour over the tapioca, mixing with a spoon until evenly combined. Let cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Stir Mexican cheese blend and eggs into the tapioca mixture. Knead dough until soft and sticky, 5 to 10 minutes. Add water, 1 teaspoon at a time, if dough seems dry. Drop spoonfuls of dough 1 inch apart on the baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 25 minutes.
