In a small glass or stainless-steel bowl, combine the sour cream, milk, chives, vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper. Mix well and set aside. In a food processor with a grating attachment, grate the potatoes, 1 1/2 of the apples, and the onion. Transfer to a large bowl and stir in the parsley, eggs, bread crumbs, and the remaining 1 1/4 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. In a large nonstick frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over moderate heat. Form the potato mixture into twelve pancakes about 21/2 inches wide and 1/2-inch thick, using about 1/4 cup of the mixture for each. Cook the pancakes in batches, turning once, until crisp and golden, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Keep the cooked pancakes warm in a 200 degrees F oven on a baking sheet lined with paper towels until the last batch is done. Use 1 tablespoon of oil for each batch. Cut the remaining apples into thin slices. Put them in a large bowl along with the greens. Add all but 2 tablespoons of the dressing and toss. Arrange the salad on plates and top with the pancakes. Drizzle the remaining dressing over the pancakes.
