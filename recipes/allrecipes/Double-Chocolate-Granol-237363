Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix oats, cashews, coconut, and mixed fruit together in a large bowl. Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Stir honey into melted butter until smooth; add oats mixture and stir to coat. Sprinkle cocoa powder over the oats mixture; stir. Drizzle vanilla extract over the mixture; stir. Season mixture with a pinch of salt. Spread oats mixture in a single layer onto a baking sheet; toast in preheated oven, stirring once about halfway through, until crisp, about 10 minutes. Cool oats mixture to room temperature. Transfer to an airtight container, add chocolate chips, and stir.
