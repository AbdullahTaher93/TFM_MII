Heat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat a large baking sheet with nonstick spray. To Make Filling: Saute mushrooms in margarine until tender, about 5 minutes. Combine cheeses, 4 tablespoons (50 mL) egg substitute, and black pepper. Stir in broccoli, roasted peppers, olives, and mushrooms. To Assemble Calzone: On baking sheet, stretch dough into a 6 x 16-inch (15 x 40-cm) rectangle. Spoon on filling, covering dough up to 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the edges. Fold dough over lengthwise; press edges together. Brush dough with remaining egg substitute. Bake until calzone is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
