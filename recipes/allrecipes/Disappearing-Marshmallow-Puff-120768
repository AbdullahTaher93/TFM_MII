Separate crescent dough into 16 triangles. In a bowl, combine sugar and cinnamon. Roll marshmallows in butter, then in cinnamon-sugar. Place marshmallows at wide end of crescents. Fold corners over marshmallow. Roll up each triangle, beginning at the wide end. Pinch seams to seal. Dip bottom of dough in butter. Place butter, side down, in ungreased muffin cups. Place muffin pans on baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or until golden brown. Immediately remove from pans to wire racks. For glaze, combine confectioners' sugar and vanilla. Stir in enough milk to achieve desired consistency. Drizzle over puffs. Sprinkle with nuts. Serve warm.
