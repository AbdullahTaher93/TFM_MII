Brown meatballs on all sides. Push the meatballs to the side. Blend remaining flour into the drippings. Add the broth, water and thyme. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Add potatoes, carrots and onions and stir with meatballs and sauce. Cover and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30-35 minutes. Add peas and continue to cook 10 minutes. Adjust seasonings, if desired.
