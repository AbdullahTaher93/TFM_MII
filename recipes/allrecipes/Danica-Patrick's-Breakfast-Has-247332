Saute the diced sweet potatoes in a pan with 1 tablespoon of coconut oil. Finish with sea salt. In another pan, saute the diced red bell pepper and apple until slightly softened. Add the chopped kale and cook until it's wilted, then combine the mixture with the sweet potatoes. Reuse that pan to cook the ground turkey and season with sage, thyme, rosemary, sea salt and ground black pepper. Combine the meat with the potato mixture, stir and serve. Add fried egg and avocado if desired.
