Bring the water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Remove from the heat, and stir in the couscous. Cover, and let stand for 3 to 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork. Rinse couscous with cold water in a colander set in the sink. Once cooled, pour couscous into a large bowl. Add salmon, cucumber, celery, tomato, dill weed, parsley, salt, and pepper. Whisk together lemon poppy seed dressing, olive oil, and vinegar in a small bowl. Pour dressing over salad, and toss to coat.
