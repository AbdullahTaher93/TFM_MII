In a saucepan, bring the apricot nectar, dates and apricots to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat; add orange peel and rosemary. Cool for 10 minutes. In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in egg and milk. Combine flour and baking soda; add to creamed mixture alternately with date mixture. Pour into three greased 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
