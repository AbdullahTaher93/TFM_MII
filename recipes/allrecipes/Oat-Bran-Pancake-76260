Heat nonstick griddle or frying pan over medium to medium high heat. Combine oat bran, flour, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Set aside. Beat together buttermilk and egg substitute in a small bowl with a wire whisk. Pour the egg mixture over dry ingredients. Stir together until ingredients are just blended and no large dry lumps appear. Pour approx. 1/4 cup pancake batter onto hot griddle. Cook pancakes until puffed, browned and slightly dry around the edges. Flip over and cook other side until golden brown.
