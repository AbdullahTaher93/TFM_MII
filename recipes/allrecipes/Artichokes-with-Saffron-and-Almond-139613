Place figs in a bowl and cover with the boiling water. Allow the figs to plump for 5 minutes, then remove. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of saffron threads into the remaining liquid, and allow to steep for 5 minutes. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add artichokes, and toss until coated with oil. Pour in saffron water and salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the artichokes are tender, about 8 minutes. Uncover the artichokes and increase heat to medium-high. Add the figs, almonds, vinegar, and paprika. Cook and stir until all of the liquid has evaporated. Remove from the heat, recover, and allow to stand for 5 minutes before serving.
