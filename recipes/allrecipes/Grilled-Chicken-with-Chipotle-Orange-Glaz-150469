Preheat grill or broiler to high. Lightly oil the rack. Whisk orange juice concentrate, chiles, vinegar, molasses and mustard in a small bowl. Sprinkle chicken with salt. Grill or broil the chicken for 2 minutes. Turn the chicken, brush with the chipotle-orange glaze, and cook, brushing occasionally with more of the glaze, 4 minutes more. Turn the chicken again, brush with the glaze, and cook until no longer pink in the middle, 2 to 5 minutes more.
