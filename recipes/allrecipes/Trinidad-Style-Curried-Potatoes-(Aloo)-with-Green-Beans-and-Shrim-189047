Toss the shrimp, white wine vinegar, seafood seasoning, and cumin together in a bowl. Heat the oil in a pot over medium heat; cook the onions in the oil until they begin to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the celery, carrot, red bell pepper, and scotch bonnet pepper; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook another 3 minutes. Whisk the curry powder into 1/2 cup of water in a small bowl; pour into the pot while also adding the potatoes; mix to coat and allow to cook 2 to 3 minutes more. Pour in 2 cups hot water and bring mixture to a boil. Gently lie the green beans into the pot. Allow the mixture to simmer until the potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add the shrimp and cook another 5 minutes. Sprinkle the cilantro leaves over the mixture and season with salt and pepper just before serving.
