In a medium saucepan, combine sugar and cornstarch. Whisk in the egg yolks and milk until thoroughly combined. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil; boil for 1 minute. Remove from the heat. Add lemon juice and raisins. Pour into pie shell. For meringue, beat egg whites in a small bowl until foamy. Gradually add sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until stiff and glossy. Spread over warm pie, making sure meringue covers all of the filling. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or until light golden brown. Serve warm or cold. Store leftovers in the refrigerator.
