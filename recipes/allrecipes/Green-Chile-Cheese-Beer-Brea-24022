Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Blend green chiles and cheese together in a blender until smooth. In a large bowl, stir together chile mixture, flour, sugar and beer together in a large mixing bowl until you get a sticky dough. Scoop dough into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped.
