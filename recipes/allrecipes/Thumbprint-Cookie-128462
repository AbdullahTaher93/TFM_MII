Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease baking sheets. In a medium bowl, combine the oats, flour, baking powder, and salt. In a large bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the butter and brown sugar for 3 minutes, or until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and vanilla extract. Beat in the flour mixture, a little at a time, until well-blended. Shape the mixture into 1-inch balls and place on the prepared baking sheets, leaving 2 inches between the cookies. Dip your thumb into water and make an indentation in the center of each cookie. Spoon 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of the raspberry spread into the centers of half of the cookies. Fill the remaining cookies with the apricot spread. Bake for 12 minutes, or until lightly browned and firm to the touch. Cool on a rack for 2 minutes. Remove to the rack to cool completely.
