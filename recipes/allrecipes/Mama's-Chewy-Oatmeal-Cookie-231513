Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat brown sugar, shortening, milk, egg, and vanilla extract in a bowl until mixture is creamy. Stir oats, flour, baking soda, and salt into moist ingredients. Drop dough by spoonful onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.
