Drain peas, reserving 1/3 cup of liquid. Place peas and liquid in a blender or food processor; cover and puree until smooth. Set aside. In a saucepan, saute the onion in butter until tender. Stir in the flour, sugar, salt, pepper and sage until smooth. Gradually add water; bring to a boil. Boil and stir for 2 minutes. Stir in milk and pureed peas; heat through. Garnish with bacon.
