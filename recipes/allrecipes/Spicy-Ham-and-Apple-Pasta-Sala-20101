Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and run under cold water. Transfer to a large bowl with ham and apples and set aside. In a small bowl, whisk together the preserves, apple jelly, horseradish, mustard and black pepper. Pour over the ham/pasta mixture and toss to combine. Cover and refrigerate salad for 30 minutes. When ready to serve, place mixed salad greens on 4 plates and arrange ham salad on top.
