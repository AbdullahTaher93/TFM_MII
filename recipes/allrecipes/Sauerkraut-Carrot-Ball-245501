Combine sauerkraut, carrot, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, cumin, parsley, basil, turmeric, cayenne, garam masala, black pepper, and salt in a large bowl; mix until thoroughly combined. Add 6 tablespoons flour and mix well to combine. Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add sauerkraut mixture and 1/2 cup water; cook and stir until the mixture thickens, adding more water if needed, 5 to 8 minutes. If the sauerkraut mixture is not thick enough or not thickening, add more flour. Spread sauerkraut mixture evenly in a casserole dish and set aside to cool, about 1 hour. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place bread crumbs in a shallow bowl. Use a 1-inch cookie scoop or your hands to form the cooled sauerkraut mixture into 1-inch balls. Roll them in bread crumbs and place in the hot oil. Fry in batches until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
