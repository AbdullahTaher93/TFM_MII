In a bowl, combine flour and salt. Whisk together eggs and milk; stir into dry ingredients just until blended. Pour into four greased and floured 8-oz. custard cups. Place on a baking sheet. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 20 minutes or until puffed and edges are golden brown (do not open the oven door during baking).
