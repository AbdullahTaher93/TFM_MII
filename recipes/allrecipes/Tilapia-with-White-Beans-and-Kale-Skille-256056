Sprinkle tilapia with half of salt and pepper; set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a deep 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook about 2 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Add half of kale, cook 2 minutes or until wilted. Add the remaining kale and oil; cook 2 minutes more or until wilted. Stir in beans, drained tomatoes, wine and remaining salt and pepper. Top with tilapia. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat approximately 10 minutes or until fish flakes easily with fork (145 degrees F).
