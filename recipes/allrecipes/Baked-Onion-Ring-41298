In a large bowl, combine the first five ingredients; set aside. Cut onions into 1/2-in-thick slices. Separate into rings, reserving the small rings for another use. In a small mixing bowl, beat egg substitute until frothy. Dip onion rings into egg, then into crumb mixture, coating well. Place in a single layer on baking sheets that have been coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 375 degrees for 15-20 minutes or until onions are tender and coating is crispy.
