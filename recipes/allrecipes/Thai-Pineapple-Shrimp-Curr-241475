Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir curry paste until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir shrimp into paste and cook for 3 minutes. Transfer shrimp to a plate, scraping as much paste back into the skillet as possible. Pour coconut milk into the curry paste. Add leeks, onion, bamboo shoots, sugar, and fish sauce; bring to a boil. Add green beans, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, scallions, and jalapeno pepper and simmer until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Add shrimp and pineapple; cook and stir until shrimp are pink and cooked through, about 5 minutes more. Serve curry over cooked rice.
