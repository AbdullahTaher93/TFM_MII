Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet. In a large bowl, stir together the all purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, 2 tablespoons sugar and salt. Using a pastry blender or fork, cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles fine bread crumbs. Stir in eggs and cream to make a firm dough. Turn mixture onto a lightly floured surface and briefly knead until dough sticks together. Divide the dough into 8 or 10 pieces, and round out the edges. Place onto the prepared cookie sheet, brush with egg white and sprinkle with remaining sugar. Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown.
