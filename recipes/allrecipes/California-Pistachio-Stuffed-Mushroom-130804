Remove stems from mushroom caps; finely chop stems. Saute mushrooms stems and onion in 1/4 cup butter until tender. Add breadcrumbs, garlic, pistachios, parsley, marjoram and salt. Mix well. Spoon stuffing into mushroom caps. Place on a baking sheet; drizzle with remaining melted butter. Bake at 350 degrees F for 5 minutes, or until hot. Alternately, you may broil them 6 inches from heat for 5 minutes until browned and thoroughly heated.
