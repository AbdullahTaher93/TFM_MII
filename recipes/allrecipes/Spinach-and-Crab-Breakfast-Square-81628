Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a microwave safe bowl, place the block of spinach and zap until thawed. Drain the crab (put the juices in a bowl for your cat or dog!) and add the crab to the spinach. Drain the mushrooms and add to the spinach. Add the lemon pepper and half of the Parmesan cheese. Toss. Butter an 8x8 non-metallic baking dish on the bottom and the sides. Spread 1/2 of the spinach mixture over the bottom. Using your hands, flatten pieces of cream cheese then lay them on top of the spinach forming a uniform layer. Add the remaining spinach on top of the cream cheese. In the spinach bowl (now empty except for some little bits here and there that you want to keep) add the eggs, milk, extract and salt. Beat with a whisk until well blended. Pour into the baking dish. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top and garnish with a few sprinkles of paprika (more for the color than the taste). Bake for 35 minutes or just until the center rises slightly above the edges. Cut into 6 servings. Serve at once.
