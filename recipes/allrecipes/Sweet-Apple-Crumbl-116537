In a bowl, combine apples, water, lemon juice and cinnamon. Spoon into a 1-qt. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Dot with butter. For topping, combine the chocolate chips, brown sugar, oats, peanut butter, flour and cinnamon; crumble over apple mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until apples are tender. Serve warm with ice cream if desired.
