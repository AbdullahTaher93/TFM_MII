In a blender, pour the beef broth, soy sauce, olive oil, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce; add garlic, garlic powder, basil, parsley, and black pepper. Cover blender, and pulse a few times, then blend thoroughly, about 20 seconds. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat the vegetable oil until tiny wisps of smoke rise, then brown the roast on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Place the roast into a slow cooker. Pour the beef broth mixture from the blender over the roast, set the cooker to Medium, and cover. Cook until very tender, 5 to 6 hours; add the carrots, recover the cooker, and cook for 10 more minutes; then mix in the macaroni. Cover the cooker, and simmer until macaroni and carrots are tender, about 20 more minutes. Slice beef, and serve with macaroni, carrots, and sauce.
