Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners. Mix oat flour, whole wheat flour, oat bran, hot cereal, cinnamon, allspice, and baking powder together in a bowl. Combine yogurt, milk, egg whites, canola oil, honey, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Add yogurt mixture to flour mixture; stir to combine. Fold blueberries and pecans into batter. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake muffins in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
