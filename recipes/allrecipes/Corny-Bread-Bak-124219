Combine chicken, cheese, corn and chilies; place in greased shallow 2-1/2-qt. baking dish. In a mixing bowl, beat baking mix, egg yolks, milk and salt until smooth. In another mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form; fold into yolk mixture. Pour over chicken mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until browned and a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
