Stir together cheese, mayonnaise, mustard and cayenne in a small bowl. Spread over 6 of the bread slices. Top with the remaining bread to make sandwiches. Brush oil evenly over the bottom of a heavy, ovenproof cast-iron skillet. Heat the skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sandwiches in batches, and cook until the undersides are lightly toasted, about 1 minute. Turn and cook the other side, about 1 minute more. Slice in half diagonally. Serve warm.
