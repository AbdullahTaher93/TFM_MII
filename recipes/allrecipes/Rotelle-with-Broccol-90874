In a 5- to 6-quart pan, bring about 3 quarts water to a boil over high heat; stir in pasta and cook, uncovered, until just tender to bite (about 10 minutes). Or cook pasta according to package directions. Meanwhile, heat oil in a wide frying pan over medium-high heat. Add hot chili flakes, garlic, and broccoli; cook, stirring often, until broccoli starts to turn bright green (about 2 minutes). Add 1/4 cup water and bring to a boil; then reduce heat, cover, and simmer until broccoli is tender-crisp to bite (3 to 5 minutes). Remove from heat. Drain pasta well and pour into a large bowl. Add broccoli mixture, lemon peel, and ricotta cheese; using 2 spoons, mix lightly. Spoon onto a platter or individual plates and offer romano cheese to add to taste.
