Mix parsley, marjoram, thyme, sage, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Rub 1/2 teaspoon of the herb mixture over each pork chop. Store remaining herb mix in an airtight container for later use. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook pork chops in skillet until no longer pink in the center, 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
