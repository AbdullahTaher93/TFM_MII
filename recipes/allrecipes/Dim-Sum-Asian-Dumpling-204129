Combine pork, onion, cilantro, red pepper flakes, red curry paste, garam masala, chili powder, onion powder, and garlic powder in a bowl. Mix well, then set aside. Place flour into a separate bowl. Slowly stir in the water as needed until a soft dough is achieved. There may be some water left over. Roll out walnut-sized balls of dough into thin circles. Fill each of the wrappers with about 1 tablespoon of the pork mixture. Moisten the edges of the wrapper, then fold in half, sealing to create a half moon shape. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling. Place the dumplings in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water, and cover. Steam until the dough becomes glossy, about 10 minutes. To make sauce: Combine peanut butter, cayenne pepper, sugar, and vegetable oil in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl. Cook in the microwave on High for 30 seconds and stir. Serve with the dumplings.
