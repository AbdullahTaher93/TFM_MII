Unroll dough and separate into eight triangles; make four squares by pressing the seams of two triangles together and rolling into shape. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Spoon 1/4 cup pie filling in one corner of each square. Fold to make triangles; pinch to seal. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden. Mix sugar and milk; drizzle over turnover. Serve warm.
