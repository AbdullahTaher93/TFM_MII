Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Mix the lemon zest with the sugar in a small dish. Sift together the flour and salt in one bowl; in another, beat the eggs gently and whisk in the milk. Add the eggs and milk to the flour and salt a little at a time, whisking until smooth. Stir in half the lemon sugar. In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt the butter over medium heat, coating the bottom and halfway up the sides. When the butter is bubbling, add the fruit. Stir until each piece has softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining lemon sugar. When the sugar dissolves into a syrup--about 2 minutes--stir the batter and pour it carefully into the pan over the fruit. Put the skillet into the oven to bake until the clafouti is golden brown and is set and puffed up at the edges, about 20 minutes. Divide into four warmed bowls, sift a little confectioners' sugar over each, and top with sour cream, if you'd like.
