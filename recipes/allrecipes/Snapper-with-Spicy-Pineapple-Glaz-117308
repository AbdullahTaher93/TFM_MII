For glaze, in a small bowl, combine the preserves, vinegar, ginger, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and cayenne; set aside. Place fillets on a broiler pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Brush both sides of fillets with oil; sprinkle with remaining salt. Broil 4-6 in. from the heat for 5 minutes. Brush with half of the glaze. Broil 5-7 minutes longer or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Brush with remaining glaze.
