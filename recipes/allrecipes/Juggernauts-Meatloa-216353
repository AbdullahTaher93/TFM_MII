Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 2 9x5-inch loaf pans. In a large bowl, mix together the ground lamb, chicken, and pork until the 3 meats are thoroughly combined; mix in the egg, rolled oats, onion, green pepper, raisins, carrots, ketchup, hot pepper sauce, garlic, curry powder, oregano, and rosemary. Divide the mixture in half; form each half into a loaf, and place into the prepared loaf pans. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven; reduce heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) and bake 30 more minutes. Tilt the pans to allow grease to collect at a corner of the pan; pour off the grease. Allow the meat loaves to cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans. Cook until food is at least 160 degrees (71 degrees C), check with instant-read thermometer.
