Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners. In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, flaxseed, and salt. Whisk to mix. Add berries and stir to coat. In another bowl, combine milk, eggs, SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, oil, and almond extract. With a fork, beat until smooth. Pour egg mixture into berry mixture and gently mix with a fork to moisten the dry ingredients. Don't overmix (a few lumps in the batter are normal). Dollop 1/3 cup of batter into each of the prepared muffin cups. Bake for 20 to 24 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. Let stand for 5 minutes on a rack before serving.
