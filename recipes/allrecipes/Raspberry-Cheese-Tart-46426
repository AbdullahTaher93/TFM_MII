Crust: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In small bowl, mix together graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and margarine. Press about 1 tablespoon of the crust mixture into 10 muffin pan cups lined with paper liners. Set aside. Filling: In a small bowl, beat cream cheese until soft with an electric mixer on low speed, approximately 30 seconds. Add yogurt and beat on low speed until smooth, approximately 1 minute. Stir in 1 cup SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and egg substitute until well blended. Place 1 tablespoon of raspberries (4 to 5 berries) into each cup prior to adding filling. Divide filling evenly among muffin cups. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes or until firm. Chill in refrigerator for 2 hours before serving.
