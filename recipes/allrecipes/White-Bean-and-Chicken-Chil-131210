In a medium saucepan, heat oil on medium high. Add scallions (saving some greens for garnish) and garlic and saute until golden. Add chile powder and cumin. Saute for 1 minute. Add white beans, tomatoes, and broth. Simmer 15 minutes until liquid is slightly reduced. Stir in chicken and simmer 5 minutes more. Season with Tabasco and garnish with scallion greens. If desired, serve with baked tortilla chips (recipe no. 13) and low-fat sour cream.
