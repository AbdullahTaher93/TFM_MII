Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 13X9 pan with foil and spray with a non-stick cooking spray. Set aside. Combine flour, SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend, half of the SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, oats and walnuts. Cut in the margarine with a fork until the mixture is crumbly. Press all but one cup of the crust mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake for 15 minutes. Allow to cool. Beat cream cheese, eggs, the remaining half of the SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, the pumpkin and the pumpkin pie spice until it is well blended. Pour the cream cheese mixture over the pre-baked crust and sprinkle with the 1 cup of remaining crust and the chocolate chips. Bake for 25 minutes or until set. Lift from pan to cool. Cut into 24 bars.
