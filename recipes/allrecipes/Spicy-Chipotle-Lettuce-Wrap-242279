Blend tomato sauce, water, chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, chili powder, oregano, and 1 teaspoon sea salt together in a blender until sauce is smooth. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium heat; cook and stir onions, green bell peppers, and a pinch salt until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add ground beef and increase heat to medium-high; cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Mix garlic and sauce into ground beef mixture; cook and stir until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir kidney beans and black beans into into ground beef sauce and simmer, stirring occasionally, until filling flavors have blended, about 20 minutes. Spoon filling into lettuce leaves.
