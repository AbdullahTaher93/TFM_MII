Gently fit pastry into a 9-inch pie pan. Fold excess pastry under and flush with pan rim. Pinch pastry rim to flute decoratively. Prick dough all over with a fork. Bake in a 375 degree oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Let cool at least 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a microwave-safe bowl, combine chocolate chips and whipping cream. Heat in a microwave oven at 50% power, stirring every 30 seconds, until chocolate is soft, about 1 minute total. Stir until mixture is smooth; pour into crust, covering the bottom evenly. Rinse bowl, wipe dry, and add brown sugar and butter (cut into chunks). Heat in a microwave oven at full power (100%), stirring every 30 seconds until butter melts and sugar dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes total. Let mixture cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Add milk and peanut butter to bowl. Beat with a mixer on medium speed to blend well. Add whipped topping, stir to mix, then beat until well blended, scraping bowl often. Scrape peanut butter mixture evenly over chocolate in crust. Cover and chill at least 2 hours or up to 2 days. Cut into wedges.
