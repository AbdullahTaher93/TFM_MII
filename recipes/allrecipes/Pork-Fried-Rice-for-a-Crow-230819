Heat peanut oil in an industrial-sized skillet over medium-high heat until hot, but not smoking. Add eggs to hot oil; cook and stir vigorously until eggs are cooked yet slightly wet, about 5 minutes. Stir rice into the scrambled eggs, breaking into individual grains; cook and stir until hot, about 5 minutes. Mix peas, ham, and green onion into the rice; cook and stir until hot, about 10 minutes. Pour soy sauce over the rice mixture; stir to coat rice with sauce.
