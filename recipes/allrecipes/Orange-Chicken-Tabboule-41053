In a medium mixing bowl pour boiling water over bulgur. Let stand 30 minutes. Drain off excess liquid. Meanwhile, finely shred enough peel from oranges to make 2 teaspoons peel. Peel and section oranges over a bowl to catch juice. Cover and chill orange sections until serving time. Measure and reserve 1/4 cup orange juice. In a large mixing bowl stir together drained bulgur, orange peel, orange juice, chicken, cucumber, parsley, green onion, mint, oil, and salt. Cover and chill 4 to 24 hours, stirring occasionally. Just before serving, fold in orange sections. Serve on lettuce-lined plates.
