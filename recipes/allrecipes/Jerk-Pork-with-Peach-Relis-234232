Drain canned peaches, reserving 1/3 cup of the syrup. Combine reserved syrup, onion, thyme, vinegar, garlic, 1 tablespoon of the ginger, the soy sauce, jerk seasoning and ground habanero pepper in a blender. Blend until smooth. Transfer to a large resealable plastic bag set in a shallow dish. Add pork tenderloins; seal bag. Turn tenderloins to coat. Chill for 4 to 24 hours, turning bag occasionally. Meanwhile, for the Peach Relish, chop the drained peach slices. Combine chopped peaches, the remaining 1 teaspoon ginger, the red onion, lime zest and lime juice in a medium bowl. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Cover and chill up to 24 hours. For a charcoal grill, arrange hot coals around a drip pan. Test for medium-high heat above pan. Remove pork from marinade; lightly sprinkle with additional salt and black pepper. Place on grill rack over drip pan. Grill, covered, for 25 to 30 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers 145 degrees F. (For a gas grill, preheat grill. Reduce heat to medium-high. Adjust for indirect grilling. Grill as above.) Remove meat from grill; cover with foil and let stand for 10 minutes. Slice and serve with Peach Relish. If desired, top with additional thyme.
