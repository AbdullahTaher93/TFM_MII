Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a skillet, heat the oil and brown the pork chops. Place the pork chops in a baking dish. In a bowl, toss the bread cubes, melted butter, chicken broth, celery, onion, and poultry seasoning together. Put heaping mounds of the bread crumb mixture onto the pork chops. Combine the cream of mushroom soup with the water, and pour this mixture over the stuffing and pork chops. Cover and bake for 30 minutes. Uncover and continue baking for 10 minutes longer or until juices run clear. The meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
