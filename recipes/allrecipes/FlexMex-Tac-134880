In a large skillet, cook the beef, onion, and garlic until the beef is brown. Drain the fat. Stir in the beans, chili pepper, and chili powder, and cook until hot. Remove from heat. Warm the tortillas in the microwave for 20 seconds, then fill each tortilla with half of the meat mixture. Top and eat.
