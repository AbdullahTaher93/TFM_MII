Chop the cucumber in a food processor until nearly liquefied; strain through a piece of cheesecloth to remove excess moisture, being careful to not over-drain and lose too much of the fresh flavor. Mix the cucumber, yogurt, garlic, sour cream, and mayonnaise together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper.
