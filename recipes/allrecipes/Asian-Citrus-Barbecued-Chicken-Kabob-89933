Heat grill. Alternately thread chicken, pineapple and bell peppers on four 10 to 12-inch metal skewers. In small bowl, combine barbecue sauce and ginger orange sauce; mix well. When ready to grill, place kabobs on gas grill over medium heat or on charcoal grill 4 to 6 inches from medium coals. Brush kabobs with sauce. Cook 11 to 13 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink in center, turning frequently and brushing with sauce. Discard any remaining sauce.
