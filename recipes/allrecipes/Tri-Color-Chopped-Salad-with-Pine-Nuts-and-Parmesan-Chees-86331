For the vinaigrette: Whisk together the mustard, red wine vinegar and chopped oregano in a small bowl. Whisk in the olive oil until the consistency is smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside. Toss together the radicchio, Belgian endive, arugula, grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and pine nuts in a large salad bowl. Pour the vinaigrette over the salad ingredients and toss lightly to coat. Divide onto four chilled salad plates and serve.
