In a medium bowl, stir together the chili garlic sauce, hot sauce and sweetener. Set aside. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the drumsticks, and cook until browned on the outside, turning as needed. Reduce heat to medium-low, and spoon sauce over the chicken to coat. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken has cooked through and sauce is thick and sticky, about 20 minutes.
