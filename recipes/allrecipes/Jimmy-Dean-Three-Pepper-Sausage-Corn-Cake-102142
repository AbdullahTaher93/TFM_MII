In a large skillet, cook sausage over medium-high heat, stirring frequently until thoroughly cooked and no longer pink. Remove from heat, stir in frozen corn; set aside to cool. In a large mixing bowl, combine beaten eggs, 6 tablespoons of the melted butter, water, black pepper, red pepper, jalapeno pepper, green onion and optional cilantro; stir well. Stir in sausage-corn mixture; add cornmeal mix and stir well. Spray or lightly oil a large skillet or griddle with vegetable oil. Add 2-3 teaspoons of remaining butter and heat skillet to medium. Griddle is ready when small drops of water sizzle and disappear almost immediately. For each corn cake, spoon 1 rounded tablespoon of batter onto skillet. Cakes may be flattened slightly or left about 3/4 to 1 inch thick. Cook 2-1/2 to 3 minutes on first side; turn and cook 2 minutes more, or until golden brown on both sides. Use remaining butter as needed to grease skillet. Serve warm; garnish each cake with 1 teaspoon sour cream and chili sauce or salsa if desired.
