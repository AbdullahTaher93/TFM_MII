In a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat, heat oil with curry powder and cumin until aromatic. Stir in eggplant, jalapenos, potatoes, tomatoes, salt, chili powder and turmeric. Cover and cook 30 to 45 minutes, adding water if necessary to maintain a stew-like consistency. Sprinkle with cilantro before serving.
