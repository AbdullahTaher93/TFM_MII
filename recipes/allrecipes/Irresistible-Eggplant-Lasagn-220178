Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cook and stir olive oil and eggplant in a skillet over medium-high heat until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add water if needed to prevent burning. Set aside. Season ground turkey with Creole seasoning; cook and stir in a pot over medium heat until browned, about 10 minutes. Stir garlic, crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, crushed red pepper, and mixed vegetables into ground turkey; simmer 10 minutes. Combine Mozzarella cheese, Provolone cheese, and Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Combine ricotta cheese, egg whites, milk and Italian seasoning in a separate bowl. Pour half of tomato sauce into a 13x9 baking dish. Layer half of eggplant on top of sauce layer. Spoon half of ricotta mixture on top of eggplant. Sprinkle half of Mozzarella mixture on top of ricotta mixture. Repeat layering process with the remaining ingredients. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil and place pan on baking sheet in case of drips. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove cover; bake another 15 minutes, until cheese is browned and bubbly.
