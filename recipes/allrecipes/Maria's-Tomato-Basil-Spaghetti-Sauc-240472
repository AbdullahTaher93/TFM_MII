Puree tomatoes in a food processor until smooth; strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Heat olive oil in a large, deep pot over medium heat. Stir strained tomatoes, onion, Parmesan cheese, basil, garlic, and red wine together in the pot with the oil; season with salt and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until thickened, about 25 minutes.
