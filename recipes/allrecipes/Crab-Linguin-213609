Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the linguine, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Bring water, onion, butter, chicken bouillon granules, lemon juice, garlic powder, parsley, oregano, and pepper to a boil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to simmer until the liquid is reduced, about 10 minutes, then add the imitation crabmeat, and cook for 2 more minutes. Stir in the whipping cream and Swiss cheese until combined. Serve cream sauce over prepared pasta.
