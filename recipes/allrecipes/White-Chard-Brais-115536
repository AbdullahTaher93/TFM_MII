Place porcini in a medium bowl. Pour boiling water over them and let soak until softened, about 30 minutes. Separate chard leaves from stems; cut leaves crosswise into 1-inch strips and stems into 1-inch lengths. Drain the porcini in a fine sieve lined with paper towel over a 2-cup measure. Add water to the soaking liquid if necessary to measure 1 1/2 cups total. Rinse the porcini under cool running water. Squeeze out any excess water and coarsely chop. Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add white mushrooms and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Add garlic, the chard stems and leaves, reserved liquid and chopped porcini; stir to combine. Cover and cook until the chard stems are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Uncover, increase heat to high and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is reduced by half, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
