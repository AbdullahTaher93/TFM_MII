Season chicken thighs with garlic, black pepper, cumin, and oregano. Heat oil in a deep saucepan over medium-high heat; cook seasoned chicken until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. Combine beer, tomato, red onion, and cilantro in a blender; blend until a smooth sauce forms. Pour sauce over chicken and reduce heat to low; simmer until chicken is very tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
