Mix water, soy sauce, sweet rice wine (found in the Asian foods aisle) or sake, sugar, minced or pressed garlic cloves, and hot chili flakes. Place meat in a plastic food bag (choose small cuts like pork chops, chicken breasts, or turkey breast slices), pour in brine to cover, then seal and chill 6 to 12 hours. Discard used brine; cook meat as desired.
