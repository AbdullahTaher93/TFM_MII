Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a cast iron skillet. Mix together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Set aside. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and oil. Stir in the cottage cheese, onion, and zucchini. Make a well in the dry ingredients and slowly pour in the wet ingredients. Mix until just combined. Pour into the skillet. Bake until lightly browned and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes.
