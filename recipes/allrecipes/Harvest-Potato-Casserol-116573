Place potatoes and bay leaves in a Dutch oven or large kettle; cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 25-30 minutes or until tender. Remove from the heat; cool to room temperature. Place in the freezer (still covered by the cooking water) for 1 hour. Drain potatoes; peel and grate. Place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Drizzle with butter. Sprinkle with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Combine the sour cream, soup, 1 cup cheese, pimientos and onion; spread over potatoes. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese; top with cornflakes (dish will be full). Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until bubbly.
