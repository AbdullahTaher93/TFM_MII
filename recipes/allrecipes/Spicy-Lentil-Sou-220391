Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in carrot and celery; cook, stirring often, until vegetables are tender, about 8 more minutes. Stir in tomato paste, crushed red pepper, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper; mix in chicken stock and lentils. Bring soup to a boil and reduce heat to low; simmer until lentils are soft, about 20 minutes.
