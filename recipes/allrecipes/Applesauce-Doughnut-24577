In a separate bowl, stir together flour baking powder, salt, baking soda, mace and cinnamon. Stir flour mixture into the egg mixture alternately with the buttermilk. Mix until a stiff dough is formed. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 3/4 to 1 inch thick sheet. Make sure to roll the dough to an even thickness.
