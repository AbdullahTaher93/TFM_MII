Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of waxed paper. Pound lightly with the smooth side of a meat mallet. Cut a pocket into each chicken breast. Rub 2 garlic cloves over chicken breast. Season chicken inside and out with salt, pepper, thyme, basil, and parsley. Stuff pockets with spinach, fontana cheese, and prosciutto. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Beat 2 eggs in a bowl. Pour bread crumbs into a shallow bowl. Dip stuffed chicken into eggs. Dredge in bread crumbs until coated. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook breaded chicken until browned, about 6 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a baking sheet. Sprinkle Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese over chicken; drizzle remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil on top. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 10 to 20 minutes. Cook and stir 2 garlic cloves in the same skillet used to brown chicken for 1 to 2 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes. Pour in Marsala wine; simmer until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken stock. Stir butter and flour into the skillet until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Serve sauce over chicken.
