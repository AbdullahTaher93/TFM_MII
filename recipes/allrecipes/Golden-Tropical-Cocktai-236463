Divide ice cubes between 2 martini glasses to chill the glasses while you make the cocktail. Muddle pineapple chunks in the bottom of a cocktail shaker; add orange juice, spiced rum, coconut-flavored rum, banana liqueur, and lime juice. Dump ice cubes from chilled glasses into the shaker. Secure lid onto shaker and shake vigorously. Strain cocktail into the glasses.
