Place tortillas on lightly greased grill rack. Grill over medium heat for 2 to 4 minutes or until tortillas begin to brown, turning once. (Or, place tortillas on baking sheet. Bake at 425 degrees F for 5 to 8 minutes or until crisp, turning once.) Meanwhile, in large nonstick skillet heat 1 teaspoon of oil. Add corn and cumin. Cook, stirring occasionally, over medium-high heat for 5 to 6 minutes or until corn begins to brown. Stir in Chik'n Strips and remaining oil. Cook and stir for 1 to 2 minutes more or until heated through. Spread beans on tortillas. Top with lettuce and tomato. Spoon warm corn mixture on top. Serve with salsa and sour cream.
