Cook fettuccini in a large pot of boiling salted water until "almost" done. Drain, and return noodles to pot. Stir cream, butter or margarine, tomato sauce, garlic, and broccoli into the noodles. Simmer until noodles are done. Stir in sliced mushrooms, and remove from heat. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
