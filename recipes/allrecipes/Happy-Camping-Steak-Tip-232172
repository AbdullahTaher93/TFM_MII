Mix ketchup, cola, and Italian salad dressing in a large bowl. Coat beef tips with the mixture and marinate in refrigerator for at least 12 hours, stirring occasionally. Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Drain beef tips, discarding used marinade. Grill beef tips on the preheated grill until browned and slightly pink inside, 5 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest piece should read at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C).
