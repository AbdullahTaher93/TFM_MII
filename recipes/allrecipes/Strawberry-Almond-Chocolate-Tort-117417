Place egg whites in a large mixing bowl; let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Coat the bottom of three 9-in. baking pans with nonstick cooking spray; line with waxed paper. Spray the paper with nonstick cooking spray and dust with flour; set aside. Sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt together three times. Beat egg whites on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in sugar, about 2 tablespoons at a time, on high until stiff glossy peaks form and sugar is dissolved. Combine coffee and extracts. Fold dry ingredients into egg mixture alternately with coffee mixture. Spread into prepared pans. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. Gently peel off waxed paper. Cool completely. In a bowl, gently mash the strawberries; stir in almond extract. Fold in whipped topping. Place one cake layer on a serving platter; top with half of the filling. Repeat layers. Top with remaining cake layer. In a small mixing bowl, beat cream until it begins to thicken. Combine confectioners' sugar and cocoa; add to cream. Beat until stiff peaks form. Frost top of cake. Garnish with almonds and strawberries. Chill for at least 1 hour before cutting. Refrigerate leftovers.
