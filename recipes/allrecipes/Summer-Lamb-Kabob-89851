Place lamb in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, stir together mustard, vinegar, olive oil, salt, pepper, rosemary, sage, and garlic. Pour over lamb, and mix to coat meat. Cover, and refrigerate overnight. Preheat outdoor grill for direct heat. Add marinated lamb, fruit, and vegetables to stainless steel or bamboo skewers. Reserve some of the juice from pineapple chunks and cherries. In a small bowl, stir together melted butter and splashes of juice from the pineapples and cherries to create a basting sauce. Place skewers on preheated grill, and cook about 12 minutes, turning and brushing with butter sauce.
