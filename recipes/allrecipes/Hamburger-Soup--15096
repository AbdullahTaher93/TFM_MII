In a large skillet over medium high heat, saute the ground beef for about 5 minutes, or until brown and crumbly. In a large soup pot over high heat, combine the ground beef, cabbage, celery, tomatoes, corn, mushrooms, water, barley, parsley and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium low. Simmer for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Add the carrots and potatoes and continue to simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the vegetables are done to your liking. Serve with a warm loaf of bread and enjoy!
