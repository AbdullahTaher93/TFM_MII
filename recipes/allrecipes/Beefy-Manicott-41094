Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Place ground beef, onion and garlic in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until beef is evenly brown. Remove from heat. Mix in bread crumbs, Italian seasoning, egg and 1 cup shredded cheese. Spoon filling into manicotti shells. Combine tomato sauce, stewed tomatoes, wine and mushrooms. Spoon sauce to cover the bottom of an 8x11 inch baking dish. Arrange filled manicotti in a single layer, and cover with remaining sauce. Sprinkle top with remaining cheese. Cover, and bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove cover, and bake 10 minutes.
