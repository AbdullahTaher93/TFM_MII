Pour 3 tablespoons of the oil into a 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium high heat. When oil is hot, add potatoes and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on most sides, 10 to 15 minutes. While potatoes brown, cut spinach leaves crosswise into 1/2 inch strips. Wash spinach and drain well; set aside. Reduce heat to low; add garlic, coriander, ginger, and remaining tablespoon of oil to potatoes. Cook, stirring often, until very fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in 1/2 cup water, cover pan tightly, and simmer until potatoes are tender when pierced, about 8 minutes. Uncover pan and add spinach to pan. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring, until spinach is wilted and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt.
