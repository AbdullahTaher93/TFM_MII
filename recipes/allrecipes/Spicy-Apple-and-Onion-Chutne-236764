Heat a skillet over medium-low heat; add butter and raise heat to medium. Cook and stir onion in the melted butter until transparent and lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Add garlic and sea salt to onion mixture; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir apples and jalapeno peppers into onion mixture; cover skillet with a lid. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until apples are softened and transparent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add honey and simmer for 2 more minutes.
