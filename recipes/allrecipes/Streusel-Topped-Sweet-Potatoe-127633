Bring sweet potatoes and 1 cup water to boiling in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cover; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 15 minutes or until sweet potatoes are tender. Meanwhile, in small skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Stir in cookie crumbs and pecans. Cook, stirring constantly, 5 minutes or until toasted. Remove from heat. Drain sweet potatoes. Gently toss with remaining butter. Pour into serving bowl and sprinkle with crumb mixture.
