Remove from the heat. Gradually stir 1 cup into egg yolks; return all to saucepan. Bring to boil. Cook and stir for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in the butter, lemon juice and peel until smooth. Pour into pastry shell. In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites and salt until stiff but not dry peaks form. Gradually beat in sugar until soft peaks form. Spread over pie, sealing edges to pastry. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until meringue is golden. Cool.
