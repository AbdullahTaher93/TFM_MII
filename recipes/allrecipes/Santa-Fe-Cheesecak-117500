Combine tortilla chips and butter; press onto the bottom of a greased 9-in. springform pan. Place on a baking sheet. Bake at 325 degrees F for 15 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and eggs on low speed just until combined. Stir in Monterey Jack cheese and chilies; pour over crust. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until center is almost set. Place pan on a wire rack. Spread sour cream over cheesecake. Carefully run a knife around edge of pan to loosen; cool for 1 hour. Refrigerate overnight. Remove sides of pan just before serving. Garnish with yellow pepper, onions and tomato. Refrigerate leftovers.
