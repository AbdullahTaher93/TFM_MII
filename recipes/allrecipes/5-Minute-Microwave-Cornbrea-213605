Mix the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, salt, egg, milk, and vegetable oil in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl. Heat in the microwave on high, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 3 minutes, rotating the bowl halfway through cooking if the microwave does not have a rotating tray.
