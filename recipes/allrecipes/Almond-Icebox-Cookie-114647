In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugars. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine flour, cinnamon and baking soda; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Fold in chopped almonds. Shape into two 15-in. rolls; wrap each in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight. Unwrap and cut into 1/4-in. slices. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets; top each with a whole almond. Bake at 375 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until edges begin to brown. Remove to wire racks to cool.
