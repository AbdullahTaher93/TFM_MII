In a small bowl, combine cream cheese, granulated sugar, egg whites, sour cream, 1 tablespoon of the flour, and 1 teaspoon of the vanilla. Beat until smooth; set aside. In another small bowl, stir together the remaining 11/4 cups flour, baking powder, and walnuts; set aside. In a large bowl, combine syrup, brown sugar, butter, egg, and the remaining 2 teaspoons vanilla. Beat until smooth. Add flour mixture; beat until dry ingredients are evenly moistened. Pour two-thirds of the brownie batter into a lightly oiled 8-inch-square nonstick or regular baking pan; spread to make level. Pour cheese mixture from Step 1 evenly over batter. Drop remaining batter by spoonfuls over cheese mixture; swirl with a knife to blend batter slightly with cheese mixture. Bake in a 350 degrees F oven until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean (about 25 minutes; pierce brownie, not cheese mixture). Let cool in pan on a rack, then cut into 2-inch squares.
