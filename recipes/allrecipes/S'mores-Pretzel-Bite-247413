Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place a heaping teaspoon of marshmallow cream off center on Snack Factory(R) Pretzel Crisp(R). Place on prepared sheet. Freeze for at least 15 minutes. Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes. Line a work surface with waxed paper. Dip marshmallow-covered half of pretzels in melted chocolate about halfway up. Place on waxed paper and immediately sprinkle with graham cracker crumbs. Allow chocolate to harden before removing bites from waxed paper, about 5 minutes.
