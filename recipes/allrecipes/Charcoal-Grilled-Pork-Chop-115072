Dissolve salt and sugar in 3 quarts cold water in 2-gallon zipper-lock plastic bag. Add chops and seal bag, pressing out as much air as possible. (Alternatively, divide brine and chops evenly between two 1-gallon zipper-lock bags.) Refrigerate, turning bag once, until fully seasoned, about 1 hour. Remove chops from brine and dry thoroughly with paper towels. Coat chops with spice rub or season generously with pepper. Ignite large chimney starter filled with hardwood charcoal (about 2 1/2 pounds) and burn until charcoal is covered with layer of fine gray ash. Build a two-level fire by stacking most of coals on one side of grill and arranging remaining coals in single layer on other side. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill with lid, and let grate heat up, about 5 minutes. Use wire brush to scrape cooking grate clean. Cook chops, uncovered, over hotter part of grill until browned on each side, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes per side. Move chops to cooler part of grill and cover with disposable aluminum roasting pan. Continue grilling, turning once, until instant-read thermometer inserted through side of chop and away from bone registers 135 degrees F, 7 to 9 minutes longer. Transfer chops to platter; cover with foil pan, and let rest 5 minutes. Internal temperature should rise to 145 degrees F. Serve immediately.
