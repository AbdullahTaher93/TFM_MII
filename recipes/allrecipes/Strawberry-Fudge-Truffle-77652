In a small saucepan, melt chocolate over low heat. Put almonds in a small bowl. In a medium mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth and creamy. Add melted chocolate, beating until smooth. Stir in vanilla wafer crumbs and preserves, mixing well. Cover and chill mixture for 1 hour. Remove from refrigerator and shape mixture into 1-inch balls or ''truffles.'' Roll each truffle in almonds; chill truffles until serving time
