Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the fettuccini at a boil until cooked through yet slightly firm, about 6 minutes; drain. Season the scallops salt. Heat olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat and cook the scallops until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer scallops to a plate. Pour the clam juice into the skillet. Whisk together the low-fat milk, flour, white pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon salt until the mixture is smooth; whisk into the clam juice. Reduce heat to low and bring the sauce to a simmer, whisking constantly. Cook until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Return the scallops and any accumulated juices to the skillet and stir in the peas until thoroughly combined. Return to a simmer. Gently mix the cooked fettuccine, 1/2 cup of Romano cheese, chives, lemon zest, and lemon juice into the scallops and sauce. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup of Romano cheese to serve.
