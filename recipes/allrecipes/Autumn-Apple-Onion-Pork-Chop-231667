Combine onion, apple, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon vinegar, thyme, and rosemary in a skillet; cook and stir mixture over medium heat until onion is lightly browned and apples are softened, about 15 minutes. Sweeten with brown sugar to taste. Set aside and keep warm. Arrange pork chops in a separate skillet; season with salt, pepper, and paprika. Drizzle 1 tablespoon vinegar and 1 tablespoon olive oil over pork chops. Cook pork chops over medium heat until no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Transfer pork chops to a serving dish and top with apple-onion topping. Serve immediately.
