Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water. Mix mayonnaise, lemon pepper seasoning, and dried mustard together in a large bowl. Mix in cherry tomatoes, peas, and chicken. Fold in rotini. Sprinkle paprika over salad before serving.
