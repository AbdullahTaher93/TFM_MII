Remove drippings from roasting pan to medium saucepan and straddle roasting pan across two burners. Heat pan on high and add shallots, sage, and wine. Bring pan contents to a boil, stirring to loosen cooked-on bits. Continue stirring and reduce by about half. Remove from heat and add to saucepan with drippings. Skim off as much of the fat as possible and return to a light boil. Stir together chicken stock with cornstarch or arrowroot to make a thin paste. Reduce heat to simmer and whisk cornstarch mixture into saucepan. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally and season with salt, pepper and walnut oil - 1 teaspoon at a time, to taste. Serve with turkey.
