In a medium bowl, stir together cream cheese, goat cheese, and horseradish cheddar. The mixture will be stiff and can be mixed with an electric mixer, if preferred. On a sheet of foil, roll the cheese mixture into a log about 1 1/2 in. by 10 in. long. Close foil and refrigerate for 1 hour or longer. Toss pistachios together to mix evenly. Spread mixture into a rectangle about 10 in. long on a clean sheet of foil. Put log on top and roll to coat all sides completely. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until serving. Serve with crackers.
