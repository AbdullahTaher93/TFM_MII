In a baking dish, combine the soy sauce, garlic, ginger and hot sauce. Stir in 1/2 cup of water. Add the chicken thighs and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour, turning a few times. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bring the chicken to room temperature. Discard half of the marinade. Bake the chicken for 40 minutes, basting a few times. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large, nonstick skillet. Add the shiitake, salt and pepper; cook over moderately high heat for 4 minutes. Add the scallions and cook over moderate heat for 5 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and walnut oil and serve with the chicken.
