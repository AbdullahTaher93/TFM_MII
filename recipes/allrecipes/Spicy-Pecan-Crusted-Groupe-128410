In a 9 inch X 9 inch (23 cm x 23 cm) glass baking dish, combine the scallions, teriyaki sauce, garlic, and ginger. Place the grouper in the marinade and turn to coat both sides. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. In a pie plate, combine the bread crumbs, cereal flakes, pecans, and pepper. Remove the group from the marinade; discard the marinade. Press each fillet into the crumb mixture to coat all sides. Coat a large nonstick skillet with nonstick spray and place over medium-high heat until hot. Add the grouper and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until golden brown on the bottom. Mist the top of the fillets with nonstick spray, then flip and cook for 3 to 4 minutes more, or until the grouper flakes easily when tested with a fork. Sprinkle with the basil.
