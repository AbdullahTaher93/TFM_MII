Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray one side of a sheet of aluminum foil large enough to fold over all the salmon with cooking spray. Arrange salmon on the prepared side of the foil. Sprinkle with sage, thyme, paprika, and pepper. Fold foil over salmon to enclose. Bake salmon 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until easily flaked with a fork.
