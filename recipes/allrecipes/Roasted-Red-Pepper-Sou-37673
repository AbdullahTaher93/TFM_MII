Place roasted red peppers in a blender or food processor, and blend until smooth. In a large saucepan, mix roasted red peppers, chicken broth, and mushrooms. Season with basil, oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil. Stir in tortellini, and continue cooking 8 to 10 minutes, or until pasta is al dente.
