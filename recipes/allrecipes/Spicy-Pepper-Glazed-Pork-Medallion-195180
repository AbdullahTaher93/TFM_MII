Season pork with cumin and garlic pepper. Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork and cook until nicely browned on both sides, about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in Worcestershire, jelly, orange juice and mustard. Cook, turning often, until pork is well glazed. To serve, spoon small amount of sauce onto serving plate. Place pork medallions on top. Spoon remaining sauce over pork. Garnish with orange slices and parsley, if desired.
