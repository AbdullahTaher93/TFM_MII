Dissolve bouillon in boiling water. Cut spaghetti noodles in half and add to boiling water until done. Over medium heat empty can of corned beef onto a skillet. Add spaghetti sauce to meat. Stir until heated; corned beef will come apart and a thick sauce will form. If desired, add Italian seasoning, garlic powder, dry onion, or any other spices. Once noodles are done, drain and combine with corned beef sauce.
