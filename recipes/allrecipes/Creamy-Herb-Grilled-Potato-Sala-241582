Whisk sour cream with mixed herbs, vinegar, honey, mustard, salt and pepper until combined; set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil; add potatoes and cook for 12 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold running water. Preheat grill to medium; grease well. Toss potatoes with melted Spreadables butter. Spread out evenly on the grill and cook, turning often, for 15 minutes or until well marked and fork tender. Transfer potatoes to a bowl and toss with dressing, celery, peas and radishes. Salad can be served warm or reserved for up to 24 hours in the refrigerator.
