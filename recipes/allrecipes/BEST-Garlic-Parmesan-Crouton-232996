Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Put cubes in a large bowl and season generously with creole seasoning. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir Parmesan cheese, garlic, and onion powder into the melted butter; pour over the bread cubes and toss to coat. Spread bread cubes onto a large baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes, stir, and continue baking until golden brown and crispy, about 10 minutes more.
