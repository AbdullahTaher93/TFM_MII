Whisk together the mayonnaise, milk, white vinegar, and white sugar in a large bowl; add the cabbage and toss to coat. Chill in refrigerator at least 1 hour. Heat oil in deep-fryer or large deep pan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C); add the potato slices; cook until crispy and golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Place a large skillet over medium heat. Arrange the capicola in four separate stacks in the skillet and top each stack with 1 slice mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, and Swiss cheese; heat until the cheese begins to melt. Arrange 4 slices of Italian bread on 4 separate plates. Top each slice with a stack of capicola and melted cheese; about 1 1/2 cups of the cabbage mixture, 1 slice onion, 1 slice tomato, and about 1/4 of the fried potatoes. Top with the remaining bread slices. Cut each sandwich in half to serve.
