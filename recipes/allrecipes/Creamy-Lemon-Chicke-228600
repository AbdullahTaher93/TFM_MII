Pound chicken breasts smooth side down, gently between pieces of plastic wrap, with flat side of meat mallet until 1/2 inch thick. In small shallow dish, mix flour, 1 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper; dip each chicken breast into flour mixture, coating all sides. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken breasts in oil 6 to 8 minutes, turning once, until brown. In small bowl, mix cooking sauce and lemon juice. Pour sauce mixture over chicken. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer 5 to 10 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink in center. Sprinkle with parsley and lemon peel. Serve with rice.
