In a bowl, stir together ketchup, mustard, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and maple syrup. Stir in garlic and onion powder. Place chicken in a large resealable freezer bag. Pour in marinade, seal, and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Remove chicken from bag, and reserve marinade. Cut the chicken into thin slices. Warm oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in onions, bell pepper, and chicken. Cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to medium, and stir in reserved marinade. Cook about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
