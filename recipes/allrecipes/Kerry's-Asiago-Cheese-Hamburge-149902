Mix the beef, Worcestershire sauce, buffalo wing sauce, pepper, salt, and garlic powder in a large bowl. Form mixture into four patties. Place the patties on a plate; cover. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the onion in the olive oil until translucent, about 5 minutes; set aside. Cook the beef patties on the preheated grill on one side for about 5 minutes; brush the top of each burger with 1 tablespoon of barbeque sauce; flip. Cook burgers until well done, or the internal temperature reaches 180 degrees F (85 degrees C), about five minutes more. Place one burger on the bottom half of each bun. Top each burger with cooked onions, ketchup, Asiago cheese, and bacon slices; sandwich with top of bun and serve.
