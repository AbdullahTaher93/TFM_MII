Place salmon fillets in a zip-lock baggie and add the teriyaki sauce. Turn to cover. Marinate for 15 minutes. Pour off marinade and discard. Prepare your grill and preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Have an oven-proof platter ready. Over a hot grill, cook the salmon for 3 minutes on each side (start with the skin side up). Transfer the fish to a platter, cover and place in the oven and cook for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the mango sauce. Slice mango on either side of it's large seed. Cut into strips. Then with a thin knife, slice off the skin by having each strip skin side down on a cutting board and running the knife horizontally as close to the skin as you can. Be sure to cut off as much of the flesh around the edge of the seed too. Dice into cubes about the size of a grape. Set aside about 2/3 cups (save the rest for some other recipe). Mix the yogurt with the 2 tsp of Teriyaki sauce and stir in the diced mangos. Serve with the sauce poured over the fish and garnish with the minced mint.
