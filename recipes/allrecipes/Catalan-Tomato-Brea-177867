Slice loaf horizontally. Place halves, cut-side down, on a barbecue grill over medium-hot coals (you can hold your hand at grill level 3 to 4 seconds) or on medium heat on a gas grill just until golden brown, 30 to 90 seconds. Watch carefully to prevent burning. Rub toasted surfaces of bread with cut sides of garlic cloves. Drizzle bread generously with olive oil. Slice tomatoes in half horizontally and rub cut sides of tomato over toasted surface of bread, squeezing tomato halves to get as much pulp and juice as possible. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Slice into wedges; serve.
