In a saucepan over medium heat, mix the soy sauce, water, brown sugar, honey, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and cool. Place the pork chops in a large, resealable plastic bag. Pour the soy sauce mixture into the bag, seal, and marinate in the refrigerator for 3 to 6 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Drain the pork chops, and discard remaining marinade. Arrange the pork chops in a baking dish, cover, and bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven. In a bowl, blend the ketchup, cocktail sauce, brown sugar, water, and mustard. Pour over the pork chops, and continue baking 30 minutes, to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
