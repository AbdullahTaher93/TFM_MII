Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Whisk ricotta, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons pumpkin puree, sugar, eggs, and vanilla together in a separate mixing bowl until smooth. Pour mixture into dry ingredients. Mix together until mixture becomes a loose batter. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Use one spoon to scoop out a heaping tablespoon of dough and a second spoon to carefully push dough into hot oil. Fry in batches for about 1 minute. If zeppole don't turn over by themselves after 1 minute, gently turn each with a strainer to brown on the other side, about 1 more minute. Remove with a strainer and drain on cooling rack.
