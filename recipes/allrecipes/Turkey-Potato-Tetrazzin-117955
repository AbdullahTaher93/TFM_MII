In a bowl, combine Alfredo sauce and milk; spread 1/4 cup into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Top with a third of the potatoes; sprinkle with 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese. In a bowl, combine the turkey, 1-1/2 cups Swiss cheese and broccoli; spoon about 2 cups over potatoes. Top with about 2/3 cup sauce mixture. Repeat layers twice. Cover and bake at 400 degrees F for 45 minutes. Top with remaining cheeses (dish will be full). Bake, uncovered, 20-25 minutes longer or until potatoes are tender. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
