Wash and dry the chicken breasts and trim off fat. Cut the breasts diagonally into strips the size of your index finger. Place these strips in a bowl and stir in the buttermilk and 2 to 3 tablespoons of the hot sauce. Marinate for 30 minutes. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F. Place the flour in a shallow bowl, the egg whites in a second bowl, and the cracker crumbs in a third bowl or plate. Stir the paprika, peppers, garlic powder, salt, and onion powder into the crumbs. Lift the chicken out of the marinade. Using two forks, dip each strip first in the flour, then in the egg (let the excess drip off), and finally in the crumbs. Make sure they are well-coated. Lightly coat a baking sheet with nonstick spray. Arrange the strips in a single layer on the baking sheet and cover them with nonstick spray as well; this helps them 'fry' all over. Bake the strips 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked and golden brown. Turn them once. Transfer the wings to a platter and drizzle with the remaining hot sauce. Serve at once with low-fat blue cheese dressing.
