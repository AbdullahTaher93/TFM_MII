In a 8-in. nonstick skillet, cook bacon until crisp. Remove bacon to paper towel to drain; discard drippings. In a small bowl, beat eggs; add water, chives, hot pepper sauce, salt pepper and bacon. Pour into the same skillet; cook over medium heat. As eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. When eggs are set, fold omelet in thirds.
