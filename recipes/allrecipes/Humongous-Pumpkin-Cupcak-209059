Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line the cupcake cups with the paper cupcake liners. Beat the cake mix with the eggs, buttermilk and oil until blended. Fold TWIX Cookie Bars into the batter. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cupcake pans. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely. Tint the vanilla frosting with the orange food coloring. Line the cupcakes snugly into a large pumpkin shape on the cake circle or platter. Follow this pattern--one row of 4 cupcakes, one row of 5, one row of 6, another of 5, another of 4. This leaves 2 cupcakes to be placed at the pumpkins top for a stem (use the photo as a guide). Spread orange frosting over the cupcakes, covering them completely so they look like one big cake. Use black M&M'S Brand Chocolate Candies to outline the pumpkin, and to make the eyes, mouth and nose. Fill in any remaining area of the pumpkin with orange M&M'S Brand Chocolate Candies.
