Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Trim off any excess fat from roast. Make several deep slits and insert a half clove of garlic in each slit. Place roast in an aluminum oven pouch. Pour soup over roast. Then sprinkle soup mix over the roast followed by the Worcestershire sauce. Seal pouch tightly and place on a baking sheet. Bake in a preheated oven for 8 to 9 hours.
