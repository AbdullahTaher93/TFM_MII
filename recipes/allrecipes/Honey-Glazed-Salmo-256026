Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Place salmon fillets skin-side down on the baking sheet; pierce with a fork several times. Season with black pepper. Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Whisk olive oil, white cooking wine, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, onion salt, mustard, and hot pepper sauce into the melted butter; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Brush generously over the salmon fillets. Bake salmon fillets in the preheated oven, basting with butter mixture every 5 minutes, until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes. Coat each fillet with honey; continue baking until glazed, 3 to 5 minutes.
