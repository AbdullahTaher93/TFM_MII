Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Arrange baguette slices in a single layer on the baking sheet. Place under broiler until golden, 2 minutes. Turn each slice over and broil 2 minutes. Turn off broiler. Turn each slice over again; drizzle with olive oil. Push chocolate piece into the center of each slice and return baking sheet to oven for 2 more minutes. Remove from oven and lightly sprinkle each chocolate piece with sea salt.
