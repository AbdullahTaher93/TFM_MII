Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch (23-cm) springform pan with nonstick spray. In a bowl, mix the crumbs, margarine, and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the jam. Press the mixture into the bottom of the pan. With a mixer set at medium speed, beat together the two types of cream cheese until light and fluffy. Add the milk, sour cream, egg substitute, egg, and vanilla, and beat until smooth. Pour into the pan. Place the pan inside a larger one filled with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. Bake the cake until the center is nearly set, 50 to 55 minutes. Cool the cake on a wire rack for 30 minutes, then refrigerate it overnight. Arrange the peaches on the cake. Brush the peaches with the remaining 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of jam.
