In a saucepan, over medium high heat, bring milk to a boil, add oats and butter. Cook and stir 1 minute. Remove from heat, cool to lukewarm. In a mixing bowl stir yeast in warm water until dissolved. Add oat mixture, sugar, salt, whole-wheat flour and 2 1/2 cups of the all purpose flour, beat until smooth. Add enough of the remaining flour to form a soft dough, turn onto a floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 7 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, grease top of dough. Cover, let rise in warm place, until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Punch down, let rest 10 minutes. Shape into 24 rolls (golf ball size). Place in 2 greased 9 x 13 inch baking pans. Cover; let rise until double, about 45 minutes. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F oven until golden brown, about 20 - 25 minutes. Remove from oven and place on a cooling rack.
