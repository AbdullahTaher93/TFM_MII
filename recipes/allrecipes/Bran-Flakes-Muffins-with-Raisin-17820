Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease 12 muffin cups. Combine raisin bran cereal and milk. Let stand until mixture is moistened. Beat in egg and shortening. Mix in flour, baking powder, salt and sugar, stirring only until combined. Fill greased muffin pans 2/3 full. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, until toothpick inserted into center of a muffin comes out clean.
