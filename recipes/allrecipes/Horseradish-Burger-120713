In a bowl, combine beef, steak sauce and seasoned salt; mix well. Shape into 16 patties. In a small bowl, combine cream cheese, horseradish and mustard. Spoon about 1 tablespoonful into the center of half of the patties; top with remaining patties. Press edges to seal. Grill, uncovered, over medium-hot heat for 10 minutes on each side or until meat is no longer pink. Serve on buns.
