In a medium bowl, combine the first eight ingredients; mix well and set aside. Roll pastry to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut into 5-in. circles. Spoon about 1/4 cup filling in the center of each circle. Moisten edges of pastry with water. Fold over and seal edges with a fork. Place on a greased baking sheet. Cut 1/2-in. vents in tops. Brush with egg. Bake at 425 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.
