To make the salmon: Combine the wine, water, bouillon, peppercorns, dillweed, bay leaves, celery, and lemon in a skillet. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the salmon to the mixture in the skillet and cook for 10 minutes or until the fish flakes easily. Transfer the salmon to a platter, using a slotted spoon. Cover, and chill thoroughly. Discard the liquid mixture remaining in the skillet. To make the cucumber-dill sauce: In a medium bowl, mix together the cucumber, sour cream, yogurt, dillweed, and mustard. To serve, place the fillets on individual serving plates. Spoon the sauce evenly over the fillets. Garnish with fresh dillweed sprigs, if using.
