Prepare rice according to package directions. Melt the butter or margarine in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and celery and saute for 5 to 10 minutes, or until almost tender. Stir in the four and salt and pepper to taste. Add the broth and milk and stir until soup thickens. Add the rice and the chicken and allow to heat through, about 10 minutes.
