Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a pot with enough water to cover, boil the potatoes for about 10 minutes. Drain, cool, and place in a bowl. Toss with olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon thyme, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, chives, salt, and pepper. Rub the pork loin roast with 1 teaspoon thyme, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, and onion powder. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the roast on a rack in a shallow roasting pan, and cook 50 minutes in the preheated oven. Arrange the potatoes around the roast, and continue cooking 50 minutes, to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove from heat, cover with foil, and let sit 15 minutes before slicing.
