Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Toss potatoes with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast for 20 to 25 minutes before adding chicken (follow next steps to prepare chicken before roasting). Add the bread to a food processor. Pulse until it turns into crumbs. Take the breadcrumbs out, and set aside. Pulse the garlic and parsley until finely chopped. Add the breadcrumbs back, and pour in melted butter. Pulse again until it coats all of the breadcrumbs. Press the bread mixture onto the chicken breasts. Put the chicken into the oven with the potatoes and bake until cooked through, about 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, halve the tomatoes, toss with olives, lemon zest, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, salt, pepper and parsley. Stir in Feta. Set aside. Layer arugula on the bottom of the plate. Add the chicken breasts, top with tomato and feta salsa. Serve with roasted potatoes.
