Heat a large skillet over high heat. Mix orange juice, mustard and basil in a glass measuring cup. Coat the scallops with oil and season both sides with salt and pepper. When pan is hot (if using a nonstick skillet, residual oils will send up wisps of smoke), add scallops; cook until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Divide scallops among 4 dinner plates. Add orange juice mixture to the hot skillet; simmer until reduced by half, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in butter, pour over scallops and serve.
