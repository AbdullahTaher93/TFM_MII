Combine stock, bay leaves, thyme, port, ginger, and jam in a large saucepan. Bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer until stock has reduced to 1 cup, about 1 hour. Remove from heat, strain, and transfer to a clean small saucepan. Set aside. Combine peppercorns, juniper berries, and rosemary in a spice grinder. Grind, allowing some texture to remain. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Place a large roasting pan in the oven. Salt both sides of each rack well, and rub the ground spice mixture into the meat. Heat olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet set over medium-high heat. Place both racks in skillet, and brown each side, about 2 minutes per side, using tongs to maneuver racks in skillet. Transfer racks to the preheated roasting pan. Roast venison 30 to 35 minutes for medium rare. Remove roasting pan from oven, and transfer meat to a cutting board to rest 15 minutes. Return sauce to a boil. In a small bowl, combine remaining 2 teaspoons butter with flour; mix until a paste forms. Reduce heat, stir in cranberries; let simmer until berries are soft and sauce is glossy. Whisk in the butter mixture. Serve the red-currant-and-cranberry sauce with the venison.
