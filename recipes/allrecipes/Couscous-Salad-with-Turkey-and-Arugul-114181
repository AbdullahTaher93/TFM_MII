In a medium saucepan, bring the water and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt to a boil. Stir in the couscous and raisins. Cover, remove from the heat, and let stand for 5 minutes. Transfer the couscous and raisins to a large bowl to cool. Meanwhile, in a small frying pan, toast the walnuts over moderately low heat, stirring frequently, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Or toast the nuts in a 350 degrees F oven for 10 minutes. Remove the nuts from the pan and chop them. In a large glass or stainless-steel bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and the pepper. Add the oil slowly, whisking. Toss the carrots, the toasted nuts, the turkey, the arugula, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt with the cooled couscous. Toss the salad into the dressing.
