Cook spaghettini according to package directions. Reserve 1/4 cup pasta-cooking liquid, and drain. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until softened but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook just until they begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in parsley, basil, salt, and pepper. Turn off heat. Immediately add the cooked pasta and cheese, and toss gently. If pasta seems too dry, add reserved pasta-cooking liquid as needed. Serve immediately.
