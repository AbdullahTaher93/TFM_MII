Place water and chicken in a large Dutch oven; bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, skimming any foam from the surface with a slotted spoon, until the chicken is cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pot, reserving the cooking liquid. When cool enough to handle, shred the chicken into thin strips. Combine garlic, chili powder, soy sauce, salt and 2 tablespoons of the reserved cooking liquid in a large bowl. Add the shredded chicken and mix thoroughly. Cover and set aside to marinate for 10 minutes. Whisk eggs and oil in a small bowl until well combined. Bring the remaining cooking liquid to a boil again over high heat. Add the seasoned chicken, scallions and pepper. Return to a boil; drizzle the egg mixture slowly over the boiling soup. Serve immediately.
