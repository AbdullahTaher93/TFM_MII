Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, mix 1/2 cup ketchup with the remaining ingredients until well combined. Divide mixture among 6 cups of a 12-cup (4 ounce) muffin tin, spacing them evenly and gently compressing and mounding the tops. Brush tops with remaining 1/4 cup ketchup. Transfer tin to oven; bake until inside temperature registers 170 degrees F on an instant read thermometer, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven; let rest 5 minutes before removing from tin. Serve hot.
