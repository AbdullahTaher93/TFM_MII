In a bowl, combine the raisins, nuts, sour cream, honey, 2 tablespoons butter, cinnamon and lemon peel; set aside. Separate the biscuit dough into 10 pieces. On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece into a 6-in. oval. Place a rounded tablespoonful of raisin mixture on each. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a short side; seal seam. Place roll-ups seam side down on an ungreased baking sheet. Melt remaining butter; brush over dough. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 2 minutes. Combine confectioners; sugar, vanilla and enough milk to achieve drizzling consistency; drizzle over rolls. Serve warm.
