Combine mango-flavored rum and chopped jalapeno pepper in a large glass container. Let infuse, at least 1 hour. Strain out jalapeno pepper and discard. Mix infused rum with orange-peach-mango juice, orange-flavored liqueur, and lime juice together in a bowl. Fill a cocktail shaker with ice and add rum mixture, working in batches. Cover shaker and shake until outside of the cocktail shaker is frosted; pour into serving glasses. Garnish with jalapeno pepper slices.
