Mix sweet potatoes and carrots together in a large bowl. Form into small balls and flatten into patties. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry patties in hot oil until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Drain on paper towels; allow to cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
