In a skillet, cook and stir almonds and sugar over low heat until sugar is dissolved and almonds are coated. Spread almonds on waxed paper and set aside. In a large glass salad bowl, layer the lettuce, water chestnuts, peas, cucumber, tomatoes, cheese and oranges. Sprinkle with the sugared almonds. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. In a jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine dressing ingredients; shake well. Pour over salad and serve immediately.
