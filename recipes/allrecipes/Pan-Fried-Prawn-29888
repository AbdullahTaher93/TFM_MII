Trim the prawns, leaving heads and shells on. Cut the prawns in the middle (divide into head part and tail part). Place the prawns in a bowl, add 1 tsp. salt, then add water until the prawns are covered. Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Take the prawns out, rinse and drain. Heat the pan (high heat), set the prawns in the pan (without oil) until brown, then flip to the other side until brown. Remove prawns and set aside. Heat 2 tbsp. oil in a clean pan (high heat). Add garlic and prawns; stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add ginger, cooking wine, sugar, 1/4 tsp salt and soy sauce. Stir fry until the sauce has a thick consistency, somewhat dry. The prawns are ready to serve.
