Bring 1 3/4 cups water and 1 teaspoon coarse salt to a rapid boil in a 2-quart saucepan. Stir 1 cup white rice (unconverted) into boiling water. Return mixture to a boil; reduce heat to a simmer. Cover; cook without lifting lid to prevent steam from escaping until rice is done (15 to 20 minutes; check toward end of cooking time). The rice should be studded with steam holes when done. Let stand, covered, 5 to 10 minutes, then fluff rice with a fork.
