Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Stir flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir pomegranate seeds, 1/2 cup sugar, and lemon juice together in a bowl until seeds are coated with sugar. Beat egg in a bowl; stir in almond milk, butter, vinegar, and vanilla. Pour egg mixture into pomegranate mixture and stir to combine. Stir egg and pomegranate mixture into flour mixture to make a soft dough. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. If dough is too sticky, sprinkle with a bit of cornstarch. Roll or pat dough into a 3/4-inch thick round; cut into wedges and transfer to a baking sheet. Sprinkle dough with 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
