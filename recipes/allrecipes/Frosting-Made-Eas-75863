Pour milk into a saucepan, and bring to just a simmer. Be careful, if it starts to boil, it will quickly boil over. Meanwhile, combine the shortening, margarine and sugar in a large bowl, and beat with an electric mixer until light. When the milk is heated, gradually drizzle in the hot milk, while continuing to whip until light and fluffy.
