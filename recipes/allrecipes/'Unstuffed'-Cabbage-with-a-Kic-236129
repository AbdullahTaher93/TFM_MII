Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground turkey in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Transfer cooked turkey to a bowl. Heat olive oil in the skillet over medium heat; saute onion in hot oil until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic to onion; saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour diced tomatoes and tomato sauce over the onion mixture; season with Italian seasoning, basil, red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer tomato mixture until the tomatoes are softened, about 10 minutes. Stir cabbage into the tomato mixture; continue cooking until cabbage is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir ground turkey into the mixture; cook to reheat the turkey, 1 to 2 minutes.
