In 10-inch skillet, heat shredded chicken, enchilada sauce and green chiles to simmering over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Cook about 5 minutes or until heated through and chicken begins to fall apart in sauce. Remove from heat. Spoon chicken mixture into taco shells; top with onion and cheese.
