Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Beat mango pulp, sugar, margarine, and eggs together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until light and well mixed, 3 to 5 minutes. Sift flour, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl. Stir mango mixture into flour mixture just until batter is combined. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Gently press almonds into batter. Continue baking until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
