Cut eggplant in half lengthwise; scoop out pulp, leaving a 1/4-in.-thick shell. Set shell aside. Chop pulp; place in a colander over a plate. Sprinkle with salt; let stand for 30 minutes. Blot moisture with a paper towel. In a skillet, saute eggplant pulp and onion in butter until tender. Add the bread crumbs, mushrooms, parsley and pepper. Spoon into eggplant shells. Place in a greased 8-in. square baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 15 minutes. Sprinkle with cheese; bake 5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.
