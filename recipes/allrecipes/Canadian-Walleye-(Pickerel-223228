Heat 1/8 inch of vegetable oil in two large cast-iron or heavy-duty frying pans over medium-high heat. Arrange three separate pie plates or shallow bowls for breading the fish. Combine flour, salt and pepper in one bowl, milk and eggs in another, and bread crumbs in the third bowl. Coat each fillet in the flour mixture, then dredge them in egg wash, then coat them well with bread crumbs. Place 4 fillets in each frying pan. Cook until golden brown, about 5 to 7 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and serve immediately.
