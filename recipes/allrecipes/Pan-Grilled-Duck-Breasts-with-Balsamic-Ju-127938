Remove the skin from the duck breasts and discard. Melt the butter and oil in a large, nonstick grill pan over medium heat. Add the duck breasts and cook 5 to 8 minutes per side, or until medium-rare, adding more oil if necessary. (If you are substituting pork tenderloins, cook 5 to 10 minutes on each side, or until an instant-read thermometer registers 160 degrees F in the thickest part.) Transfer the duck breasts to a grooved carving board; cover and set aside. Add the wine and the vinegar to the grill pan and boil uncovered 5 minutes. Add the broth and boil 5 minutes longer, or until reduced and just thickened. (This is not a thick gravy; pan juices should be slightly watery and thin.) Carve each breast into 1/2 inch-thick slices on the diagonal. Arrange slices fan style on plates and drizzle with pan jus. Alternatively, pass the jus at the table.
