Rinse and spin dry the lettuce. Be sure that there is a lot of variety of lettuce and baby greens. Pick out and discard any leaves that don't look perfectly fresh. Place lettuce in a large shallow bowl (such as a pasta bowl). Sprinkle on top the blue cheese and the toasted walnuts. Mix together and blend well the oil, vinegar and salt & pepper. Drizzle dressing over the salad and serve.
