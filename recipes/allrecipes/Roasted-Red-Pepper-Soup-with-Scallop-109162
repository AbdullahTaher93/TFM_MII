Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until tender about 4-5 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute longer. Add peppers and broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly. Carefully transfer soup to a blender, add basil and vinegar and puree until smooth. Return the soup to the saucepan and reheat over medium low heat. Stir in the cream and allow to heat through, about 5 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Heat a medium skillet over high heat until very hot. Place scallops in a medium bowl and coat with remaining olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place scallops in pan and cook, turning once until well seared, about 5 minutes. Ladle equal portions of soup into 4 bowls. Garnish with scallops and serve.
