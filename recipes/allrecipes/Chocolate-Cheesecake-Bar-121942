In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in extract. Combine flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture until mixture resembles coarse crumbs (do not overmix). Set aside half for topping. Press the remaining crumb mixture into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. For filling, in a large saucepan, add the chocolate chips, cream cheese and milk . Cook over low heat until chips are melted; stir until smooth and blended. Remove from the heat; stir in walnuts and extract. Spread over crust; sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture. Bake at 375 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. Cut into bars.
