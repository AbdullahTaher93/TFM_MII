Slice queso fresco in half horizontally, creating 2 rounds. Transfer to a shallow microwave-safe baking dish. Spread salsa evenly over queso fresco and pour any residual juices around the dish for the queso fresco to marinate in. Top with cilantro, jalapeno, and hot sauce. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate, at least 2 hours, preferably longer. Heat queso fresco in the microwave until slightly softened, about 3 minutes.
