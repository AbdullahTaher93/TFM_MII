Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add chicken thighs, onion, and garlic. Cook and stir until starting to brown, about 10 minutes. Add sherry and smoked paprika; cook and stir until mostly reduced, about 5 minutes. Stir borlotti beans, tomatoes, and chicken bouillon cube into the pot. Cook and stir until flavors combine, about 10 minutes. Stir in kale; simmer until thickened into a stew consistency, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
