Cut chicken into 1-inch pieces. Place in a medium bowl. For marinade, in a small bowl combine yogurt, curry powder, ginger, and salt. Squeeze the juice from half of 1 lime; stir into yogurt mixture. Pour marinade over chicken; stir to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or for up to 2 hours. Cut the remaining limes into wedges; set aside. Drain chicken, discarding marinade. Thread chicken onto 8 long metal skewers, leaving a 1/4-inch space between each piece. For a charcoal grill, grill kabobs on the rack of an uncovered grill directly over medium coals for 12 to 14 minutes or until chicken is tender and no longer pink, turning once halfway through. (For a gas grill, preheat grill. Reduce heat to medium. Place kabobs on grill rack over heat. Cover and grill as above.) Remove kabobs from grill. To serve, place fruit on the ends of kabobs. Serve with lime wedges.
