Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly spray a Bundt pan with non-stick cooking spray. Sift together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and cocoa in a large bowl. Set aside. Mix together sugar, oil, eggs, and chipotle sauce in a separate bowl. Dissolve instant coffee in hot (not boiling) water. Stir into egg mixture. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients; mix just until moistened. Pour batter into prepared Bundt pan. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle of cake comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cake cool in pan before inverting onto a serving plate. To make glaze, combine chocolate morsels, butter, and corn syrup in microwave safe bowl. Microwave on high for 1 minute; stir. Continue microwaving on high in 30 second increments, stirring afterwards each time. To serve, slice cake and top with chocolate drizzle.
