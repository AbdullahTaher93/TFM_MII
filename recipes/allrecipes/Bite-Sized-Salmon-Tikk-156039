Mix together the cayenne, turmeric, and salt in a bowl. Add the salmon to the bowl and toss to coat. Allow to sit 15 minutes. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. While the oil is heating, sprinkle the cornstarch over the salmon and again toss to coat. Cook the salmon in the heated oil until golden brown, about 1 minute per side.
