Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Add chicken; cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Reduce heat to medium. Cook until juices run clear and chicken is cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Let cool completely. Coarsely chop chicken, and transfer to a medium bowl. Bring 1 1/2 inches of water to a boil in a small saucepan fitted with the steamer insert. Add broccoli; cover, and cook until broccoli is just tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Let cool completely. Coarsely chop broccoli; add to chicken in the bowl. Add cheeses, and season with salt and pepper. Toss well. Place a packed 1/2 cup of chicken mixture in center of each tortilla; shape filling into a horizontal oval. Fold in right and left sides about 1/2 inch, then tightly roll up. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place pockets seam down on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Bake until crisp and beginning to turn golden, about 12 minutes. Cut in half crosswise, and serve.
