Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain most of the grease from the skillet and return to heat. Pour water into the skillet; add lima beans, black-eyed peas, and okra. Bring the mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook for 2 hours.
