In a blender or food processor, pulse the flours, cornmeal, baking powder, ginger, baking soda, yogurt, egg substitute, honey, and oil until just combined. By hand, stir the apples into the batter. Coat a large, nonstick skillet with nonstick spray and heat over medium heat. For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons (25 to 45 ml) of the batter into the skillet. Cook until lightly browned and cooked through, about 2 minutes on each side. Repeat with remaining batter.
