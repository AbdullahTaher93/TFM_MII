Line a large stockpot with a large food safe bag. Pour the water, wine, and salt into the bag; stir until the salt is completely dissolved. Squeeze the orange quarters into the liquid and then drop them into the pot. Add the rosemary and give a final stir. To use, carefully lower a thawed turkey into the brine and tie the bag to seal; store in refrigerator at least 5 hours before cooking.
