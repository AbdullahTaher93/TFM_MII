Preheat over to 350 F. In a large skillet, cook sausage over medium-high heat, stirring frequently until thoroughly cooked and no longer pink. Stir in refried beans and lime juice; season to taste. Fill each mini phyllo shell with 1 rounded tablespoon sausage mixture. Place green chilies on top and sprinkle with cheese. Bake 10 minutes or until cheese is melted.
