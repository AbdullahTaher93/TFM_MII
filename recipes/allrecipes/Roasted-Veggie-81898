Cut the veggies as you wish. Here's what I typically do. Cut the turnip in half then slice, forming half moons. Slice the zukes as an angle, forming ovals. Slice the crookneck into rounds. Leave the mushroom caps whole if bite sized. Cut the peppers and onions into squares. In a large bowl add the oil, vinegar and herbs. Mix well. Toss in the cut veggies and let marinate for about 10 minutes. Toss occasionally. Preheat the broiler. Arrange veggies on a foil lined sheet pan (makes clean up a breeze), keeping in mind the hot spots under your broiler and putting the turnips there and the squash in the 'cold' spots or closest to the door. Broil for about 3 minutes then check and see if things need to be rearranged. If anything is about to burn, turn it over and move to a cooler spot. Broil another 3-5 minutes as needed. Toss onto a platter and serve. As an appetizer, provide 1 or 2 dipping sauces.
