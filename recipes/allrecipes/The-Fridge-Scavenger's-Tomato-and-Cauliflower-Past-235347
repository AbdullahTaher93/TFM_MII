Put a celery slice in a deep skillet with a cover; add olive oil. Heat olive oil over medium-high heat until celery slice is sizzling, 3 to 5 minutes. Add remaining celery, onion, and garlic to olive oil; turn heat to medium. Cook and stir onion mixture until slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Mix cauliflower, tomatoes, sage, salt, and pepper into onion mixture; cook and stir over medium-high heat until bubbling, about 5 minutes. Cover skillet with lid, reduce heat to low, and cook until a knife slides easily into cauliflower, about 15 minutes. Add chicken broth if tomato and cauliflower sauce begins to burn. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain and transfer to a serving bowl. Pour tomato and cauliflower sauce over pasta; add Parmesan cheese. Toss to coat.
