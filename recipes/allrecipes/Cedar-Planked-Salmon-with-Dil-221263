Soak cedar plank in water for at least 1 hour. Preheat grill for indirect cooking over medium heat. Mix Dijon mustard, mayonnaise, lemon juice, lemon zest, dill, and garlic in a bowl. Arrange salmon on soaked cedar plank and spread mustard mixture over salmon. Place cedar plank on the cooler side of the grill; cook until salmon is easily flaked with a fork, 25 to 30 minutes.
