In a food processor or blender, combine everything except the asparagus and mix until thoroughly blended. Set aside. Cut the asparagus into two-inch pieces, on the diagonal. Half-fill a large skillet with water, cover and bring to a boil. Add the asparagus and simmer just until crisp-tender (approx. 4-5 minutes). Drain well but do not rinse. Transfer to serving bowl. Pour the sauce over the hot asparagus and toss to coat. Serve warm or at room temperature.
