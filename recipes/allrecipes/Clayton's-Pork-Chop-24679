Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place pork chops in a 9x13 inch baking pan. Add the mushroom and celery soups. Stir to coat the pork chops. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, until meat is no longer pink inside and thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove from oven and stir sour cream into soup mixture. Sprinkle with French-fried onions. Serve immediately.
