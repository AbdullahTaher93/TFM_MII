Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with about 1 tablespoon olive oil. Mix tomato, onion, garlic, and parsley in a bowl. Place a layer of potato slices in the bottom of the prepared baking dish; sprinkle with about 1/4 the tomato mixture, salt, pepper, and all the rice. Continue layering with potatoes, zucchini, tomato mixture, salt, pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil, ending with a layer of potatoes. Pour in just enough vegetable broth to cover the rice. Sprinkle bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese over top potato layer. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and bake until top is golden and crusty, about 10 more minutes.
