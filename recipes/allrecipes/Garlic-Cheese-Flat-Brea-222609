Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10x15-inch baking sheet. Press dough on to prepared baking sheet. Combine butter, garlic, and basil in a small bowl; drizzle over dough. Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese, Romano cheese, and Parmesan cheese. Bake in preheated oven until crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Cut into squares and serve warm.
