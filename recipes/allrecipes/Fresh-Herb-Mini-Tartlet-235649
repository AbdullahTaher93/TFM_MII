Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Beat the eggs, heavy cream, herbs, shallots, black pepper and red pepper in a medium bowl with a fork or whisk. Stir in the cheese. Unfold the pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface. Roll the pastry sheet into a 12-inch square. Cut into 36 (2-inch squares). Press the pastry squares into 36 (1 1/2-inch) mini muffin-pan cups. Spoon about 1 tablespoon egg mixture into each muffin-pan cup. Bake for 15 minutes or until the filling is set and the pastries are golden brown. Let the pastries cool in the pans on wire racks for 5 minutes.
