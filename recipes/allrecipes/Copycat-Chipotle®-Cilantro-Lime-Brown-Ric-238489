Bring water and brown rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 30 to 45 minutes. Transfer brown rice to a large bowl and cool slightly, 5 to 7 minutes. Whisk lime juice, garlic, olive oil, and salt together in a bowl; stir into rice. Fold cilantro into rice mixture.
