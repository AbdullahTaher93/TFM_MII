Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender, about 15 minutes; drain and return to the pot. Meanwhile puree the carrots in a food processor until completely smooth. Mash potatoes with a potato masher or ricer. Mix in pureed carrots and remaining ingredients. Warm over medium heat, stirring constantly.
