Heat coconut milk in a large saucepan over low heat. Simmer green beans in coconut milk until soft, about 10 minutes. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir chicken and onion in hot oil until the chicken pieces are no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Stir chicken mixture into the green bean mixture; cook together for 2 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter. Melt coconut butter and almond butter together in a saucepan over low heat; drizzle over chicken and green beans.
