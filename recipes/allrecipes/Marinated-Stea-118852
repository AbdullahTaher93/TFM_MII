In a bowl, combine the first seven ingredients; mix well. Pour 3/4 cup marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add the steak. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade. Before starting the grill, spray grill rack with nonstick cooking spray. Drain and discard marinade from steak. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 10-12 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F). Baste with reserved marinade during the last 5 minutes of cooking.
