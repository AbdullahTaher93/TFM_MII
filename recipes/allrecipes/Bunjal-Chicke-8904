Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the chicken into a 2 quart covered baking dish or dutch oven with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and olive oil. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and appears brown. Add the onion, pepper, garlic, tomato paste, garam masala, curry powder, seasoning to taste and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Mix all together, then add 1/4 cup water for the ingredients to steam. Return to the oven for 5 more minutes to blend all the flavors. Serve over rice or eat plain.
