Bring the vegetable broth to a boil in a saucepan. Add the mushrooms, reduce heat to low, and simmer 4 minutes. Stir the miso paste and soy sauce together in a small bowl; add to the broth along with the tofu and continue cooking for 1 minute more. Pour the soup into bowls and top with the green onions to serve.
