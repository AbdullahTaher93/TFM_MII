Melt whipped butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; stir flour, garlic salt, and kosher salt into the melted butter until smooth. Whisk in low-fat milk, bring to a simmer, and reduce heat to low. Simmer sauce until thickened, whisking constantly, about 1 minute. Stir spinach into the sauce and heat until warmed through, 1 to 2 more minutes.
