To make the chipotle sauce you can either mince the chilies (with a bit of the sauce) and stir it in with the mayo and sour cream or you can put all 3 ingredients in a food processor or blender. Taste before you add the salt for it might not need it depending on your brand of Chipotle. If it is too spicy (wait for the heat, it's slow to arrive) then simply add more mayo or sour cream. Of course if you want more heat then add more chipotle (only 0.5g net carbs/Tbsp). Set aside. Fry the steaks and eggs to your liking. I typically pan-fry the steak over medium-high heat in a non-stick skillet (no oil added) for about 4 minutes per side then transfer to an oven proof platter and put into a 250 degrees F oven for 5 to 10 minutes. Then I lightly wipe out the fry pan with a paper towel (leaving just a bit of fat) and fry the eggs. Place one egg on top of each steak and drizzle the sauce over the steak & eggs. Serve immediately.
