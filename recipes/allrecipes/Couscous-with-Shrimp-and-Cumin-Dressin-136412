In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Put shrimp in the pan in a single layer, season with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper, and cook for 2 minutes. Turn and season with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper; cook just until opaque throughout, about 1 minute more. Remove and refrigerate until cool enough to handle. Cut shrimp in half lengthwise. In a large bowl, whisk together vinegar, mustard, and cumin. Whisking, add remaining 6 tablespoons oil slowly. Add couscous, shrimp, tomatoes, lettuce, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and toss.
