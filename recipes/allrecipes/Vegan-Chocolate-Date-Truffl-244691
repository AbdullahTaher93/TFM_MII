Put dates, cashews, coconut, water, cocoa powder, coconut oil, and espresso powder in an oiled food processor; blend until evenly combined. Form mixture into balls using oiled hands. Arrange balls on a waxed paper-lined baking sheet; chill in refrigerator for 1 hour. Melt 1/2 of the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl for 30 seconds; stir and microwave again for 30 seconds until chocolate is mostly melted. Add remaining chocolate chips to bowl and stir until all the chocolate is melted. Rub hands with oil and dip balls in the melted chocolate; remove with a fork, allowing excess chocolate to drip back into bowl. Arrange chocolate coated truffles on the baking sheet. Chill for 1 hour.
