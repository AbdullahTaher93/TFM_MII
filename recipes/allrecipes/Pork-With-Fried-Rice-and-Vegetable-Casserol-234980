Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels and break slices into crumbles. Reserve bacon drippings. Bring 1 3/4 cups water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Beat eggs and 2 tablespoons water together in a bowl. Heat 2 tablespoons reserved bacon drippings in a skillet; cook egg mixture in hot bacon drippings until hard-cooked, about 5 minutes. Transfer egg to a plate and cut into thin slices. Heat remaining bacon drippings in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir green onions in hot bacon drippings until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour onion over eggs and return skillet to heat. Increase heat to medium-high and stir pork pieces into skillet. Cook and stir pork until browned and cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir rice, cooked eggs, and soy sauce together in a bowl. Add corn and green beans; stir. Turn rice mixture out into a casserole dish. Drop pork pieces over the rice mixture and top with crumbled bacon. Cook in the preheated oven until ingredients are heated through and flavors blend, about 30 minutes.
