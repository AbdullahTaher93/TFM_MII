Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Combine the first 4 ingredients, and set aside. Separate the 2 soups in separate bowls and add 1/2 soup can of water to each; stir these well and set aside. Place 1/3 of the crumb mixture into a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer 1/2 of the turkey and pour the celery soup over this. Layer another 1/3 of the crumb mixture, followed by the remaining turkey. Pour the turkey soup over and top with the remaining crumb mixture. Drizzle with butter and pack the mixture firmly into the dish. Bake 20 to 30 minutes.
