In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Combine potatoes, milk and egg; stir into the crumb mixture until a soft dough forms. Turn onto a floured surface; knead gently 10-12 minutes or until no longer sticky. Gently pat or roll dough into a 9-in. circle about 3/4 in. thick. Cut into 10-12 wedges. Separate wedges and place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown.
