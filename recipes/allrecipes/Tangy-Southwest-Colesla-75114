In a large bowl, whisk together the lime juice, cumin, cayenne pepper, sweetener, salt, and pepper until well combined and sweetener is completely dissolved. Add green and red cabbages, green onions, and carrots, and toss to coat. Refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving to allow flavors to develop. Serve chilled.
