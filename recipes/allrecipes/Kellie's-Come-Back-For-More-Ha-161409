Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the ham in a baking dish or roasting pan with the flattest side down. Cover with ketchup then use your hands to pack brown sugar into the ketchup. Cover the ham loosely with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and sugar has caramelized, about 1 hour.
