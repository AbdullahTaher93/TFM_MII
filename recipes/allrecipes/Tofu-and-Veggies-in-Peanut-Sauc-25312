Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Saute broccoli, red bell pepper, mushrooms and tofu for 5 minutes. In a small bowl combine peanut butter, hot water, vinegar, soy sauce, molasses and cayenne pepper. Pour over vegetables and tofu. Simmer for 3 to 5 minutes, or until vegetables are tender crisp.
