In a stockpot, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, thyme, carrots, and parsnips; saute, stirring often, until tender, about 5 minutes. Add lentils, tomato, salt, pepper, and the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer uncovered until lentils are tender, about 40 minutes. Add chard to soup and cook until leaves are wilted and tender, about 5 minutes. Season with additional salt and pepper, if desired. Serve with olive oil for drizzling.
