Heat oven to 375 degrees F. On microwavable plate, microwave biscuits, uncovered, on Medium (50%) for 50 to 60 seconds or until thawed, turning biscuits over halfway through microwaving. Spoon 1 teaspoon of the melted butter into each of 2 ovenproof 10-oz. custard cups or ramekins; tilt cups to completely coat bottom with butter. Place 1 tablespoon caramel topping in each cup. Top each evenly with blueberries and pistachios. In small bowl or resealable food-storage plastic bag, mix sugar, vanilla powder and cinnamon. Cut each thawed biscuit into 6 pieces. Lightly dip each piece into remaining melted butter; roll or shake in sugar mixture to coat. Place 6 coated biscuit pieces in each custard cup. Drizzle with any remaining butter; sprinkle with any remaining sugar mixture. Bake at 375 degrees F for 21 to 26 minutes or until biscuits are golden brown and edges are bubbly. Cool 10 minutes. Run knife around edge of custard cups; invert onto individual plates. If desired, serve with yogurt.
