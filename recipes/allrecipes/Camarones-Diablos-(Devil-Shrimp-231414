Combine chicken broth, brown rice, 1 tablespoon butter, and salt in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and broth is absorbed, about 45 minutes. Heat 1 tablespoon butter and olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and jalapeno peppers in the hot butter and oil until onion is slightly softened, 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour red wine and Worcestershire sauce into onion mixture; mix in chipotle peppers. Cook and stir mixture until liquid is slightly evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add shrimp and cook until opaque, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer until liquid is reduced, about 15 minutes. Serve shrimp mixture over cooked rice.
