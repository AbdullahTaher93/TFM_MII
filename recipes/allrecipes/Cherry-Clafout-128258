Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter four 1-cup-capacity ramekins or custard cups. In a small bowl, toss the cherries with 2 tablespoons of the sugar, then divide among the ramekins. In a food processor, combine the almonds, the remaining sugar, the flour, salt, eggs, egg yolk, milk, and almond extract. Process until the almonds are ground and the mixture forms a smooth batter, about 30 seconds. Pour the batter over the cherries, dividing equally. Top each serving with a teaspoon of cognac and bake 35 minutes, or until puffed and brown. Let cool until warm (they will sink slightly). Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar and garnish with toasted almonds, if desired. Serve warm.
