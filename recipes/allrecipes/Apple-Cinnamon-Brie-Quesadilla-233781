Melt 3/4 teaspoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat, tilting the skillet to evenly spread butter. Place 1 tortilla in the melted butter. Cover tortilla with Brie cheese slices and apple slices; sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon. Place the remaining tortilla over the filling. Cook quesadilla until bottom tortilla is browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Spread the remaining 3/4 teaspoon butter on top tortilla; carefully flip quesadilla and cook until bottom tortilla is browned and cheese is melted, 3 to 5 more minutes. Slice quesadilla into quarters.
