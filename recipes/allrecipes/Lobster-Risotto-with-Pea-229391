Bring broth to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add lobster tails; reduce heat. Simmer gently 4 to 5 minutes or until shells turn bright red and lobster meat is opaque. Remove lobster from broth; let cool at least 10 minutes. Keep broth warm over low heat. If your phone rings, tell the caller you're making Lobster Risotto and you'll call back. At which point, they'll ask you what time is dinner. If you wish, tell them when it's going to be ready and to pick up a bottle of Prosecco on their way. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a 10-inch saute pan over medium heat. Add onion; saute 3 minutes. Add rice; saute 2 minutes. Add wine; simmer until wine is absorbed. Begin adding warm broth to rice mixture 1/2 cup at a time (a large ladleful), keeping the liquid at a gentle simmer and stirring frequently. When broth is almost absorbed, add another 1/2 cup and continue simmering and stirring frequently. Meanwhile, shell lobster; cut the meat into 1/2-inch thick chunks. Try not to nibble on too much of the lobster meat. Because, yum, its lobster. When 3-1/2 cups of the broth are absorbed by the rice (18 to 20 minutes), add lobster meat and peas. Continue simmering and stirring in the last of the broth as needed. Rice should be slightly al dente and the mixture should be creamy. Remove from heat; stir in 1/2 cup of the cheese, remaining 1 tablespoon oil and the lemon peel. Season to taste with salt. Transfer to shallow bowls; top with remaining 1/4 cup cheese. Garnish with parsley if desired.
