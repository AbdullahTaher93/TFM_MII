In a Dutch oven, slowly bring the chicken and water to a boil. Cover and simmer for 45 to 60 minutes or until chicken is tender, skimming the surface as foam rises. Remove chicken and set aside until cool enough to handle. Remove and discard skin and bones. Cube chicken and return to broth. Add the potatoes, onions, beans and seasonings. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Stir in remaining ingredients. Simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes or until slightly thickened.
