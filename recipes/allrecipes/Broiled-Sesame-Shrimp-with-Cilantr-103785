In a blender or food processor, combine the olive oil, sesame oil, lemon juice, onion, garlic, cilantro, ginger, paprika, salt and pepper. Cover and puree until smooth. This is the marinade. Place the shrimp into a large bowl and cover with the marinade. Set aside for 20 minutes to marinate. Adjust oven rack to highest position and preheat the oven's broiler. Thread shrimp onto skewers and place on a broiler pan or a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Brush shrimp with as much of the marinade as you can get to stick. Broil until pink and spotty brown, 6 to 7 minutes. Shrimp do not have to be turned. Serve immediately with lemon wedges.
