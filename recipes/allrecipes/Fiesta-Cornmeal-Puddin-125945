Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 9 inch baking dish with cooking spray. Bring the water to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add the salt. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the cornmeal in a slow, steady stream, whisking constantly. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes, or until very thick. Remove from the heat. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the bell pepper; cook, stirring, for 4 minutes. Add the scallions and garlic; cook, stirring, for 2 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Add the bell pepper mixture, spinach, egg whites, and hot-pepper sauce to the cornmeal. Stir well. Place in the baking dish. Sprinkle with the cheese. Bake for 30 minutes, or until firm, puffed, and golden.
