Heat oven to 325 degrees F. Line 13x9-inch baking pan with foil, with ends extending over sides of pan. Finely crush 24 cookies. Melt 1/4 cup butter; mix with crumbs. Press onto bottom of prepared pan. Beat cream cheese and sugar with mixer until blended. Add sour cream and vanilla; mix well. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating after each just until blended.

Meanwhile, microwave chocolate and remaining butter in microwaveable bowl on HIGH 1 minute; stir until smooth. Cool slightly; spread over top of cheesecake. Refrigerate 4 hours.
