Arrange the spinach on four plates. In a skillet, melt butter over medium heat, and add crushed garlic. Cook and stir until slightly golden. Stir in breadcrumbs. Drop the goat cheese slices into the breadcrumbs a few at a time, and turn to coat in the breadcrumb mixture. Place a slice or two of goat cheese on each serving of spinach, and drizzle the salads with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
