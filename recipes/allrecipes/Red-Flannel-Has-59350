Place potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover them. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain, and cool. Run potatoes and beets through a ricer, or through a food processor with a grater attachment. Stir in salt and pepper. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the potato and beet mixture, and pat down evenly. Fry until heated through, and browned on the bottom. Serve with more butter and red wine vinegar to taste.
