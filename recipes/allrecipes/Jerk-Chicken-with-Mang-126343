Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Coat a 13 inch x 9 inch baking pan with cooking spray. In a food processor, combine the peppers, onion, garlic, ginger, oil, vinegar, thyme, allspice, and salt. Process until very finely chopped, stopping the machine a few times to scrape down the sides of the container. Spread the jalapeno mixture on both sides of the chicken breasts. Place them, skinned side up, in the prepared baking pan. Bake for 30 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted in the thickest portion registers 170 degrees F and the juices run clear. Place the chicken on plates and scatter the mango on top. Sprinkle with the mint.
