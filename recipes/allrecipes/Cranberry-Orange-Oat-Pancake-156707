Preheat nonstick griddle (if using electric griddle, set to 325 degrees F-350 degrees F). Whisk together oats, flours, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in large bowl. In medium bowl, whisk together eggs, orange juice, milk, and oil. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir to combine. Fold in cranberries. Drop 1/4 cup of batter onto griddle and cook until edges look dry and bubbles come to the surface, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until bottom browns and pancake is cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve with agave nectar.
