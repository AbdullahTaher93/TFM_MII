Peel and chop onion and garlic. In a 5- to 6-quart nonstick pan over medium-high heat, stir oil, onion, and garlic until onion is limp, about 5 minutes. Add cumin, coriander, and cayenne; stir until spices are fragrant, about 30 seconds. Drain and rinse beans. Add 2 cans to pan along with broth, carrots, and rice. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until carrots and rice are tender to bite, 15 to 20 minutes. In a blender, puree soup, a portion at a time, until smooth. Return soup to pan, add sherry and remaining beans, and stir over medium heat until hot, about 2 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Peel, pit, and slice avocado. Ladle soup into bowls. Garnish with avocado slices, sour cream, and cilantro.
