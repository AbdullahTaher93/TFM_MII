To make tomatillo salsa: Combine tomatillos, onion, garlic and jalapeno in a food processor. Using an on/off motion, pulse until smooth. Stir in cilantro and season with salt and pepper. To make enchiladas: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Lightly oil an 8-by-11-inch baking dish or coat with nonstick cooking spray. Place turkey in a large nonstick skillet over high heat and cook, stirring to break up meat, until no longer pink. Season with salt and pepper. Drain in a colander. Wipe out the pan with paper towels. Add oil to the pan and heat over medium-high heat. Add onion and green pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, jalapenos, cumin, chili powder, oregano, and cinnamon; cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes more. Mash beans coarsely and add to the pan, along with broth, tomatillos and the cooked turkey. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in cilantro and season with salt and pepper. To assemble enchiladas: Soften a tortilla by heating it directly on a stovetop burner for about 30 seconds, turning frequently. Spoon about 1/2 cup of the turkey-and-bean filling down the center of the softened tortilla. Roll up and place seam-side-down in the prepared baking dish. Repeat these steps with the remaining tortillas and filling. Spoon the tomatillo salsa over the enchiladas and sprinkle with cheese. Bake for 10 minutes, or until heated through. Serve with tomato salsa and sour cream, if desired.
