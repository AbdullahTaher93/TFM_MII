In a bowl, combine flour and salt; cut in shortening until crumbly. Gradually add water, tossing with a fork until dough forms a ball. Divide dough in half. Roll out one portion to fit a 9-in. pie plate; place pastry in pie plate and trim even with edge of plate. In a large saucepan, bring water and raisins to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes. In a small bowl, combine the sugar, cornstarch and salt; stir in cream until smooth. Add to raisin mixture. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat; stir in vanilla. Pour into pastry shell. Roll out remaining pastry to fit top of pie. Place over filling; trim, seal and flute edges. Cut slits in top. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Cool completely on a wire rack. Store in the refrigerator.
