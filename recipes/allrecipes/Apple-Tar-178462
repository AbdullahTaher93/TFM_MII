Place cookies, tops up, into a tart pan; press cookies out to cover pan and create a crust. Fan apple slices over cookies. Mix sugar and cinnamon together. Sprinkle over apples. Dot with butter. Place tart pan on a baking sheet. Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F oven for 30 minutes or until golden brown. Meanwhile, place apricot preserves in a microwaveable bowl. Microwave (HIGH) 1 minute. Remove from oven; brush with warmed apricot glaze. Serve warm or at room temperature with ice cream or whipped cream, if desired.
