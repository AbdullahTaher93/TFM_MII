Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray an 8- or 9-inch (2- or 2.5-L) square baking dish with no-stick spray. In a large bowl, combine the eggs, egg whites, molasses, and sugar, and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the pumpkin and milk. Add the flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, allspice, and white pepper, and whisk just until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the pudding is lightly browned and cracked around the edges but still a bit soft in the center. Transfer to a wire rack to cool briefly. Just before serving, place the confectioners' sugar in a small strainer and dust over the warm pudding.
