In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and 1/2 teaspoon sugar in 1/4 cup warm water. Add the remaining sugar and water, butter, egg, salt, and 1-1/2 cups of flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, combine topping ingredients; pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan; set aside. Combine filling ingredients; set aside. Punch dough down and turn onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 15-in. x 8-in. rectangle; spread filling over dough. Roll up from the long side. Seal seam. Slice into 15 rolls; place with cut side down over topping. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30-45 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool 3 minutes; invert pan onto a serving plate.
