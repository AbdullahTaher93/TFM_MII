Drain pineapple, reserving 2 tablespoons juice (discard remaining juice or save for another use). In a large bowl, combine the pineapple, cabbage, carrot and raisins. In a jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine the mayonnaise, lemon juice, horseradish, celery seed, salt and reserved pineapple juice; shake well. Pour over cabbage mixture and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.
