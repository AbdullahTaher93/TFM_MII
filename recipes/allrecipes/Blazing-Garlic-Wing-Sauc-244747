Combine hot sauce, oil, garlic, sugar, garlic powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and Worcestershire sauce in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce is smooth and slightly thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Stir cornstarch and water together in a bowl until smooth; whisk into sauce until thickened.
