Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook sausages, about 15 minutes, until well browned and cooked through. Drain fat, and return skillet and sausages to medium heat. Stir in water, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, cayenne, tomato paste, and brown sugar. Bring contents to a boil; reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.
