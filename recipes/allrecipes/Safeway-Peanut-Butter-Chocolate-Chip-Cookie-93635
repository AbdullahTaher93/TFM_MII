Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In large mixing bowl with electric mixer, mix granulated sugar, brown sugar, peanut butter, and butter until creamy, about 1 minute. Mix in eggs and vanilla. In a medium bowl, stir together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add to batter, mixing on low speed until blended. Mix in chocolate chips, oats, and peanuts. Drop batter onto 2 oiled baking sheets in heaping tablespoons about 3 inches apart. Flatten slightly to about 2 1/2 inches across and 1/2 inch thick. Bake cookies until tops are barely set when lightly pressed and color is golden, about 12 to 14 minutes. They will feel underdone but will firm up as they cool. Let stand 5 minutes and remove to racks to cool completely.
