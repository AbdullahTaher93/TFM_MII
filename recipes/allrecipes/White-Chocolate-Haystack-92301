Chop any large chunks of white chocolate into small pieces. Melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler or in a medium-size bowl in the microwave at 50 percent power until it is smooth and creamy. Stir in peanuts and pretzels until well coated. Spoon by rounded teaspoonfuls onto a baking sheet lined with wax or parchment paper. Cool to room temperature or refrigerate until firm. Cookies may be refrigerated for several months.
