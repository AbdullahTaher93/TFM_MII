Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Spray a shallow two to three-quart baking dish with cooking spray; set aside. In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt butter and stir in flour. Cook, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes. Whisk in fat-free or low-fat lactose-free milk, chicken broth, wine and pepper (optional); bring mixture to a boil. Stir in mushrooms, reduce heat and cook, stirring frequently about 10 minutes or until mixture thickens and mushrooms are softened. Stir Parmesan cheese, pasta, turkey and peas into the fat-free or low-fat lactose-free milk mixture; spoon into prepared dish. Top with Cheddar cheese and cover loosely with foil. Bake about 45 minutes or until bubbling at edges and heated through.
