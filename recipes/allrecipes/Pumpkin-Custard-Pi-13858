Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a saucepan, stir the pumpkin over medium-high heat for 10 minutes or until slightly dry and caramelized. Remove from heat; add the sugar, salt, cinnamon and ginger. Mix well. Add the eggs, cream and milk. Mix until smooth; pour into pastry lined pie pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Allow to completely cool on rack before cutting.
