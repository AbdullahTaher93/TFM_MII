Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over high heat, and quickly brown the pork on all sides. Pour in the wine, and mix in bread crumbs to coat pork. Mix the onions, shallots, garlic, and parsley in a bowl, and sprinkle over the meat. Transfer Dutch oven to the preheated oven, and cook 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and pour in the stock. Cover, and continue cooking 50 minutes. Remove cover, increase heat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and cook 10 more minutes. Sprinkle with vinegar to serve.
