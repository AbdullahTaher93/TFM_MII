Mix water, quinoa, 1 tablespoon coconut oil, and chicken bouillon granules in a saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until white threads appear on the quinoa grains, about 15 minutes. Melt 2 tablespoons coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute mushrooms, onion, and red bell pepper in hot oil until softened, 5 to 7 minutes; season with salt. Stir red wine and soy sauce into the vegetable mixture; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the liquid is reduced, about 10 minutes. Mix quinoa and vegetables in a large serving bowl; top with Parmesan cheese.
