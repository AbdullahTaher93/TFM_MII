Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil. Place potatoes in food processor, and pulse until finely chopped. Add eggs, and pulse a few times to combine. Pour mixture into a large bowl. Mix in enough flour to make a very thick dough. Place dough by spoonfuls into boiling water. Boil until done, about 20 minutes (depending on size). Drain, and set dumplings aside. Place chopped bacon and onion in a skillet over medium heat. Cook a few minutes until bacon releases fat. Place hot dumplings into pan; cook until bacon is crisp and onions and dumplings are browned.
