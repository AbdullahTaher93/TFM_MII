Rinse chicken and pat dry. Heat oil in a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook, turning once, until lightly browned on all sides (5 to 6 minutes). Remove chicken from pan and set aside. To pan add onion and garlic; cook, stirring often, until onion is lightly browned (about 3 minutes). Stir in orange juice, cinnamon, cloves, raisins, and capers. Return chicken to pan. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in center; cut to test (6 to 8 minutes). Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon chicken and sauce onto warm plates; sprinkle with parsley, if desired.
