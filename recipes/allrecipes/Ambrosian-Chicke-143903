Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Toss together the panko and coconut in a bowl; set aside. Stir together the yogurt, almond extract, and marmalade in a large bowl. Pour half into a separate bowl, and stir in the crushed pineapple to make a dipping sauce; set aside. Coat the chicken strips in the remaining yogurt mixture and roll in the panko mixture. Place the chicken strips on the parchment lined baking sheet. Bake the strips in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking until the chicken is golden brown, no longer pink, and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes. Serve the hot ambrosian chicken strips with the pineapple-yogurt dipping sauce.
