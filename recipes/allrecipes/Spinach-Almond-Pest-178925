Place almonds and pine nuts (keep separate) in a single layer in a dry skillet over medium heat. Toast, stirring occasionally until fragrant, 3-5 minutes. Combine all ingredients except 1/2 cup of the slivered almonds in a food processor, blending just until smooth. Toss pesto sauce with cooked fettuccine and top with roasted cherry tomatoes and remainder of slivered almonds.
