Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Stir cookie mix, oil and egg in medium bowl until soft dough forms. Shape dough into 12 balls, using 1 1/2 tablespoons dough for each. Place balls about 4 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Shape remaining dough into 24 balls, using 1 teaspoon dough for each. Insert stick into side of each large ball; place 2 small balls next to each large ball for ears. Press balls evenly until about 1/4 inch thick. Bake 11 to 13 minutes or until edges begin to brown. Cool 2 minutes; remove from cookie sheet to wire rack. Cool completely, about 30 minutes. Add 2 flat candies on each cookie for eyes and 1 milk chocolate candy for nose, using gel to attach. Squeeze on gel for mouth.
