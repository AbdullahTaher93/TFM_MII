Toss alligator cubes with lime juice, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour to marinate. Squeeze any excess liquid from alligator and place into a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper, then toss with enough flour to coat. Remove alligator, shake off excess flour, and set aside. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add alligator, and cook until firm and opaque, 5 to 6 minutes. Place alligator into serving dish, then pour wine into skillet and simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes. Pour sauce over alligator to serve.
