Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place beans, parsley, lemon juice, whole garlic cloves and oregano in a food processor. While the food processor is running, add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream. Set bean dip aside. Slice each slice of bread into thirds. Place bread strips on a baking sheet. Add 1 minced garlic clove to melted butter and brush on bread. Bake for 5 to 6 minutes. Turn bread sticks and brush with butter. Sprinkle bread sticks evenly with Parmesan. Bake 5 to 7 additional minutes or until toasted. Serve warm bread sticks with bean dip.
