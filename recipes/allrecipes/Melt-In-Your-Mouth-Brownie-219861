Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, combine Melt(R) and cocoa, blending with a spoon until smooth. Add baking powder and sugar, stirring until slightly mixed. Add flour and eggs; stir until completely integrated. Pour into a 9 x 13 baking pan, lightly coated with cooking spray. Sprinkle chocolate chips (and/or nuts) over top of brownie mixture. Bake in for 25-30 minutes, or until done. Cool, cut into squares, and enjoy!
