Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch round baking pan. Stir butternut squash, flour, sugar, eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla together in a large bowl until combined. Pour squash mixture into the prepared baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the kugel comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Sprinkle with cinnamon.
