Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Add pumpkin chunks and simmer until cooked-through. Drain. Cool to room temperature. Place pumpkin, salt, coconut milk, coconut cream, cinnamon powder, clove powder, ginger powder, cornstarch and Kahlua into a blender. Blend for 5 minutes at full speed. Pour the mixture into a 2-quart pot. Add the allspice berries. Reheat over medium heat stirring constantly for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Pass the mixture through a fine sieve to remove solids. Stir until it cools down to room temperature. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Serve chilled.
