Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 2 (8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch) loaf pans with the cooking spray. Stir the flour, cinnamon, baking soda and baking powder in a large bowl. Beat the sugar, soup, egg whites, oil and vanilla extract in a medium bowl with a fork or whisk. Add the soup mixture to the flour mixture, stirring just until blended. Fold in the zucchini and raisins. Pour the batter into the loaf pans. Bake for 55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the loaves cool in the pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Remove the loaves from the pans and let cool completely on wire racks.
