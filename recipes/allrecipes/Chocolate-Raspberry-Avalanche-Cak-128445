Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch cake pan (23 x 3.5-cm cake tin) with nonstick spray. In a large bowl, combine flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup yogurt, oil, and vanilla extract. In a small bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in remaining 1/2 cup sugar until stiff peaks form. Stir yogurt mixture into flour mixture just until moistened. Fold in egg whites. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle evenly with 1 cup raspberries. Bake 40 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in the pan on a rack 10 minutes. Remove from the pan and cool completely. Cut into 12 squares. In another small bowl, mix honey, water, and remaining 1/4 cup cocoa. In another medium bowl, mix remaining 1/2 cup yogurt and preserves. Serve each square with a dollop of raspberry cream and a drizzle of chocolate sauce.
