Using blender or whisk, mix eggs, canola oil and milk until blended. Add flour, sugar and salt continue to blend until mixed well. Brush medium frying pan or crepe pan with canola oil. Heat pan on medium high heat. Quickly pour about 3 tablespoons of batter into pan and tilt in all directions until coated evenly. Cook for about 1 minute and remove from pan. Place wax paper between each crepe to prevent sticking. Serve warm with a variety of toppings, or prepare ahead and refrigerate for up to 2 days. Crepes may also be frozen for up to 1 month.
