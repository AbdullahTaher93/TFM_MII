Heat oven to 425 degrees F. In 8-inch skillet, cook sausage over medium heat, stirring frequently, until browned and no longer pink; drain. Set aside to cool. In medium bowl, mix both cheeses and chiles. Stir in cooled cooked sausage. In another medium bowl, beat eggs thoroughly with fork. Stir in salsa. Remove pie crusts from pouches; place flat on work surface. With rolling pin, roll each crust into 12-inch round. With 3 1/2-inch round cutter, cut 22 rounds from crusts, rerolling scraps as necessary. Press each round into ungreased muffin cup or fluted tartlet pan. Spoon 1 heaping tablespoon cheese mixture into each crust-lined cup. Top each with about 1 tablespoon egg mixture; divide any remaining egg mixture between cups. Bake 14 to 18 minutes or until filling is set. If desired, garnish with fresh cilantro. Serve warm.
