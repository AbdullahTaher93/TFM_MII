In a bowl, combine the first six ingredients. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Shape into 1-1/2-in. balls. In a skillet, combine the tomato juice, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, cloves and cinnamon. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; add the meatballs. Cover and simmer for 50 minutes or until the meat is no longer pink, stirring occasionally. Discard the cloves before serving.
