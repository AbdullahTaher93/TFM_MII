Stir mayonnaise, olives, tomato paste, horseradish, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and chipotle pepper powder together in a bowl. Crumble egg yolks into mayonnaise mixture. Chop whites and stir into mayonnaise mixture until dressing is thick and creamy. Season with kosher salt and pepper as needed, cover with plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator until flavors blend, at least 30 minutes.
