Saute the onion and garlic in the oil (or butter). When the onion becomes translucent, add the flour and make a roux. Let the oil and flour mixture cook for about a minute before adding chicken broth. Add the carrots, celery and chicken into the roux. Simmer until vegetables are tender, then add spinach. Cook gnocchi according to package directions. Add the coconut milk to the chicken and vegetables sauce. Once mixture thickens again, add the cooked gnocchi and seasonings. Top with Parmesan if desired and serve immediately.
