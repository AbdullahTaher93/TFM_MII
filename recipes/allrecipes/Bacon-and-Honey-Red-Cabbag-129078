In a Dutch oven or large, deep skillet, heat a drizzle of EVOO over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook until crisp, about 5 minutes; remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the onion to the pan and cook until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the cabbage, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring frequently, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the beer and reduce for 2 minutes. Stir in the honey and cook on low heat until dissolved. Simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in the parsley and reserved bacon; season to taste.
