Sprinkle chicken lightly with salt and pepper. In a large skillet cook chicken in hot oil over medium-high heat for 8 to 10 minutes or until no longer pink (170 degrees F), turning once. Remove chicken from skillet; cover and keep warm. Cook mushrooms, sweet pepper, and garlic in same skillet until just tender (add more oil, if needed). For sauce, use a whisk to combine LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, flour, and pepper. Carefully add to skillet. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir 1 minute more. Stir in sherry, if desired. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add chicken; heat through. Place rice on a serving platter. Top with chicken, vegetables, and sauce.
