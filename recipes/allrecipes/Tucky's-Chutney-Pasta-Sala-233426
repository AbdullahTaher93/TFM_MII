Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Rinse spaghetti with cold water to cool; drain. Stir spaghetti, apples, bell pepper, shrimp, mango chutney, mayonnaise, and raisins together in a large bowl. Top with peanuts.
