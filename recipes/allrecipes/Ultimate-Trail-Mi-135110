Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the nuts and oats in a bowl and coat lightly with cooking spray (about 3 shots). Drizzle with 1 Tbsp honey and add the cinnamon, stirring to mix. Spread the nuts evenly on a pan and toast for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once they've cooled, stir in the second tablespoon of honey, and mix in the dried fruit. Divide into 1/4 c servings, place each in a ziploc bag, and keep a stash at work or in the car.
