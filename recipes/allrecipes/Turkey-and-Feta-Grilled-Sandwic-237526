Put turkey slices atop one bread slice; top with lettuce and feta cheese. Spread Italian salad dressing over one side of the second bread slice and lay atop the other slice with the dressing facing downward. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook sandwich in melted butter until browned, about 2 minutes per side.
