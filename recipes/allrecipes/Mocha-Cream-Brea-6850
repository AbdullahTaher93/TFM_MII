Place all ingredients, except for the semi-sweet chocolate chips, into the bread machine in the proper order for your machine. Use dough cycle. At end of dough cycle, remove dough, and place on lightly-floured board. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten. Roll out dough into a rectangle, sprinkle with miniature chocolate chips, and roll up into a loaf. Place dough into greased loaf pan, cover and let rise for 45 minutes. Slash loaf with a razor or a lame. Bake in preheated 375 degree F (190 degrees C) oven for 25-30 minutes. Remove loaf onto a cake rack and let cool.
