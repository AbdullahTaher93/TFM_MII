Slice the top off of each tomato. Hollow out each tomato with a spoon, leaving a 1/2 to 1/4 inch shell. Place tomato pulp in a large bowl. Stir the vinegar and olive oil into the pulp, mixing to break up any large pieces. Season with salt and pepper. Evenly spoon the filling into the tomato shells. Refrigerate for at least 10 minutes before serving.
