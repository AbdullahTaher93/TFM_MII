Preheat the oven to 425 degrees (see footnote for microwave preparation). On a baking pan, place pepperoni slices evenly in rows. Sprinkle dried garlic powder and dried parsley on top of the pepperoni. May also add parmesan cheese and fennel seeds. Place the pan inside the oven and bake for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from pan, and let cool for 30 seconds. Plate to serve with the dipping sauce. Can also be stored for future snacking refrigerated in an airtight container.
