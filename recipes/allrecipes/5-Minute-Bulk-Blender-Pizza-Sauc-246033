Blend tomato sauce, olive oil, sugar, thyme, basil, oregano, shallots, garlic powder, salt, and baking soda together in a blender on high until sauce is smooth and well-mixed, 1 to 2 minutes. Divide sauce among twelve 1/2-cup freezer-safe containers; store in freezer until ready to use. Remove individual containers from freezer to thaw before using, about 60 minutes.
