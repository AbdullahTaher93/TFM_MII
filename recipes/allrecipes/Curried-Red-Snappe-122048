Place the fish in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. In a skillet, saute onions and celery in butter until tender. Add curry powder and salt; mix well. Remove from the heat; stir in milk. Spoon over fish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
