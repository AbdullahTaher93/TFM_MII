In a small saucepan, combine butter, oil and chocolate. Cook over low heat, stirring until chocolate melts. Add water; cool 15 minutes. In another bowl, combine remaining cake ingredients and beat well (*To sour milk, add 1-1/2 teaspoons vinegar to milk; let stand 5 minutes.) Fold chocolate mixture into batter. Pour into two greased and floured 8-in. cake pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until cakes test done. Cool in pans 5 minutes. Meanwhile, for filling, combine milk, sugar and water in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Add raisins and dates. Cook until thickened, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; add vanilla and nuts. Cool. For frosting, melt chips in top of a double boiler over hot water. Remove from heat. Stir in sour cream and salt; beat with a spoon until smooth. Cool 5 minutes or until frosting is of spreading consistency. Place one cake layer, upside down, on a plate. Spread filling on top and place other layer over. Frost entire cake. Chill 1 hour before serving. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream if desired.
