Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). P Place 1/2 cup butter in a shallow microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave until melted, about 30 seconds. Mix crushed crackers into the melted butter. Dip haddock in cracker mixture until coated on both sides. Transfer to a shallow baking dish. Bake haddock in the preheated oven until flesh flakes easily with a fork, about 25 minutes. Place remaining 1/4 cup butter in a small microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave until melted, about 15 seconds. Stir in honey and parsley until blended. Remove haddock from the oven; drizzle honey butter on top. Continue baking until top is browned, about 5 minutes more.
