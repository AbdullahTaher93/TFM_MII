Season pork tenderloin with salt and black pepper. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add pork to hot oil and cook until browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Add onions, red bell peppers, and garlic to pork; cook and stir until onion is slightly tender, about 10 minutes. Stir tomatoes with green chile peppers, kidney beans, beef broth, green chile peppers, chili powder, basil, and cumin into pork mixture. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover Dutch oven, and simmer, stirring every 15 minutes, until pork is tender and falling apart, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Stir edamame, corn, and carrots into stew; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Break pork into pieces using the flat edge of a wooden spoon creating a 'shredded' texture.
