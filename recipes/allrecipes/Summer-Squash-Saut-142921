Heat garlic, oil, and red-pepper flakes in large saute pan over medium heat, 2 to 3 minutes, or until garlic begins to turn golden. Add squash and salt. Toss to coat. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until squash begins to break apart. Uncover, increase heat to medium, and cook 10 to 12 minutes longer or until liquid is almost gone.
