In a large pot, melt the butter over moderately low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in the minced ginger and the cabbage and cook for 1 minute longer. Add the broth, potatoes, smashed ginger, and 1 teaspoon of the salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the pork and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Cook until the pork is just done, about 3 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and parsley. Remove the pieces of smashed ginger before serving.
