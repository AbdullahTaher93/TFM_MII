Cook and stir onion, brown sugar, and vinegar in a skillet over medium heat until onion is golden, about 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 6-muffin tin with cooking spray. Whisk egg whites and eggs in a large measuring cup. Fill each muffin cup halfway with egg mixture. Scatter onion, Gouda cheese, and prosciutto cubes on top. Cover with remaining egg mixture, leaving 1/4-inch space at the top for eggs to rise. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 20 minutes.
