Place a large glass bowl over a pan of simmering water. Melt chocolate, stirring occasionally. Do next two steps while chocolate melts. In a chilled, clean medium-sized bowl, beat the cream with an electric mixer on high speed until it holds medium peaks. Set aside. If using the same set of beaters for the next step, be sure to clean and dry them thoroughly between steps. In another clean, medium-sized bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on high speed until it holds medium peaks. Set aside. Mix the yolks and sugar with the melted chocolate. Fold in 1/3 of the egg whites first to lighten the mix, then add the remaining 2/3 of the egg whites and fold gently. Add the whipped cream and mix. Serve in martini glasses and let chill until ready to serve.
