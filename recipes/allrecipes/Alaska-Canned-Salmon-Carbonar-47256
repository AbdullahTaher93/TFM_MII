Break salmon into bite-sized pieces; set aside. Cook pasta according to package directions; drain and keep warm. In 3-quart saucepan, cook bacon until crisp. Drain, reserving about 2 tablespoons fat. Add tomatoes, onion, vinegar, garlic, basil, oregano and peppers. Cook 5 minutes or until slightly thickened. Stir in salmon pieces and cream; heat through. Serve over hot cooked pasta. Garnish with cheese.
