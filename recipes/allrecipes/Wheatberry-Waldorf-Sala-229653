Place wheat berries in a bowl, cover with water, and allow to soak for 5 minutes. Drain. Transfer into a large saucepan and stir in 6 cups water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until wheat berries are tender, 60 to 80 minutes. Pour in more water if wheat becomes dry. Drain and set aside to cool. Mix wheat berries with apples, raisins, walnuts, parsley, pomegranate seeds, apple juice, vinegar, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, black pepper, nutmeg, and cinnamon in a salad bowl. Can be chilled overnight if desired.
