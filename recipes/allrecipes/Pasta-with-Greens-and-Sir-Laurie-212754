Reserve the leafy part with the rapini flowers and the stems with the rapini stems. In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat and add the garlic. When the garlic is browned, remove it and discard. Add the leeks and pancetta to the garlic-flavoured oil and cook until the leek is softened and the pancetta is lightly browned. Add the vegetable stems, the stock and the salt and pepper. Cover and cook 4 minutes. Add the chard leaves and rapini flowers and cook, covered, another 2 minutes. Cook the pasta in boiling salted water until al dente. Drain the pasta, return it to the pot and add the vegetable mixture. Toss gently and add the Sir Laurier cheese at the last minute. Transfer to a serving dish and top with the pine nuts.
