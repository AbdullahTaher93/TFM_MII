Pour tomato sauce into a large skillet. Add sugar; mix until dissolved. Combine beef, rice, Worcestershire sauce, and egg into a large bowl; season with salt and pepper. Mix until well blended. Form into 1-inch balls; place into the skillet. Spoon some of the sauce over meatballs. Cook over medium heat until sauce begins to bubble. Cover; reduce heat to low. Cook for 20 minutes or until meat is no longer pink.
