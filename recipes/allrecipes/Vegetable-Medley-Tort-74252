Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a 9 inch square greased baking dish, arrange Mann's Vegetable Medley in a single layer. Top with even layers of potato, green onions, pimiento and cheese. In a medium bowl, combine eggs, milk, salt and pepper; whisking to blend. Pour over vegetable mixture. Bake until the vegetables are crisp-tender and lightly browned on top, about 45 minutes. Insert a knife into the center of the torta. If the knife shows no evidence of uncooked egg, the torta is cooked thoroughly. Let cool 5-10 minutes before cutting into squares. Serve hot, at room temperature or cold, with salsa as an accompaniment.
