Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Stir flour, half-and-half, vegetable oil, and Sriracha sauce together in a bowl to form a lumpy dough. Roll dough into 2-inch balls and place on a baking sheet. Bake biscuits in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Brush melted butter and sprinkle salt on top of each biscuit.
