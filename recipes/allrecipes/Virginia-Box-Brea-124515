In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add eggs, sugar, salt, butter and 2 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours. Punch the dough down. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 13-in. x 9-in. rectangle. Transfer dough to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Using a sharp knife, cut dough into 14 even squares. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20 minutes or until golden brown. To serve, separate into rolls.
