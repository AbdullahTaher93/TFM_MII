Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large loaf pan. Mix tuna, cream of chicken soup, milk, cracker crumbs, bread crumbs, onion, egg, and black pepper until thoroughly combined and spoon the mixture into the prepared bread pan. Smooth top. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the loaf comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.
