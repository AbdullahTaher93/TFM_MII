Spoon sour cream into a quart size heavy plastic ziptop bag; chill. Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for direct heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is directly under the food). Rinse peppers and cut in half lengthwise through stems. Scoop out seeds and veins. In a bowl, mix cheese, tomato, onion, cilantro and salt. Spoon mixture evenly into pepper halves, pressing it into hollows. Lay filled peppers, cheese side up, on grill over a solid bed of medium hot coals or medium high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand just above grill level for only 3 to 4 seconds). Keep charcoal grill uncovered; close lid on gas grill. Cook peppers until blistered and slightly charred on the bottoms, 3 to 5 minutes. With a wide spatula, transfer peppers to a clean platter. Snip off a corner of the sour cream bag to make a 3/4 inch opening; squeeze sour cream equally over the hot peppers and serve.
