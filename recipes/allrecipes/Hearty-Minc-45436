Melt margarine in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat, and stir in the ground beef and onion. Cook until onion is tender and beef is evenly browned. Reduce heat to low. In a medium bowl, mix tomato juice, water, beef stock, Worcestershire sauce, celery salt, and pepper. Pour into the beef mixture. Stir pasta into the skillet. Cover, and simmer 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the mixture from heat, and stir in sour cream and sherry. Sprinkle with parsley to serve.
