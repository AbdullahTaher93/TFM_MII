Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine graham cracker crumbs, powdered sugar and butter in a bowl. Spread evenly onto bottom of springform pan. Bake 5 minutes; cool. Beat cream cheese in a mixer bowl until smooth. Gradually add sugar and beat until light. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Transfer 1 cup mixture to a separate bowl and blend in pumpkin, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and Kahlua. Pour half of pumpkin mixture into prepared crust, then top with half of cream cheese mixture. Repeat layers using remaining pumpkin and cream cheese mixtures. Using table knife, cut through layers with uplifting motion in five places to create marbled effect. Place springform pan on baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes. Turn off oven, but do not open oven door. Let cake stand in warm oven 1 hour. Remove cake from oven, cool to room temperature, then refrigerate. Remove from pan before serving.
