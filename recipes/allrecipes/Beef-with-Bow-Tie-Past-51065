Trim fat from beef. Cut beef with grain into 2-inch strips; cut strips across grain into 1/8-inch slices. (For easier cutting, partially freeze beef about 1 hour.) Spray 12-inch skillet with cooking spray; heat over medium heat. Cook asparagus, onions and 1 cup of the broth in skillet 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until liquid has evaporated; remove mixture from skillet. Add beef to skillet. Cook about 2 minutes over medium heat, stirring frequently, until beef is no longer pink. Return asparagus mixture to skillet. Stir in remaining broth and remaining ingredients except cheese. Cook about 2 minutes, stirring frequently, until mixture is hot. Sprinkle with cheese.
