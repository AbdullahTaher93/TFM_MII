Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In medium bowl, mix chicken, 1/4 cup chutney, the mustard, sliced onions and yogurt with fork until well blended. Refrigerate until needed. Cut 4 (12-inch) squares of heavy-duty foil. Place 1 foil square on work surface; fold into thirds to make a triple-thick 12x4-inch strip. Starting with one 4-inch end, roll foil strip into tube with 1 1/4-inch inside diameter. Repeat with remaining foil squares. Unroll dough; separate into 4 rectangles, pressing perforations to seal. Place 1 foil tube on one short side of each rectangle; roll dough around tube. Place seam side down 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Sprinkle each evenly with lemon-dill seasoning and pepper. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from cookie sheet; place on wire rack. Cool 5 minutes. To remove foil from each crescent cannoli, grasp inside corner of foil and pull to uncoil foil from dough. Cool 5 minutes longer. Fill each crescent cannoli with 1/2 cup chicken mixture; place on individual plate. Place any extra chicken mixture near open ends of each cannoli. To garnish, cut off white ends from 4 green onions; save for later use. Cut each green portion lengthwise into 2 strips; tie ends of each pair to form a knot. Place knot on top of each cannoli, tucking ends under sides. Spoon 1 teaspoon chutney onto plate at side of each cannoli.
