In a large bowl, combine dry ingredients. In another bowl, beat eggs, buttermilk and oil; mix well. Stir into dry ingredients just until blended. Pour batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto a lightly greased hot griddle; turn when bubbles form on top of pancakes. Cook until second side is golden. Meanwhile, for syrup, combine sugar, butter and corn syrup in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat; boil and stir for 5 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the heat; stir in buttermilk and vanilla. Let stand 5 minutes. Stir; serve with pancakes.
