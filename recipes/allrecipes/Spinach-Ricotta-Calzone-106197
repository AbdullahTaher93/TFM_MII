Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). On a floured surface, roll out each piece of dough into a 6-inch circle. Cover with a damp cloth and set aside. In a large bowl, mix together ricotta cheese, eggs, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, spinach, Italian seasoning and salt and pepper. Spoon about 1/3 cup of the filling onto each circle, leaving a 1-inch border along the bottom half of the dough circle. With wet fingertips, moisten the bottom border. Fold dough over filling; press to seal. Place on a large parchment-lined cookie sheet. Bake in preheated oven for about 30 minutes, or until golden brown.
