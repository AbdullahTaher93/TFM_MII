Place the sazon seasoning, black pepper and garlic powder into a large resealable plastic zipper bag, pour in the beer, and seal the bag. Smush the bag around with your fingers for a few seconds to mix the beer with the seasonings, and place the chicken thighs into the marinade. Reseal the bag, squeezing as much air out as possible, and refrigerate at least 6 hours or overnight. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from marinade, and reserve marinade. Grill chicken until no longer pink inside, the juices run clear, and the chicken has good grill marks, 5 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Pour the reserved marinade into a saucepan over medium-high heat, bring to a boil, and cook until the marinade is reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Mix in the barbecue sauce, and slather over chicken to serve.
