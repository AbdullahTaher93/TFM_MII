Combine turkey, mushrooms, and zucchini in a 13x9-inch dish. Pour Italian dressing over mixture and stir to coat. Cover dish with plastic wrap; marinade in refrigerator 2 hours to overnight. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Thread turkey, mushrooms, and zucchini slices onto skewers until all the ingredients have been used. Discard excess marinade. Cook the skewers on the preheated grill, turning frequently until nicely browned on all sides, and the meat is no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes.
