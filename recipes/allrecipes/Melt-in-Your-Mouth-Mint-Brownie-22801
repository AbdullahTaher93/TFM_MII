Prepare brownie mix according to package directions. Spread into a 9x13 inch pan and bake as directed. Unwrap mint wafer candies while brownies are baking in the oven. When the brownies are done, place mint wafer candies side by side onto the top of the hot brownies and let them sit for a minute to soften. Using a knife or spatula, gently swirl melted candy over surface of brownies. Allow to cool a few hours so the candy hardens. Cut into bars.
