With the skin still on the garlic cloves, drop them into a small pan of boiling water and cook for 5-6 minutes. Drain and let cool for a minute. Remove the skins (if they are still on) and smash the garlic in a small bowl making a paste. Add the mustard, vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper. Blend well. Whisk in the olive oil.
