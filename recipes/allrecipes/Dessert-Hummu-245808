Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread white and black poppy seeds on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly roasted and fragrant, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer poppy seeds to a blender or mortar and pestle and grind into a fine flour. Add 1 1/2 cup coconut water and butter; blend until paste is creamy and has a pourable consistency. Add enough honey to make paste moderately sweet. Place macadamia nuts, 1/4 cup coconut water, lemon juice, orange juice, ginger, lime juice, olive oil, sugar, mint, poppyseed oil, orange zest, and salt in a food processor or blender. Add 1 1/2 cup poppy seed paste; blend until hummus is smooth. Transfer hummus to a serving bowl. Mix cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and nutmeg together in a small bowl to make spice topping. Sprinkle over hummus.
