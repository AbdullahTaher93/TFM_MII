The shrimp should be cooked and have the shells removed. Chill for 1 hour. For the dressing, remove the stem and seeds from the jalapeno pepper and finely mince. Put the mayonnaise, ketchup, relish, horseradish, lemon juice and jalapeno into a jar with a well sealing lid. Shake well. Alternatively, mix dressing ingredients in a food processor. Cut the celery lengthwise then slice on an angle. Slice, chop or mince the bell pepper. Chop or mince the scallions. In a bowl, toss together the shrimp, celery, bell peppers and scallions. Add enough of the dressing to well coat everything (perhaps all of it). On four individual plates, place the mixed greens, then the shrimp mixture. Garnish with the red pepper flakes and serve.
