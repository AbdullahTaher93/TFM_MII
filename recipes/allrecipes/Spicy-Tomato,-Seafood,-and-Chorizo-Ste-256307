Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add onion, peppers, and garlic; cook and stir until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Add ground chorizo to pan and cook and stir, crumbling, until browned and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat. Pour chicken stock into a large soup pot. Add Hunt's tomatoes, Mexican corn, cumin, chipotle, and softened onion-peppers-garlic mixture. Stir to combine, then simmer for 10 minutes to blend flavors. Stir in cod, shrimp, and reserved chorizo and continue to simmer until fish and shrimp are cooked, about 5 to 7 minutes. Ladle into serving bowls. Serve with fresh chopped green onions, chopped cilantro, and lime wedges.
