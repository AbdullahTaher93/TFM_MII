In a small skillet, over a low heat, dry roast the 3/4 teaspoon coriander, 1/4 teaspoon fennel, and 1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds individually until an aroma is starting to be given off. Combine all these with the curry leaves, and over a low heat, dry roast for about 5 minutes more. Do not burn Grind the spices and leaves using a mortar and pestle or a clean coffee grinder. Set aside. Place potato cubes in a microwave-safe bowl, and microwave until about 1/2 cooked (time depends on individual microwave), about 3 to 5 minutes. In a large skillet, melt the ghee over medium heat. Cook the onion, garlic, and ginger in the ghee until golden and aromatic. Meanwhile, grind the remaining coriander and cumin seeds; add with one teaspoon fresh curry powder (prepared in the first step) to the onions and garlic. Cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Stir in the potatoes, and cook for 3 minutes. Stir in the coconut milk, bring to a simmer, and then reduce heat to low. Cover, and cook until potatoes are tender, about 7 minutes. Season with salt to taste. Top with chopped fresh cilantro, and serve.
