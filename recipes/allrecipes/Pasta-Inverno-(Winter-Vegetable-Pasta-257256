Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 9 minutes. Drain. Heat olive oil in a deep skillet over high heat. Add winter squash, onion, and red bell pepper; cook, stirring with a wooden spoon and scraping the bottom of the skillet, until browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, green beans, olives, and garlic. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until green beans are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir spinach, red wine vinegar, sugar, basil, salt, and black pepper into the skillet. Cook and stir until spinach starts to wilt, about 1 minute. Add drained pasta; cook and stir until tender and coated with sauce, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top and toss well.
