Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil. Add pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, and add pasta to a large bowl. Stir in eggs, carrots, peas, shrimp, and crab meat. Cover, and refrigerate. To make dressing, stir together mayonnaise, milk, lemon juice, and sugar. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and paprika. Mix dressing into chilled pasta, stirring until well combined. If the salad seems dry, stir in more mayonnaise and a splash more milk or water. Cover, and chill before serving.
