Place chili in a large skillet over medium heat. Place bacon pieces on a paper towel and microwave for 30 seconds to crisp up. Fold bacon into the chili. Flatten mixture with the back of a spoon. Make 4 indentations big enough to fit an egg. Break eggs into indentations. Cover and continue to cook until eggs are done as desired (about 12 minutes). To serve, use a large spoon to scoop up an egg with a portion of chili and bacon for each serving. Sprinkle with chopped scallions.
