Bring 1/4 cup water to a boil with the sugar, thyme and rosemary, stirring, until the sugar dissolves. Let the mixture cool, then strain into a pitcher; discard the herbs. Stir in the rum and lemon juice. Pour into highball glasses filled with ice and top each with sparkling water and a lemon wedge.
