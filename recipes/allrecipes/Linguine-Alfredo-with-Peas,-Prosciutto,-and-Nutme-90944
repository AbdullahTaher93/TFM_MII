In a 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat, bring about 3 quarts of water to boiling. In another 1 1/2- to 2-quart pan, whisk together the alfredo sauce and white wine. Place over low heat and stir occasionally until hot. While water and sauce heat, cut prosciutto into fine slivers. Pour oil into an 8- to 10-inch nonstick pan. Add slivered prosciutto; stir often over medium-high heat until prosciutto is lightly browned and crisp, about 7 minutes. Remove from pan with a slotted spoon and let drain on a paper towel. When water boils, add linguine and cook 2 minutes. Add peas and continue to boil until pasta is cooked and peas are tender-crisp to bite, 1 to 2 more minutes. Drain pasta and peas well, then return them to the 5- to 6-quart pan. Add heated sauce and toss gently until pasta is coated. Arrange pasta on a serving platter or individual plates. Sprinkle lightly to taste with nutmeg, then top with browned prosciutto.
