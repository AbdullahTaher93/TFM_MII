In a greased roasting pan, combine the popcorn, cereals and nuts. In a saucepan, bring the brown sugar, butter and corn syrup to a boil. Boil until a candy thermometer reads 250 degrees F (hard-ball stage), about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat; immediately stir in vanilla and baking soda. Drizzle over popcorn mixture; toss to coat. Transfer to a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake, uncovered, at 250 degrees F for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes.
