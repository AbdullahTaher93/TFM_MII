Mix together the yogurt, mayonnaise, lime juice, cilantro, cayenne pepper, and salt in a bowl until smooth. Place the corned beef in a saucepan over medium-low heat just until hot. Place a tortilla into a heavy skillet over medium heat until hot and just beginning to show brown spots, about 30 seconds per side. To assemble, arrange about 2 tablespoons of coleslaw on a tortilla; follow with 3 tablespoons of corned beef. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the yogurt sauce; roll up to serve.
