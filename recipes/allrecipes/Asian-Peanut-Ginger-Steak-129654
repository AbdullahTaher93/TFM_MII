Mix marinade, peanut butter, ginger, lime peel and juice with wire whisk until well blended. Reserve 1/4 cup of the marinade mixture to serve with the cooked steak. Place steaks in resealable plastic bag. Pour 1/2 cup of the marinade mixture over steaks; seal bag. Turn over several times to evenly coat steak. Refrigerate 30 minutes to marinate. Remove steaks from marinade; discard marinade. Preheat grill to medium heat. Grill steaks 4 to 6 minutes on each side for medium rare (145 degrees F) to medium doneness (160 degrees F), brushing frequently with the remaining marinade mixture. Cut each steak in half. Serve with the 1/4 cup reserved marinade mixture.
