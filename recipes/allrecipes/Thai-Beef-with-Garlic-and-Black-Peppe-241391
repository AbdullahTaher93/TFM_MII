Stir fish sauce and garlic together in a large glass bowl. Add beef slices and toss to coat. Marinate meat for 15 minutes. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons sesame oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Carefully add about 1/4 of the beef slices to the oil and saute until mostly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Season beef with 1 tablespoon pepper and about 1/4 of the cilantro; continue cooking until the beef is no longer pink, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove beef with a slotted spoon to a serving platter and repeat process with remaining ingredients.
