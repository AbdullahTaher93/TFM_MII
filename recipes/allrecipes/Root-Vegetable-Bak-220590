Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Combine red potatoes, yam, carrots, parsnip, jicama, and turnips in a large baking dish. Mix rosemary, olive oil, garlic, and sea salt in a small bowl; pour over vegetables and toss to coat. Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are tender, 35 to 45 minutes.
