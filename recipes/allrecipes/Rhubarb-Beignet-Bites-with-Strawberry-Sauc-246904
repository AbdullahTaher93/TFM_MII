Place rhubarb, white sugar, and water in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook until rhubarb is tender, about 5 minutes. Strain rhubarb, reserving sugar syrup. Combine buttermilk, egg, and melted butter in a bowl. Stir in cooked rhubarb. Mix flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir in buttermilk and rhubarb mixture until batter is thick and smooth. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spoon batter into a resealable plastic bag; snip a large hole in one corner. Working in batches, squeeze 1-inch lengths of batter into hot oil. Fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Stir strawberries into reserved sugar syrup to make sauce. Serve sauce alongside beignets.
