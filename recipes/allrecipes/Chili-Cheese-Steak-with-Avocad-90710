Rinse steak and pat dry. Cut into 4 equal pieces. Set an 11- to 12-inch frying pan with ovenproof handle over high heat; when pan is hot, add oil and tilt to coat pan bottom. Add steak and cook, turning pieces once, until browned but still rare in center (cut to test), 6 to 7 minutes total. Remove steaks from pan, leaving any juices in pan, and transfer to a plate. Remove pan from heat and add tequila and vinegar; be careful -- mixture will boil vigorously. (If it doesn't, return pan to heat until boiling.) Off the heat, return steaks to pan. Lay chilies equally on steaks; top with cheese slices. Broil steaks in pan 4 inches from heat just until cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes. While steaks broil, pit, peel, and thickly slice avocado. Transfer steaks to plates. Spoon pan juices around meat. Arrange avocado equally on portions. Add salt and pepper to taste.
