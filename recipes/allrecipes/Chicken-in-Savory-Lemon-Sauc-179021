Spray a 12-inch nonstick skillet with the cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Add the chicken and cook until it's well browned on both sides. Add the soup, water, pepper, parsley, lemon juice and paprika to the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Top with the lemon slices.
