Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Line 15x10-inch baking pan with sides with foil. Place salmon diagonally, skin side down, in foil-lined pan. Stir together brown sugar, maple syrup, chile powder and soy sauce. Spread over salmon. Sprinkle with pecans. Roast 15 to 20 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Let stand 5 minutes before lifting salmon onto serving platter, leaving skin behind.
