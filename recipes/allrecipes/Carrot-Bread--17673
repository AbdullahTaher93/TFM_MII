Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Combine eggs, oil and milk; stir into flour mixture until well blended. Stir in carrots, coconut, cherries, raisins and walnuts. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let cool on a wire rack for ten minutes before removing from the pan to cool completely. Store in plastic wrap to keep moist.
