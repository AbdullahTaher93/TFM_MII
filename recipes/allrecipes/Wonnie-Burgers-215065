Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Mix the ground beef, pork sausage, Parmesan cheese, eggs, sweet onion, garlic, onion soup mix, Worcestershire sauce, kosher salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until evenly incorporated. Shape into 10 patties. Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked through and no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
