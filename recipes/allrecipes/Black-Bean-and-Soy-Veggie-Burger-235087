Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Blend shelled edamame, black beans, vegetable broth, ricotta cheese, egg whites, and garlic in a blender or food processor until smooth; transfer to a bowl. Stir wheat bran, oats, turmeric, chili powder, cloves, oregano, basil, Italian seasoning, and salt into bean mixture; form into 7 patties and place on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes; flip and continue baking until patties are lightly browned and cooked through, about 20 more minutes.
