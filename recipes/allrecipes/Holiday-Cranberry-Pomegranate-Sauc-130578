Mix the cranberries, sugar, orange juice, orange zest, ground cloves, and cinnamon sticks together in a saucepan. Bring to a boil. Lower heat to medium, and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and cool. Stir the pomegranate seeds into the cranberry mixture, and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight. Remove the cinnamon sticks before serving.
