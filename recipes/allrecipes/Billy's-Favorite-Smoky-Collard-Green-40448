Heat oil in a large pot. Saute onion and garlic until onions are translucent. Place chopped collard greens in pot, and add water to cover. Stir in brown sugar, molasses and liquid smoke. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 30 to 40 minutes, or until greens are tender.
