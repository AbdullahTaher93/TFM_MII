Preheat oven to 350 F. In medium skillet over medium heat, crumble and cook sausage until browned. Drain on paper towels. In large mixing bowl, combine sausage, corn muffin mix, eggs, corn, baking mix and milk. Pour into a greased 6x9x3-inch loaf pan and cover with foil. Bake for 45 minutes. Remove foil and bake for another 30 to 35 minutes or until browned. Cool 15 minutes and remove from pan. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 hour or overnight. Slice loaf into 8 slices. In large non-stick skillet over medium heat, add 2 Tbsp. oil. Fry corn cakes until golden brown on each side, about 4 to 6 minutes. Serve with syrup and butter.
