Place pomegranate juice in a saucepan and simmer over medium heat for about 10 minutes until reduced to 2 tablespoons. Stir in vinegar and sugar; cover and chill until ready to use. To prepare salad, arrange plum slices alternately with mozzarella on a platter. Drizzle with chilled pomegranate mixture and olive oil; sprinkle with basil and lemon zest. Serve as a salad or as an appetizer with grilled baguette slices.
