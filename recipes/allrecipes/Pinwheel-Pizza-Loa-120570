In a large bowl, beat the eggs, salt and pepper. Crumble beef over eggs and mix well. On a piece of heavy-duty foil, pat beef mixture into a 12-in. x 10-in. rectangle. Cover with ham and cheese to within 1/2 in. of edges. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a short side and peeling away foil while rolling. Seal seam and ends. Place the loaf seam side down in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Top with pizza sauce. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1-1/4 hours or until meat is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
