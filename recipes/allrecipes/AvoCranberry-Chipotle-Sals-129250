In a large bowl, combine the avocados, cranberries, red onion, tomatoes, and tomato juice. Gently stir, with a wooden spoon or your hand, just until blended. Gently stir in the chipotle puree or rocoto paste, lime juice. Add salt and pepper to taste. Let sit for about 20 minutes, and then stir in the cilantro and serve. Or, cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day. Return to room temperature and stir in the cilantro just before serving
