In a small mixing bowl, beat the mozzarella cheese, cream cheese, artichokes and garlic until blended. Unroll both tubes of crescent dough into rectangles. Place dough in an ungreased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan; press onto the bottom of pan, sealing seams and perforations. Spread with artichoke mixture. Bake at 375 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Cut into squares; serve warm.
