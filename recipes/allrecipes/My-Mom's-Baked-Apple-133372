Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Have a GH (Grown-Up Helper) cut a deep X on the stem part of each apple and trim the bottoms of the apples, if necessary, so they sit upright. Using a small pointy spoon, scoop halfway into each apple to remove the seeds and core and make a hole. Place the apples in a small baking dish. In a medium bowl, use your hands to mix the cereal with the cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, butter, walnuts and currants. Stuff the apples with the cereal mixture and bake until the apples are tender when pierced with a toothpick (ask a GH to test them), 30 to 35 minutes. Serve them hot, topped with vanilla ice cream, for an upside-down apple sundae. Yum-O!
