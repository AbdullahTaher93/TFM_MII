Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Rinse steak and pat dry. Pat salt, pepper, and garlic flakes evenly onto meat. Pour oil into an 8- to 10-inch ovenproof nonstick frying pan over high heat; tilt to coat pan. When oil is hot, add steak and brown on both sides, about 4 minutes total. Supporting meat with tongs, tip steak onto its edge and rotate to brown lightly, about 2 minutes total. As fat accumulates in pan, wipe it out with paper towels. Put pan with steak in oven and bake until meat is done to your liking, 8 to 12 minutes for rare or about 20 minutes for well done. Turn oven heat to broil. Remove pan and wipe out fat with a paper towel. Mound French Onions on meat and sprinkle with cheese. Broil in pan about 6 inches from heat until cheese bubbles and begins to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove pan from oven and pour broth around meat, stirring to release browned bits. To serve, cut meat and onions into 4 equal portions. Transfer to individual plates and spoon juices around meat.
