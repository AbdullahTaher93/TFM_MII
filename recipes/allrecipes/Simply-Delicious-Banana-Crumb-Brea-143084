Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour 8x4 inch loaf pan. Whisk together flour, sugar, and baking powder in a mixing bowl. With a pastry blender, cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Add the banana, and mix well. Fold the flour mixture into the banana mixture until combined. Pour batter into prepared pan. Prepare the crumb topping by combining the flour, brown sugar, oats, and cinnamon in a mixing bowl. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Spoon the crumb mixture over the batter. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), and bake until a toothpick inserted in center of the loaf comes out clean, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Cool in pan 10 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack.
