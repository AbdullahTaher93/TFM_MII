Rinse the kale well. Cut away the stems and center rib from the leafy greens and discard (or save for making stock). Cut or tear the kale into smaller pieces. If the kale dries off before you are ready to cook it, then dampen it again. The moisture is needed to create steam in the next step. Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and saute for about 2 minutes (do not let it burn). Add the cayenne, stir until coated and then add the kale. Toss with tongs and cook until completely wilted. Transfer to serving bowl. Toss in the sesame oil, toasted sesame seeds and salt & pepper. Serve immediately or cover and place in a warm oven until ready.
