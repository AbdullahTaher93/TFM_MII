In a saucepan, combine the first nine ingredients; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Set aside half of the sauce. Place chops on broiling pan rack. Broil about 4 in. from the heat for 4 minutes on each side. Brush with remaining sauce. Continue broiling, turning and basting occasionally, for 3-4 minutes or until juices run clear. Serve with reserved sauce.
