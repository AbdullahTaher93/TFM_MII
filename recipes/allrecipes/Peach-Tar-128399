In the bowl of a food processor, combine 1 1/2 cups (375 mL) of flour, 2 tablespoons (25 mL) of granulated sugar, and salt. Process until blended. Add 1/4 cup cold butter or margarine and cream cheese. Pulse until the mixture resembles cornmeal. Drizzle 3 tablespoons (45 mL) of water over the mixture. Pulse until a crumbly dough forms that will hold together when pressed. If needed, add up to 1 tablespoon more water. Pulse to combine. Turn the dough out onto a work surface. Shape into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat a 10-inch tart pan or pie pan with nonstick spray. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 13-inch circle. Drape it over the prepared pan. Gently press the dough against the sides of the pan, trimming any overhang. Prick the bottom and sides of the crust with a fork. Line with foil. Fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the weights and foil. Bake for 10 minutes longer, or until lightly golden. Remove to a rack to cool. Do not turn the oven off. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the peaches, the remaining 1/3 cup (75 mL) granulated sugar, and the remaining 2 tablespoons (25 mL) flour. Set aside. In a small bowl, combine the biscotti, almonds, brown sugar, and softened butter or margarine. Using your hands, combine to form coarse crumbs. Spoon the peach mixture into the tart shell. Sprinkle with the crumb topping. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the topping is golden and bubbly. Remove to a rack to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature.
