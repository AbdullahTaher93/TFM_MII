In a small bowl, combine the first three ingredients. Rub over both sides of chicken. Spray a medium, non-stick frying pan with cooking spray and cook chicken over medium heat for 6 to 7 minutes per side, or until juices run clear. Remove from heat and set aside. When cool, shred with two forks. In a jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine the vinegar, mustard, cayenne, ginger, oils, soy sauce, and salt/pepper. Shake vigorously. In a large serving bowl, toss the Cole slaw mix, pea pods, onion, and cherries. Add the shredded chicken and toss again. Pour dressing over the top and toss to coat. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.
