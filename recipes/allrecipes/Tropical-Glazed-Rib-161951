Cut meat into individual ribs. Place in a large resealable plastic bag. Combine 1/2 cup rice vinegar, soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger and garlic; mix well and pour over ribs. Close bag securely, turning to coat. Refrigerate 4 hours, turning halfway through. In a small bowl, combine remaining 2 tablespoons rice vinegar and jam. Reserve 1/4 cup for a dipping sauce, if desired. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Drain ribs and discard marinade. Place a rack on a foil-lined roasting pan or baking sheet. Arrange ribs, meaty side down, on rack; baste with jam mixture. Bake in upper portion of oven 20 minutes. Turn ribs over; baste liberally. Continue to bake 15 minutes or until well browned. Discard any remaining sauce used for basting. Serve ribs with reserved dipping sauce.
