Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat, and saute the onion until tender. Place the chicken in the pot, and cook until lightly browned. Puree the cilantro, garlic, and 1/3 cup water in a blender or food processor. Mix into the pot with the chicken and onions. Cook and stir about 5 minutes, until mixed and heated through. Pour enough water into the pot to cover all ingredients. Mix the hominy, rice, and bouillon into the pot. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer 20 minutes, or until rice is tender. Increase the amount of water as needed to attain desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.
