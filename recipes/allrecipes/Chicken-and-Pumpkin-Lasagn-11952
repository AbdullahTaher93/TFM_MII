Stir in Bolognese sauce; simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Spoon 1/3 meat sauce into a 2 quart casserole dish, cover with 3 uncooked noodles, and top with 1/3 soup mixture. Repeat twice. Sprinkle cheese over lasagna. Bake in a preheated 400 degree F (200 degree C) oven for 35 minutes, or until hot and bubbly. Remove from oven, and let stand 15 minutes before serving.
