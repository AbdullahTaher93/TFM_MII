Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine flour, 1cup sugar, baking powder, salt, canola oil, egg, vanilla and milk and blend until well mixed. In an oiled 9 x 13-inch cake pan arrange rhubarb and strawberries. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup sugar. If substituting pie filling you don't need to add the 1/2 cup sugar. Cover with cake mixture. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until the cake begins to brown.
