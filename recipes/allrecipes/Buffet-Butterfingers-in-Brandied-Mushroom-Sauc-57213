Prepare 'Please DO Eat the Daisies' Garnish: Cut each green onion into 6-inch length; chop remaining green ends and reserve for sauce. Remove outer skin from onions and carefully cut off the tip of the bulb. Cut thin slits lengthwise in bulb of each onion to fringe, forming petals. Insert a sliver of carrot into the center of each fringed onion (for the stamen). Place onion, blossom side down, in ice water and refrigerate (to crisp onion and curl petals). Divide each steak into 2 pieces, following natural seam and removing connective tissue between pieces. Refrigerate. Cook mushrooms in 1/4 cup butter in a large frying pan, 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add reserved chopped green onion; continue cooking 1 to 2 minutes stirring constantly. Add warm brandy, carefully ignite. Shake pan until flame is extinguished. Add Madeira and sherry; stir in flour, mustard, garlic, salt and pepper. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until lightly thickened. Keep warm. Quickly brown steaks (in batches) in remaining butter in large frying pan over medium heat 3 minutes per side for rare. Transfer steaks to warm serving platter. Add 3 tablespoons water to drippings in frying pan, stirring constantly. Stir in mushroom sauce; heat through. Pour over steaks. Scatter onion daisies over steaks and serve immediately.
