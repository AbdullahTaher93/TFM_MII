In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lime juice and cumin. Add to it the minced red onion, minced jalapeno pepper and cilantro. Toss. Remove any skin or bones from the cooked chicken. Cut into bite sized pieces and add to the dressing bowl. Toss well. This much can be made a day in advance and refrigerated, which will intensify the flavors. Remove from refrigerator 15 minutes before serving. Rinse and dry the romaine lettuce leaves. Slice or rip them into strips. Toss the lettuce with the chicken and dressing until well coated. Add the goat cheese and lightly toss again. Serve.
