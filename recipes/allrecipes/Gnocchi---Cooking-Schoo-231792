Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with 2 to 3 inches cold water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until tender, 30 to 35 minutes. A paring knife should easily insert into the center. Place on a towel to cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Peel potatoes and pass them through a ricer (or grate them on the small holes of a box grater) onto a work surface. Spread out potatoes and allow them to cool completely, about 10 minutes. Combine egg and salt in a small bowl. Transfer potatoes to a bowl; add egg mixture, 1 1/2 cups flour, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Stir until combined, taking care not to over-mix. Sprinkle 1/4 cup flour over a work surface and your hands. Knead dough gently until smooth but slightly sticky, 1 to 2 minutes. Add more flour as needed if the dough gets too sticky. Divide dough into 8 pieces. Roll each piece lightly into a rope, about 1/2-inch thick. Cut each rope into 1/2-inch pieces, adding more flour as needed. Take each gnocchi and roll along the tines of a fork, creating ridges. Place prepared gnocchi on a baking sheet dusted with flour. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; cook and stir 10 to 20 gnocchi at a time until they float to the top, about 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining gnocchi.
