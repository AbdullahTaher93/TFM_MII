In a large mixing bowl, combine the cake mix, pumpkin, eggs, oil, cinnamon, baking soda and cloves. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Fill paper-lined miniature muffin cups two-thirds full. Press a pecan piece into each. Bake at 350 degrees F for 17-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely. In a small mixing bowl, cream the butter, cream cheese and vanilla. Gradually add confectioners' sugar. Add enough milk to achieve spreading consistency. Frost cupcakes. Sprinkle with cinnamon.
