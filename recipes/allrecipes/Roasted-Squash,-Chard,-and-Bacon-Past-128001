Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Toss squash, onion, bacon, and rosemary with 2 tablespoons olive oil and spread in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast until tender and browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente. Place the chard in a large bowl. Put a colander over the bowl and drain pasta over chard. Let chard sit 1 minute; drain well and squeeze out excess water. Toss chard with pasta, squash mixture, and remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste. Toss with Parmesan cheese and serve.
