Cream the butter and sugar. Beat in the egg, vanilla and almond extracts. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Mix until well blended. Fold in the almonds and coconut. Cover dough and refrigerate for at least one hour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), and grease cookie sheets. Roll dough into 1/2 inch rolls and cut into 1 1/2 inch lengths. Bake 18 to 20 minutes, or until golden. Dip in confectioners' sugar and let cool.
