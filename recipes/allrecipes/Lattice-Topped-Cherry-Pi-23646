Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Combine 2 cups flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt in large bowl; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in enough water with fork just until flour is moistened. Divide dough in half; shape each half into ball. Wrap 1 ball of dough in plastic food wrap; refrigerate. Roll out remaining ball of dough into 12-inch circle on lightly floured surface. Place in 9 inch pie pan. Trim pastry to 1/2 inch from rim of pan. Set aside. Combine sugar, 1/3 cup flour and 1/8 teaspoon salt in large bowl. Add cherries and orange peel; toss lightly to coat. Spoon into prepared crust. Roll out remaining pastry ball to 11-inch circle. Cut circle into 10 (1/2-inch) strips with sharp knife or pastry wheel. Place 5 strips across filling in pie pan, 1 inch apart. Place remaining 5 strips at right angles, 1 inch apart, to the strips already in place; trim strips. Fold trimmed edge of bottom pastry over strips; build up an edge. Seal; crimp or flute edge. Brush strips with milk; sprinkle with sugar. Cover edge of crust with 2-inch strip of aluminum foil. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes or until crust is golden brown and filling bubbles in center. Remove aluminum foil during last 5 minutes, if desired. (If browning too quickly, shield lattice strips with aluminum foil.)
