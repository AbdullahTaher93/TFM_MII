Preheat the broiler. Coat a large baking sheet with sides with cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine the peaches, strawberries, honey, cinnamon, and allspice or cloves and toss to coat well. Place the fruit on the prepared baking sheet. Dot with the butter. Broil, turning the pan 2 or 3 times (no need to turn the fruit), for 4 minutes, or until the fruit is glazed, bubbly, and golden brown in spots. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly. Sprinkle with the mint, lemon verbena, or cinnamon basil, if using. Serve warm or at room temperature.
