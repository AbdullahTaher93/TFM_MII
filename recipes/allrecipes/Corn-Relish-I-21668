Cut the corn from the cobs. Scrape the cobs with a large spoon to remove remaining juices. In a large saucepan, mix the corn kernels and juice, tomatoes, green bell peppers, red bell peppers, cucumber and onion. In a medium bowl, mix the sugar, apple cider vinegar, salt, celery seed and mustard seed. Pour into the saucepan over vegetable mixture. Bring to a boil, then simmer 1 hour. Transfer the finished relish to sterile jars. Refrigerate until serving.
