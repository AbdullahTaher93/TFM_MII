In a large bowl, dissolve 2 tablespoons salt in 2 cups cold water. Add the pork chops to the brine and soak in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, place the sweet potatoes in a medium pot of salted water and bring to a low boil. Cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, garlic, jam and mustard. Whisk in 1/3 cup olive oil in a thin stream until smooth. Preheat the broiler and place a large, heavy ovenproof skillet over high heat. Remove the chops from the brine, pat dry and brush with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Sear the chops for 3 minutes on each side, then baste with one-quarter of the raspberry dressing. Broil, basting once, for 2 minutes on each side. In a medium bowl, toss the sweet potatoes, bell pepper and scallions with the remaining raspberry dressing; season to taste with salt. Serve each pork chop with some of the sweet-potato salad.
