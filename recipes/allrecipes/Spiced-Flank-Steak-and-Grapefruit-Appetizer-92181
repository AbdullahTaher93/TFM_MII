Trim fat and silvery membrane from steak. Mix cumin, mustard, cinnamon, cayenne, cloves, and 1/2 teaspoon salt, then rub mixture all over steak. Cover and chill at least 15 minutes or up to 2 days. Cut peel and white membrane from grapefruit. Over a bowl, cut between inner membranes and fruit to release segments. Broil steak on a rack in a pan about 4 inches from heat until rare in thickest part (cut to test), about 7 minutes, or medium-rare, about 9 minutes; turn once to cook evenly. Let meat stand at least 15 minutes. Up to 1 hour before serving, drain grapefruit and save juice for another use. Select 30 to 34 of the most attractive grapefruit segments and lay on towels to drain; lightly blot tops to dry. Save remaining fruit for other uses. Slice meat very thinly across the grain into 30 to 34 equal pieces. Wrap each grapefruit segment with a steak slice and set, seam down, on a platter. Tuck a mint leaf into each bundle. Add salt to taste. Serve, or wrap airtight and chill up to 1 hour.
