In a small bowl, combine the oil, vinegar, sugar, poppy seeds, mustard powder and garlic powder. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or more. For each serving, arrange 2 spinach leaves and Boston lettuce leaves on a salad plate. Top the leaves with 3 ounces of sliced turkey and 4 slices of the nectarine. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of raspberries and 1 tablespoon of the walnuts over the turkey and greens. Drizzle each serving with approximately 2 tablespoons of the reserved dressing.
