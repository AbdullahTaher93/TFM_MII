Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Whisk sugar, salt, paprika, turmeric, onion powder, and garlic powder together in a bowl. Spread cauliflower onto the prepared baking sheet; spray liberally with cooking spray. Season cauliflower with spice mixture. Roast in the preheated oven until cauliflower is tender, 30 to 35 minutes.
