Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners. Mix corn bread mix, milk, sour cream, honey, and eggs in a bowl until batter is well combined yet slightly lumpy; allow to rest for 5 minutes. Fill muffin cups 3/4 full with batter. Lightly sprinkle each muffin with sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until muffins are golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Brush tops of muffins with melted butter; repeat brushing muffins with butter 2 to 3 more times.
