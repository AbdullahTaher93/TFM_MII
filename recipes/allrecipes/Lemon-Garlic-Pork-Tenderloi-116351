In a resealable plastic bag, combine the oil, lemon juice, peel, garlic, oregano, salt and pepper; add pork. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Drain and discard marinade. Grill, covered, over medium coals for about 13-14 minutes on each side or until juices run clear and a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let stand for 5 minutes before slicing.
