Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Foil-line and grease baking sheets. Combine coconut, sweetened condensed milk and vanilla extract in large bowl. Stir in morsels. Drop by level tablespoon on prepared baking sheets; press each cookie lightly with back of spoon. Bake for 10 to 14 minutes or until lightly browned around edges. Remove to wire racks to cool completely. Store loosely covered at room temperature.
