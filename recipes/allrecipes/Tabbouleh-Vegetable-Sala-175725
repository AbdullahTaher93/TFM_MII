In a large bowl, combine bulgur, garlic, pepper, and 1 1/4 cups hot water. Let stand until cool, about 10 minutes. Add lemon juice, onion, and oil; let stand until bulgur is tender, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cut raw broccoli and peel and slice stalk into small pieces. Cut florets into about 3/4-inch pieces and coarsely chop the tender parts of the peeled, sliced broccoli stems. When bulgur is tender, stir in broccoli, parsley, garbanzos, and shredded carrot. Add salt to taste.
