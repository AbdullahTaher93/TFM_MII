Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add zucchini and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and scoop out seeds. In a medium bowl combine cream cheese, sour cream, Parmesan cheese and garlic. Spoon mixture into zucchini halves and sprinkle with paprika. Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until heated through.
