Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium sized bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and allspice. In a large bowl, with an electric mixer on medium, cream the sugar and butter until light yellow and fluffy. Add the molasses, egg whites, and egg; beat well. Using a wooden spoon, stir in flour mixture until flour disappears. Fold in raisins and nuts. Drop by tablespoons, 2 inches apart, onto lightly greased cookie sheets. Bake 8-9 minutes. Lightly sift confectioners' sugar over if you like.
