In a small saucepan, boil the chicken broth over medium-high heat until it is reduced to 1/4 cup (50 ml). Add the juice, mustard, garlic, rosemary, mustard powder, red pepper, and honey. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat. Use immediately or refrigerate until ready to use. Coat a grill rack with nonstick spray. Fire up the grill and heat for 10 minutes on medium-high. Place the rack on the grill. Grill the chicken for 4 minutes. Turn; grill for 1 minute. Brush with the pineapple-mustard glaze. Continue grilling the chicken until it is cooked through, about 3 to 5 minutes longer, brushing with the glaze.
