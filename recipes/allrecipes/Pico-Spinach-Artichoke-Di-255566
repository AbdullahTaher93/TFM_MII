Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Mix both packages of cream cheese and mayonnaise together in a bowl until smooth. Fold in artichoke hearts, pico de gallo, spinach, Parmesan cheese, Romano cheese, and garlic. Spread cream cheese mixture in the prepared baking dish. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbly, about 20 minutes.
