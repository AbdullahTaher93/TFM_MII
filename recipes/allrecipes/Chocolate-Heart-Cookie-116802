In a small mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in vanilla. Combine the flour and cocoa; gradually add to creamed mixture. On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with a 3-in. heart-shaped cookie cutter. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until firm. Remove to wire racks to cool. In a microwave-safe bowl, heat vanilla chips and 1 tablespoon shortening until melted, stirring frequently. Dip both sides of cookies into melted mixture. In another microwave-safe bowl, heat the chocolate chips and remaining shortening until melted, stirring frequently. Drizzle over the cookies. Place on wire racks to dry.
