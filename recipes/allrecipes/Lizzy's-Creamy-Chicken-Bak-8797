Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sprinkle the chicken breasts with seasoning salt to taste. In a large skillet, brown the chicken in olive oil, on both sides, until they are golden brown. Then place the chicken in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a medium size bowl, combine the sour cream, chicken soup and dry onion soup mix. Pour the mixture over the chicken and bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool and serve.
