Tint the frosting orange and set aside. Use 1/2 cup of orange frosting to spread on the bottom of both pound cakes, then press them together. Stand the cakes up so that they are vertical on a serving plate. Create the pitch of the roof by trimming the top of one cake on a slight angle to give it the appearance of looking tipsy. Trim the other cake on a steeper angle. Completely cover the cake with remaining orange frosting. Break the chocolate wafers in half and arrange, overlapping slightly, as the roof. Using the photograph as a guide, pipe black decorating icing for the windows and other decorations. Use 3 TWIX Cookie Bars as the door and chimney. Use broken wafer cookies for the shutters. Use M&M'S Brand Peanut Chocolate Candies to outline the top of the roof and sides of the house. Grind the remaining cookies along with remaining TWIX Cookie Bars in the food processor. Spread this mixture around the base of the house as 'dirt.' Scatter M&M'S Brand Chocolate Candies on the cookie 'dirt.'
