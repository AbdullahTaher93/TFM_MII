Place beef and flour in a large, resealable plastic bag. Shake to coat beef with flour. In a small bowl, mix tomato paste and water. In a large slow cooker, combine onions, ginger, garlic, cinnamon stick, turmeric, and paprika. Place beef on onions, and sprinkle with cumin, coriander, cardamom, cloves, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg. Pour tomato paste mixture over meat. Cover, and cook on LOW setting until beef is very tender, about 8 to 9 hours. When ready to serve, season to taste with salt, and stir in cilantro.
