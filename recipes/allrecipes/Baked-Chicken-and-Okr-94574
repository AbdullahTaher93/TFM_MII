Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread the rice over the bottom of a 10x15 inch baking dish. Layer the chicken pieces, tomatoes, okra, and bay leaves on top of the rice. Pour the broth and reserved tomato juice over the ingredients and season with salt and pepper. Cover and bake for 2 hours, until the chicken is tender and falling off the bone. Remove the bay leaves. Serve in large bowls with plenty of rice and sauce.
