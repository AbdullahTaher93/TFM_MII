Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the green beans, and cook for about 2 minutes. Drain, and immediately transfer to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Drain again. Heat the sesame oil and vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the green beans, and fry for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the garlic, shallot, salt and pepper to the beans. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Mix in the sesame seeds, cook for 1 more minute, then serve.
