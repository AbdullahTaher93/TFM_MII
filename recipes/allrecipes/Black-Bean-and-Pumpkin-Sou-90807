In a 5- to 6-quart pan, combine oil, onion, chili powder, garlic, and cumin. Stir often over medium heat until onion is limp, about 10 minutes. To pan, add beans, pumpkin, tomatoes and their liquid, broth, and chipotles. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook, stirring often, until hot throughout, about 10 minutes. Transfer about 2 cups of the mixture to a blender and whirl until smooth. Return puree to pan and mix well. Divide among soup bowls. Garnish with cilantro sprigs, if desired, and offer lime wedges and sour cream to add to taste.
