Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. Sift flour, cornmeal, brown sugar, salt and baking powder together into a large bowl. Dredge the blueberries in the sifted ingredients. In a small bowl, combine the milk, butter and egg. Stir the wet ingredients into the flour mixture just until moistened. Spoon batter into prepared muffin tins. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Let muffins sit for 10 minutes before removing from the pan.
