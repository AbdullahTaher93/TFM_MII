Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 48 mini-muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. Stir the flour, sugar, baking powder, pumpkin puree, egg whites, milk, applesauce, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, and ginger together in a large bowl until everything is just moistened; pour into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 15 minutes. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack before serving.
