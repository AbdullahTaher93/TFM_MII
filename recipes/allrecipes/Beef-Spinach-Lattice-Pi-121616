On a floured surface, roll out half of pastry to fit the bottom and two-thirds up the sides of a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Line ungreased dish with pastry. In a bowl, combine remaining ingredients. Spoon over crust. Roll out remaining pastry into a 15-in. x 10-in. rectangle; cut lengthwise into 3/4-in. strips. Place strips over the filling, forming a lattice crust. Press edges with a fork to seal. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until golden brown.
