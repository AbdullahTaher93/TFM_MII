Rinse fish and pat dry. Arrange pieces, skin down, on oiled rack in a broiler pan. Melt butter in a small frying pan over medium heat; stir in garlic. Cook, stirring, occasionally, until garlic is soft (about 3 minutes). Spoon butter from garlic and drizzle over salmon fillets; reserve garlic in pan. Broil salmon 2 to 3 inches below heat for 2 minutes. Meanwhile, mix mustard and wine with sauteed garlic. Remove pan from oven. Spoon mustard mixture evenly over fish. Return to oven and broil until crust is golden brown and fish is just opaque but still moist in thickest part; cut to test (4 to 6 minutes). Transfer to a serving platter. Garnish with lemon wedges.
