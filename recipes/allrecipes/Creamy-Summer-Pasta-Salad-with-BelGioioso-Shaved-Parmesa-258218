Cook pasta in salted water according to the package instructions. While pasta is cooking, heat olive oil in a 12-14 inch skillet or saute pan. Add onions and saute until soft and glassy, but not brown. Add garlic and cook for a minute stirring constantly. Add kale and cook until it is soft but still bright green and textured, about 2 minutes. Add cherry tomatoes and zucchini, season with salt and pepper. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes. Remove from heat. Drain pasta into a large bowl, add Mascarpone and rosemary, stir well. Stir in the kale-tomato mixture. Top with almonds and shaved BelGioioso Parmesan cheese.
