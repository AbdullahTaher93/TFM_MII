Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. In small bowl, combine sugar and Lawry's (r) Seasoned Salt. Rub seasoning mixture on ribs. In foil-lined shallow roasting pan, arrange ribs meat-side-up; cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake ribs 2 hours or until ribs are thoroughly cooked. Remove foil and generously brush ribs with barbecue sauce. Bake uncovered an additional 15 minutes to glaze*. Serve, if desired, with additional barbecue sauce.
