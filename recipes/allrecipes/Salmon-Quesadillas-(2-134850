Heat a cooking spray-coated nonstick skillet over medium heat. When it's hot, place the first tortilla in the skillet. Sprinkle on half of the cheese. Add remaining ingredients. Top with the remaining cheese and the second tortilla. Cook, pressing down occasionally with a spatula, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the cheese melts and the tortilla starts to become crisp. Flip and cook for about 6 minutes more.
