Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. In large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts; cover and cook 5 minutes. Turn chicken, cover and cook 5 minutes longer. Uncover and continue to cook just until juices run clear when chicken is pierced with knife point; set aside. In large bowl toss greens with 3/4 cup of the Plum Sauce Dressing; divide among four plates. Cut each chicken breast into 1/2 inch slices and fan out on greens. Drizzle each chicken serving with 1 tablespoon dressing. Sprinkle each serving with 2 tablespoons of almonds.
