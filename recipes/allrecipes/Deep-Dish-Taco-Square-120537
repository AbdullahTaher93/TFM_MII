In a nonstick skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Remove from the heat; stir in the cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream and onion. In a bowl, combine biscuit mix and water. Spread into an 8-in. square baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Top with beef mixture and tomato. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 20 minutes or until bottom crust is golden brown.
