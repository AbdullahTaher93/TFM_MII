Mix orange juice, honey, soy sauce, lemon juice, and ginger together in a small bowl. Place salmon in a shallow dish. Pour all but 3 tablespoons of the orange juice mixture on top. Reserve remaining mixture in the bowl. Let salmon marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Transfer salmon to a baking dish lined with aluminum foil; pat dry with paper towels. Discard marinade. Spoon 1 tablespoon of reserved orange juice mixture over salmon; season with salt and pepper. Drizzle olive oil on top. Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 6 minutes. Spoon remaining 2 tablespoons orange juice mixture over salmon. Continue baking until flesh flakes easily with a fork, 6 to 9 minutes more. Serve with lemon wedges.
