Drain oysters, reserving 1/3 cup juice, and set both aside. Combine chopped green onions, skim milk, diced tasso, and garlic in a medium saucepan, and cook milk mixture over medium-low heat 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Place flour in a small bowl. Add reserved oyster juice, stirring with a whisk until blended, and add to milk mixture. Cook oyster juice mixture over medium heat 4 minutes or until thick, stirring constantly. Add oysters, chopped parsley, and Cajun-Creole Seasoning; cook 4 minutes or until edges of oysters curl. Combine oyster mixture and pasta in a large bowl; toss well. Garnish with basil sprigs, if desired.
