Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Fry chicken pieces in the oil until slightly browned and the juices run clear. Remove from the pan and drain on a paper towel. In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, heat chicken broth over medium heat. Add the carrots, peas, celery, onion and mushrooms. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and let simmer for 20 to 25 minutes. Add the noodles and cook for 10 more minutes or until noodles are al dente.
