Spread cabbage and cilantro over a clean dish towel. Gather up towel and squeeze out as much moisture from the cabbage as possible. Transfer cabbage and cilantro to a bowl. Add pork, egg whites, jalapeno peppers, ginger, and sesame oil. Mix thoroughly with your hands. Season with salt and pepper. Cover 2 baking sheets with waxed paper. Fill a small bowl with water. Hold a potsticker wrapper in the palm of your hand. Place a tablespoonful of the pork mixture in the center. Dip a finger in water and use it to wet the edges of the wrapper. Fold up edges and pinch together to seal. Transfer dumpling to a prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining wrappers and pork mixture. Freeze dumplings until firm, about 2 hours. Transfer to large resealable plastic bags.
