In large bowl, combine flour, flaxseed, baking powder, baking soda and salt; set aside. In medium bowl, combine buttermilk, oil, eggs and honey. Whisk until well combined. Pour buttermilk mixture over flour mixture. Whisk until just combined. Let stand 10 minutes. Heat skillet to medium heat. When hot, pour cup batter onto skillet, repeating to fill skillet. Top each pancake with blueberries. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface and golden brown underneath (about 2 minute). Flip and continue cooking until golden brown and cooked through (about 2 minutes). Note: This batter is thick and takes longer to cook than basic pancake batter. Remove from skillet and keep warm; repeat with remaining batter and blueberries. Serve with Wild Harvest 100% Pure Maple Syrup, if desired.
