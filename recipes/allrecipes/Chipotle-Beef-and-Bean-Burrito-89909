Cook ground beef with taco seasoning and ground chipotle in a large skillet over medium-high heat for 8 to 10 minutes or until beef is no longer pink. Drain. Stir beans and chiles into beef mixture. Heat 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally until hot. For each burrito, spoon 1/2 cup beef mixture onto a tortilla. Top beef with 2 tablespoons cheese. Fold sides over beef about 1 inch on each side and roll up.
