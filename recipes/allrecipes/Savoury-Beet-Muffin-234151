Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners. Whisk flour, oat bran, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and ginger in bowl. Whisk sugar, goat cheese, and eggs together in a separate bowl until smooth and creamy; stir flour mixture into goat cheese mixture until flour mixture is completely absorbed into batter. Fold in beets. Spoon batter into the prepared muffins cups, filling 2/3 full. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
