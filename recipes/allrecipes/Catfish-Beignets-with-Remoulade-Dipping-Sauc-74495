Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and saute for 3 minutes or until slightly wilted. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the cayenne pepper. Add catfish pieces and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and green onions. Saute for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and cool. Mix eggs, milk, baking powder and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper. Add flour, 1/4 cup at a time, beating well until the batter is smooth. Fold in catfish mixture. Heat shortening in a deep fryer or a large, heavy saucepan to 360 degrees F on a deep-frying thermometer. Drop heaping spoonfuls of batter into the hot oil, one at a time. When the beignets pop to the surface, roll them around with a slotted spoon to brown evenly. Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle beignets with Rustic Rub and serve with Remoulade Dipping Sauce. For Rustic Rub: Mix all ingredients in a small bowl until well blended. The rub mixture can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 months. Makes about 1 cup. For Remoulade Dipping Sauce: Place all ingredients in a food processor and process for 30 seconds. Use immediately or refrigerate the sauce for several days in an airtight container. Makes 2 cups.
