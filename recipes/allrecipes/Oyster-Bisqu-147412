Blanch carrots and leeks in boiling salted water until tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain and refresh under cold running water. Spread the julienned vegetables on paper towels and pat dry; set aside. Heat oil in a large (4-quart) saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onions and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in rice and cook for about 2 minutes. Pour in 4 cups fish stock (or diluted clam juice) and increase heat to high. Bring to a boil, stirring often, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and cook for 25 minutes, or until the rice is very soft. Puree the mixture in a blender or food processor until very smooth. Return the puree to the pan; pour in milk and the remaining 2 cups stock (or diluted clam juice). Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Stir in oysters and their liquor and cook gently for 3 minutes, or until the oysters are curled at the edges. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle the bisque into bowls and garnish with the julienned carrots and leeks.
