Adjust oven rack to center position and heat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add potatoes. Cook until tender but still firm, about 10 to 15 minutes. Drain potatoes and combine with the ham and parsley in a large heat resistant bowl. Set aside. Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion; saute until tender, about 4 minutes. Add flour and stir until well blended. Slowly add milk and whisk together. Bring to a boil and season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat and continue to simmer and stir sauce until it is the consistency of a thick creamy soup, about 2 minutes. Pour over the ham mixture; toss to coat. Pour into greased 9X13 inch baking dish, cover with foil and bake until bubbly, about 30 minutes. Remove foil, sprinkle top with cheeses, turn on broiler and broil until cheese is browned, about 5 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes then serve.
