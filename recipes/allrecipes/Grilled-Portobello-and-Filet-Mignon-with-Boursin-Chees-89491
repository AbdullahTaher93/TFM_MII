Remove stems and scrape gills out of mushrooms. Brush the mushrooms and steaks with olive oil. Season the mushroom caps with salt and pepper, and season the steaks with steak seasoning. Grill the mushroom caps for about 3-4 minutes and steaks 4-5 minutes on each side. Fully cook to desired doneness. Place a mushroom cap, stem side up, on each plate. Top each cap with 1/4 of the Boursin cheese. Place a grilled steak on top of the cheese.
