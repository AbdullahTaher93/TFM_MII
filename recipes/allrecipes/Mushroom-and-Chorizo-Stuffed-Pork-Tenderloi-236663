Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cut pork tenderloin down the center lengthwise nearly all the way through, leaving the two sides attached; sprinkle with 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce. Stir onion, mushrooms, and garlic together in a bowl. Distribute mushroom mixture evenly along center of pork; sprinkle with remaining Worcestershire sauce and steak seasoning. Lay chorizo slices evenly along mushroom stuffing. Pierce tenderloin with 4 or 5 skewers crosswise through both edges; wrap butcher's twine around skewers, as if lacing shoelaces, and pull tenderloin closed around stuffing. Tie ends of twine together; place tenderloin in a baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until pork is slightly pink at the center, and an instant-read thermometer inserted near the center of the pork reads at least 145 degrees F (74 degrees C), 20 to 30 minutes. Remove string and skewers; cut into 2-inch thick medallions to serve.
