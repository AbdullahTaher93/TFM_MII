Preheat broiler. Combine topping ingredients in small bowl. Rub beef steaks with garlic. Place steaks on rack in broiler pan so surface of beef is 2 to 3 inches from heat. Broil 13 to 16 minutes for medium rare to medium doneness, turning once. One to two minutes before steaks are done, spread evenly with topping. Season with salt; sprinkle with parsley.
