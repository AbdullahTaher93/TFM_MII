Place the water and asparagus in a saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Cook covered 5 minutes. Remove cover and cook 1 or 2 minutes, until tender. Drain and set aside, but keep warm. Melt the margarine in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the turkey cutlets 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until browned and no longer pink on the inside. Remove turkey from the pan and set aside. Add the garlic and shrimp to the already heated skillet. Cook over medium-high heat 1 or 2 minutes, stirring constantly until the shrimp is heated through. Prepare hollandaise sauce according to package directions. Place each turkey cutlet on a plate. Top with the asparagus and shrimp. Spoon hollandaise sauce over all.
