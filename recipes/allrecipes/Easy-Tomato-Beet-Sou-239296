Puree tomatoes, beets, tomato paste, and 1/2 cup beef stock together in a blender until smooth. Pour tomato mixture into a saucepan with the remaining beef stock. Stir sugar, dill, hot pepper sauce, salt, and pepper into the tomato mixture. Bring the soup to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the flavors meld, about 30 minutes.
