Roll cheese back and forth in paper to form a log about 8-inches long and 1 1/2-inches in diameter. Wrap airtight and chill for 1 hour or up to 2 days. Just before serving, roll log in pepper-seed mix. Serve log whole, on a platter, with Toasteds(R). Or cut log into slices (about 1/4-inch) and place on Toasteds(R) to serve.
