Combine cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, capers and basil, mixing well. Spread 1 teaspoon cheese mixture over center of each slice of salami. Place one tomato in center of cheese. Gather up salami around cheese and tomato, forming a rosette and pressing lightly to hold shape. Serve immediately or cover and refrigerate for up to 24 hours before serving to guests.
