Whisk the instant pudding mix and two cups of cold milk for 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully fold in the whipped topping. Dip cookies individually into the remaining 1 cup of milk and line the bottom of a small casserole dish. Don be afraid to overlap the cookies. Empty half of the cream mixture on top of the cookies. Then dip the remaining cookies individually into the milk and create the second layer of cookies. Top the dish with the remaining cream and smooth out. Place in the refrigerator for at least one hour. Top the entire dish with chocolate curls made by running a vegetable peeler along the edge of the chocolate bar.
