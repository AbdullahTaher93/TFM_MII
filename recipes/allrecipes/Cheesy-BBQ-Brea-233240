Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; cook and stir onion in the melted butter until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir poppy seeds into onion mixture. Cut bread into slices, leaving them still attached on the bottom of the loaf. Put an American cheese slice into each slit; spoon poppy seed mixture into each slit. Wrap loaf with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 30 minutes.
