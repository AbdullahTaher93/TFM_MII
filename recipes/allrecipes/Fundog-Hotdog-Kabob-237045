Soak skewers in a bowl of water for about 30 minutes; drain. Preheat an outdoor grill for low heat and lightly oil the grate. Thread hot dog pieces, red bell pepper pieces, green bell pepper pieces, onions, pineapple chunks, grape tomatoes, and dill pickles onto the skewers. Grill kabobs on the preheated grill, turning frequently, until lightly browned, about 15 minutes.
