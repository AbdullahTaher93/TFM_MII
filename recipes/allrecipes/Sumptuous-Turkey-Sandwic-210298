Remove the top halves of the rolls and set aside. With the bottom half of each roll as a base, layer 1 to 2 slices of turkey. Spread one tbsp. of cranberry relish (or sauce) on each sandwich, followed by 2 tbsp. of the stuffing. Place a lettuce leaf on the stuffing (this will help prevent the top roll from becoming overly moist). Spread a sheen layer of butter (or mayonnaise) on the top roll and assemble the sandwich. Serve immediately, refrigerate or wrap individually in plastic for bag lunches.
