Combine the chicken broth, chopped potato, ginger root, and soy sauce in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the potato is tender, about 10 minutes. Stir the chopped tomato and green onion through the potato mixture. Increase heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a boil. Remove the saucepan from the heat and immediately stir the egg into the mixture until the egg cooks into thin ribbons throughout the soup.
