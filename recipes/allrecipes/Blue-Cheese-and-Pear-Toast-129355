Heat the broiler. Core and quarter the pears, then toss with a squeeze of lemon juice to prevent the pears from browning. Cut the cheese down the length of the wedge to make 8 thin, triangular slices. Lightly toast the pecans under the broiler, watching carefully to make sure they don't burn, then roughly chop them; set aside. Spread out the bread slices on the broiler pan and toast lightly on both sides. Spread the mango chutney on the toasted bread and top with the watercress and arugula. Arrange a slice of cheese and a pear on each piece of toast and sprinkle with pecans. Season with pepper. Serve at once, with halved cherry tomatoes.
