Flatten chicken to 1/4-in. thickness. Place in a greased 2-qt. microwave-safe dish. In a bowl, combine brown sugar and cornstarch; stir in teriyaki sauce, apple juice, oil and garlic. Drain oranges, reserving juice; set oranges aside. Add juice to the teriyaki mixture; pour over chicken. Cover and microwave on high for 8 minutes. Baste chicken with sauce. Cover and cook 3-5 minutes longer or until sauce is thickened. Serve over rice. Garnish with onions and oranges.
