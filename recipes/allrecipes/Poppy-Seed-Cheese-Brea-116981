Cut bread into 1-in. slices to within 1/4 in. of bottom. In a small bowl, combine the butter, mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, poppy seeds and onion. Spread over each slice of bread; sprinkle cheese between the slices. Place the loaf in an ungreased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake at 375 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until the cheese is melted and the bread is crisp.
