In a shallow bowl, combine the pecans, sesame seeds if desired, paprika, salt and pepper. Place flour and buttermilk in separate bowls. Coat chicken with flour, dip in buttermilk, then coat with pecan mixture. Place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Drizzle with butter. Top each with three pecan halves. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until juices run clear.
