Process butter, apricot preserves and rosemary in a food processor until smooth, stopping to scrape sides. Toss together carrots, parsnips, salt, pepper and 3 tablespoons apricot mixture. Place on an aluminum foil-lined 15x10-inch jellyroll pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 425 degrees F for 20 minutes; stir and bake 20 more minutes or until tender. Remove from oven and toss with remaining apricot mixture.
