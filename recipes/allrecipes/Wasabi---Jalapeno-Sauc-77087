In a small bowl, stir together the sour cream and mayonnaise. Mix in the wasabi powder, jalapeno pepper, vinegar and salt. Refrigerate for about 15 minutes to let the flavors develop. If you want to add more wasabi, add a little bit, and then refrigerate for about 5 minutes. The wasabi will get hotter upon sitting.
