Thaw fish, if frozen. Rinse fish and pat dry with paper towels; set aside. In large skillet, combine water, bouillon, white wine, lemon slices, onion, peppercorns and bay leaves. Bring mixture to a boil. Add salmon steaks. Cover and simmer for 8-12 minutes or until fish flakes easily when pierced with a fork. Remove fish from liquid and discard the poaching liquid. Cover and refrigerate fish until chilled; about 2 hours. For Lemon Dill Dressing: In small bowl, stir together 3/4 cup mayonnaise, 3 tablespoons buttermilk, 1 tablespoon fresh snipped dill, 1 tablespoon fresh snipped chives, 2 teaspoons lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon fresh finely shredded lemon peel. To serve, place chilled salmon fillets over lettuce and drizzle each serving with Lemon Dill Dressing.
