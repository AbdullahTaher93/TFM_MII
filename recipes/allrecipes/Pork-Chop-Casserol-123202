Sprinkle pork chops with Italian seasoning and pepper. Arrange in the center of a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish that has been coated with nonstick cooking spray. Combine potatoes, onion and flour; place around chops. Dot with margarine; sprinkle with green pepper. Cover and bake at 325 degrees F for 55 minutes. Uncover and bake 10-15 minutes longer or until potatoes are tender and meat juices run clear.
