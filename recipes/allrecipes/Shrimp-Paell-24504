In a saucepan bring water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. In a large skillet over medium heat, saute the garlic and shrimp for about 5 minutes or until pink. Pour in broth, tomatoes and saffron; bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Stir in 2 cups of the cooked rice and reduce heat to low. Cook for an additional 5 minutes.
