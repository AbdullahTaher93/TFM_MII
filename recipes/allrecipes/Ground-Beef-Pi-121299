In a skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Press into an ungreased 9-in. pie plate. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and cheese. In a bowl, combine the eggs, milk and biscuit mix just until combined. Pour over cheese. Bake at 400 degrees F for 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.
