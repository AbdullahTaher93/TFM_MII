In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, egg whites, scallions, and Italian seasoning. Coat a large nonstick skillet with nonstick spray and warm the skillet for 1 minute over medium heat. Drop the potato mixture by tablespoonfuls (about 15 mL) into the skillet and flatten it slightly. (About half the mixture will fit in the skillet.) Cook until the pancakes are golden and the potatoes are tender, 5 to 6 minutes on each side. Repeat with the remaining potato mixture, recoating the skillet with nonstick spray, if needed.
