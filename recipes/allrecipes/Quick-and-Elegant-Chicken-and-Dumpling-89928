Stir together chicken, gravy, broth, carrots, peas, wine and bay leaves in a 5-quart Dutch oven. Bring to a boil over medium high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat until stew is just simmering. Meanwhile, stir together baking mix and milk in a large bowl until soft dough form. Drop dough by heaping tablespoonfuls (about 12) over hot stew. Cover tightly and simmer 15 minutes without lifting lid. Sprinkle dumplings with paprika, if desired.
