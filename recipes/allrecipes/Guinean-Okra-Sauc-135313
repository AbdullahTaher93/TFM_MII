Fill a large pot with water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the frozen okra and return to a boil. Cook the okra uncovered, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink, but do not rinse. Trim the stems off the okra. Place the trimmed okra, chile pepper, garlic, lemon juice, and salt into a food processor. Process until smooth, about 30 seconds. Season to taste.
