Sprinkle lemon pepper and ground pepper over steak; set aside. Grill steak, uncovered, over medium-hot coals (350 to 400 degrees) 5 minutes on each side until desired degree of doneness. Slice. Combine arugula, tomatoes and green pepper in a large bowl. Top with sliced steak, blue cheese and toss with vinaigrette.
