Mix cucumber, mandarin oranges, vinegar, green onions, cilantro, and dill in a bowl until relish is well blended. Set oven rack 3 to 4 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Spray a broiler pan with cooking spray. Arrange orange roughy fillets on the prepared broiler pan; season with salt and pepper. Broil in preheated oven until fish is easily flaked with a fork, 9 to 12 minutes.
