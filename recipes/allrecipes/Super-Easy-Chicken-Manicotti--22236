Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread about 1/3 of the pasta sauce in ungreased 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle garlic salt on chicken. Insert chicken into uncooked manicotti shells, stuffing from each end of shell to fill if necessary. Place shells on pasta sauce in dish. Pour remaining 2/3 pasta sauce evenly over shells, covering completely. Sprinkle with olives and cheese. Cover and bake in the preheated oven for about 1 1/2 hours, or until shells are tender.
