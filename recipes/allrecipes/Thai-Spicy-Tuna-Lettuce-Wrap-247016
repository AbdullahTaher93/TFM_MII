Make the spicy mayo by mixing the sriracha, mayo and Asian red chili paste together; refrigerate to chill. Empty drained tuna into a large bowl. Break up tuna into large chunks. Add 2/3 of the green onions to the tuna; reserve the rest for garnish. Add the jalapeno, red bell pepper, red onion, shredded carrot, Thai basil and cilantro to the tuna and gently mix together, being careful not to break the tuna apart too much. In a small bowl whisk together lime juice, sesame oil, Asian chili paste, sesame seeds, sugar, garlic, salt, and pepper. Pour dressing over tuna and mix carefully. Spoon tuna mixture onto lettuce leaves and top with Spicy Mayo and reserved green onions. Garnish with cilantro or Thai basil if you like.
