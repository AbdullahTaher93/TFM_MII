Grate potatoes and onion using the largest holes of a four-sided grater. Combine in a small bowl; add egg, flour, salt, and pepper, and stir well to combine. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Drop batter by heaping tablespoonfuls into the pan, and cook until golden brown around the edges, about 3 minutes. Turn latkes over, press lightly with a spatula, and cook about 3 minutes more. Continue cooking latkes in batches until batter is used up. Serve with applesauce or sour cream. Potato, carrot, and parsnip variation: Use 2 all-purpose potatoes, 1 medium carrot, and 1 small parsnip. Potato, onion, and horseradish variation: Use 2 Yukon Gold potatoes, 1/4 large white onion, and 2 tablespoons prepared horseradish, liquid pressed out.
