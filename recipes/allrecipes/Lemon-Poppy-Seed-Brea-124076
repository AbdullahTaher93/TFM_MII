In a mixing bowl, combine the cake and pudding mixes, eggs, water and oil; beat until well mixed. Fold in poppy seeds. Pour into two greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until bread tests done. Cool in pans for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack.
