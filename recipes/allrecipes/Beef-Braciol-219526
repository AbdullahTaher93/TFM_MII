Heat half the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the pepper and onion and cook until the vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in the bread crumbs. Remove the skillet from the heat. Spread 1/2 cup vegetable mixture onto each beef slice. Roll up the beef around the filling and secure with toothpicks. Heat the remaining oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef rolls and cook until well browned on all sides. Stir in the sauce, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 20 minutes or until the beef is fork-tender.
