Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Spray 18x24-inch sheet heavy-duty foil with cooking spray. Place frozen vegetables in center of foil; top with salmon fillets. Mix citrus dressing and curry powder together; spoon 2 tablespoons on top of each salmon fillet; spread evenly to coat. Reserve remaining dressing for sauce. Seal foil into packet and place on baking sheet. Bake about 25 minutes or until salmon is no longer translucent in center and flakes with fork. Meanwhile, mix remaining dressing and cream in small saucepan. Gently heat over low heat until hot, but not boiling. To serve, cut each fillet in half; serve with vegetables and cream sauce.
