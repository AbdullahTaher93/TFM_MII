In a saucepan bring water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. In a large skillet over high heat, add sesame oil and allow it to get hot. Add rice and 1 tablespoon of butter. Saute for three minutes. Stir in the snow peas and corn. Saute until rice begins to brown slightly. Add shrimp to top of rice. Reduce heat to low and cover to keep warm. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the orange and lime juices, onion, honey, ginger root and garlic. Mix thoroughly. Spoon enough of the mixture to coat the shrimp. In a saucepan over high heat, combine the remaining juice mixture with chicken broth and cornstarch. Bring to a boil and reduce heat. Simmer until thickened. Stir in 1 teaspoon of butter. Serve over the rice and shrimp.
