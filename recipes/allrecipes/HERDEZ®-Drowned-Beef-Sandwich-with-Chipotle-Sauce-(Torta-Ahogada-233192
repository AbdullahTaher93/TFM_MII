Combine the chipotle cooking sauce with the beef broth and cilantro in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue to cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook onions in the hot oil until they begin to soften. Stir in the garlic and cook for another minute. Add the meat with 1/4 cup of the sauce and cook, stirring, for about two minutes until heated through. Ladle the sauce into four bowls for dipping. Place the meat mixture on the bottom half of the sandwich bun, garnish with cilantro sprigs and place top half of bun on top. Dip sandwiches in the sauce and enjoy.
