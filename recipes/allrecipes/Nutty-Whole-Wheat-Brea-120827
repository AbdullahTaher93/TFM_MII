In a mixing bowl, combine 1 cup all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, walnuts, brown sugar, yeast and salt. In a saucepan, heat the water, yogurt and butter to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes (do not let rise). Shape dough into a ball; place on a baking sheet coated with nonstick cooking spray. Cover and let rest in a warm place for 20 minutes. Bake at 400 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to cool on a wire rack.
