Prepare pudding according to package directions, using fat-free milk. Arrange a single layer of cake in the bottom of a deep glass bowl. Spread with one-third of preserves and sprinkle with a generous tablespoon of sherry or orange juice. Top with one-third of banana slices and one-third of pudding. Continue layering two more times, ending with pudding. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate a few hours before serving.
