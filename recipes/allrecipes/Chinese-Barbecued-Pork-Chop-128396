In a small saucepan, combine the ketchup, hoisin sauce, vinegar, sherry or broth, garlic, and ginger. Bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring often, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until reduced to a syrupy consistency. Set aside. Coat a grill rack or broiler pan with nonstick spray. Preheat the grill or broiler. Grill or broil the chops for 8 minutes, turning once. Cook, brushing with the reserved sauce and turning occasionally, for 3 to 4 minutes longer, or until a thermometer inserted in the center of a chop registers 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) and the juices run clear.
