Mix whole wheat flour, ground almonds, ground flax seeds, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Whisk almond milk, bananas, egg, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Mix into the whole wheat flour mixture until batter is just combined. Melt butter on a griddle over medium heat. Drop 1/3 cup batter onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
