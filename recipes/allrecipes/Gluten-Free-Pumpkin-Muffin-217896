Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. Whisk rice flour, soy flour, sugar, and salt together in a bowl; stir in pumpkin, oil, and eggs. Mix rice cereal and baking powder together in a bowl; stir into pumpkin mixture until batter is combined. Fold in chocolate chips. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
