In a large pot combine the chicken, carrots, barley, water, bouillon and salt and pepper to taste. Bring all to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and let simmer for 30 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside. Skim broth as needed. Remove chicken from pot and add leeks. Bring back to a boil; reduce heat, cover and let simmer another 15 minutes or so, until thickened. Meanwhile, skin and debone the cooked chicken. Return chicken meat to thickened stew and cook for about 5 minutes to heat through. Serve hot.
