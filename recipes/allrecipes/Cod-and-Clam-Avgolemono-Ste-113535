In a large saucepan, combine the broth, onion, carrots, and dill. Bring to a boil and cook, partially covered, over moderately low heat for 5 minutes. Stir in the rice and continue cooking, partially covered, until the rice is just done, about 15 minutes. Discard any clams that are broken or do not clamp shut when tapped. Put the clams and water into a medium saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook, shaking the pot occasionally, just until the clams open, about 3 minutes. Remove the open clams and continue to cook, uncovering the saucepan as necessary to remove the clams as soon as their shells open. Discard any that do not open. Carefully pour the clam-cooking liquid into the rice mixture, leaving any grit in the bottom of the saucepan. Add the fish, peas, salt, and pepper; bring to a simmer. If necessary, add more of the chicken broth to just cover the fish. Simmer, uncovered, until the fish is just done, about 2 minutes. In a medium stainless-steel bowl, whisk together the eggs and lemon juice until frothy. Pour most of the hot liquid from the fish stew in a thin stream into the egg mixture, whisking. Pour the egg mixture back into the saucepan, stirring gently so as not to break up the fish. Gently stir in the clams in their shells.
