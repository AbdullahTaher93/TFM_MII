Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Lay 4 8x10-inch pieces of aluminum foil onto a flat work surface and spray with cooking spray. Arrange equal amounts of the haddock into the center of each foil square. Stir butter, lime juice, dill, kosher salt, and red pepper flakes together in a small bowl; drizzle evenly over each portion of fish. Top each portion with onion slices. Bring opposing ends of the foil together and roll together to form a seam. Roll ends toward fish to seal packets. Cook packets on the preheated grill until fish flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
