Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 3-quart casserole dish. Mix evaporated milk, pudding mix, almond extract, and pumpkin pie spice together in a large bowl. Add cinnamon rolls, raisins, and pecans and mix until well combined. Let stand for 5 minutes. Transfer cinnamon roll mix to a casserole dish and dot with butter. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
