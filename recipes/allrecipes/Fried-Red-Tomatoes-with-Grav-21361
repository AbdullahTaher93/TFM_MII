In a large skillet heat oil over medium heat. Sprinkle seasoning salt on both sides of tomato slices, then dredge in the 1/2 cup of flour. Place tomatoes in the hot oil and fry until golden brown, turning once. Keep tomatoes warm. Add the 2 tablespoons of flour to the oil and cook over medium heat, stirring until smooth, about one minute. Gradually pour in the half and half, stirring constantly until thickened. Stir in the brown sugar, salt and pepper. Spoon gravy over the tomato slices and serve immediately.
