If grilling the burgers, coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill. In a bowl, combine the first 10 ingredients. Crumble turkey over mixture and mix well. Shape into six 1/2-in.-thick patties. Grill, covered, over indirect medium heat or broil 6 in. from the heat for 6-7 minutes on each side or until a meat thermometer reads 165 degrees F. Sprinkle with parsley. Serve on buns with lettuce and tomato.
