Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place linguini in the pot, cook 9 to 11 minutes, until al dente, and drain. Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat, and saute the cashews 5 minutes, until lightly browned. Mix in the cooked linguini, teriyaki sauce, ginger, and green onion, and continue to cook and stir until heated through.
