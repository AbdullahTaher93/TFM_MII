Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Using the back of a wooden spoon or a spatula, cream together the room temperature butter and the Splenda. Then add the almond meal and cocoa powder and blend well. No lumps. Add the beaten egg whites and the extracts and blend well. Drop about a rounded Tbsp of batter onto a cookies sheet lined with parchment paper. The cookies will pretty much hold whatever shape they are when going into the oven, so experiment. I like them in rugged looking drops but sometimes I flatten them more like a cookie. You can even pipe them out with a pastry bag. Bake at 375 degrees F for 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes.
