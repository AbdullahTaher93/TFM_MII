Marinate the steaks, covered and refrigerated, in the bourbon and Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM) mixture for 2 to 4 hours. In a saute pan heat oil over medium heat, add mushrooms, onions and Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM) and saute for 5 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally until tender. Add beer and remaining tablespoon of fresh herbs and simmer for 2 minutes. Add steak sauce and cream and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes. Add cheese, stir and set aside, keeping warm. Preheat grill to high. Remove steaks from the marinade, setting aside the marinade for basting.
