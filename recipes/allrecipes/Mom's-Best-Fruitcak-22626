Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line 2 small loaf pans with parchment or wax paper. In a large bowl combine Brazil nuts, dates, cherries and pineapple. Over the fruit and nuts sift the flour, sugar, salt and baking powder. Mix well. In a small bowl combine eggs and vanilla; beat until foamy. Pour over fruit mixture and mix well. Spoon batter into prepared pans. Bake in preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.
