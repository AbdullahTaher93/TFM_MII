Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Heat bacon drippings in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown roast on all sides. Remove roast to a casserole dish. Place butter, garlic, and carrots in the skillet. Reduce heat to medium. Stir in parsley, bay leaf, salt, pepper, tomato paste, and sugar. Pour in red wine, and stir to combine. Pour over pork roast. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove, and arrange mushrooms around the roast. Return to oven, and bake 1/2 hour.
