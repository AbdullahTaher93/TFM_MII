Preheat oven to 350 degrees F Spray 6 custard cups or a standard muffin pan (6 oz capacity) with cooking spray. Line each cup with 3 layers of phyllo dough and spray with the butter cooking spray between each layer. In a small bowl mix the chicken sausage, scallions and spinach. Divide the mixture between cups. Break 1 egg into each cup, sprinkle with pepper and top each with about 1 tablespoon of the cheese. Bake in the oven for 18 minutes or until the yolks are set. Serve either in custard cups or gently remove from muffin pan (let the egg cups cool 3 minutes before trying to remove).
