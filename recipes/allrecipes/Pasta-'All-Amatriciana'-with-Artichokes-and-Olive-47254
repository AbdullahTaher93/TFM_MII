In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook pancetta, stirring often until browned, about 6 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add undrained tomatoes, artichoke hearts, wine, olives, rosemary and crushed red pepper. Simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Stir in parsley. Meanwhile, in large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta until al dente, about 10 minutes. Drain well and toss with sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Garnish with rosemary sprigs.
