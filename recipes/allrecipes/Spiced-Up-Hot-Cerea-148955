Place water, milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and butter into a large saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Once the butter has melted and the water is steaming but not boiling, whisk in the cream of wheat cereal. Stir constantly until thickened, then reduce heat to low, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in sugar to taste before serving.
