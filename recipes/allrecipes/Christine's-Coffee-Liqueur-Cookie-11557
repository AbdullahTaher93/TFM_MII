Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). In a small bowl, dissolve instant coffee crystals into the coffee liqueur; set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar. Gradually add eggs and coffee mixture while mixing. Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, stir in the chocolate chips. Drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls onto a cookie sheet. Cookies should be at least 2 inches apart. Bake for 23 to 25 minutes. Immediately transfer cookies to cooling rack after baking. These keep well at room temperature or refrigerated.
