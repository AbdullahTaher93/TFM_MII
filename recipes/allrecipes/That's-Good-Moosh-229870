Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with taco seasoning; stir. Set aside. Bring 3 quarts water to a boil in a 5-quart stockpot. Break ramen noodles into bite-sized pieces and add to boiling water. Cook, stirring frequently, until noodles are tender, 3 to 5 minutes; drain. Pour tomatoes into a bowl; break into small pieces using your hand or a spoon. Dissolve 2 of the packets of seasoning from the ramen noodles in 1 cup water; stir into the tomatoes. Pour the tomato mixture into the stockpot and place over medium heat. Stir ground beef into the tomato mixture; cook and stir until hot, 3 to 5 minutes. Add drained noodles to the beef mixture; stir to coat. Season the mixture with the remaining packet of ramen noodle seasoning to taste. Remove stockpot from heat; stir sour cream through the tomato mixture. Top with Cheddar cheese to serve.
