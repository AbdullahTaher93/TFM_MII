Place cranberry sauce, Dijon mustard, garlic, salt, black pepper, rice vinegar, and cider vinegar into a blender. Turn the blender on and process until smooth, about 30 seconds. Pour in walnut oil in a steady stream, then vegetable oil. Blend until the salad dressing is thick and creamy, about 1 minute.
