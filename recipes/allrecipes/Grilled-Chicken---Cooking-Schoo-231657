Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Pat chicken breasts dry with a paper towel. Trim the chicken breasts of excess skin and fat and season with salt and pepper. Turn off one grill burner. If using a charcoal grill, push the coals to one side. Place chicken on the unheated side of the grill. Cover the grill and cook until the chicken is golden brown, flesh is no longer pink at the bone, and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
