In a mixing bowl, beat oil and sugar. Add egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add sweet potato, water and vanilla; mix well. In a small mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff; fold into the sweet potato mixture. Combine flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt; add to potato mixture. Stir in pecans. Pour into three greased 9-in. round cake pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 22-27 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing to wire racks. For frosting, melt the butter in a saucepan; whisk in sugar, milk and egg yolks until smooth. Cook and stir over medium heat for 10-12 minutes or until thickened and bubbly. Remove from the heat; stir in the coconut, pecans and vanilla. Cool slightly. Place one cake layer on a serving plate; spread with a third of the frosting. Repeat layers.
