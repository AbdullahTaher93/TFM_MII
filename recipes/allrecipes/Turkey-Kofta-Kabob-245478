Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Combine ground turkey, onion, garlic, cilantro, egg, chile pepper, coriander, paprika, chili powder, and salt together in a large bowl; mix thoroughly. Divide turkey mixture into twelve 1/4-cup portions, roll into log-shaped ovals, and place on a baking sheet. Grill ovals over indirect heat on middle rack, turning occasionally, until no longer pink in the center, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
