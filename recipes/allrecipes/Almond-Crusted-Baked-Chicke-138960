Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix chopped almonds, breadcrumbs, salt, and thyme in a shallow bowl. In a small pan over medium heat, melt the butter and add water and chicken granules. Stir to dissolve granules. Remove from heat. Dip each chicken breast in the melted butter mixture and then in the crumb mixture. Place in a baking dish that has been sprayed with nonstick vegetable cooking spray. Pour any leftover butter mixture and then any leftover crumb mixture over chicken breasts. Bake uncovered 30 minutes or until chicken is golden and crisp and meat is white in center when tested with a knife. Serve with hot cooked rice.
