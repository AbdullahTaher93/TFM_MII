Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Rinse mushrooms and pat dry. Remove and chop stems; place in medium-size bowl and mix in crab, cheese, onions, and Worcestershire. Coat a 9 inch-square or 7- by 11-inch baking pan with cooking oil spray. Arrange mushrooms, gill side up, in pan. Spoon crab mixture on top of mushrooms, pressing it together lightly. Bake until cheese melts and browns lightly, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve hot.
