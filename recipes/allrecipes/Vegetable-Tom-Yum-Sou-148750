Bring chicken stock, galangal, lime leaves, lemon grass, and hot chile paste to a boil in a large pot. Stir in fish sauce, lime juice, shallots, tomato, mushrooms, bok choy, and carrot. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes. Garnish with cilantro and green onion before serving.
