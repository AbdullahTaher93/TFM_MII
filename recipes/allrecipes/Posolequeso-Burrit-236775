Combine pork, hominy, cilantro, oregano, garlic, chile paste, cumin, and lemon pepper on a flat-top grill or large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until heated through, 10 to 15 minutes. Spoon pork mixture into each tortilla and top with Cheddar cheese. Fold opposing edges of the tortilla to overlap the filling. Roll 1 of the opposing edges around the filling into a burrito; wrap in aluminum foil.
