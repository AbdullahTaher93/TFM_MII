In a bowl, combine the dry ingredients. Combine eggs, orange juice and butter; mix well. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in dates, walnuts and orange peel. Coat muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray or use paper liners; fill two-thirds full with batter. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
