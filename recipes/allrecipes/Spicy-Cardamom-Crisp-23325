Combine sugar and butter in large bowl. Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until creamy. Add egg, corn syrup, water and vanilla; beat until well mixed. Reduce speed to low; add remaining ingredients except almonds. Beat until well mixed. Divide dough into thirds. Shape each third into 1/2-inch thick square. Wrap each square in plastic food wrap. Refrigerate until firm (1 to 2 hours). Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface, one-third at a time (keeping remaining dough refrigerated), to 12x10-inch rectangle. Cut into 2-inch squares using pastry cutter or sharp knife; cut squares diagonally in half to form triangles. Place 1 inch apart onto ungreased cookie sheets. Lightly press almonds into center of each cookie. Bake for 7 to 9 minutes or until edges are lightly browned and cookies are set.
