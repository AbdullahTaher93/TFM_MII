Heat oil in a small frying pan over medium heat. Stir in tomato paste, and heat through. Set aside. Place green beans and water in a medium saucepan. Arrange onions and green pepper in layers over beans. Sprinkle turmeric, and salt and pepper over vegetables, and pour tomato paste over everything. Cover. Cook over medium heat until vegetables are tender and all water has evaporated.
