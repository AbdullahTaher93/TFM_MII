Bring 3 cups water to a boil. Using the side of a knife, crack open the cardamom pods, and add them to the boiling water with the ginger. Boil for 5 minutes, then remove from the heat. Add the tea bags and let steep until the tea is red, about 5 minutes. Whisk in milk to taste. Remove the tea bags, pour the tea through a sieve and let rest for 10 minutes before serving.
