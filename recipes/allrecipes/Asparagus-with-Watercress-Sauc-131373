Combine 1 Tbsp oil, lemon juice, and salt in a small bowl. In a blender, combine watercress, onions, and lemon juice mixture. Blend until smooth. Preheat grill to medium. Snap off and discard hard ends of asparagus. Place in a plastic bag with remaining olive oil. Toss to coat. In a grill basket, grill asparagus for 8 to 10 minutes, turning frequently until crisp-tender. Top asparagus with watercress sauce and sprinkle with chopped egg.
