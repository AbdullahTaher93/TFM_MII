Heat butter and olive oil in a large skillet over low heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in the hot butter-oil mixture until onion is transparent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add flour and slowly pour in beef broth while stirring constantly until flour is smoothly mixed into the broth and vegetables. Stir Burgundy wine into onion-flour mixture; season with basil and oregano. Bring mixture to a simmer; add mushrooms. Cook and stir until sauce is thickened, about 10 minutes.
