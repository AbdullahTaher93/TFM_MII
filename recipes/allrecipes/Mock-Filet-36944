Preheat your oven's broiler. In a medium bowl, mix ground beef and bread crumbs. Add eggs, onion, salt and pepper; mix well. Shape into 6 thick patties. Wrap bacon around the outside rim of each patty, and secure with a toothpick or kitchen string. Place on rack in broiler pan or casserole dish and broil 5 inches from heat source for 10 minutes. Take out of oven and turn patties over. Mix ketchup, brown sugar and mustard in small bowl. Spoon over patties, and return to broil for 5 minutes longer or until meat is firm, and no longer pink in the center.
