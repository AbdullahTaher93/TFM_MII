Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic, and cook for a few minutes, just until fragrant. Crumble in the pork; cook and stir until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Add the shrimp; cook and stir until pink and opaque. Mix in the soy sauce, sugar and green onions. Pour in 2 cups of water, and bring to a boil. Simmer for 3 minutes. Stir together remaining water and cornstarch. Stir into the skillet gently and allow to simmer until thickened. Turn off the heat to ensure a smooth sauce. Stir in the eggs, and serve immediately over rice.
