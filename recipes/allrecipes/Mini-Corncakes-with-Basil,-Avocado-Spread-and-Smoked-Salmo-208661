Corncakes: In blender, puree the corn and milk until kernels are coarsely ground, about 30 seconds. Add egg, butter and basil and blend just a second or two, to beat the egg. In medium bowl, stir together flour, baking powder and salt. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and stir in the corn/egg mixture until moistened. Add a little more milk, if necessary, until batter drops easily off a spoon. Spray or lightly oil a non-stick skillet or griddle and heat over medium-high heat. Drop the batter by rounded teaspoonsful into hot skillet and cook until browned on bottom, about 3 to 4 minutes. Turn and brown on second side, another 3 to 4 minutes. Avocado Spread: Rinse, halve and seed the avocado. Scoop avocado into shallow bowl. Mash coarsely with fork. Add pepper, lime juice, cilantro, chives and salt and mix. Spread each corn cake with a tablespoon of avocado spread. Top with smoked salmon, garnish with chives and cilantro and serve.
