Cut the beef into 1-inch cubes. On a piece of waxed paper or in a plastic food storage bag combine flour, salt and pepper. Toss beef cubes in flour mixture to coat or place beef cubes in food storage bag and shake until beef cubes are coated with flour mixture. In a wide, heavy saucepan, heat the oil. Brown beef cubes on all sides, removing from pan as browned. In the same saucepan, melt the butter. Saute the onion and garlic until translucent. Deglaze with red wine and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of saucepan. Return the meat to the pan. Add stock, vinegar and bay leaf. Cover and let simmer 1 hour. Cut the sage leaves into a chiffonade (see cooking tips) and stir into sauce with the butternut, squash, parsnips, carrots and tomatoes. Cover and let simmer 20 minutes or until meat and vegetables are tender. Remove bay leaf and correct seasonings.
