Grease the inside of a 9" springform pan, using soft butter. Press 1 cup of cookie crumbs into the bottom of the pan. Set aside. Place cream cheese and SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend into a mixer (preferably with a paddle attachment). Run for a few minutes, scraping down the sides and beaters frequently. Add Ricotta; then add eggs, one by one. Wait for egg to be incorporated into the mix and scrape down the bowl before adding another egg to insure that everything is smoothly blended. Finally add sour cream, lemon juice and zest, and mix to uniform consistency. Pour batter into the prepared pan and place on a cookie sheet. Bake at 325 degrees F for 50 -55 minutes, or until almost fully set and the center jiggles slightly. Allow to cool completely. To Make Glaze: Mix the ingredients in a bowl and use an offset spatula to cover the outside of the un-molded cheesecake. Cover the top of the cake with a one eighth of an inch layer of the sour cream glaze and lightly coat the sides, use the spatula to stick the remaining 1/4 cup cookie crumbs onto the sides.
