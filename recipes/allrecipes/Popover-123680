Using 1/2 teaspoon shortening for each cup, grease the bottom and sides of six 6-oz. custard cups or the cups of popover pan. Place custard cups on a 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan; set aside. In a mixing bowl, beat eggs; blend in milk and butter. Beat in flour and salt until smooth (do not overbeat). Fill cups half full. Bake at 450 degrees F for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F; bake 30 minutes longer or until very firm. Remove from the oven and prick each popover to allow steam to escape. Serve immediately.
