Place mango and peach in a small bowl. Squeeze juice of 1 lime over mango mixture; add onion and 1 tablespoon cilantro. Stir well. Bring water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Add rice, juice of 1 lime, and 1 tablespoon cilantro; stir well. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Set rice aside and keep warm. Spray a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Cook and stir sausages in hot skillet until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove sausages from pan; cut into bite-sized pieces. Pour orange juice in skillet used for sausage; bring to a simmer. Return chopped sausage to skillet; cover and simmer in the orange juice until juice has reduced to a syrup and sausage is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add mango salsa to sausage; stir to combine, about 30 seconds. Sprinkle with garlic salt; serve over rice.
