In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites with cream of tartar until foamy. Add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until soft peaks form. Spread in a well-greased 9-in. pie pan. Bake at 275 degrees F for 50 minutes. Cool. For filling, melt chocolate in a double boiler over hot but not boiling water. Stir in coffee until smooth. Remove from the heat; stir in vanilla until well blended. Cool. In another mixing bowl, beat cream; fold in chocolate mixture. Pour into the meringue shell. Sprinkle with nuts if desired. Chill for several hours.
