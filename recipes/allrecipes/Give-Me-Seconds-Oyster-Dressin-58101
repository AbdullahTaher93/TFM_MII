Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2 quart baking dish. In a medium bowl, mix together the oysters, half-and-half, and Worcestershire sauce. Spread evenly in the prepared baking dish. In a small bowl, mix together the crackers and butter. Sprinkle over the top of the oyster mixture. Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until the top is nicely browned and dressing is hot.
