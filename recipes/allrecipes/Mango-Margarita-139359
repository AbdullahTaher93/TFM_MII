Run a quarter section of each lime along the rim of each glass and dip it upside down into the margarita salt. Carefully shake the excess salt of the glass to ensure that it doesn't spill into the bottom of the glass. Fill each glass with ice and then add one part tequila to three parts mixer. Top off each glass with lime juice, one quarter, and a couple of tablespoons of mango nectar. Drink!
