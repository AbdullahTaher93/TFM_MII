Add vegetable oil to 10-inch skillet and heat over medium heat. Cook and stir sliced sausage, green pepper, onion and tomatoes 5 to 10 minutes, until sausage is heated through and vegetables begin to soften. Combine cornstarch, ginger, vinegar, soy sauce and apricot preserves; stir into sausage mixture. Stir until mixture is bubbly and sauce begins to thicken. Add two cups of drained pineapple chunks. Reduce heat to low and stir until pineapple is heated through. Serve over cooked rice.
