Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Place potatoes in a bowl; add 2 tablespoons olive oil and toss to coat. Cook on preheated grill until tender, about 30 minutes. Cool potatoes, 10 to 15 minutes; cut into quarters. Whisk 1/2 cup olive oil, vinegar, salt, black pepper, garlic, and sugar together in a bowl until dressing is smooth. Toss potatoes, bacon, green onions, and parsley with dressing in a bowl until evenly coated.
