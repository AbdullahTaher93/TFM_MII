Place red chile peppers in a bowl and cover them with warm water. Let sit until rehydrated, about 10 minutes. Drain. Place green chile peppers, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, mace, and cardamom in a large, dry skillet over medium heat. Toast until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer red chile peppers and toasted spices to a mortar and pestle. Add shallots, garlic, lemongrass, cilantro root, peppercorns, lime leaves, galangal, shrimp paste, and salt. Pound together into a coarse paste.
