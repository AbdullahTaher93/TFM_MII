Place the beets into a large pot, fill with water, then bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until the beets are tender, about 15 minutes. Larger beets will take longer. Slip the peels from the beets, and slice. Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil; stir in the salt and vinegar to dissolve the salt. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Fill hot, sterilized jars halfway with sliced beets; break up a half-slice of onion into half-moon rings and drop into the jar. Fill the rest of the jar with sliced beets; top with another half-slice of onion. Fill the jar to within 1/2-inch of the top with the salt-vinegar liquid. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 20 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all).
