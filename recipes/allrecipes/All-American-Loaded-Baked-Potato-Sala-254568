Place potatoes in a pot; fill with water until potatoes are covered. Add salt; bring to boil. Simmer until potatoes are just tender enough to be pierced with a fork, about 15 minutes. Drain and run under cold water until potatoes are slightly cool. Mix sour cream, creamy salad dressing, and ground black pepper together in a large bowl. Stir in Cheddar cheese, green onion, and bacon bits; add potatoes. Cover and chill in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
