Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place the slice of ham in a shallow baking dish. Mix together the mustard and garlic; spread over the ham. Pour in enough milk to cover the ham to about 1/2 inch from the top. Bake, uncovered for 1 hour, basting occasionally with the milk. Remove to a platter, slice, and serve.
