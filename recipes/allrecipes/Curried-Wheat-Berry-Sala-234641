Place wheat berries in a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain. Bring 6 cups water and wheat berries to a boil in a saucepan; add 1 teaspoon olive oil and salt. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the wheat berries are tender and have split open, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Drain and rinse wheat berries with cold water. Whisk 1/3 cup olive oil, curry powder, parsley, red pepper flakes together in a bowl until dressing is evenly mixed. Combine wheat berries, chickpeas, sunflower seeds, and raisins in a bowl. Drizzle dressing over wheat berry mixture; toss to coat and season with salt.
