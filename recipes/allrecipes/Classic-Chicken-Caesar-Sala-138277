Make croutons: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Place bread on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the oil, and season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Bake, tossing occasionally, until golden, 12 to 15 minutes; remove from oven; and let cool. Make chicken: Heat remaining tablespoon oil in a large skillet over high. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Cook until opaque throughout, 1 to 2 minutes per side; remove from skillet and let cool. Prepare lettuce: Cut romaine crosswise into 1-inch ribbons; wash and dry. Make dressing: In a blender, combine lemon juice, mayonnaise, Parmesan, anchovy fillets (if using), and garlic; blend until smooth. If preparing this recipe in advance, see instruction below. If stored in refrigerator, bring chicken and dressing to room temperature. Slice chicken crosswise into strips; toss with croutons, lettuce, and dressing.
