Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Remove 1/2 cup of the mozzarella cheese; cover and refrigerate for later use. Mix all remaining ingredients except crackers until well blended. Spread into 9-inch pie plate. Bake 20 minutes or until dip is heated through and top is lightly browned. Sprinkle with reserved 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley, if desired. Serve with crackers.
