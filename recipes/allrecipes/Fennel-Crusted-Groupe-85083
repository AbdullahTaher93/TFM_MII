Toast fennel seeds over medium heat 1-2 minutes or until aromatic in a small skillet. Remove from skillet. Finely crush toasted seeds using a mortar and pestle, a spice mill, a clean coffee grinder or a rolling pin. Blend with dill, thyme, salt and pepper. Rub spice mixture evenly on both sides of grouper fillets. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil; set aside. Heat remaining oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet. Add fillets; saute 4-5 minutes per side or until done and lightly browned. Add white wine to pan; cook 1 minute. Remove grouper to serving plate. Serve with Vanilla Beurre Blanc, if desired.
