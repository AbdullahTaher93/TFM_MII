Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners. Mix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, chia seeds, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger together in a large bowl. Beat butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat egg into the butter mixture. Mash banana into the butter mixture until smoothly incorporated. Fold carrot and orange zest into the mixture. Mix flour mixture into the butter mixture about 1/2 cup at a time to make a batter. Fold cranberries into the batter. Divide evenly between prepared muffin cups to fill nearly to the top. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
