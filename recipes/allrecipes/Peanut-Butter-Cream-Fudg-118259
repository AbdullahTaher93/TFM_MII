In a heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, sour cream and salt; bring to a boil. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Uncover and cook over medium heat until a candy thermometer reads 238 degrees F (soft-ball stage). Remove from the heat; stir in peanut butter and vanilla. With a wooden spoon, beat until thick and creamy, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a buttered 8-in. square dish. Cool and cut into squares. Store in the refrigerator.
