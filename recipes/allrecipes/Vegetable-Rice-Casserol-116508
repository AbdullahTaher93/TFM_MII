In a large saucepan, bring water and butter to a boil; add rice. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until liquid is absorbed. Stir in the parsley, 2 teaspoons dill and 1 teaspoon celery salt; set aside. In a skillet, saute carrots, tomato, green pepper, onion, celery and hot peppers in oil until vegetables are crisp-tender. Stir in soup, milk, basil, thyme, pepper and remaining dill and celery salt. Divide half of the rice mixture between two greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dishes. Top with vegetable mixture and remaining rice mixture. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes or until heated through.
