Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut about 1/2 inch off tip of garlic head and discard. Place garlic in a custard cup. Drizzle with olive oil. Cover with foil and bake in a 350 degree F oven for 30 minutes or until tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife. Let cool. Squeeze garlic pulp out of peels. Mash with a fork, and set aside. Meanwhile, peel potatoes and parsnips; cut into 1/2-inch chunks. Cook, covered, in a Dutch oven in boiling salted water 25 to 30 minutes or until tender. Drain; return potato mixture to Dutch oven. Mash with a potato masher or beat with an electric mixer on low speed. Heat LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk and the 1/4 cup butter in a small saucepan just until boiling. Stir into the potato mixture. Stir in mashed garlic, salt, and pepper. If necessary, heat through. Serve at once. If desired, top with additional butter and fresh thyme.
