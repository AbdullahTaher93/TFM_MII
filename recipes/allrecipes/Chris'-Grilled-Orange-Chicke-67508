Place the chicken into a large bowl, and pour in the lemon juice, lime juice and orange juice. Sprinkle the mint leaves over, and drizzle with honey. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Preheat a grill for medium heat. When the grill is hot, lightly brush the grate with oil. Place the chicken onto the preheated grill, and discard the marinade. Cook for 6 to 8 minutes per side, or until no longer pink and juices run clear.
