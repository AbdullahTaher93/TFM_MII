Add flour and baking powder and pulse about 12 times until incorporated. Add cream and almond extract and process until incorporated, about 5 seconds. In a large bowl with a spoon, mix plums, nectarines, almond extract, sugar, and cornstarch. Pour into prepared dish. Drop batter by heaping tablespoons over fruit. 5. Bake for 20 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining sliced almonds and sugar. Continue baking for 15 to 20 more minutes or until top is golden and fruit is bubbling. Cool slightly before serving.
