Cover and refrigerate the remaining marinade for basting. Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill. Drain and discard marinade from chicken. Grill bone side down, covered, over indirect medium heat for 20 minutes. Turn; grill 20-30 minutes longer or until juices run clear, basting occasionally with reserved marinade.
