To prepare Pebre Sauce: Place onion in a medium bowl, cover with ice water and let soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Drain. Combine the onion, tomato, cilantro, jalapeno (or serrano), vinegar, garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. To prepare steak: Mix paprika, cumin, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper in a small bowl. Rub the spice mixture evenly over both sides of steaks. Heat oil in a large ovenproof skillet, such as cast iron, over medium-high. Add the steaks and cook just until browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast the steaks 5 to 7 minutes for medium-rare, depending on thickness. Transfer to a clean cutting board. Tent with foil and let rest for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, mash avocados with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Carve the steak into thin slices. Serve with the avocado and Pebre Sauce.
