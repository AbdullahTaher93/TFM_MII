In a skillet, saute onion in butter until tender. Remove from the heat. In a bowl, lightly beat one egg. Add the onion, potatoes, flour, salt, pepper and hot pepper sauce if desired. Shape into four to six patties; place on a greased baking sheet. Lightly beat remaining egg; stir in water. Brush over potato cakes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until heated through.
