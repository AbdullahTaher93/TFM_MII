Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Place peaches cut-side down on the grill; cook until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip peaches, dust with cinnamon, and fill each half with 1 tablespoon molasses. Cook until browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Let peaches rest before serving, 3 to 5 minutes.
