In a frying pan, brown the bacon and save the fat. Once the bacon is cooked, begin browning the beef in the saved bacon fat. Cut up the onions, garlic and jalapeno peppers and saute them in the remaining bacon fat. Add 8 tablespoons of chili powder in with the sauteed vegetables. Combine all of the cooked ingredients into a pot; add the Hormel(R) Chili, chicken broth, chili beans and three cups of water to the mixture. Chop up three whole, peeled tomatoes, juice of one lime and add both into the chili. Add in some corn flour to thicken up the mixture. Cook and serve.
