Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking dish with aluminum foil. Season arctic char with salt, place in prepared baking dish, and sprinkle with lime zest. Combine lime juice, olive oil, sherry, rosemary, and garlic in a food processor; pulse until garlic is finely chopped. Spread mixture over fish and season with black pepper and cayenne pepper. Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 12 to 15 minutes, basting with pan juices about halfway through. When the fish is close to being cooked, switch the oven to broil for remaining two minutes or until browned.
