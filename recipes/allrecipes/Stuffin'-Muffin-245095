Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter 18 muffin cups. Melt butter over medium heat in large stock pot or Dutch oven. Add onion and celery; saute over medium heat until vegetables are soft, about 8 minutes. Season with poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper. Remove pot from heat. Mix bread cubes into vegetables; stir until bread cubes are evenly coated. Stir in Swanson(R) Chicken Broth; mix well. Press 1/4 cup mixture into buttered muffin tin cups. Bake in preheated oven until tops of muffins are golden brown, about 35 minutes.
