Dice the hardboil eggs. One way to dice an egg is by using an egg slicer. Slice in one direction and rotate 90 degrees and slice again. This makes match sticks which break into cubes when you mix in the mayo. Trying to turn the egg again to make perfect cubes is more work than it is worth. Stir in the mayo and sour cream. Then add the chopped celery, bell pepper, scallions, celery salt, pepper and fresh dill. Toss and serve.
