Rinse spinach and place (still wet) in a large pot. Cover and cook over medium-low heat, stirring once, until spinach wilts, about 4 minutes. Drain spinach in colander and let cool slightly. Wrap in paper towels and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. In the bowl of a food processor, combine white beans, oil, lemon juice, water, and half the spinach. Puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Coarsely chop remaining spinach. Stir into dip.
