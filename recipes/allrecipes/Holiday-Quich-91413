Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9-inch metal or glass pie dish with vegetable oil spray. Flatten each slice of bread with a rolling pin on a cutting board or flat surface. Cut 5 slices in half vertically (from top crust to bottom crust). Cut a 3-inch circle from the remaining slice with a round cookie cutter or a knife (this will go in the center of the crust). Place slices of bread in the bottom of the pie dish, slightly overlapping each piece to form a crust, gently pressing the slices of bread into the pie dish. Place the reserved bread circle in the center, and gently press down into the other slices of bread. Bake for 10 minutes, or until bread is toasted and golden brown. Remove from oven and place on a cooling rack. Arrange, ham, turkey or Canadian bacon evenly in the bottom of the crust. Arrange red bell pepper and green onions evenly in the crust. In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk, egg substitute, eggs, Parmesan cheese, oregano, salt, and pepper, until blended. Pour egg mixture over the meat and vegetable filling and place the pie dish on a baking sheet. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until center is set. Remove from oven and let mixture rest 5 minutes before cutting into wedges.
