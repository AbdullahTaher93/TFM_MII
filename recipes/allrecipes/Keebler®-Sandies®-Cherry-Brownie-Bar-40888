Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Combine crushed Sandies(R) Cookies and butter in a mixing bowl. To prepare crust, press into lightly greased baking pan (13 X 9 inches). Prepare brownies following directions on box using water, vegetable oil, and eggs. Pour batter on top of the Sandies(R) Cookies crust. Evenly place dollops of cherry pie filling into brownie batter. Bake at 350 degrees F for 28 - 30 minutes or until toothpick inserted comes out clean. Cool and dust with powdered sugar (cover cherries with a paper circle cut out to avoid covering with powdered sugar). If desired, cut into hearts with heart shaped cookie cutter.
