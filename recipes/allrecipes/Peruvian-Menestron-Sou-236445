Heat oil in a pot over medium heat; saute onion, tomato, and garlic until onion is softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add beef and salt to taste; cook and stir until beef is mostly cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Pour about 10 cups water over beef mixture; add garbanzo beans, corn, lima beans, celery, carrot, and cabbage. Boil mixture until vegetables are mostly tender, about 10 minutes. Stir potatoes, peas, and fettuccine into vegetable-beef mixture; cook until potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Blend cotija cheese, spinach, basil, and about 1 tablespoon water in a blender until smooth and liquefied, adding more water as needed. Pour cheese mixture into soup; cook until soup is green and cooked through, about 4 more minutes. Season with more salt if desired.
