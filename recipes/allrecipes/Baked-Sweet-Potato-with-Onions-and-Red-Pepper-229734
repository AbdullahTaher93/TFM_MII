Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the sweet potato on a baking sheet and bake until tender, about 30 minutes. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, red bell pepper, and chili pepper until very tender, about 15 minutes. Stir vegetarian ground beef into the skillet and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Slice cooked sweet potato in half lengthwise and top with the skillet mixture. Place yogurt on top and season with salt and black pepper.
