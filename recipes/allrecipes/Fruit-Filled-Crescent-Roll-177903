In a medium bowl, combine fruit and lemon juice. In a small bowl, combine sugar and cinnamon. Unroll dough and separate into 8 triangles. Sprinkle all but about 1/2 tsp. of sugar mixture over dough. Spoon some fruit mixture onto each triangle, about 1 inch in from edge of shortest side. Fold shortest side up and over fruit then continue rolling to the point. Place rolls point side down on a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle the remaining sugar mixture over crescents. Bake in a 375 degrees F oven until golden brown, 13 to 15 minutes.
