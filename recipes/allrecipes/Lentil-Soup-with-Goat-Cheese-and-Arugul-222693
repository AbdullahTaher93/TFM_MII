Heat olive oil in a stockpot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until the onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add carrots and celery to stockpot; continue cooking until soft, about 10 minutes. Pour vegetable broth, water, and white wine over the mixture. Stir crushed tomatoes, lentils, paprika, bay leaves, honey, salt, and black pepper into the mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover the stockpot, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the lentils are soft, about 1 hour. Remove and discard bay leaves. Ladle into bowls and top with arugula and goat cheese to serve.
