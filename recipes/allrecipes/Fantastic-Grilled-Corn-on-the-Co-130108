Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Husk corn; remove silk. Rinse under cold water; shake off excess water. Wrap each ear in foil. Grill 15 to 20 min. or until corn is tender, turning occasionally. Remove from grill; unwrap corn. Meanwhile, mix butter, Parmesan cheese and parsley. Spread butter mixture on corn.
