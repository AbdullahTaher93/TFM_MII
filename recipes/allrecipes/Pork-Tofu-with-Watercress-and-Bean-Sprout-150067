Place pork in a wok or skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until pork is browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Stir in the soy sauce, water, ginger, and black pepper; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and simmer until meat is tender, about 40 minutes. Stir in the watercress and bean sprouts, and continue to simmer until tender yet still crisp, about 10 minutes more. Mix in the tofu, cover, and simmer 5 minutes more.
