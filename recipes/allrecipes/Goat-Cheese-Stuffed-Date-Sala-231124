Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Spread goat cheese inside each date half. Cook dates on preheated grill until dates begin to caramelize and goat cheese melts, about 5 minutes. Remove from grill and cut each date half into halves. Mix spinach, pear, onion, and tomatoes together on a plate or in a bowl; top with dates. Drizzle olive oil and vinegar over salad.
