Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in tomato paste and anchovy fillet, cook until fragrant and color deepens, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in chicken broth and bring to a boil. Stir in tortellini and beans; cook until tortellini are cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Stir in salt, black pepper, 1 pinch red pepper flakes, and oregano. Add spinach; cook and stir until just wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Ladle into bowls and garnish with red pepper flakes and grated Parmesan cheese.
