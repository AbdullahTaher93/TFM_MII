In a food processor, combine the flour and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Pulse until blended. Add the oil and butter. Pulse until the mixture resembles a fine meal. Add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed, and pulse just until the dough forms large clumps. Form into a ball and flatten into a disk. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Coat a 9-inch pie plate with cooking spray. Place the dough between 2 pieces of waxed paper and roll into a 12-inch circle. Remove the top piece of paper and invert the dough into the pie plate. Peel off the second piece of paper. Press the dough into the pie plate and up onto the rim, patching where necessary. Turn under the rim and flute. Chill in the refrigerator. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the brown sugar, egg, egg whites, vanilla extract, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and the remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt until well-blended. Whisk in the pumpkin and milk. Pour into the chilled crust. Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F. Bake for 25 minutes, or until a knife inserted off-center comes out clean. Cool on a rack.
