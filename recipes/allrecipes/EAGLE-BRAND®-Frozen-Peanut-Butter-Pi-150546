Chocolate Crunch Crust: In heavy saucepan, over low heat, melt butter or margarine and semi-sweet chocolate chips. Remove from heat; gently stir in oven-toasted rice cereal until completely coated. Press on bottom and up side to rim of buttered 9-inch or 10-inch pie plate. Chill 30 minutes. Pie filling: In large bowl, beat cream cheese until fluffy; gradually beat in sweetened condensed milk then peanut butter until smooth. Stir in lemon juice and vanilla. Fold in whipped cream. Turn into prepared crust. Drizzle topping over pie. Freeze 4 hours or until firm. Return leftovers to freezer.
