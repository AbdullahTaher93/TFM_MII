Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. In a 12-inch nonstick frying pan over high heat, combine beef, onion, and garlic. Stir often until beef is well browned and crumbled, about 15 minutes. To pan, add marinara sauce, olives, 1/4 cup green onions, hot sauce, and cumin. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring often, until bubbling, 5 to 6 minutes. Add salt to taste. Keep warm. Meanwhile, cut sandwich rolls in half horizontally. Brush cut sides lightly with olive oil. Arrange rolls, cut sides up, in a 10- by 15-inch baking pan. Bake rolls until lightly toasted, 5 to 6 minutes. Place bottom half of 1 roll on each plate. Ladle meat sauce equally onto rolls. Sprinkle with additional sliced green onions. Cover sandwiches with roll tops and serve immediately.
