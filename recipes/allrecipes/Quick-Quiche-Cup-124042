In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and sour cream until smooth. Add eggs; mix well. Stir in Swiss cheese, bacon, red pepper and oregano; set aside. Separate dough into 10 biscuits; flatten into 5-inch circles. Press each into the bottom and sides of a greased muffin cup. Divide the egg mixture among biscuit-lined muffin cups, using about 2 tablespoons for each. Bake at 375 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand 5 minutes before removing from tin and serving.
