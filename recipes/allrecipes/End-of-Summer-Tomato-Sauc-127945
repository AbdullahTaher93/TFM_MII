Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and cook just until golden, about 30 seconds. (Do not allow garlic to burn, or the sauce will be bitter.) Add tomatoes and red-pepper flakes; reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring often, until tomatoes break apart and sauce begins to thicken, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Season sauce with salt. Stir in basil and remove the saucepan from heat.
