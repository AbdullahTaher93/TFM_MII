Coat a grill rack with cooking spray. Preheat the grill. Place the tomatoes in a small bowl. Cover with boiling water and let soak for 10 minutes, or until soft. Drain and discard the liquid. Meanwhile, place the eggplant, squash, onion, and peppers on the prepared grill rack and cook for 6 minutes, turning once, or until lightly browned and softened; remove from the grill and set aside. In another small bowl, combine the cream cheese, goat cheese, sour cream, thyme, pistachios (if using), and tomatoes. Remove the soft insides from the crust of each half of the bread. Reserve for another use. Spread the tomato mixture over both halves of the bread. Layer the grilled vegetables on the bottom half, then cover with the top half of the bread. Cut into 4 sandwiches.
