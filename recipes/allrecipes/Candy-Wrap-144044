Lay the tortilla out on a clean surface or dinner plate. Spread orange marmalade on one half, then spread maple syrup on the other. Roll the tortilla up tightly, starting at the end with the syrup and finishing with marmalade. Use toothpicks to hold it together if needed, or wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for a few hours, then slice into 1 inch pieces to serve.
