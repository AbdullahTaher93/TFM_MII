Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine cream of celery soup, Cheddar cheese, milk, sour cream, mayonnaise, tuna, parsley, lemon juice, salt, and ground black pepper in a 9x5-inch loaf pan; stir until sauce is well mixed. Toss the pasta into the sauce until thoroughly coated. Spread the bread crumbs over the top of the pasta mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until bread crumbs are golden brown and sauce is bubbly, about 45 minutes.
