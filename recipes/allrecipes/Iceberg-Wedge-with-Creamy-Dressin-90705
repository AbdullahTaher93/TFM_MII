Cut out and discard the core from the iceberg lettuce, then hold the lettuce under cold running water and carefully loosen the leaves from inside the cored end. Shake off and drain away as much water as possible, discarding any bruised outer leaves. Blot the head of lettuce dry with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel, then wrap loosely in paper towels, place in a plastic bag, and refrigerate until chilled and crisp, for at least 30 minutes or up to 5 days. Serve cut wedges of iceberg lettuce topped with choice of creamy salad dressing. If desired, accent ranch-dressed lettuce wedge with a sprinkle of minced red or green bell peppers; or blue cheese-dressed lettuce with a few slivered radishes or cherry tomato halves and fresh basil.
