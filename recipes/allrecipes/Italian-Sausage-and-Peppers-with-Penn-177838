Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage in 2 batches and cook until it's well browned. Remove sausage with a slotted spoon and set aside. Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining oil. Add the peppers and onions and cook for 5 minutes. Stir the pasta sauce into the skillet. Heat to a boil. Return the sausage to the skillet and reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 20 minutes or until the sausage is cooked through and the vegetables are tender. Serve over the pasta and sprinkle with cheese.
