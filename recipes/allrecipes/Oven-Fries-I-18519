Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Microwave the potatoes on high power for 5 minutes. Cool slightly and cut potatoes in half lengthwise, then cut each half into 4 wedges. Drizzle potatoes with oil; sprinkle with paprika and salt. Arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes, until crispy and browned.
