Stir in broth, tomatoes and salsa; bring to boil. Simmer on medium-low heat 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, brush both sides of tortillas with remaining dressing; cut in half, then into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Spread onto rimmed baking sheet. Bake 10 minutes or until crisp and lightly browned. Stir chicken and corn into soup. Bring to boil on medium heat; simmer on medium-low heat 5 minutes or until heated through, stirring occasionally.
