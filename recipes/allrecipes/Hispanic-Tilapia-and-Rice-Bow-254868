Pat tilapia filets dry with paper towels and season both sides with salt and pepper. In large skillet, heat oil and add tilapia filets. Cook until fish releases easily with a spatula; flip and cook until fish is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from skillet and set aside, tenting loosely with foil to keep warm. Add beans, corn, water, salsa, cumin, chili powder and contents of rice package to skillet, stir well. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce heat. Simmer until water has been absorbed and rice is tender, about 7 minutes. Place rice in a serving dish and top with fish. Serve immediately.
