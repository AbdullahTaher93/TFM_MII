In a medium saucepan over medium heat, cook pine nuts in 1 tablespoon olive oil, stirring often, until golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in 2 teaspoons of the thyme, then add 2 1/2 cups water and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in couscous, cover, and remove from heat. Let stand for 5 minutes or up to 15 minutes. Add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 teaspoon thyme, fluff with a fork and pour into a bowl.
