Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Press one biscuit onto bottom and up the sides of each cup of two 6-cup muffin pans (will fill 10 cups). Chill until ready to fill. Blend gravy mix and milk; set aside. Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat. Stir in peas, pimientos, turkey and thyme; heat through. Add gravy mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, until gravy comes to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring constantly, 1 minute, or until thickened. Spoon turkey mixture into prepared biscuit cups. Bake 15 minutes.
