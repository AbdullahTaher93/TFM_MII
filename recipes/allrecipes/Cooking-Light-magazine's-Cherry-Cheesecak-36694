Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Coat a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray. Combine crumbs, 2 tablespoons sugar, and margarine. Firmly press crumb mixture into bottom and 2 inches up sides of pan. Combine 2/3 cup sugar, flour, and next 5 ingredients (flour through eggs) in a large bowl; beat at high speed of a mixer until smooth. Add milk and sour cream to cheese mixture; beat until smooth. Beat egg whites (at room temperature) at high speed of a mixer until soft peaks form. Gradually add 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until stiff peaks form using clean, dry beaters. Gently fold egg white mixture into cheese mixture. Pour into prepared pan. Bake at 300 degrees for 55 minutes or until almost set. Remove from oven, and cool completely on a wire rack; cover and chill 8 hours. Top with pie filling.
