Preheat oven broiler. In 8-inch ovenproof skillet (preferably nonstick), heat oil over medium-high heat. Add leek and saute until fragrant and starting to soften, about 2 minutes. Add bell pepper and saute 2 to 3 minutes more. Whisk eggs, ricotta, salt, and black pepper in medium bowl. When leek and bell pepper are tender, add egg mixture to skillet. Lower heat to medium and cook, stirring constantly and scraping eggs from bottom and sides of pan with spatula. When eggs start to solidify (about 1 minute), stop stirring and use spatula to smooth out top, making sure vegetables are evenly distributed. Cook over medium heat until eggs are mostly solid and bottom of frittata is golden brown (use spatula to peek underneath), about 4 minutes. Put skillet under broiler and cook until top is golden brown and eggs are cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Cut frittata into 4 wedges with spatula and serve.
