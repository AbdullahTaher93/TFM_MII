Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix butternut squash, onion, mayonnaise, Cheddar cheese, sugar, and egg in a casserole dish. Combine cracker crumbs, pecans, and sunflower seeds in a bowl; sprinkle over squash mixture. Pour melted butter over crumb topping. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling and crumb topping is browned, about 45 minutes.
