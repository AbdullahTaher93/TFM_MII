Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and sear on all sides. Remove chicken from pan. Add shallots and cook until beginning to turn translucent, about 3 minutes; stir in garlic and mushrooms and cook and stir until mushrooms begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Stir in Swanson(R) Chicken Broth and wine; add bay leaf and fresh thyme. Cover and cook over low heat until chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove bay leaf. Whisk together flour and cream. Stir mixture into chicken and sauce. Cook and stir over medium heat until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.
