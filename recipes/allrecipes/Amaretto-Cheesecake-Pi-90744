Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. For crust, in a small bowl stir together cookie crumbs and margarine; using the back of a spoon, press mixture evenly over bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Bake until lightly browned (6 to 8 minutes). Remove from oven. Meanwhile, in a food processor or blender, combine cream cheese, cottage cheese, amaretto, egg, egg white, and 1/2 cup of the sugar; whirl until smooth. Pour mixture into baked crumb crust. Return pie to 350 F oven and bake until top feels dry when lightly touched and center jiggles only slightly when pan is gently shaken (25 to 30 minutes). Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir together remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, sour cream, and vanilla to make topping. Remove pie from oven, then reduce oven temperature to 250 F. Pour sour cream mixture over hot cheese pie, smoothing gently to spread evenly. Sprinkle with almonds. Return to oven and bake for 5 minutes. Let cool on a rack (about 1 hour), then cover lightly and refrigerate until cold (at least 2 1/2 hours).
