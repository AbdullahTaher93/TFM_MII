Shorten grilling time by pounding the chicken breasts to an even thickness before cooking. Put each breast between sheets of plastic wrap and, starting at the thickest point, pound the chicken with a tenderizer or the heel of your hand until the thick part is even with the thin part. Put the chicken in a resealable plastic bag with the marinade, setting aside 1/4 cup, and refrigerate overnight. Grill for about 12 to 15 minutes per side. Brush with the reserved marinade before serving.
