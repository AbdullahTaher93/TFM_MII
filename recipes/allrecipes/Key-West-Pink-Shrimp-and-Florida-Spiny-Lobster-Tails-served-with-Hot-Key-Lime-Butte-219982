Mix 1/2 cup of butter with hot pepper sauce and Key lime juice in a small bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat; stir in shrimp and lobster tails. Cook and stir until shrimp just turn pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and stir in the mushrooms, garlic, and white wine; continue to cook and stir until the mushrooms have released their liquid and are tender, about 5 more minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the Key lime juice mixture until melted.
