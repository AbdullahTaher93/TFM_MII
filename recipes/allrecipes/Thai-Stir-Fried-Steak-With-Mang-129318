Make the dressing first. In a small saucepan whisk together the vinegar, honey, chili powder, paprika, and ginger. Slowly whisk in the water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer uncovered for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the lime or lemon juice. Set aside. Peel the mangoes (but not the plums), cut the fruits in half, remove the pits, and cut into 1/2-inch thick slices. Place in a large, shallow bowl (you should have about 5 cups). Add the watercress, cabbage, cucumber, red pepper, green onions, cilantro, and mint. Toss gently to mix. Set aside. Diagonally cut the steak into 1/4-inch thick strips. In a large bowl coat the steak with 3 tablespoons of the dressing, the soy sauce, garlic, and sugar. Heat a wok or nonstick skillet over high heat, add the oil, and then the steak. Stir-fry until the steak strips are cooked to taste. Spoon the steak over the salad. Drizzle with the rest of the dressing and sprinkle with the peanuts.
