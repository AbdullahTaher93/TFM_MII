Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Mix water, tomato juice, tomato paste, minced onion, chili powder, sugar, oregano, garlic salt, and salt into ground beef; cover skillet and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer beef mixture, stirring occasionally, until flavors have blended, about 30 minutes. Place spaghetti into beef mixture and stir to separate strands; cover skillet and simmer, stirring frequently, until spaghetti is tender, about 30 minutes.
