Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Crumble sausage into the pot and cook until completely browned, about 5 minutes. Remove sausage from pot with a slotted spoon to a bowl, retaining oil and drippings in pot. Cook and stir onion in reserved drippings until tender, about 5 minutes. Season onion with salt, Italian seasoning, and black pepper; stir. Add red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, and orange bell pepper to the onion mixture; cook and stir until the peppers are slightly tender, about 2 minutes. Stir white wine and garlic into the pepper mixture. Bring the liquid to a simmer and cook until the liquid reduces to almost nothing, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir diced tomatoes with their juice into the pepper mixture. Return sausage to the pot; fold gently to integrate the sausage. Cook at a simmer until the sausage is reheated and the tomatoes tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Drizzle remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil over the sausage mixture. Add about half the basil and the parsley; stir. Place lid on pot and remove from heat. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pappardelle at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Divide pasta between 6 bowls; top with sausage mixture to serve.
