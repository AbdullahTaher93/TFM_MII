Flour chicken breast, then dip in egg, then in Parmesan cheese to coat. In a small skillet, saute chicken over low heat, seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. When the chicken is half done (after about 4 to 5 minutes), stir in the cream and green onions. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat, sprinkle with a handful of Parmesan cheese, and serve.
