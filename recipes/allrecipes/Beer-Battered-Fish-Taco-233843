In food processor, place Chimichurri Aioli ingredients. Cover; process, using quick on-and-off motions, until smooth. Empty into bowl, and refrigerate until ready to serve. In deep fryer or heavy saucepan, heat at least 2 inches oil to 350 degrees F. While oil is heating, mix flour and beer in medium bowl. Cut fish fillets into cubes. Dip cubes into batter, and fry fish in batches, about 3 minutes per side, until golden brown and cooked through. Drain on paper towels; sprinkle lightly with salt. Fill each taco shell with fish, cabbage, a dollop of aioli and chiles. Serve with lime wedges.
