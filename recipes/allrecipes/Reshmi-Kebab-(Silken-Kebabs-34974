Place almonds in a small bowl and cover with water. Allow to soak for 15 to 20 minutes; drain. Place almonds, peppers, garlic, ginger, and cilantro into the bowl of a food processor; blend until smooth. Season with salt, and blend in lemon juice. Blend in cream. Transfer mixture to a large, non metallic bowl. Place chicken in bowl, and turn to coat. Cover, and marinate in refrigerator for 24 hours. Preheat grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate. Remove meat from marinade, and thread onto skewers. Brush meat with butter, and arrange skewers on hot grate. Slowly cook the chicken until cooked through.
