Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Melt the butter or margarine in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, bay leaves, onion and green bell pepper and saute for about 5 minutes. Add the meat and saute until slightly browned on all sides. Transfer mixture to a 2 quart casserole dish and pour the tomatoes over the mixture. Cover and bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for about 2 hours. (Note: Also can be done in a slow cooker on low setting for 6 to 8 hours.)
