Bake the small cake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes, the medium cake for 40-45 minutes and the large cake for 55-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 15 minutes before removing from dishes to wire racks to cool completely. In a mixing bowl, beat frosting and food coloring. Place large cake on a serving plate; spread with frosting. Top with medium cake; frost. Add small cake; frost top and sides of entire cake. Using a wooden spoon and beginning at bottom of cake, make circles in frosting around cake to form the beehive. Position chocolate wafer at the base for the entrance.
