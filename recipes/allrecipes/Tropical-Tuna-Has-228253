Mix together almond flour, coconut flour, tuna, orange juice, almond milk, baking powder, pineapple, and egg in a bowl until incorporated into a batter. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Scoop batter into skillet and allow it to cook, without mixing, about 3 minutes. Flip batter with a spatula every 3 minutes for about 15 minutes, or until there is an even mixture of light tuna color and golden, crispy batter on each side.
