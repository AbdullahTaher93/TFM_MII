Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and place a sheet of aluminum foil on the grate. While grill is heating, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Drop asparagus spears into boiling water and stir gently; cook until the asparagus are bright green but still crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the asparagus and cool quickly under a stream of cold water. Place asparagus into a bowl and toss with olive oil, salt, and black pepper. Place asparagus onto the foil-lined grill grate and cook until tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Turn spears over several times with tongs. Transfer grilled asparagus to a serving platter. Stir cilantro, light butter, fat-free sour cream, and lemon juice together in a bowl; drizzle over asparagus to serve.
