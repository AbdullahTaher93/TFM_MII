Light the grill or heat the broiler. In a small glass or stainless-steel bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, savory, salt, and pepper. Add the oil slowly, whisking. Put the trout fillets in a medium glass dish or stainless-steel pan. Add the marinade and turn the fillets to coat. Grill or broil the fish 2 minutes. Turn and cook until just done, about 2 minutes longer for 1/4-inch-thick fillets. Serve with the lemon wedges.
