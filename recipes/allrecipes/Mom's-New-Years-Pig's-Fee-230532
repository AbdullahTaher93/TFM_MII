Thoroughly wash pig feet in cold water and place into a large pot or Dutch oven. Add celery, onion, vinegar, red pepper flakes, seasoned salt, garlic, black pepper, and bay leaves to the feet; pour in water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until meat is tender and falling off the bones, about 2 hours.
