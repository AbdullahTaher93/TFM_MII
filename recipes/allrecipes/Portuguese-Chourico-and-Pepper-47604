In a slow cooker, combine the sausage, green pepper, onion, tomato paste, wine, water, and crushed garlic. Stir so that everything is evenly distributed. Cover, and set on Low. Cook for 8 hours. Uncover the pot, and cook an additional 2 hours to allow some of the liquid to evaporate. Serve over rice, or with Portuguese rolls.
