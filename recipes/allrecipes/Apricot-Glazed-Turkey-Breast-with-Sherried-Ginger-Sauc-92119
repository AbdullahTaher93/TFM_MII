If turkey is frozen, thaw in refrigerator for at least 48 hours. Rinse breast and pat dry. Set on a rack in a foil-lined 9- by 13-inch pan. Bake in a 375 degree F oven until a thermometer inserted in center of thickest part reaches 120 degree F (45 to 55 minutes). Meanwhile, in a 1 1/2- to 2-quart pan, melt jam over medium-low heat. Stir in 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice, and the ginger. When the turkey reaches 120 degrees F, brush some of the apricot mixture over breast. Continue roasting, brushing twice more with apricot mixture, until a thermometer inserted in center of thickest part reaches 155 degrees F to 160 degrees F (30 to 40 more minutes). Transfer turkey to a platter and keep warm; let rest for 10 to 20 minutes. To the remaining apricot mixture in pan, add remaining soy sauce and lemon juice, and the broth. In a 1-cup glass measure, smoothly mix cornstarch with sherry. Add to broth mixture and stir over high heat until sauce comes to a boil (about 4 minutes). Pour any accumulated juices from turkey platter into sauce; season to taste with salt and pepper. Slice turkey and serve with the sherry-ginger sauce.
