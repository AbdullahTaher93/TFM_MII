Place carrots into a microwave-safe bowl; add brown sugar, butter, and orange marmalade to carrots. Cover bowl loosely with plastic wrap and cook in microwave on high power for 3 minutes; stir. If butter and marmalade aren't completely melted, continue cooking on high power for 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until carrots are coated with glaze.
