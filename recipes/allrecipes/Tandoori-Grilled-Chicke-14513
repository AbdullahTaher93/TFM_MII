Preheat grill for medium heat. In a large bowl, mix yogurt and tandoori spice. Reserve 1/2 cup for basting. Add chicken to remaining sauce, and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Brush oil over grate to prevent sticking, and place chicken on the grill. Cook chicken for 5 to 6 minutes per side, basting with reserved yogurt marinade frequently. Serve hot.
