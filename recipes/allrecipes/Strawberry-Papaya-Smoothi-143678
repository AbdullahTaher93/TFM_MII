In a blender container combine papaya, strawberries, LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, and honey. Cover and blend until smooth. With the blender running, add ice cubes, one at a time, through the opening in the lid, until ice is crushed and mixture is smooth. Pour into glasses. If desired, garnish with additional strawberries or sliced papaya and fresh mint. Serve immediately.
