Saute scallions and Jalapeno pepper in two teaspoons butter in large non-stick fry pan. In large bowl, whisk eggs with 1/2 cup Bandito Peach Salsa, 1/2 cup Roasted Garlic Red & Green Pepper Sauce, cumin, salt and pepper. Pour egg mixture over scallions and scramble gently, until fully cooked. In separate 12-inch non-stick fry pan, over medium high heat, melt remaining 1 teaspoon of butter and place one flour tortilla and about 1 large teaspoon of cheese. Add 1/4 of the cooked eggs. Cover with second large teaspoon of cheese and cover with second tortilla. Repeat. Cook 2 minutes per side on medium high heat until golden brown. Remove from pan. Cut each of the quesadillas into four. Spoon on remaining Bandito Peach Salsa and sour cream. Dust on chili powder.
