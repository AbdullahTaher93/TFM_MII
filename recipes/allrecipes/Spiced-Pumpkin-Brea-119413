In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients. In another bowl, combine the eggs, pumpkin, oil and water; mix well. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Pour into three greased 8--in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely.
