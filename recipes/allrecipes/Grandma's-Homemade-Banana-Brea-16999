Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x4 inch loaf pan. Combine sugar, butter, bananas, eggs, flour, baking soda, milk, salt and vanilla extract in a large mixing bowl; beat well. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in a preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.
