Cook bacon in a large skillet and over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels and crumble once cooled. Mix bacon, broccoli, red onion, raisins, and cashews together in a large bowl. Whisk mayonnaise, brown sugar, and red wine vinegar together in a separate bowl; drizzle over the broccoli mixture in small amounts, tossing the salad between additions to coat somewhat evenly.
