In a skillet over medium heat, brown pork chops in butter. Add water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until juices run clear and pork is tender. Drain pork chops on paper towels. Drain all drippings from pan. In a bowl, combine muffin mix, egg, milk and chili powder; mix until blended. Immediately coat chops with batter. In the same skillet over medium heat, fry chops in oil until batter is golden brown and cooked through.
