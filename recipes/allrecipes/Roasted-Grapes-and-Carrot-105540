Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Toss together the grapes, carrots, and red onion in olive oil to coat. Sprinkle with cumin and toss to evenly distribute. Spread mixture on baking sheet. Roast in preheated oven until carrots have begun to soften, about 15 to 20 minutes.
