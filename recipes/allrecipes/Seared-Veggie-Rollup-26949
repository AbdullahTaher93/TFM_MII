In a medium saucepan over medium heat, cook and stir jalapeno peppers, banana peppers, Anaheim pepper, garlic and onion in oil until soft, about 3 minutes. Mix in the frozen mixed vegetables, water, vegetable broth, lemon juice and hot pepper sauce. Raise heat to high and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until thick and darkened, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Separate crescent roll dough into triangles, and arrange on a large baking sheet. Place a generous amount of the vegetable mixture on each triangle. Roll triangles around the mixture. Bake in the preheated oven 20 minutes, or until lightly browned.
