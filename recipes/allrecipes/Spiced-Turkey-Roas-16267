Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place turkey in a roasting pan, and rub with olive oil. Combine the cinnamon, cloves, allspice and peppercorns; rub over turkey. Place turkey in the oven and roast for about 1 hour until juices run clear. Prepare a sauce by combining the cranberries and 2 cups water in a saucepan and bringing to a boil. Lower the heat and cook until cranberries begin to pop; add the orange juice. Combine the cornstarch or arrowroot with 2 tablespoons water and add to the sauce. Cook until thick and serve over sliced turkey.
