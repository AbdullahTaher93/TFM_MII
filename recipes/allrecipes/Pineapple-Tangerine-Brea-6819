Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Drain pineapple well, pressing out excess syrup with back of spoon. Reserve 3/4 cup of the syrup. In a medium bowl, combine pineapple, reserved syrup, egg, butter and grated tangerine zest. Set aside. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, wheat germ, baking powder, salt and baking soda. Make a well in the center, and pour in pineapple mixture. Stir just until blended. Pour batter into greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pan. Bake for 60 to 70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool in pan 15 minutes. Remove from pan; cool completely on wire rack.
