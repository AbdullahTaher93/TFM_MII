Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place spinach in a glass or microwave safe mixing bowl. Add 1 tablespoon water. Cover and microwave on High (100%) 3 minutes. Drain well and squeeze dry. Blend in remaining ingredients, except Wonder Bread. Cover. Microwave on High 2 to 3 minutes, or until hot and melted, stirring every minute. Cut each slice of toasted bread in half diagonally, then in half diagonally again, making 4 pieces per slice. Arrange slices in a single layer on foil-lined baking sheet. Spoon about 1 tablespoon hot dip onto each bread quarter, spreading until even and just near the edges. Bake 5 to 6 minutes or until golden and hot.
