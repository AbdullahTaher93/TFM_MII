Place baby back ribs portions in the bottom of a slow cooker; sprinkle black pepper and five-spice powder on top. Mix hoisin sauce, pineapple juice, green onions, rice wine vinegar, sesame oil, brown sugar, ginger, and garlic in a bowl to make sauce. Pour 2/3 of the sauce over the ribs. Refrigerate remaining sauce. Cook ribs on Low, basting occasionally with sauce, until tender, 6 to 8 hours. Transfer ribs to a serving dish. Brush remaining sauce on top.
