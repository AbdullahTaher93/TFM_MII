In a medium bowl, combine onions, rice, cheese, paprika, caraway seeds, and capers. Lay 1 filo sheet flat (cover remaining filo with plastic wrap to prevent drying) and brush lightly with butter. Top with another filo sheet and brush with more butter; repeat using remaining filo to make a stack; reserve remaining butter. Starting about 1 inch from a narrow edge, lay ham slices over filo to cover about a third of the dough; leave a 1- to 2-inch margin at sides. Evenly pat rice mixture over ham. Roll filo from ham end to enclose filling. Gently transfer strudel, seam side down, to a buttered rimless baking sheet (at least 11 by 14 in.). Brush strudel lightly with remaining butter. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven until golden brown all over (15 to 17 minutes). In a small bowl, mix sour cream with mustard; set aside. Place watercress in a large bowl; sprinkle with vinegar, then toss lightly. Using 2 wide spatulas, slide strudel onto a platter. Cut into thick slices and serve with watercress. Add sour cream sauce to taste.
