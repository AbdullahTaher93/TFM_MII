Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Bring almond milk to a boil; steep tea 4-5 minutes or until a desired tea flavor is reached. Meanwhile, whisk together eggs, whites, sugar and salt in a medium bowl until blended. Very gradually whisk hot milk mixture into egg mixture and stir until sugar is dissolved. If lumps appear, strain mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl or pitcher. Stir in orange zest. Divide mixture between 6 ramekins or tea cups and bake in a water bath until set but still a bit jiggly when shaken, 50-60 minutes. Let cool, then wrap and chill for at least 4 hours. Garnish with almonds and serve.
