Saute the onion in the oil in a large frying pan for 10 minutes. Add 2 teaspoons of parsley and the tomatoes. Cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the tomatoes have broken down. Season with the salt and add the lobster meat. Simmer for 10 minutes. Cook the pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain and add to the pan. Serve in individual dishes and sprinkle with the remaining 1 teaspoon of parsley.
