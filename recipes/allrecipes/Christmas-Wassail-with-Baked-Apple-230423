Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place halved apples, cut sides down, on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until apples are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Simmer 2 cups apple cider, cloves, allspice, and nutmeg in a large kettle or pot for 10 minutes. Add the remaining apple cider, orange juice concentrate, and lemonade concentrate; stir until wassail is smooth. Mix brown sugar into the wassail; heat until almost boiling. Float baked apple halves and cinnamon sticks in the wassail; serve warm.
