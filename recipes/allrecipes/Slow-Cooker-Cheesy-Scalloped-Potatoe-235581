Spray a 6-quart slow cooker with the cooking spray. Layer one third of the potatoes and half of the onion in the cooker. Repeat the layers. Top with the remaining potatoes. Stir the soup, milk, Parmesan cheese, salt and black pepper in a medium bowl. Pour the soup mixture over the potatoes. Cover and cook on HIGH for 4 to 5 hours or until the potatoes are tender. Sprinkle with the Cheddar cheese. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted.
