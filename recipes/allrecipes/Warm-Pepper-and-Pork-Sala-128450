Preheat the broiler. Place bell peppers on a broiler pan and cook 4 inches (11 cm) from the heat, turning occasionally, until skin is bubbly and browned all over. Transfer to a paper bag, seal, and set aside 5 minutes, or until cool enough to handle. Remove and discard skin, ribs, and seeds. Cut peppers into strips. Place pork on the broiler pan and cook 12 to 15 minutes, turning once, or until a thermometer inserted in center reaches 155 degrees F (68 degrees C) and juices run clear. Let stand 10 minutes. Cut into thin slices. Warm oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add onion, cabbage, celery, salt, and black pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 10 minutes, or until tender. Divide cabbage mixture among four plates. Arrange peppers and pork on top. Drizzle each with dressing and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) cheese.
