Place carrots in a saucepan and cover with water; cook until tender. Drain and place in a blender or food processor. Add eggs and 1/2 cup water; puree until smooth. In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in remaining water. Add carrot mixture. Stir in oil, sugar, molasses, salt and 5 cups flour; beat until smooth. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Shape into 48 balls. Place 2-in. apart on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise until almost doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until browned.
