Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat a baking sheet with nonstick spray. In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, cardamom or coriander, salt, and 2 tablespoons sugar. Drizzle with oil and mix with a fork until evenly distributed. Reserve 1 tablespoon egg whites. Stir yogurt, lemon peel, and remaining egg whites into flour mixture. Stir gently with a fork until mixture holds together. Turn onto lightly floured surface. Knead about 8 strokes to mix dough thoroughly. Pat out dough to form 8-inch (20-cm) circle. With a sharp knife, cut evenly into 8 wedges. Arrange wedges, about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart, on the prepared baking sheet. Brush with reserved egg whites. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake 15 minutes, or until golden brown.
