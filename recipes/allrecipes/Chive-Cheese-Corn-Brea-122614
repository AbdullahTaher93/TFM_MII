In a large bowl, combine cornmeal, flour, sugar and baking powder. In another bowl, whisk the eggs, milk and butter. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Gently fold in cheese and chives. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 400 degrees F for 18 minutes or until golden brown. Cut into strips; serve warm.
