Heat oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Saute the cinnamon, cardamom, anise, cloves and curry leaves for 2 to 3 minutes, then stir in shallots, garlic and ginger and saute until fragrant. Stir in curry paste and cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Pour in the coconut milk and water and let simmer for 3 to 4 minutes; add chicken, tamarind juice and salt and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes.
