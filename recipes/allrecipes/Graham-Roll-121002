In a mixing bowl, combine the shortening, sugar and salt. Stir in boiling water. Cool to 110 degrees F-115 degrees F. Dissolve yeast in warm water. Add yeast mixture, egg, 1 cup cracker crumbs and whole wheat flour to shortening mixture; mix well. Stir in enough all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into 48 pieces. Shape each into a ball. Dip into melted butter, then roll in remaining cracker crumbs. Place in greased muffin cups. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
