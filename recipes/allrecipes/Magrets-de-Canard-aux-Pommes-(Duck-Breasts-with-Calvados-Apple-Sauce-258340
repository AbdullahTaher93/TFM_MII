Place duck breasts skin-side down in a nonstick skillet over high heat; cook for 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low; cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Melt butter in a separate skillet over high heat. Add apples; cook and stir until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low; cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Remove skillet from heat; pour in Calvados. Cook and stir over low heat, scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the skillet, until alcohol evaporates, about 1 minute. Serve duck breasts with Calvados sauce.
