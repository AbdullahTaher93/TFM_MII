Preheat a grill for high heat. Toss shrimp together with the lime juice, cilantro, and minced garlic. Place one shrimp inside each jalapeno half, and wrap with a slice of bacon. Thread onto skewers, 5 shrimp per skewer. Lightly oil the grill grate. Place skewers on the grill and cook for 4 to 5 minutes per side or until the bacon has browned and the shrimp are pink.
