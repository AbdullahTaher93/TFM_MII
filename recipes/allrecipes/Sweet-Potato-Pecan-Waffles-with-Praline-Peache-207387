Heat a medium skillet over medium heat for 1 minute. Add 2 tablespoons chopped pecans and brown sugar. Stir until sugar melts and coats the nuts; be careful that they do not burn; set aside. Puree sweet potatoes with their liquid and milk in a blender until smooth; set aside. Preheat a non-stick waffle iron. Mix waffle mix, sweet-potato mixture and egg yolks in a large bowl until well combined. Stir in the remaining, uncooked pecans; set aside. Beat egg whites in a clean bowl with a whisk until they hold a shape, and fold into the waffle batter; set aside for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, strain juice from peaches into a large skillet then set peaches aside. Stir honey into juice, and boil over high heat until lightly thickened, about 5 minutes, stirring often. Stir in peaches and reserved sugar-glazed pecans; keep warm. Lightly coat the interior of the preheated waffle iron with spray oil. Pour about 1/3 of batter onto the hot waffle iron and cook until puffed, brown and crisp, according to manufacturers directions. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve immediately with peach topping.
