In a small skillet, saute onion in oil until golden brown; cool slightly. Unroll crescent dough and separate into triangles. (Please note: there will be two extra triangles that may be used to make dinner rolls.) Spread 1 teaspoon of mustard on each triangle. Divide onions equally on the triangles, and place one link on the wide end of each triangle. Carefully roll-up. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15 to 18 minutes or until golden brown. Serve hot.
