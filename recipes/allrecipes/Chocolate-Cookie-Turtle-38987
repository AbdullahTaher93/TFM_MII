SHAPE slightly rounded tablespoons of cookie dough into balls; place over circle onto pecans. REPEAT with remaining pecans and dough, placing turtles two inches apart on baking sheets.

MICROWAVE caramels and milk in medium microwave-safe bowl on HIGH (100 percent) power for 1 1/2 minutes; stir. Microwave at additional 10- to 20-second intervals, stirring until smooth. Drizzle over turtles.
