Mix the chipotle powder, lime juice, salt, honey, and vanilla to make the glaze. Spear the fruit onto skewers (preferably bamboo). Spray the kabobs with cooking spray (away from the grill) and place them over direct heat. When the edges of the fruit chunks brown, flip the kabobs. When the other side browns, move the kabobs to a cooler section of the grill and brush on the glaze, flipping and brushing every minute until the fruit begins to soften.
