Cut off the tops of the peppers and toss the cores and seeds. Stand the peppers in an 8x8-inch microwavable dish, add 2 Tbsp water, cover with plastic wrap, and nuke for 3 to 5 minutes. Next, remove the peppers and discard the water. Chop the pepper tops and mix with the onion, garlic, and oil in the dish. Heat for 3 to 5 minutes, or until soft. Stir in the beef and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until the meat is browned. Mix in the rice and microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the seasoning packet, the tomatoes, and 1 cup water. Cover with plastic wrap and nuke for 15 to 18 minutes, or until the rice is tender. Fill the peppers with the mixture, put them in the dish, and pour the tomato sauce over the tops. Heat for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the sauce is hot.
