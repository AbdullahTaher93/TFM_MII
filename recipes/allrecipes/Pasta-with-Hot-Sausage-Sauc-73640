In a skillet over medium heat, cook the sausage until evenly brown. Mix the red onion, garlic, and capers into the skillet, and cook until onion is tender. Mix in the mashed whole tomatoes, crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and red wine. Season with basil, parsley, oregano, red pepper, black pepper, and salt. Bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Simmer 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place the ziti in the pot, cook 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain. Serve the sauce mixture over the cooked pasta. Top with Romano cheese.
