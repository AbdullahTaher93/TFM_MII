Mix pulled pork and onion together in a bowl. Spoon pork mixture, about 1 teaspoon per wonton, onto the center of each wonton wrapper. Moisten 2 of the 4 sides of each wrapper with water and fold wrapper over filling, forming a triangle. Press to seal. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) or until almost smoking. Working in batches, fry wontons in the hot oil until golden brown, about 1 minute. Transfer cooked wontons to crumpled paper towels. Serve immediately with barbeque sauce.
