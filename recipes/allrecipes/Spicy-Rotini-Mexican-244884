Pour whole box of pasta into a large skillet (approximately 12 inches in diameter). Pour 3 cups of cold water into the pan ensuring that the water covers the pasta. Turn the burner to high and set your timer to 10 minutes (optional: add a bit of salt to taste). Cook on high, stirring occasionally until most of the water is absorbed about 10 minutes but may vary by stove. With about 1 minute left add salsa and cream cheese then season with salt and pepper; fold to combine. Remove skillet from the heat. Top with olives, cheese and parsley before serving.
