I generally use frozen berries to make jam except when my garden is in the height of production. But even then, I sometimes freeze them so I can make jam when I feel like it instead of when they are ready. Cut the strawberries into quarters or eights depending on their size. If the blackberries are fresh then rinse them well. You should have about 6 cups total of fruit. Taste test for sweetness. Be careful not to burn your mouth, the fruit will be very hot - so spoon out just a little and let it cool for a minute. I usually don't need to sweeten this blend of fruits, but every one has their own tastes. Keep adding Splenda a little at a time until the desired sweetness. Dissolve the gelatin in the 1/3 cup of boiling water. Then add this to the fruit and mix thoroughly. Pour into 3-4 jelly canning jars (or recycled jelly jars). Refrigerate for 3 or more hours before using. If you don't think you'll use up the jam within a month, then keep one jar in the refrigerator and put the others in the freezer for future use.
