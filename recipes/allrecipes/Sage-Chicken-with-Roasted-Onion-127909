Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Season chicken, inside and outside, with salt and pepper. Slide your fingers between skin and meat to loosen the skin all over the bird, taking care not to tear skin. Slip sage leaves under skin, pressing them flat against breast and legs. Put chicken in a baking pan, then rub with 1 tbsp. of the oil. Arrange onions around chicken and drizzle with the remaining 1 tbsp. oil. Bake until browned and chicken has reached an internal temperature of 160 degrees F about 1 hour. Remove from oven and allow chicken to rest for 15 minutes before carving.
