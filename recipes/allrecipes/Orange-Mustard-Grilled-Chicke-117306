In a small bowl, combine the first six ingredients; mix well. Pour 3/4 cup marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add the chicken. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 45 minutes. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade for basting. Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill. Drain and discard marinade from chicken. Grill, covered, over medium heat 5-6 minutes on each side or until juices run clear, basting occasionally with reserved marinade.
