Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion in the hot oil until a light golden brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in crushed tomatoes, garlic, and basil and bring mixture to a boil. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low and let sauce simmer, stirring occasionally, and skimming off any oil that accumulates on top. Cook until sauce is thick and reduced, about 1 1/2 hours.
