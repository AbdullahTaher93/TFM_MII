Pat the scallops dry. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add a drizzle of EVOO to the pan, then, using a paper towel, spread the olive oil around the pan. Add the scallops and cook, without moving, until caramelized, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook for about 2 minutes. Arrange the orange slices on a platter and top with the oregano, parsley and scallions; season to taste with salt and pepper. Drizzle EVOO over the oranges and top each with a scallop.
