To make the sauce: In a small bowl, add the water, vinegar, lemon juice, lime, juice, rum (if using) and orange extract. Mix well. While whisking vigorously add the guar gum. Continue whisking awhile after it has dissolved to be sure that it does not lump. If it does lump, strain and try again. Set aside. Cut the top green section off of the scallions, mince them and set aside for the garnish. Coarsely chop the bottom white sections. Slice 1/4 of a red bell pepper. The jalapeno should be finely minced. Omit the seeds for they'll create a bitter taste. Crush the garlic clove under a heavy knife or cleaver, remove the skin and mince. Set aside. On a plate, mix together the cumin, oregano, chili powder, allspice, lemon pepper, and salt. Dredge the pork chops into this mixture. Heat the oil in a fry pan over medium-high heat, add the chops and cook for about 3 minutes per side, until it is starting to brown. Remove chops to a plate and cover with foil. Reduce heat to medium; add the butter to the pan and the scallions, bell peppers, jalapeno and garlic. Saute for about 1 minute stirring frequently. Add the Cubana sauce, stir and scrape up any brown bits from the bottom and sides of the pan. Once it comes to a boil, reduce heat to a low simmer. Return chops to the pan to heat through about 5 minutes. Lightly cover, turn the chops every minute or so. Do not let the sauce boil again.
