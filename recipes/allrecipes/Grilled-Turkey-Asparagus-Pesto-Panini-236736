Blend basil, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper in a food processor or blender until smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Add pine nuts and pulse just until pine nuts are chopped, but still visible. Preheat grill for medium-low heat and lightly oil the grate. Cook asparagus on the preheated grill directly on the grate or on a grill pan until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Spread 1 1/2 teaspoons butter onto 1 side of each bread slice. Spread desired amount of pesto onto the opposite side of each bread slice. Layer provolone cheese and turkey on the pesto-side of 2 bread slices; top with a second bread slice, pesto-side down. Place sandwiches directly on the grill and cook until golden brown and cheese is melted, about 6 minutes per side. Remove from grill and cut each sandwich in half.
