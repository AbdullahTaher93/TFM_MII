Chop giblets and cook in butter in a medium skillet over medium heat, 2 minutes. Stir in celery and onion and cook until tender, but not brown. Remove from heat and stir in salt, pepper and poultry seasoning. Place bread crumbs in a large bowl. Toss with giblet mixture and enough broth to lightly moisten the bread. Use stuffing to stuff an 18 pound turkey, or bake separately, in a 2 quart dish, covered, 40 to 45 minutes in a 375 degree F (190 degree C) oven.
