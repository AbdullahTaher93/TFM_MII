Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 2-quart baking dish. Whisk sweetened condensed milk, sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Stir in whole kernel corn, cream-style corn, and butter. Whisk cornmeal, flour, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl; stir cornmeal mixture into the corn mixture. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cornbread comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Serve warm.
