Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute ground beef and onion in the hot skillet, breaking beef into small pieces, until beef is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir garlic into the beef mixture and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute; season with paprika, chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, oregano, and salt. Sprinkle cornstarch over the beef mixture. Pour water over the beef mixture and stir. Bring mixture to a simmer and cook until moisture absorbs into the meat, about 5 minutes. Spoon beef mixture into each tortilla. Top each portion of beef with 2 tablespoons Monterey Jack cheese, 1 tablespoon sour cream, and 1 tablespoon salsa.
