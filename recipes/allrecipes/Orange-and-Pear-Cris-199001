Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Combine flour and SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend in a food processor. Pulse to combine. Add margarine and process until crumbly. Place topping in freezer until ready to use. Cut orange sections from membranes into large bowl. Squeeze juice from membranes over fruit; discard membranes. To the oranges, add pears, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, cornstarch, and nutmeg. Mix gently. Spoon fruit into an 8 8-inch baking dish. Sprinkle with topping. Bake 30 minutes, or until fruit is bubbling and topping is golden brown. Let cool on a rack for 15 to 20 minutes before serving.
