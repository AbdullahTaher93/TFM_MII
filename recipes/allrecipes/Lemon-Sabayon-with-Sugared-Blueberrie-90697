Grate peel and squeeze juice from both lemons. To make sugared blueberries, in a 5- to 6-quart pan, mix 3 tablespoons of the lemon juice (save remaining for sabayon), 2/3 cup of the sugar, and cinnamon. Stir over high heat until mixture is boiling vigorously, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in peel from 1 lemon and blueberries. Divide blueberries equally among 8 serving bowls and refrigerate until sabayon is ready. To make sabayon, in the top of a double boiler or metal bowl (4- to 6-qt.), whisk to blend egg yolks, remaining 1/3 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice (save extra for other uses or discard), and Riesling. Set double boiler over boiling water, or nest bowl in a pan over boiling water. Whisk egg mixture (or beat with a mixer on medium speed) until it is thick enough to hold a mound for a few seconds, 5 to 7 minutes total. Add remaining lemon peel and mint, if using, and whisk. Spoon at once into bowls with blueberries to serve.
