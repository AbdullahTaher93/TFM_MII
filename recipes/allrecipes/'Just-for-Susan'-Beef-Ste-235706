Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook beef in hot oil until browned completely, about 5 minutes. Pour 4 cups water into the pot; add salt and pepper. Bring liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook beef for 2 hours. Stir potatoes, carrots, celery, and onion into the water; cook until all vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. Whisk cornstarch into 2 tablespoons water; stir into the liquid in the pot. Continue cooking until the liquid has thickened, about 10 minutes.
