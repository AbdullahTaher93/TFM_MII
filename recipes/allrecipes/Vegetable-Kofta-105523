Boil the mixed vegetables till soft. Drain, and allow to cool to room temperature. When cool, chop fine and set aside. Moisten the slices of bread with a little water and squeeze out the excess. Stir together the vegetables, bread, mashed potatoes, serrano, onion, ginger, cilantro, and salt. Form into 8 balls. Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry the koftas in the hot oil until golden brown. Drain on paper towels, and allow to cool to room temperature. Make the gravy by melting the butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the onions, ginger, garlic, ground coriander, turmeric, and garam masala; cook until the onions have softened. Mix in the tomato paste and cook for 5 minutes. Pour in the milk and season with salt; cook for 10 to 15 minutes more, stirring occasionally. To serve, reheat the koftas in the gravy. Garnish with the cream and chopped cashews.
