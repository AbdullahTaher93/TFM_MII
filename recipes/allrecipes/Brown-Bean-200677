Pick over the beans, rinse them, and place them in a large bowl with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and enough water to cover by 3 or 4 inches. Allow the beans to soak overnight. The next day, drain and rinse the beans, and place them in a large pot. Stir in the chicken broth, ham hock, black pepper, and salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and reduce the heat to a simmer. Simmer the beans over low heat for 4 hours, adding water occasionally if needed to keep the soupy consistency. Remove the ham hock before serving.
