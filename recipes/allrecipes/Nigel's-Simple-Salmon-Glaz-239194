Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking dish with aluminum foil. Place salmon into the prepared baking dish. Stir barbeque sauce, mustard, white wine, soy sauce, and maple syrup together in a small bowl; pour mixture over salmon. Bake in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes.
