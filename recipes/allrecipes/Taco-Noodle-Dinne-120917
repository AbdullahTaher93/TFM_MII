In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the beef and onion until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the water, taco seasoning and salt. Reduce heat; simmer for 2-3 minutes. Add the mushrooms. Sprinkle noodles over the top. Pour tomato juice over the noodles and stir gently. Cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes or until noodles are tender. Remove from the heat. Combine the sour cream and parsley; spread over the top. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes.
