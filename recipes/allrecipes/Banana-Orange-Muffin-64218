Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Line twelve medium muffin cups with paper baking cups or lightly spray bottoms only with cooking spray. In large bowl, combine oats, flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt and dates; mix well. In medium bowl, combine yogurt, banana, egg whites, oil and orange peel; blend well. Add to dry ingredients all at once; stir just until dry ingredients are moistened. (Do not overmix.) Fill muffin cups almost full. Bake 20 to 22 minutes or until golden brown. Cool muffins in pan on wire rack 5 minutes; remove from pan.
