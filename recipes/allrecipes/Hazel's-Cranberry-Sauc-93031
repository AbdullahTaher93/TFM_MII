In a saucepan, stir together the apple cider, white sugar, brown sugar, allspice, cloves, nutmeg and cranberries. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 15 minutes, until most of the cranberries have popped. Continue cooking until the consistency is thick. Ladle into sterile jars to within 1/2 inch of the rim, seal with lids and rings. Process in a simmering water bath for 10 to 15 minutes to seal, or just transfer to containers, cool, and refrigerate. It will last at least a week if it can escape being gobbled up!
