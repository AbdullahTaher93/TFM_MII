Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and green onions; cook and stir until green onions are wilted, about 3 minutes. Stir in the plum jam, chili sauce, grape juice, lime juice, and allspice. Bring mixture to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until sauce thickens, about 30 minutes.
