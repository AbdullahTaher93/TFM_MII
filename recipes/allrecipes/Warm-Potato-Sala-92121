Cut potatoes into 1-inch chunks. Fill a 4- to 5-quart pan with 2 to 3 cups of water. Place a steamer basket in the pan; bring water to a rapid boil over high heat. Add potato chunks and cover. Steam for 7 to 10 minutes, until potatoes are tender but not falling apart. Drain well; place in a large mixing bowl. Cover with plastic wrap to keep warm until other ingredients are ready. In a small bowl, using a wire whisk, mix vinegar, garlic powder, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Uncover bowl with potatoes. Using a large spatula, evenly mix vinegar mixture, capers, and green onions into potatoes. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and set aside until ready to serve.
