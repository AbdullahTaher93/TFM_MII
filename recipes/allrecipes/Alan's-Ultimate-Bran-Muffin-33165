Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 12 cup muffin pan. In a medium bowl, mix whole wheat flour, wheat germ, wheat bran, oat bran, baking powder, baking soda, ground ginger, and barley malt flour. In a separate medium bowl, thoroughly blend oil, honey, milk, yogurt, and eggs. Gradually fold milk mixture into the whole wheat flour mixture until moistened. Fold in the raisins. Spoon into the prepared muffin pan. Bake 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.
