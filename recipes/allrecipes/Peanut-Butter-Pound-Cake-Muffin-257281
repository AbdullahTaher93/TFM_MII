Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups. Combine pound cake mix, eggs, bananas, peanut butter, butter, chocolate chips, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a bowl; pour into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
