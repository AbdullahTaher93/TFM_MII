Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Combine oil, garlic, basil, rosemary, parsley, red pepper flakes, and salt in a large bowl. Toss in potatoes until evenly coated. Place potatoes in a single layer on a roasting pan or baking sheet. Roast in preheated oven, turning occasionally, until potatoes are brown on all sides, 20 to 30 minutes.
