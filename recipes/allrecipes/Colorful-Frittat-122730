In a large skillet, saute the broccoli, mushrooms and onions in butter until tender. Add ham; heat through. Remove from the heat and keep warm. In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs, water, mustard, Italian seasoning and garlic salt until foamy. Stir in the cheese, tomatoes and broccoli mixture. Pour into a greased shallow 1-1/2-qt. baking dish. Bake at 375 degrees F for 22-27 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
