Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Put sweet potato and red onion in a large bowl. Drizzle 2 tablespoons olive oil over the sweet potato mixture and toss to coat vegetables in oil; spread onto a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven, turning occasionally, until browned on the edges, 30 to 40 minutes. Let roasted vegetables cool to room temperature. Puree jalapeno peppers, garlic, lime juice, and remaining olive oil in a blender or food processor until smooth. Transfer cooled roasted vegetables to a large bowl; add black beans and green bell pepper. Pour pureed jalapeno pepper mixture over the vegetable mixture and toss to coat; season with salt and pepper. Garnish salad with cilantro.
