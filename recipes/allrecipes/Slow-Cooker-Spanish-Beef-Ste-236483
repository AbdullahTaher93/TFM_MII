Transfer beef to a slow cooker, retaining some of the beef drippings in the skillet. Return skillet to heat and heat the retained drippings. Saute onion and garlic in hot drippings until softened, about 5 minutes; add to beef in slow cooker. Stir potatoes, diced tomatoes, sofrito, and olives into the beef mixture.
