Place potatoes in a pot of cold water. Cover and set over high heat; boil until easily pierced with a fork, about 20 minutes. Drain well and cover with a clean dish towel for 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir bacon until very crispy, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Transfer bacon to a blender; blend into tiny pieces. Break Camembert cheese into small lumps; mix with Cheddar cheese and spring onion in a bowl. Mash potatoes until smooth. Stir bacon, Camembert cheese mixture, half of the cream, and butter into the mashed potatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Spread mashed potato mixture in a baking dish. Pour remaining cream on top. Pierce in several places with a fork. Bake in the preheated oven until the top starts to brown, about 15 minutes.
