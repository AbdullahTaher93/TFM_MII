In a bowl, combine biscuit mix, cornmeal and water just until moistened. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead 5 times. Roll out into a 10-in. square; cut into 10 strips. Starting at one end, wrap each strip in a spiral around a hot dog; pinch ends. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 425 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.
