Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Prepare muffin tin by greasing cups or use paper liners. In a large bowl, add flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. Mix together with a fork. In a separate bowl, whisk together butter, Truvia(R) Baking Blend, orange zest and juice, eggs, vanilla, and milk. Stir the wet mixture into the flour mixture until just combined. Fold in chopped cranberries. Fill each muffin cup about 3/4 full. Bake until golden and a toothpick comes out clean (20-25 minutes). Cool muffins in pan for 5 minutes, then remove to a wire rack and cool completely.
