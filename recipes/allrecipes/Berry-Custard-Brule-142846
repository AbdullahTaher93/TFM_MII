For custard, in a heavy small saucepan combine 2 tablespoons sugar and cornstarch. Stir in LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Remove from heat. Gradually stir half the mixture into egg yolks. Return all of the egg mixture to saucepan. Cook and stir until bubbly. Reduce heat to low. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla. Quickly cool the custard by placing the saucepan into a bowl half-filled with ice water for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Transfer mixture to a small bowl. Cover surface with plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled or up to 24 hours. At serving time, rinse berries; drain well. Divide berries evenly among four dessert dishes, custard cups, or goblets. Spoon chilled custard over berries in dishes. Set aside. For topping, in a small skillet or saucepan heat 2 tablespoons sugar over medium-high heat until sugar just begins to melt, shaking skillet occasionally to heat evenly (but do not stir). Reduce heat to low and cook until sugar is melted and golden, stirring as necessary with a wooden spoon after sugar begins to melt. Quickly drizzle caramelized sugar over each dessert serving. Serve immediately.
