Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the onion and garlic in the hot oil until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with the curry powder and stir to evenly coat. Add the chicken and stir. Cover the skillet and cook for 2 minutes. Stir the prawns into the mixture and cook another 2 minutes. Add the ham and bay leaves; season with salt and pepper and mix thoroughly. Again cover the skillet and cook another 2 minutes. Pour the coconut milk into the skillet. Add the rice and stir. Reduce heat to low and cover; cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice is tender, about 30 minutes. Serve hot.
