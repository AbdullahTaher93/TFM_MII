Coat both sides of the bread with olive oil-flavored cooking spray. In a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, cook the bread on 1 side for 2 minutes, or until lightly toasted. Do this in batches, if necessary. Remove from the pan. Arrange 4 of the slices, toasted side up, on a work surface. Top with the cheese, tomato, peppers, and basil. Top with the remaining bread slices, toasted sided down. Carefully place the sandwiches in the skillet. Cook for 2 minutes per side, or until toasted and the cheese melts.
