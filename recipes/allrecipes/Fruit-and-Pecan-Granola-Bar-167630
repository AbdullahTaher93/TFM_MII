Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line an 8-by-11-inch pan with foil. Coat with cooking spray. Whisk egg, egg white, sugar, oil, cinnamon, salt and vanilla in a large bowl. Stir in oats, cranberries (or raisins), pecans and flour. Spread in prepared pan. Bake until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool; cut into bars with a lightly oiled knife.
