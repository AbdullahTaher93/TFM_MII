Combine cabbage, black beans, corn, carrots, bell peppers, and 1 cup cilantro in a large bowl. Toss lightly until mixed. Place sour cream, 1 1/2 cups cilantro, green onions, lime juice and zest, garlic, salt, and cayenne in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse on and off 5 or 6 times to completely blend. Pour dressing over cabbage mixture and toss to coat evenly.
