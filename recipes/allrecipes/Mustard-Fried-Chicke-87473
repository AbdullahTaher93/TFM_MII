Season the chicken wings on both sides by sprinkling with seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, and MSG. I like to lay it all out on a big plastic bag for easier clean up. Coat each piece with a thin layer of mustard. You may use a basting brush or your fingers. Put the flour into a plastic bag, add the chicken, and shake to coat. Heat the oil in a deep-fryer or deep heavy skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). When the oil is hot, add the chicken and cook for 6 minutes on each side, or until juices run clear. Drain on paper towels, and cool for 5 minutes before serving.
