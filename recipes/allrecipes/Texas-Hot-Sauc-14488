Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until soft. Stir in beef and pork and cook, stirring frequently until brown. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in hot dogs. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Drain off any excess fat. Stir in the browning sauce, pepper, salt, tomato paste and water. Bring mixture to a boil. Lower heat and simmer for 1 hour, uncovered. Stir occasionally. Stir in the paprika, chili powder, cinnamon and parsley. Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary. Simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. Using a hand held mixer blend the bread crumbs into the sauce and it's ready to serve!
