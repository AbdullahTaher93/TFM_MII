Preheat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Pour rock salt into a large, shallow casserole dish. Combine watercress, butter, bread crumbs, green onions, celery, tarragon, Italian parsley, anise-flavored liqueur, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a food processor; blend until smooth. Place 8 to 12 shucked oysters on top of the rock salt. Spoon 1 to 2 teaspoons of watercress mixture a top each oyster. Bake in the preheated oven until oysters are firm and butter has melted, about 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining oysters.
