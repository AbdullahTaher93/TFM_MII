In a medium saucepan, place chicken in broth and bring to a boil. Add lime juice, scallion, ginger, and soy sauce. Reduce heat and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove chicken and add mushrooms; cook 5 minutes until mushrooms are soft. Meanwhile, shred chicken. Return chicken to pot and add spinach. Stir and cook until spinach wilts, about 2 minutes.
