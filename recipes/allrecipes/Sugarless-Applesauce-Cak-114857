Combine raisins, fruit and water in a saucepan; cook, uncovered, until water is evaporated and fruit is soft. Set aside to cool. Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, combine flour, baking soda, salt, nutmeg and cinnamon. In another bowl, combine eggs, applesauce, sweetener, oil and vanilla. Add nuts and reserved fruit mixture. Stir into dry ingredients and blend thoroughly. Pour into a greased 10-in. fluted tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until the cake tests done.
