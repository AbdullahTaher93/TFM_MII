Coat a large no-stick skillet with no-stick spray. Warm the skillet over medium heat. Season both sides of the chicken with the Italian seasoning and garlic powder. Add to the skillet and cook over medium heat, turning once, for about 5 minutes, or until browned. Remove the chicken and set aside. Add the onions, green peppers and garlic to the skillet and saute for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the onions are tender. Add the tomatoes (with juice), wine and mushrooms. Return the chicken to the skillet and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover and simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink in the center. If the sauce is too thin, transfer the chicken to a warm dish and set aside. Cook the sauce, uncovered, at a brisk simmer for about 5 minutes, or until thick. Season to taste with the salt and black pepper. Serve the chicken and sauce over the pasta. Sprinkle with the parsley.
