In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter, oil and sugars until light and fluffy. Add pudding mix, eggs and water; mix well. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; gradually add to the chocolate mixture (dough will be stiff). Stir in the chocolate chips. Roll into 1-in. balls. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 9-11 minutes or until set and edges are firm. Cool for 2 minutes before removing to wire racks.
