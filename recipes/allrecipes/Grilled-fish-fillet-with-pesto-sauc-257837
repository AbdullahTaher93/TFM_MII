Heat the Philips Airfryer to 180C. Brush the fish fillets with the oil and season with pepper & salt. Place in the cooking basket of the Airfryer and slide the basket into the Philips Airfryer. Set the timer for 8 minutes. Pick the basil leaves and place them with the garlic, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese and olive oil in a food processor or pestle and mortar. Pulse or grind the mixture until it turns into a sauce. Add some salt to taste. Place the fish fillets on a serving plate and serve them drizzled with the pesto sauce.
