Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Rinse and pat dry the chicken pieces and rub them with brown sugar. In a large skillet, fry the chicken QUICKLY in hot oil (the sugar must not burn). When browned, remove to a 10x15 inch baking dish. Saute the onions and garlic in oil until soft. Add the sweet peppers, tomato paste, raisins, curry powder, chicken stock, bay leaf, salt, black pepper and parsley. Simmer for about 5 minutes. Pour the sauce mixture over the chicken, cover and bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove cover and bake for another 30 minutes or until tender.
