Thaw fish if frozen. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Rinse fish; pat dry thoroughly with paper towels. Whisk together egg and water in a shallow bowl. Combine cornmeal, salt, lemon pepper, and cayenne in another shallow bowl. Dip fish into egg mixture, turning to coat all sides evenly. Then dip into cornmeal mixture, turning to coat all sides evenly. Gently shake off any excess bread crumbs. Heat 1/4 inch oil or melted shortening over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add half of the fish in a single layer; fry on one side for 3 to 4 minutes or until golden. (If fish has skin, fry skin side last.) Turn carefully. Fry for 3 to 4 minutes more or until second side is golden and fish flake easily when tested with a fork. Drain on paper towels. Place cooked fish on a baking sheet and keep warm in oven until ready to serve. Serve fish with Cajun Tartar Sauce. [Cleaning Tip: Once the stove top is cool, wipe up any oil splatters with Clorox(R) Disinfecting Wipes*. Rinse hands once complete.] For Cajun Tartar Sauce: Combine mayonnaise, sweet pickles, onion, lemon juice, Cajun seasoning, and several dashes hot pepper sauce in a small bowl. Sauce may be made up to 1 week ahead.
