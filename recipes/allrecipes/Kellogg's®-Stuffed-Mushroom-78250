Rinse and clean mushrooms removing the stem. Chop stem and set aside. In large fry pan, saute mushroom caps in oil for 1 minute or until slightly softened. Blot mushrooms on paper towel and remove excess oil from pan. Saute mushroom stems and garlic in margarine for 1 minute until slightly softened. Add chicken stock and bring to boil. Place KELLOGG'S STUFFING MIX in medium mixing bowl and add chicken stock mixture, mixing until evenly combined. Add parsley and toss gently. Arrange mushroom caps, stem side up, in shallow baking pan. Fill mushrooms with stuffing mix mixture. Bake at 350 degrees F about 10 minutes or until golden brown and mushrooms are just tender. Serve hot.
