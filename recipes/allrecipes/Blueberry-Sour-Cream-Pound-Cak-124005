In a mixing bowl, cream butter; gradually add sugar and mix well. Add egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition. In a separate bowl, combine sour cream and baking soda. Add alternately with the flour to creamed mixture. Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold egg whites, extracts, butter flavoring and berries into batter. Spoon into a greased 10-in. tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 60-70 minutes or until cake tests done.
