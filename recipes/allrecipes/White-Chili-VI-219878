Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the chicken in the hot oil until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the onion and celery to the skillet; cook and stir until the vegetables are slightly softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the chicken mixture to a slow cooker. Mix in the garlic powder, cumin, bay leaf, salt, black pepper, oregano, cayenne pepper, jalapeno peppers, green chilies, chicken stock, water, and great Northern beans. Cook on Low 8 to 10 hours, or on High 4 to 5 hours. Remove the bay leaf from the mixture. Stir the sour cream and heavy cream through the chili to serve.
