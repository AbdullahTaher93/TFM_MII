Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray four 2-cup ramekins with nonstick cooking spray. Tear croissants into large pieces and place one torn croissant in each ramekin. Layer ham, broccoli, and cheese over croissants. Beat remaining ingredients together in medium bowl. Ladle egg mixture evenly over filling. Press down with fork to submerge filling in egg mixture. Bake 20 minutes or until puffed and center is set. (Pull aside a piece of croissant in the center to check.)
