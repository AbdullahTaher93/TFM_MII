Dip fillets in beaten egg, and then in bread crumbs. In an electric fryer, heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry fish until golden brown. Transfer to a dish, and keep warm. In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add garlic, and saute for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in chicken broth, wine, and lemon juice; bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat, and stir in chopped parsley. Serve butter sauce over fish fillets.
