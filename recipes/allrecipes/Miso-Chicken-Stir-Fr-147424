Combine broth, miso, vinegar, mirin and ginger in a small bowl. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Add carrots and water to the pan; cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender-crisp, about 2 minutes. Stir in the miso mixture, bell pepper, peas and the chicken. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the peas are heated through and the sauce is slightly thickened, 1 to 2 minutes.
