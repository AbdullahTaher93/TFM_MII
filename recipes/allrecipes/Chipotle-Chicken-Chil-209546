Season chicken with chili powder and cumin. Cook chicken in oil in large skillet over medium-high heat, 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper, if desired. Add undrained tomatoes, broth, chipotle pepper and beans. Cook 10 minutes, uncovered, stirring occasionally until slightly thickened and chicken is no longer pink in center. Stir in corn; cook 3 minutes. Garnish with chopped cilantro and diced avocado, if desired.
