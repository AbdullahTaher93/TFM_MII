Cut pocket bread rounds into triangles. Place in one layer on a baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes, until crisp. Let cool, then serve or store airtight up to 3 days. Place whole eggplants on grill rack over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 1 to 2 seconds). Turn occasionally until blackened, wrinkled, and soft, about 15 minutes. Alternatively, to roast eggplants, line a baking sheet with heavy foil. Broil 3 inches from heat, turning once, until done, about 30 minutes. When done, cover with foil and let cool. Holding eggplants by their stems, gently peel off skin with a sharp knife and your fingers (wear gloves if necessary). Discard stem. Tear the flesh into pieces and place in a strainer. Drain for 10 minutes. In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, process eggplant, garlic, sugar, cayenne, cumin, vinegar, and salt until finely chopped. Add oil all at once and process until mixture is pureed. Adjust seasonings to taste. Remove to a bowl; cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or up to 2 days. Garnish dip with tomato and parsley, if desired. Serve with toasted pita triangles.
