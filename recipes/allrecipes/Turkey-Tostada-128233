Place the turkey in a 2-quart (2-L) microwave-safe casserole and microwave on HIGH for 2 to 3 minutes. Break up the turkey clumps and microwave on HIGH until the turkey is no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain off any fat. Stir the tomato sauce, onions, peppers, cumin, and chili powder into the turkey. Microwave on HIGH for 4 to 5 minutes. Set aside. In a medium bowl, mash the avocado with a fork. Stir in the lime juice, garlic and cilantro, if desired. Place the pit in the guacamole to keep the color bright, then set it aside. Place the tortillas on individual plates. Top each with one-quarter of the turkey mixture. Sprinkle each with lettuce, tomatoes and cheddar. Top with the salsa, sour cream, and guacamole.
