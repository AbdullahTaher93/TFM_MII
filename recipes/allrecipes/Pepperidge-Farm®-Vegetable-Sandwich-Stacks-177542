Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place the eggplant and zucchini slices onto 2 baking sheets. Brush the vegetables with the oil. Roast for 10 minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Assemble the vegetable stacks on a baking sheet. For each stack, layer 2 eggplant slices, 2 mozzarella cheese slices, 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon sauce, 2 zucchini slices, 2 mozzarella cheese slices, 1 teaspoon Parmesan cheese and 1 tablespoon sauce, making 6 stacks in all. Bake the bread according to the package directions. Meanwhile, bake the vegetable stacks for 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted. Spread each of 6 serving plates with 3 tablespoons sauce. Top each with 1 bread slice. Top the bread slices with the vegetable stacks. Pour the remaining sauce over the vegetable stacks.
