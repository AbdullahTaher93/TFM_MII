Combine water, condensed chicken broth, beans, garlic, onion, and crushed red pepper flakes into a large saucepan; season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer; cover. Cook, stirring occasionally, until beans are soft, about 3 1/2 hours. You may need to add additional water to keep the beans from drying out. Mash cooked beans with a potato masher to desired consistency. Stir in mozzarella and pico de gallo before serving.
