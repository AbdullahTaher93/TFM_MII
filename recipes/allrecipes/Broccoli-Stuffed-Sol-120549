In a small bowl, combine the butter, lemon juice, salt and pepper. In another bowl, combine the broccoli, rice, cheese and half of the butter mixture. Spoon 1/2 cup onto each fillet. Roll up and place seam side down in a baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Pour remaining butter mixture over roll-ups. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Baste with pan drippings; sprinkle with paprika.
