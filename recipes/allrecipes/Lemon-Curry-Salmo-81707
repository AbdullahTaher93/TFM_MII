Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a small bowl mix together the curry, lemon pepper, garlic powder and a pinch of salt. Place the salmon in the center of a large sheet of aluminum foil. Cover the steaks with the curry mixture. Place a slice of lemon on top of the steaks. Form a tent with the aluminum foil, firmly crimping the top and ends, leaving a big pocket of air over the steaks. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12 minutes per inch thickness.
