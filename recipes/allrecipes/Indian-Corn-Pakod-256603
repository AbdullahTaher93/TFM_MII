Pour sweet corn into a food processor; pulse until coarsely chopped. Mix in chile peppers, onion, rice flour, besan, curry leaves, ginger garlic paste, garam masala, red chile pepper, cumin, turmeric, and salt. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan. Drop small scoops of the corn mixture into the hot oil; cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
