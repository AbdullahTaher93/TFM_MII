Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In medium bowl, combine all crust ingredients until they come together. Knead briefly, then press into a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom or pie tin. In medium bowl, whisk ricotta, eggs, salt and pepper; set aside. Add washed, wet spinach to large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook about 3 minutes, until wilted, stirring. Stir in asparagus; cook 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add vegetables and chives to ricotta mixture; stir to combine. Pour into prepared crust. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake 30 to 35 minutes, until crust is golden and filling is firm. Serve warm or at room temperature.
