Preheat oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). In a 9x13 inch baking dish, layer the chicken breasts, soup and water. Top each breast with a slice of Swiss cheese, then top it all with the breadcrumbs. Cut the butter or margarine into pads and place them over the top of the casserole. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Let cool and serve.
