Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Place 3/4 cup butter, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, and almond paste in large bowl of an electric mixer. Beat at medium speed until smoothly blended, about 2 minutes. Add eggs and beat at medium speed until incorporated, 1 to 2 minutes, scraping bowl once or twice. (Mixture will have small lumps.) Add flour and oats and beat at low speed until blended. Butter bottom and side of a 9 1/2- to 10-inch tart pan with a removable rim. Spread batter level in pan. Arrange alternating circles of raspberries, then blueberries on batter, beginning near rim of pan and spacing berries and circles about 1/4 inch apart, continuing to center of pan. Sprinkle berries and batter with remaining 2 tablespoon sugar. Bake until cake is well browned and a toothpick inserted into the center (not in a berry) comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool on a rack at least 30 minutes, or let stand until next day (cover airtight when cool). Loosen cake from rim with a knife, remove rim, and set cake on a platter. Cut in wedges and serve warm or at room temperature.
