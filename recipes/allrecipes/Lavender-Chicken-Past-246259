Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken until no longer pink, 5 to 6 minutes. Season chicken with 1 teaspoon salt and pepper. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes; drain. Heat cream in a saucepan over medium heat; mix in butter until melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk flour into cream mixture until sauce is thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add lavender and 1 teaspoon salt to sauce and mix well. Stir mozzarella cheese into sauce until melted and smooth, about 5 minutes. Mix chicken and pasta into sauce and simmer until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
