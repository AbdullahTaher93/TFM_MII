Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place butter in large mixer bowl and cream until soft. Add 1/2 cup sugar, vanilla extract, nutmeg, and salt. Cream until thoroughly mixed. Stir in flour and pecans. Shape dough into 1-inch balls and place 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake 15 minutes. Remove from cookie sheets and immediately roll hot cookies in remaining 2 cups sugar. Place sugared cookies on wire racks and set aside to cool. When cool, roll again in sugar.
