Brown ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat, chopping and turning often, about 5 minutes, until beef is cooked through. Add the sloppy joe sauce, kidney beans, and corn and heat through, about 3 minutes. To serve, place a tortilla in a small soup bowl and ladle half cup of the Sloppy Jose mixture in the center. Top with shredded lettuce and diced tomato. Makes 10 bowls.
