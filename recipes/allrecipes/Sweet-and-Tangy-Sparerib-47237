Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat bacon drippings in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Place spareribs in the skillet, and brown on each side for about 5 minutes. Season with garlic salt and pepper. In a medium bowl, mix mustard, molasses, soy sauce, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and hot pepper sauce. Place browned ribs in a large baking dish. Cover with the mustard sauce mixture. Bake 2 1/2 to 3 hours in the preheated oven, basting occasionally with the sauce mixture, to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
