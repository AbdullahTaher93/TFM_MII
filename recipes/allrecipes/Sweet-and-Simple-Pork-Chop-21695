Preheat a grill to medium heat. Put apple in a pan with water and sugar. Cover and cook on low heat, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 20 minutes until cooked and pulpy. Place pork chops under a preheated grill and cook for 5 to 10 minutes on each side. Cover each pork chop with some of the apple sauce mixture then with cheese. Return to grill and cook until cheese melts and is bubbling.
