Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, mix together corn, sour cream, eggs and melted butter. Gradually stir in the cornmeal, sugar and applesauce. Pour into the prepared pan. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.
