Coat a grill rack with nonstick spray. Preheat a grill. Position the rack 4 inches from the heat and let it get hot. Add the eggplant, squash, onions, and peppers in a single layer. Cook the eggplant, squash, and onions for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until lightly browned and softened; remove from the grill and set aside. Continue cooking the peppers until charred all over. Transfer the peppers to a paper bag and let stand for 5 minutes. Remove the tops, charred skin, ribs, and seeds from the peppers; discard. Slice the peppers into thin strips. Place the tomatoes in a small bowl and cover with boiling water. Let soak for 10 minutes, or until softened. Drain. In another small bowl, stir together the cream cheese, goat cheese, sour cream, thyme, pistachios (if using), and tomatoes until well-mixed. Remove the soft insides from the crust of each half of the bread. Discard or reserve for another use. Spread the tomato mixture over both halves of the bread. Layer the grilled vegetables on the bottom half, then cover with the top half of the bread. Cut into a total of 4 sandwiches.
