In a mixing bowl, combine 1-1/2 cups flour, sugar, yeast and seasonings. In a saucepan, heat the milk, water and 2 tablespoons butter to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat until moistened. Add egg; beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 3-5 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into 16 pieces. Shape each into a ball. Melt remaining butter; dip tops of balls in butter and remaining Parmesan cheese. Place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan or two 8-in. round baking pans. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
