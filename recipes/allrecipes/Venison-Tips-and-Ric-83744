Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the venison chunks, and cook until nicely browned on the outside and almost cooked through. Prepare the beef flavored rice mix according to package directions. While the rice is cooking, add the venison, green pepper, red pepper and onion. Simmer until rice is done and peppers are tender.
