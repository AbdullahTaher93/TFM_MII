Heat the barbeque sauce, both steak sauces, apple butter, onion, jalapeno pepper (if desired), garlic, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke, grill seasoning, allspice, cloves, salt, and black pepper in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until mixture is warmed through, then reduce heat to low and cook until onions are translucent, about 4 to 5 minutes more. Reserve 2/3 to 1 cup of the sauce to use for dipping, while the remaining sauce can be used to baste while grilling.
