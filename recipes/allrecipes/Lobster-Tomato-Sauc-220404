Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Stir parsley and lobster tails into onion and garlic; cook until shells turn bright red, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, basil, salt, and black pepper with lobster tails; simmer over low heat for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Remove lobster tails from sauce and shake excess sauce off the shells. If desired, remove lobster meat from shells and stir into sauce or serve lobster pieces separately.
