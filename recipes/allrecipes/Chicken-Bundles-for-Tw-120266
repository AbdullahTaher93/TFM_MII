Divide chicken and vegetables between two pieces of double-layered heavy-duty foil (about 18 in. square). Sprinkle with sage, salt and pepper; top with dill sprigs. Fold foil around the mixture and seal tightly. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 30 minutes or until the chicken juices run clear and vegetables are tender.
