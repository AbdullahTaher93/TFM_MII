Cut squash in half; discard seeds. Place squash cut side up in a 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Fill centers with apple. Cover and bake at 400 degrees F for 30 minutes. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the honey and butter. Cover and microwave on high for 15-20 seconds or until butter is melted. Drizzle over squash. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake, uncovered, 25-30 minutes longer or until tender.
