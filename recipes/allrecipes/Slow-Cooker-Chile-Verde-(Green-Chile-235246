Spread flour into a shallow bowl. Dredge pork cubes in flour to coat. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot oil until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Add pork; cook and stir until pork is browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer pork-and-onion mixture to a slow cooker. Stir salsa verde, diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, diced jalapeno peppers, diced green chiles, garlic, oregano, and cumin into the pork mixture. Cook on Low for 6 hours.
