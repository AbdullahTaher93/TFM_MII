Blend first five ingredients in a small bowl until smooth. Divide sausage, pepper and onion into center of foil squares. Create a packet by bringing up foil sides over 4 times. Then, fold one end 4 times (leaving one end open). Repeat to make 4 packets. Pour an even amount of marinade into opening of each packet. Seal packet by folding remaining end 4 times. Shake packets to coat mixture. Place packets on preheated grill for 45 minutes, turning halfway through cooking time. Remove packets from grill. Carefully open one end of each packet to allow steam to escape. Cool 2-3 minutes. Serve meat and vegetable mixture in pitas or tortillas.
