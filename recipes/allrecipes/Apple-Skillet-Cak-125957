Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Melt the butter in a medium ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the apples and cook for 2 minutes. Add the brown sugar, cinnamon, and raisins. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until the apples are tender. Remove from the heat and spread the apples evenly over the bottom of the skillet. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. In a medium bowl, combine the milk, eggs, egg white, and vanilla extract. Add to the flour mixture and stir just until blended. Pour over the apple mixture in the skillet. Bake for 40 minutes, or until golden brown and puffed. Remove to a rack to cool for 5 minutes. To serve, cut into wedges.
