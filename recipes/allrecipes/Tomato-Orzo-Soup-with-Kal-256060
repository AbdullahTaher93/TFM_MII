Bring beef stock to a boil in a stockpot; add orzo and cook for 5 minutes. Mix in fire-roasted tomatoes, tomato soup, kidney beans, cannellini beans, chicken bouillon, and red pepper flakes into orzo; return to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 1/2 hours. Mix kale into soup and simmer for 30 minutes more.
