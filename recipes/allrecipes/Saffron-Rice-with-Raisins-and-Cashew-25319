In a saucepan bring water to a boil. Add rice and boil for 5 minutes. Stir in the sugar, reduce the heat, and add the clarified butter. Meanwhile, soak the saffron in 1 tablespoon hot water for 10 minutes. To the rice add the saffron, cloves, raisins and cashews. Stir well, cover, and cook over low heat for 5 to 10 minutes more, or until all liquid is absorbed and rice is cooked. Sprinkle with cardamom before serving.
