Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Whisk flour and salt into butter until mixture is smooth and bubbly, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and whisk milk into butter mixture. Bring mixture to a boil, whisking constantly; cook at a boil for 1 minute. Stir in mustard. Reduce heat to low and stir Swiss cheese into milk mixture 1/4 cup at a time until cheese is melted and fondue is smooth, 5 to 10 minutes.
