In a pot, bring the rice and chicken broth to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes. In a pot with enough water to cover, boil the chicken breast halves 20 minutes, or until juices run clear. Drain, cool, and cut into chunks. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat, and saute the onion, green bell pepper, jalapeno pepper, carrot, okra, and garlic until tender. Mix in the cooked chicken and red wine vinegar. Continue to cook and stir 5 minutes. Mix the cooked rice into the skillet. Season the mixture with chili powder, garlic salt, paprika, seasoned salt, cayenne pepper, and black pepper. Continue cooking until heated through.
