In a skillet, saute chicken in 1 tablespoon butter until no longer pink. Season with salt and pepper. Place chicken and artichokes in a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish; set aside. In a saucepan, melt remaining butter; stir in flour and nutmeg until smooth. Gradually add broth. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened and bubbly. Stir in cheese until melted; spoon over chicken. Combine bread crumbs, savory and thyme; sprinkle over chicken. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25-35 minutes or until golden brown. Serve over noodles or rice.
