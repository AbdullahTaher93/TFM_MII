In a food processor, combine the shallots, garlic, anchovies, sun-dried tomatoes, tomato paste, bay leaves and marmalade and process to a smooth paste. Transfer to a large bowl and add the wine, orange juice, vinegar, rosemary, orange zest, salt, crushed red pepper and black pepper. Add the ribs and toss to coat evenly. Cover and refrigerate, turning occasionally for at least 6 hours or overnight. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Remove the ribs from the marinade and arrange them in a single layer on 2 large rimmed baking sheets. Cover with foil and bake for 1 hour. Pour the marinade into a medium saucepan and bring to a boil; let cool. Drain any fat and liquid from the ribs. Continue baking, uncovered, for about 1 hour longer, turning and basting occasionally with the reserved marinade, until the meat is very tender. Transfer the ribs to a platter and serve right away.
