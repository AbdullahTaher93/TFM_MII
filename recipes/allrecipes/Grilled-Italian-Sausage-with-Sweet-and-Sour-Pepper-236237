In a small non-stick skillet, toast almonds over medium heat for 1-2 minutes. Stir in raisins; remove from heat. Let stand for 1 minute. Add vinegar, sugar, salt and pepper. Return to medium-low heat, cook and stir until sugar is dissolved and set aside. Preheat gas grill to medium-low. If charcoal, allow it to burn until white ash has formed on coals. In a bowl, combine peppers and onion wedges. Drizzle with oil; toss to coat. Place sausages and vegetables on grill, and use tongs to turn often. Grill covered for 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked through and browned and vegetables are tender. While sausages and vegetables are grilling, brush polenta slices with Italian dressing. Carefully place on grill, grill for 2 minutes on each side or until lightly toasted. Remove vegetables from grill. Place in a large bowl, add prepared almond mixture; toss gently. On a large platter, arrange grilled sausages, vegetables and polenta. Serve.
