Make simple syrup by mixing sugar and water in a small pot. Heat long enough for sugar to dissolve but not burn, then remove from heat and let cool. Prepare mint extract by washing, patting dry, and placing mint leaves in a small mixing bowl and covering with 3 oz. of Bulleit Bourbon(TM). Soak the leaves for at least 15 minutes, then remove, place in a clean cotton cloth, and wring vigorously over the bowl, bruising the leaves. Dip in bourbon several times and wring so the juice of the mint is dripped back into the bourbon. Set extract aside for at least 1 hour or, if you prefer, place the mint leaves back in the extract for a more concentrated mint flavor. Combine the mint extract with simple syrup in a glass container or jar and refrigerate overnight. To serve, fill each julep cup with crushed or shaved ice and insert a fresh mint sprig. Add 1.5 oz. of Bulleit Bourbon(TM) per cup and follow with 2 tablespoons of the mint mixture, or to taste.
