In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda; cut in margarine until crumbly. Combine yogurt and sugar; stir into the dry ingredients just until moistened. Turn onto a floured surface; knead 4-5 times. Place on a baking sheet that has been coated with nonstick cooking spray; pat into a 6-in. x 4-in. rectangle. Cut into six square biscuits (do not separate biscuits). Brush tops with milk. Bake at 450 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until golden. Serve warm.
