Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a mixing bowl, stir together eggs, thyme, garlic powder, cheese, salt, and pepper. Stir in cream and peas, and pour into a small round baking dish. Arrange potatoes on top of the mixture, drizzle with olive oil, and dot with cubed butter. Bake, uncovered, in preheated oven for 1 hour.
