Saute the sausage until lightly browned and crumbled, about 5 minutes. Drain any excess oil. Add the chopped onions and peppers and continue to cook until they are softened, about 5 minutes. Then add pizza sauce and 1 cup of the grated cheese. Meanwhile, prepare the vegetables of choice by lightly brushing with oil, sprinkling with beef granules and baking on a cookie sheet in a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes. Place the stuffing in the baked veggies and top with grated cheese. Place back in the oven for 20 minutes.
