Put butter, broth, wine, garlic, lemon peel, parsley, and Worcestershire in a 6- to 8-quart pan; bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes. Add crab to broth. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, just until crab is heated through, 5 to 10 minutes. Divide crab among large individual bowls and spoon broth equally over each portion. Offer lemon wedges to squeeze over individual servings to taste.
