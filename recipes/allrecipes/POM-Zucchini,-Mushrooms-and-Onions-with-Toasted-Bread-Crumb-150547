Score fresh pomegranates and place in a bowl of water. Break open the pomegranates under water to free the arils (seed sacs). The arils will sink to the bottom of the bowl and the membrane will float to the top. Sieve and put the arils in a separate bowl. (Refrigerate or freeze any remaining arils for another use.) Prepare fresh pomegranate juice.* Heat oil in a large frying pan. Add onions and cook over high heat until slightly brown and softened. Add zucchini and mushrooms. Stir and cook quickly. Add salt and pepper to taste. Remove vegetables from the pan; set aside and keep warm. Add sherry or Marsala and pomegranate juice to deglaze pan. Return vegetables to the pan. Toast bread crumbs on a baking sheet at 425 degrees F until brown and mix with cheese. Toss bread crumbs with vegetables and add arils. Serve hot.
