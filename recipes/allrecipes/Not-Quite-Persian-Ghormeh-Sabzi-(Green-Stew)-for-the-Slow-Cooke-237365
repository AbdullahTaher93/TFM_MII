Mix diced potatoes and kidney beans in a slow cooker. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook beef and onion in hot oil until both are beginning to brown, about 7 minutes; season with turmeric, 1 teaspoon salt, and black pepper. Transfer beef mixture to the slow cooker. Heat remaining olive oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Saute spinach, parsley, cilantro, and chives in the skillet until slightly wilted, 5 to 6 minutes; add to the slow cooker. Stir chicken broth, lime juice, and garlic into the mixture in the slow cooker. Cook on High for 4 hours. Adjust salt as needed.
