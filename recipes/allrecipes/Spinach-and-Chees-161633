Thaw spinach and drain well. Place in large bowl. Chop up cheddar cheese and butter into inch cubes. Lightly whip eggs. Toss all ingredients in large mixing bowl until they are well combined. Place in a buttered 9x13-inch or 10x10-inch glass casserole dish and bake at 350 degrees F for about 50 minutes, until brown and bubbly. Let sit 10 minutes before serving. Great for picnics and tastes great reheated in the microwave.
