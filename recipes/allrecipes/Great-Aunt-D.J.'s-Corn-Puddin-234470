Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix sugar, flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Beat eggs together in a large bowl until well mixed; stir in cream and butter. Gradually stir sugar mixture into egg mixture until smooth; fold in corn until evenly coated. Pour corn mixture into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until pudding is lightly browned and set in the middle, about 45 minutes.
