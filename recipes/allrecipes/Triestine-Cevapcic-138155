Place beef, pork, parsley, and garlic in a large mixing bowl. Season with seasoned salt, pepper, paprika, and nutmeg. Add egg white and red wine; mix thoroughly until well blended. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to allow flavors to blend. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. Roll the meat mixture into sticks about 1 inch thick by 3 inches long, using less than 1/4 cup of the mixture per stick. Brush the cevapcici lightly with olive oil. Cook on preheated grill until browned on the outside and no longer pink on the inside, about 12 minutes.
