Cook ginger and cumin in hot vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes or until fragrant. Add the vegetable broth, cannellini beans, pumpkin, and salt. Heat through. Remove from heat and puree until smooth with an immersion blender. Set aside 1/4 cup of VOSKOS(R) Nonfat Honey Greek Yogurt to use as topper. Whisk remaining yogurt into soup. Ladle into bowls; top each with a tablespoon of the reserved yogurt, swirling with a knife. Sprinkle with some toasted pepitas.
