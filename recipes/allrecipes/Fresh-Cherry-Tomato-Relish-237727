Stir tomatoes, olive oil, red wine vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until flavors blend and juice accumulates, about 30 minutes. Strain accumulated juices into a small skillet and transfer tomatoes back to the bowl. Cook juices over medium heat until liquid reduces and sauce has a syrup-like consistency, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour sauce back over tomatoes into bowl and stir.
