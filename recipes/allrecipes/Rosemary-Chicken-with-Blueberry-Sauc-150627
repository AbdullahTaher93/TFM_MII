Mix together the rosemary, basil, and pepper in a small bowl. Pour the olive oil into a shallow dish. Pound the chicken breast to about 3/4-inch thickness. Rub each breast with adobo sauce. Sprinkle both sides of each breast with the rosemary mixture and lie them in the olive oil; allow to marinate about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce. Heat the pomegranate juice in a saucepan over medium heat. Once the juice is warm, stir in the blueberry preserves, blueberries, honey, mustard, and mustard seeds. Cook and stir until the sauce thickens, 10 to 15 minutes. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the chicken in the melted butter until no longer pink inside, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Serve with sauce on the side.
