Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Meanwhile, spray cooking oil in a large skillet and saute red bell peppers, garlic and cayenne pepper over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in sour cream and broth; simmer uncovered for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cheese. Toss hot pasta with sauce and season with salt and pepper to taste; serve.
