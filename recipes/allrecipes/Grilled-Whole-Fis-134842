Pour out half of the wine to drink, then fill the bottle with olive oil and the crushed garlic; let it sit for 30 minutes. Lightly salt and pepper the inside and outside of the fish, then sprinkle with the oil-wine mixture. Place the fish (preferably in a fish basket) on the grill, sprinkle with more of the mixture, and add a dash of salt. Turn the fish (ever minute if it's in a basket), sprinkling it with the mixture each time to keep the flesh moist. When the flesh flakes with a fork, it's done (about 7 minutes per inch of thickness). Serve with lemon wedges.
