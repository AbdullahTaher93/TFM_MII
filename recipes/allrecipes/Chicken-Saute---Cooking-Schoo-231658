Place chicken breasts between two sheets of wax paper and pound to 1/2-inch thick. Season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pan-fry chicken until browned on one side, about 4 minutes. Turn and cook chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 4 to 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
