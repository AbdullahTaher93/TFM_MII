Brown ground beef in large nonstick skillet over medium heat 8 to 10 minutes or until beef is not pink, breaking up into 3/4-inch crumbles. Pour off drippings; season with salt and pepper, as desired. Place cranberries, cilantro leaves, chilies and lime juice in food processor container. Cover; process, pulsing on and off, until ingredients are finely chopped. Add 1/2 of cranberry mixture to beef; mix well. Fill each tortilla evenly with beef mixture; top evenly with remaining cranberry mixture. Garnish with cilantro sprigs, lime wedges and lime peel strips, if desired.
