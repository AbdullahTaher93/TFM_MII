Heat olive oil in a soup kettle or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook, stirring frequently, until browned, about 7 minutes. Stir in onion, garlic and Italian seasoning. Cook until onions are tender, about 2 minutes. Stir in broth, carrots, zucchini, tomatoes, beans, pasta, salt and pepper; cover and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, until vegetables and pasta are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in spinach. Cover and let stand until spinach wilts, about 5 minutes.
