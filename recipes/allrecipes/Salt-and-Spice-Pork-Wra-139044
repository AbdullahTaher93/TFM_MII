Season pork chop with onion salt, cayenne, and pepper. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the pork chop and cook until lightly browned on both sides, about 4 minutes per side. Cut pork chop into 1/4 inch strips, return to the skillet, and cook until no longer pink. Smear the center of the tortilla with salsa or guacamole; sprinkle with Cheddar cheese. Place pork strips on top of the cheese and roll tortilla up into a wrap.
