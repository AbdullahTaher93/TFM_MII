Adjust oven rack to center position and heat oven to 250 degrees. Place bread cubes on a cookie sheet with a rim; bake until bread is dried out, about 30 minutes, then set aside to cool. Meanwhile dice and salt the tomatoes in a medium bowl; stir in the garlic and let stand until juicy, about 30 minutes. Prepare remaining ingredients; add to tomatoes and toss. Add bread cubes; toss again. Adjust seasonings, including pepper to taste. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
