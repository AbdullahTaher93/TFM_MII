Cook bacon over medium-high heat in large saucepan until crisp. Use slotted spoon to remove bacon from pan; drain. Add pork cubes and onion to bacon grease; saute until onions are crisp-tender. Stir in chili powder and paprika. Add tomatoes (with juices) and water to pan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until pork is tender, stirring occasionally, about 40 minutes. Stir beans and 2/3 of bacon into chili. Cook and stir until heated through, about 10 minutes. Add salt to taste. Serve chili garnished with remaining bacon, sour cream and green onions.
