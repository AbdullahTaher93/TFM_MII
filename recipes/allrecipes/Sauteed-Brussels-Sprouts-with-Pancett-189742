In a frying pan, cook 4 pieces Primo Taglio Sliced Pancetta over medium heat until crisp. Cool; break into small pieces. Slice 1 onion and saute in 1/4 to 1/2 cup O Organics(TM) Extra Virgin Olive Oil until lightly browned. Add 2 cups halved brussels sprouts and 1/4 cup water (add more water to keep from burning); cook until tender, about 15 minutes. In a serving bowl, toss sprouts with pancetta; season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste. Drizzle with cider vinegar or lemon juice, if desired.
