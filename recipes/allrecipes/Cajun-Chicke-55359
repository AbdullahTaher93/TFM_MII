Prepare Spanish rice mix according to package directions. Keep warm. Meanwhile, combine the flour, poultry seasoning, garlic powder, paprika, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Toss the chicken pieces in the seasoned flour to coat. Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken, and cook until lightly browned and almost cooked through. Stir the nuts into the chicken; cook and stir until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink in the middle. Serve chicken on top of prepared Spanish rice.
