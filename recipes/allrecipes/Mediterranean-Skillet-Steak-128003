Sprinkle both sides of the steaks with the oregano, basil, salt and pepper; rub the seasonings into the meat. Combine the oil and garlic in a large nonstick skillet. Cook over medium heat for about 1 minute, or until the garlic starts to sizzle. Add the steaks to the skillet and cook for about 5 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Remove from the heat and sprinkle with feta, lemon juice and olives. Cut each steak in half before serving.
