Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place chicken in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear. While the chicken is baking, place the chicken stock, garlic, and onion in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, and cook until liquid is reduced by half. Stir in wine, and continue to cook until reduced and slightly thickened. Add the mushrooms and artichokes to the chicken stock mixture. Reduce heat, and simmer until mushrooms are tender. Stir in the heavy cream, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened. Season with salt and pepper, and serve over the baked chicken.
