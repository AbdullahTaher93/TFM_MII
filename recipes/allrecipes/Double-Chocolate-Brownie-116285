In a small heavy saucepan or microwave-safe dish, melt unsweetened chocolate and butter; stir until smooth. In a small mixing bowl, combine egg and sugar. Stir in the chocolate mixture and mix well. Combine the flour, salt and baking powder; stir into the batter until just blended. Stir in nuts. Spread into a greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pan. Sprinkle with chocolate chips. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
