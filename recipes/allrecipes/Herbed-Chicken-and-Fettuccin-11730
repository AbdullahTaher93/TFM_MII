Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Cover to keep warm and set aside. Meanwhile, heat oil in a wok or skillet over high heat. Saute chicken and onion 3 minutes. Add yellow pepper, and continue cooking until chicken is no longer pink and vegetables are crisp-tender. Add garlic, chicken broth, sherry, salt and pepper. Cook just until hot. Blend in cream cheese, and heat through. Do not allow to boil. Combine chicken mixture with hot pasta. Serve.
