Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10x15 inch jelly-roll pan. In a large mixing bowl, combine ground beef, oregano, parsley and garlic. Mix in onion soup mix and seasoned bread crumbs. Mix thoroughly. Using a 1 ounce scoop, scoop and shape the meat mixture into balls. Place in the prepared pan and bake in a preheated oven for 1 hour or until meatballs are browned and cooked through. In a large pot over high heat, bring the spaghetti sauce to a boil and add cooked meatballs. Reduce heat and simmer for 4 hours.
