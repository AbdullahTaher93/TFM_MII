Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Halve Anaheim chile peppers lengthwise; remove the stem, seeds, and ribs. Place peppers cut-side down onto the prepared baking sheet. Cook in the preheated broiler until peppers are blackened and blistered, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and over tightly with plastic wrap. Let peppers steam as they cool, about 20 minutes. Remove and discard skins; chop flesh. Season pork with salt and black pepper. Heat bacon fat in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork; cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer pork to a slow cooker. Pour in beef broth and coat pork with tomato paste.
