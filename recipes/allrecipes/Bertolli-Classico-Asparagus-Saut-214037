Rinse asparagus spears and pat dry. Remove rough ends with a sharp knife if necessary. Heat Bertolli(R) Classico(TM) olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and asparagus spears; cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until asparagus is tender. Sprinkle with Parmesan and salt and pepper to taste before serving.
