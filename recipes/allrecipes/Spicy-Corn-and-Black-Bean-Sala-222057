Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir corn, fajita seasoning, and black pepper in the hot oil until corn is lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. Mix corn mixture, black beans, red bell pepper, green onion, jalapeno pepper, cilantro, lime juice, orange juice, and salt together in a bowl; cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving.
