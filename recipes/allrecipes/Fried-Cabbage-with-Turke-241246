Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir turkey in hot oil until warmed, about 3 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until hot, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low. Pour chicken broth over the turkey mixture; stir. Bring liquid to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes. Stir cabbage with the turkey mixture; season with salt, pepper, and togarashi; cook and stir until the cabbage has begun to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low, place a cover on the skillet, and continue to cook until the cabbage is completely tender, 2 to 3 minutes more.
