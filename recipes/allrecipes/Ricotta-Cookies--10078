Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg, vanilla, and ricotta cheese. Combine the flour and salt; blend into the ricotta mixture. Stir in the candied fruit and walnuts using a wooden spoon. Drop dough by rounded teaspoons onto ungreased cookie sheets. Top each cookie with a pecan half. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until sides begin to brown. Remove and cool cookies on wire racks.
