Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut the onion into thick slices and arrange them on the bottom of a casserole dish. Lay the pork chops over the onions. Season the chops with salt and pepper to taste. Cover the chops with the mushrooms and pour the stewed tomatoes over all. Bake, covered, at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour. Remove cover and bake for 30 more minutes.
