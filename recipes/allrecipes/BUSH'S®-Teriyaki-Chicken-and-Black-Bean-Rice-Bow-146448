Marinate chicken in Teriyaki Marinade and Sauce 30 minutes, turning chicken over several times. Meanwhile, prepare rice according to package directions; wait to drain to keep hot. Thoroughly cook chicken on grill 4 to 5 inches from hot coals about 5 minutes on each side, brushing occasionally with additional teriyaki sauce. Cut chicken into slices; keep warm. Reserving 1/3 cup liquid, drain beans. Blend liquid with lime juice and onion salt; combine with drained rice, beans, bell pepper and parsley. Divide mixture into 4 serving bowls. Sprinkle with black pepper and top with chicken slices.
