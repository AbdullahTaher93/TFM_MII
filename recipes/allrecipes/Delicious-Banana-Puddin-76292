Blend SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, and cornstarch together in a small mixing bowl. Set aside. Place milk, egg substitute, vanilla, and salt in a medium saucepan. Stir well. Add SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener mixture and stir well. Add butter. Cook over medium-low heat 4-5 minutes while stirring constantly. Cook until mixture begins to thicken and bubble. Remove from heat. Add banana extract. Stir well. Pour pudding into a small bowl. Spray surface lightly with cooking spray. Cover with plastic wrap by laying plastic wrap directly on top of the pudding surface. This will prevent any 'skin' from forming on the surface. Refrigerate 2 hours before serving. To serve, divide pudding equally into 6 individual serving bowls and top with sliced bananas.
