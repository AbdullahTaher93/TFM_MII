Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups. In a large bowl, mix flour, oats, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together egg, milk, olive oil and sugar. Mix in strawberries. Stir strawberry mixture into oat mixture just until evenly moist. Spoon into prepared muffin cups. Bake 18 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until a knife inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.
