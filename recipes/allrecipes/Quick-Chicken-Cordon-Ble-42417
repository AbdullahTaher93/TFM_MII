Flatten the chicken to 1/2-in. thickness. Spread mustard on one side; sprinkle with paprika. Top with a ham slice. Roll up tightly; secure with toothpicks. In a bowl, combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese and pepper. Brush chicken with mayonnaise; roll in crumb mixture. Place in a shallow 2-qt. microwave-safe dish; cover loosely. Microwave on high for 7 minutes. Turn the chicken; cook 7 minutes longer or until juices run clear. Remove toothpicks; set aside and keep warm. In a 1-qt. microwave-safe dish, heat the butter on high for 30 seconds; stir in the flour until smooth. Cook, uncovered, on high for 30 seconds. Add milk and salt. Cook 3-4 minutes longer or until thickened. Stir in cheese until smooth. Add the wine or broth. Serve over chicken.
