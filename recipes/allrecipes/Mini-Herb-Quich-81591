Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Mix together the almond meal, parmesan cheese and garlic powder. Mix in the butter. Using a fork or whisk, mix together the water with the powdered egg whites until all dissolved and frothy. Add to the almonds. Mix well. Spoon out 1 tsp of the crust mixture into each of the muffin molds and press down firmly. Bake at 325 degrees F. Meanwhile, beat together the eggs with the salt. Add the cream and the herbs and beat again. Spoon in 1 Tbsp per muffin mold. Top with a pinch of cheddar cheese. Bake at 325 degrees F for 20 minutes or until they have risen above the edges and no longer jiggle. Remove from oven and allow to cool for 15-20 minutes (or until cool enough to handle). Using a thin bladed knife or tooth pick, go around the edge of each mini quiche to loosen it. Turn over onto paper towels. Arrange on a platter and serve.
