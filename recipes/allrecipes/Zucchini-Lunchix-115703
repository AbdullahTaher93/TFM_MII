Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook the garlic in the butter until softened, about 1 minute. Stir in the zucchini and the onion; cover, cook for 2 minutes. Mix the chicken and the remaining 1 tablespoon butter into the skillet; cover. Stirring occasionally, cook until chicken is no longer pink, about 5 minutes.
