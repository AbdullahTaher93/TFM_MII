In a large pot saute onion, garlic, oregano and basil in 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add the neck bones and let simmer with the lid on until the onions are transparent. Note: if using ground beef cook with onion mixture. Once onions are clear, add the tomato sauce, tomatoes, tomato paste and water. If using meat in your recipe add at this time. Cover and simmer for several hours. Before serving, remove neck bones and discard.
