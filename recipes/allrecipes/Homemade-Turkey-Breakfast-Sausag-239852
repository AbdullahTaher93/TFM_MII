Mix sage, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and marjoram together in a small bowl. Place turkey in a large bowl and mix the spice mixture into the turkey using your hands; form into patties. Cook patties in a large skillet over medium-high heat until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
