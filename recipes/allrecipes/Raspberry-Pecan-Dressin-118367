Place the bread cubes, pecans and onions in a large bowl. Combine the egg, butter, vinegar, salt and pepper. Pour over bread mixture; toss to combine. Gently fold in raspberries. Transfer to a greased 1-qt. baking dish. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
