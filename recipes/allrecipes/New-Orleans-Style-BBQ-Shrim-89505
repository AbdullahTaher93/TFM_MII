Cube butter. Whisk together Worcestershire, white wine, lemon juice, Cajun seasoning, pepper and garlic. Pour into a saute pan over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Add the shrimp and cook until the shrimp begin to turn pink. Slowly swirl in butter while continuing to stir the shrimp. Once sauce has thickened and shrimp are cooked through, pour into a bowl and serve.
