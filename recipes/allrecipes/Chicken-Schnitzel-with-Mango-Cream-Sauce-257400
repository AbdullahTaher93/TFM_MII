Place chicken on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound with the smooth side of a meat mallet to an even 1/4-inch thickness. Pour flour into a shallow bowl. Whisk eggs with water in a separate bowl. Spread bread crumbs on a shallow plate. Dredge each chicken breast in flour. Dip into the egg mixture; press into the bread crumbs to coat both sides. Place breaded chicken on a large plate. Combine mangoes, cream cheese, heavy cream, and mango jam in a blender; puree into a smooth sauce. Transfer sauce to the refrigerator to thicken up. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook breaded chicken until golden brown and no longer pink in the center, about 3 minutes per side. Spoon mango sauce over cooked chicken. Garnish with chopped shallots and sea salt.
