Slice beef into thin strips. Cook frozen vegetables according to package directions, but cut cooking time by a third. Drain and set aside, covered. Heat large skillet or wok with oil and add ginger, red pepper, and onion. Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add beef strips and cook for 3 minutes more. Add reserved vegetables and water chestnuts and stir-fry for an additional minute. Add oyster and teriyaki sauces and cook until hot and bubbly, about 1 minute, stirring to coat. Serve over steamed rice.
