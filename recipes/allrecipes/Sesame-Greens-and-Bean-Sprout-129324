Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Toast the sesame seeds in the pan until lightly brown and fragrant. Pour the seeds into a small bowl to cool. Set aside. Heat the oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute until tender, about 3-4 minutes. Add the garlic, cabbage, and bok choy; stir-fry until cabbage is wilted but still slightly crisp, about 5 minutes. Add the bean sprouts, oyster sauce, and sesame seeds, and cook for 2 minutes. Season with a dash of black pepper and serve warm.
