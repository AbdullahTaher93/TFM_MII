Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange chicken breast slices on a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 20 minutes. Top each slice of chicken with 1 to 1 1/2 pineapple rings and a slice of Monterey Jack cheese. Continue baking in the oven until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes more.
