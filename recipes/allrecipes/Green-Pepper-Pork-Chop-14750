In a large skillet, heat oil over medium high heat. Saute onions, then add pork chops and brown for 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Add enough water to barely cover pork chops and top with green bell peppers. Add browning sauce, cover skillet and let all simmer for about 40 minutes, turning chops at least once. Remove pork chops from skillet to serving plate or platter. Thicken bell pepper sauce with flour and water, to taste. Season sauce with salt and pepper to taste, pour over chops and serve immediately.
