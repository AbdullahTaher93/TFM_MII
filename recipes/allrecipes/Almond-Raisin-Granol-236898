Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan with baking parchment. Mix oats, almonds, sunflower seed kernels, and flax seeds together in a bowl. Whisk syrup, honey, coconut oil, water, and salt together in a separate small bowl until smooth; pour over oats mixture and stir. Spread the resulting mixture onto the prepared pan in an even layer. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 60 to 90 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside to cool completely. Remove granola from pan by lifting parchment paper. Break granola into small pieces and put in a bowl; add raisins and toss by hand to mix. Store in an airtight container.
