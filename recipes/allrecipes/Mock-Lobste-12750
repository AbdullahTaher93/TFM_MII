Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, combine the melted butter, paprika, salt and pepper. Place the fish fillets on a non-stick or parchment lined baking sheet. Brush the fillets evenly with the butter mixture and sprinkle the bread crumbs over the tops of each fillet. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until the fish flakes easily with a fork.
