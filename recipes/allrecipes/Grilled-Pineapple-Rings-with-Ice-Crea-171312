Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, medium-high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above the cooking grate only 3 to 4 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). While grill heats, cut pineapple crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices; cut out the core from each slice and discard. In a small bowl, mix brown sugar and lime juice; brush onto both sides of pineapple slices with a pastry brush. Lay pineapple slices on oiled cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook, turning once with a wide spatula, until pineapple is hot and tinged with brown on both sides, about 8 minutes total. With spatula, transfer 1 or 2 pineapple slices to each of 4 dessert plates; top with a scoop of ice cream and sprinkle equally with coconut and peanuts, if you like.
