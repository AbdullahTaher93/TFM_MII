Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add ziti and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 11 minutes. Drain. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Mix ground beef, pasta, sloppy joe sauce, beef gravy, and ketchup together in a bowl; spread into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Top beef mixture with Parmesan cheese. Place baking dish on the middle rack of the preheated oven and bake until heated through and bubbling, about 1 hour. Cool casserole for 5 minutes before serving.
