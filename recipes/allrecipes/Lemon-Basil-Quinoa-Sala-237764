Bring chicken broth and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and broth has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir quinoa, lemon zest, and lemon juice together in a bowl. Add red peppers, cranberries, onion, and basil to quinoa; toss to combine.
