Cook sausage in a large pot over medium heat until fat begins to render from sausage, about 3 minutes. If pan is too dry, drizzle olive oil over sausage and cook until sausage is browned, about 5 more minutes. Stir onion and a pinch of salt into sausage; cook until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir zucchinis and potatoes into sausage; pour in vegetable broth and water. Stir bay leaf, thyme sprigs, salt, and black pepper into mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until stew is thickened and vegetables are tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Turn off heat and stir chives into stew. Adjust salt and black pepper to taste. Stir in cherry tomatoes; serve in large shallow bowls.
