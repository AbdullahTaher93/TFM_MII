Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. Heat a large saute pan over medium high heat, coat with canola oil. Saute the onions and celery until translucent, 3-5 minutes. Add the al fresco Sweet Apple Chicken Sausage, fresh herbs, and the Granny Smith apples, saute until the sausage is lightly browned, 3-5 minutes. Add the dried cranberries, salt, pepper, and chicken broth. Stir until the seasonings are incorporated. Add the cornbread cubes and toss until evenly combined. Transfer to a 12-inch casserole dish (coated with cooking spray). Bake covered for 15-20 minutes until thoroughly heated.
