Combine flour, sugar and corn starch in a medium size bowl. Cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Press into a greased 13 x 9-inch pan. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F oven for 15 to 18 minutes or until crust is lightly browned. Beat eggs, corn syrup, sugar, peanut butter, vanilla and salt in a medium mixing bowl. Stir in coconut and chocolate chips. Pour over crust. Return to oven. Bake an additional 20 to 25 minutes, or until mixture is golden. Cool on wire rack and cut into bars.
