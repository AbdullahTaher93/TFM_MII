Place salmon fillets on a baking sheet and season with salt and black pepper. Combine pecans, maple syrup, vinegar, paprika, chipotle powder, and onion powder in a food processor; pulse until texture is crumbly. Spoon pecan mixture on top of each salmon fillet, coating the entire top surface. Refrigerate coated salmon, uncovered, for 2 to 3 hours. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bake salmon in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 12 to 14 minutes.
