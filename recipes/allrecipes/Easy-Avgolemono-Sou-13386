In a medium sauce pan combine soup and milk. Heat through while whisking. In a small sauce pan boil 1 cup water and uncooked rice. Reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes, or until tender. Add rice to soup and cook until heated through. Add lemon juice in small increments until a subtle lemon taste develops. Serve warm.
