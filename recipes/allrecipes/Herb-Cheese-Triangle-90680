In a large mixing bowl, cream the cream cheese until light and mix in the gruyere. Add the egg and beat until blended. Mix in parsley. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Keeping the other sheets covered with plastic wrap, lay out one sheet of filo dough and brush lightly with melted butter; then cut into 3-inch-wide strips (they will be about 14 inches long). Place 1 heaping teaspoon of cheese filling in one corner of a strip and fold over, making a triangle. Continue to fold the filled triangle along the filo strip, maintaining the triangle shape, until you fold it over for the final time at the end. Place the triangle on an ungreased baking sheet. Repeat until all the filling and filo sheets are used. Bake pastries for 10 minutes, or until puffed and golden brown.
