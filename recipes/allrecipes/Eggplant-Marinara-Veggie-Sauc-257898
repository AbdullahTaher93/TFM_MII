Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 6 to 9 minutes. Drain. Heat olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir eggplant and zucchini in the hot oil until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup tomato sauce. Season with garlic salt and oregano. Cover and simmer until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Stir mushrooms and onion into the pot; cover and cook for 5 minutes. Add remaining tomato sauce and diced tomato. Cover and simmer until tomato begins to break down, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer, stirring occasionally, until eggplant and zucchini soft, about 7 minutes. Serve sauce over quinoa pasta.
