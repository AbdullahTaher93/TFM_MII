Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a small bowl combine oil, salt and pepper. Rub potato skins with oil mixture. Bake potatoes (do not wrap in foil) in preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until soft. Remove potatoes from oven and slice skin off of the top. Scoop the flesh into a large bowl, reserving the intact skins. To the potatoes add cheese, egg, butter and half of the green onions. Mash potatoes while gradually adding milk. Spoon the mixture into the skins and top with remaining onions and paprika. Bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until golden brown.
