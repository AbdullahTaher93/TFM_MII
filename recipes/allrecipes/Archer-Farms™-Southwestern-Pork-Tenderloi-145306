Heat grill. Put pork into a resealable plastic bag and add the cooking sauce and seal. Rub bag to coat the pork with the sauce. Cover and grill over medium-high heat 20 to 25 minutes, basting occasionally with additional sauce and turn until meat is just no longer pink. Sprinkle with fresh cilantro and serve with additional sauce.
