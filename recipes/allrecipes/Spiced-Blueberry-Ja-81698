In a large heavy pot over medium heat, add the 1/4 cup of water, blueberries and cloves. Cook until all the fruit has broken up into a mush, stir frequently. Taste test for sweetness. Be careful not to burn your mouth, the fruit will be very hot - so spoon out just a little taste and let it cool for a minute. I usually only need a scant Tbsp of Splenda, but every one has their own tastes. Keep adding Splenda a little at a time until the desired sweetness. Dissolve the gelatin in the 1/3 cup of boiling water. Then add this to the fruit and mix thoroughly. Pour into 2-3 jelly canning jars (or recycled jelly jars). Refrigerate for 3 or more hours before using. If you don't think you'll use up the jam within a month then keep one jar in the refrigerator and put the others in the freezer for future use.
