Mix together the dry rub ingredients. Set aside 1 Tbsp of the dry rub for the basting sauce. Sprinkle 1/2 of the dry rub on the brisket and literally rub it in. If you wear thin latex gloves the rub seems to stick to the meat better. Turn the brisket over and rub in the remaining dry rub. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate overnight. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F Basting Sauce: In a sauce pan over medium heat, add the canola oil and the minced jalapeno peppers. Cook for 1 minute then add the barbecue sauce, vinegar, molasses and the reserved tablespoon of the dry rub. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Pour 1/2 the sauce into a bowl to be used when serving the brisket (refrigerate it until ready to serve). Add the 1/2 cup of water to the remaining sauce to be used as the mop for basting. Place brisket in a large roasting pan. Baste both sides with some of the basting sauce. Turn brisket so that the fat side is up. Roast for 4-6 hours until tender, basting with more sauce every 30-45 minutes. When done, remove brisket to a serving platter and let it rest for 15 minutes before slicing thinly across the grain. Warm the reserved serving sauce and serve on the side.
