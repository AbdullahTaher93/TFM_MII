Preheat oven to 275 degrees F. In a small bowl mix together the Splenda and ginger. In a medium sized sauce pan over medium heat, melt the butter with 2 tsps of the ginger mixture. Once melted, turn off the heat and add the pumpkin seeds. Stir well to thoroughly coat. Use either nonstick or line a shallow roasting pan with parchment paper. Evenly distribute the pumpkin seeds over the roasting pan. Cook in a 275 degrees F oven for 15 minutes. Stir the pumpkins seeds a couple of times, don't let them brown or pop (reduce heat if necessary). Remove from oven and immediately stir in the remaining sugar/ginger mixture. Once the pumpkin seeds have cooled, place in several small decorative bowls and serve. Or store in an air-tight container until ready for serving.
