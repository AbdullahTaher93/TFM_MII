Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Saute onion and garlic until tender. Stir in sausage and cook until evenly brown. Pour in water and bring to a boil. Stir in green beans; reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until tender, about 30 minutes. Check water level often and add more as needed to prevent scorching. Season with salt to taste.
