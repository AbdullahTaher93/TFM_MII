In a bowl, mix together cocoa powder, flour, brown sugar, canola oil, water, salt, and vanilla. Scoop peanut butter into a microwaveable mug (roughly 1 cup measurement). Pour cake mixture on top. Microwave for 45 to 60 seconds. (Timing is based on a 1200W microwave so your timing might vary). Allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Mix together whipped cream and peanut butter then pipe it on top of mug cake. Finish by sprinkling over chopped toasted peanuts. Serve warm.
