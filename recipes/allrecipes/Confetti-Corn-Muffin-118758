In a large bowl, combine flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, combine egg, milk and butter; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in carrot and green pepper. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 425 degrees F for 14-18 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm.
