Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Whisk together eggs, BACARDI(R) Mixers Pina Colada mix, buttermilk, flour, salt and cayenne until smooth. Place the flour for dredging in a separate bowl. Heat 1-inch of oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Working in batches of 4 or 5, dredge onion slices in flour and dip rings into batter, letting excess drip off. Cook in skillet until golden brown, about one minute per side. Transfer browned rings to a baking sheet and bake for 15-18 minutes, turning once, until crisp. Remove from oven and let sit for 2-3 minutes to cool. Salt to taste and serve with ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce.
