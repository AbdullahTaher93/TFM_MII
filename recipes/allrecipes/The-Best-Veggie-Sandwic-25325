Preheat oven to broil. Place each muffin open-faced on a cookie sheet. Spread each half with mashed avocado; place halves close together. Distributing ingredients evenly, cover each half with sprouts, tomatoes, onion, dressing, sesame seeds and cheese. Place under broiler for about 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
