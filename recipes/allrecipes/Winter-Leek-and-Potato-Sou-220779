Melt butter in a pot over medium heat. Cook and stir leeks and onion until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir potatoes and chicken broth into onion mixture; simmer until potatoes are tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Pour half-and-half into potato soup and continue to simmer until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes more. Stir Cheddar cheese, parsley, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper into soup until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.
