Bring water to a boil in a large pot; add chicken breast, leek, onion, carrot, celery, chicken bouillon, thyme, poultry seasoning, and black pepper. Simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes. Remove chicken from pot and shred. Return chicken to the pot and stir in chicken broth and rice. Continue to simmer until rice is tender, about 30 minutes more, stirring occasionally.
