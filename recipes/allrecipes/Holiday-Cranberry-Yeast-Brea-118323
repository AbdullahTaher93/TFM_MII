In a bowl, combine the cranberries, brown sugar and molasses; set stand for 1 hour. Stir in 1 cup warm water. In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in remaining warm water. Add honey; set stand for 5 minutes. Add the butter, salt, allspice, whole wheat flour, 1 cup all-purpose flour and cranberry mixture. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a bowl coated with nonstick cooking spray, turning once to coat top. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down and turn onto a floured surface; shape into a loaf. Place in a 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to wire rack to cool.
