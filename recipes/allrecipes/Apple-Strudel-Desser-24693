Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch round pan. Using a slotted spoon, place about 1 tablespoon pie filling near the large end of a crescent roll dough triangle. Roll up the triangle. Repeat with remaining dough. Place rolls in prepared pan with points toward the center. Top with remaining pie filling. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake in preheated oven 30 minutes, until browned.
