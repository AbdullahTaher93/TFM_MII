Stir together the mayonnaise, onion, tomato, relish, and piri piri in a small bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and set aside. Season the tilapia fillets on both sides with the seafood seasoning and garlic powder. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the tilapia fillets until they are golden brown on both sides and no longer translucent in the center, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Place two slices of pepperjack cheese on top of each fillet, cover the skillet, and cook until the cheese has melted. Place each tilapia fillet onto a slice of toasted bread, spread with the reserved sauce, then top with the remaining slices of bread.
