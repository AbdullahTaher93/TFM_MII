In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in 1/2 cup warm water; let stand for 5 minutes. Add the milk powder, oil, honey, salt and remaining water. Beat for 1 minute. Add 4 cups flour; beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. For whole wheat dough, in a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in 1/2 cup warm water; let stand for 5 minutes. Add the milk powder, oil, honey, salt and remaining water. Beat for 1 minute. Add whole wheat flour. Beat on medium for 3 minutes. Stir in enough all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and grease in a warm place, about 1 hour. Punch each dough down; divide into fourths. Roll one white portion and one whole wheat portion into 14-in. x 10-in. rectangles. Place whole wheat dough on top of white dough; roll up jelly-roll style. Pinch ends to seal and tuck under. Repeat with remaining dough. Place in four greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 40 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until golden brown.
