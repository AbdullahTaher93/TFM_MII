Heat the olive oil in a skillet with a lid over medium heat. Stir in the leeks and garlic, cook and stir 3 minutes until the leeks begin to soften. Pour in the white wine, and bring to a simmer, then add the tomatoes, chicken broth, thyme, and dill weed. Simmer, uncovered, until the liquid reduces to half. Lay the sole filets on top of the vegetables, and cover the skillet. Cook until the fish is opaque, and flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes. Ladle the sauce over the sole to serve.
