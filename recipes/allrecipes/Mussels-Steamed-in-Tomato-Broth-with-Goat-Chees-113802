In a large pot, heat the oil over moderate heat. Add the onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 minutes. Add the tomato juice, wine, and celery seeds; bring to a simmer. Cover; simmer 10 minutes. Discard any mussels that are broken or do not clamp shut when tapped. Add the mussels to the pot. Cover and bring to a boil. Cook, shaking the pot occasionally, just until the mussels open, about 3 minutes. Remove the open mussels. Continue to boil, uncovering the pot as necessary to remove the mussels as soon as their shells open. Discard any that do not. Using a slotted spoon, put the mussels into four bowls. Add the cheese to the broth and whisk over low heat for 1 minute. Pour over the mussels.
