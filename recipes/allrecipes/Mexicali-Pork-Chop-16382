Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter or margarine in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, green bell pepper and red bell pepper and saute for 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and corn and saute for 5 more minutes. Pour this mixture into a 9x9 inch baking dish. Melt the remaining butter or margarine in the same skillet over medium heat. Add the pork chops and saute for 2 minutes per side, then place the chops in the baking dish over the vegetable mixture and cover with aluminum foil. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 12 to 15 minutes, or until internal pork temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
