Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Spray a sheet of aluminum foil with cooking spray and place salmon in the middle of the foil. Whisk maple syrup, Creole seasoning, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; brush onto salmon. Sprinkle butter chunks over salmon. Fold aluminum foil over salmon, sealing the edges together. Cook on the preheated grill until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes.
