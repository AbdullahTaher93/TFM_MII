Place the ginger, garlic, turmeric, chili powder, and coriander in a blender; blend into a smooth paste. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the fenugreek seeds in the oil until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes; stir in the paste; cook until the oil separates from the mixture, about 20 minutes. Mix in the yogurt, cilantro, chilies, and salt; cook until thick, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the chicken; cook for 10 minutes.
