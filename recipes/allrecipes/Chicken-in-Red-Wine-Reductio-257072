Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine shallots and garlic in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Pour in red wine. Add pomegranate syrup, honey, a few pinches of rock salt, soy sauce, sumac, peppercorns, cloves, cornstarch, and Aleppo pepper. Cook and stir until sauce thickens and coats the spoon, 5 to 10 minutes. Spread chicken wings in a baking dish; sprinkle some rock salt on top. Pour sauce over chicken; spread evenly with a brush. Bake in the preheated oven, basting occasionally with the brush, until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. Turn on the broiler; broil chicken until dark, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle poppy seeds on top.
