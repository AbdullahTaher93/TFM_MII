Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir flour, sugar, and pepper into the melted butter until smooth. Remove saucepan from heat. Stir peas and milk into the butter mixture. Return saucepan to medium heat; bring to a boil while stirring regularly. Reduce heat and cook at a simmer until the sauce thickens, about 10 minutes.
