Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Arrange the tomato slices in a single layer in the bottom and up the sides of a deep dish pie pan. Arrange slices of mozzarella cheese in the center. Sprinkle with the Italian seasoning. Bake for 5 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the cheese is melted. Serve hot or cold.
