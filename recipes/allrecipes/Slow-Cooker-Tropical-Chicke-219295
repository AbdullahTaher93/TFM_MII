Place chicken, sweet potatoes, and onion into a slow cooker. In a bowl, stir together the pineapple chunks with juice, raisins, jerk seasoning, lime zest, Worcestershire sauce, ginger, and cumin until well combined; pour the mixture over the chicken mixture in the cooker. Sprinkle with thyme. Cover the cooker, and set to Low setting. Cook until the chicken and vegetables are tender, about 6 hours.
