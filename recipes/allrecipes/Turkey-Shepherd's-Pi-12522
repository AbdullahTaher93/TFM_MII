Boil potatoes until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. While potatoes are cooking, gather other ingredients. Mash potatoes with butter and milk. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; stir in onion. Saute onion until it has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in ground turkey, carrot, mushrooms, parsley, thyme, garlic, and chicken bouillon. Cook and stir until meat is broken up and cooked through. Add salt and pepper to taste. Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute more. Transfer meat mixture to a deep dish pie pan or casserole dish. Spread mashed potatoes over meat, and swirl with a fork. Bake in preheated oven until tops of mashed potatoes are lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
