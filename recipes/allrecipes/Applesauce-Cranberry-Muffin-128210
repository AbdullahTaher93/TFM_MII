Heat oven to 400F (200C). Coat 12 muffin cups with nonstick spray. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon in a bowl. In another bowl, whisk applesauce, milk, egg and oil. Stir in cranberries. Add cranberry mixture to dry ingredients and stir just until moistened; divide batter among muffin cups. Bake until a toothpick inserted into center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Remove muffins from pan and place on a wire rack to cool. Serve warm or cooled.
