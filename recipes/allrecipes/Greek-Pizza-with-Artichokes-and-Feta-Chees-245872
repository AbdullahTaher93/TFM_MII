Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Once oil is hot, add onion to skillet and cook until just softened, about 5 minutes. Set aside. Divide dough into 2 equal balls. On well-floured surface, with floured rolling pin, roll each ball into a 10-inch circle. Place on large cookie sheets or pizza pans. Brush crusts with remaining olive oil. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Spread pesto sauce on pizza dough within 1-inch from edge; top with red onion, artichoke hearts, chicken, sliced mushrooms, sliced olives and feta cheese. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until crust is golden.
