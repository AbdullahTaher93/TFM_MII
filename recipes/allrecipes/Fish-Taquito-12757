Cut shark into strips 3/4 inch thick and 3 inches long. Mix canola oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, and Cajun style spice mix in a plastic container. Place shark strips in container, and marinate for 1 hour. Warm tortillas in a microwave to make them pliable. Drain marinade, and pat shark dry with paper towels. Place a strip of shark at one end of a tortilla, roll tightly, and secure with a toothpick. Heat oil in a deep fryer. Submerge taquitos in hot oil. Fry until golden brown, no more than 3 or 4 minutes each. Drain on paper towels. Place taquitos in a baking dish large enough to accommodate all twelve. Sprinkle with shredded cheese. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 5 minutes, or until cheese melts.
