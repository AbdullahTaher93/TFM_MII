Combine water, orange juice, Madeira and miso in a medium bowl; whisk until smooth. Add prunes and rosemary; set aside. Place flour in a shallow dish. Season turkey with salt and pepper and lightly dredge in flour, shaking off excess. Discard any unused flour. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the turkey and sear until golden, about 2 minutes on each side. Transfer to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm. Add remaining 1 teaspoon oil to the pan and heat over medium-high heat. Add shallots and mushrooms; cook, stirring, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add the reserved miso mixture and cook, stirring, until slightly thickened, 4 to 5 minutes. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low and return turkey and any accumulated juices to the pan. Simmer gently, spooning sauce over turkey, until heated through, about 1 minute. Transfer to a warmed serving platter and sprinkle with parsley.
