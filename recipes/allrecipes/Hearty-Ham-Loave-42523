In a large bowl, combine the first 11 ingredients. Add ham and sausage; mix well. Shape into two loaves. Place in ungreased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Bake one loaf at 350 degrees for 1 hour. Meanwhile, combine glaze ingredients in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil; boil for 2 minutes. Remove loaf from the oven; drain. Baste with half of the glaze. Bake 30-40 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 160-170 degrees, basting occasionally. Cover and freeze the remaining loaf and glaze for up to 2 months. To prepare, thaw in the refrigerator overnight and bake as directed.
