In small bowl combine water and food coloring. Place coconut in resealable plastic bag. Add food coloring mixture. Seal bag. Toss until coconut is tinted green. Transfer coconut to piece of wax paper to dry. Cut each licorice piece into two 4 1/2-inch lengths. Peel licorice pieces apart into sixteen 4 1/2-inch-long pieces. Set aside. In large saucepan melt butter over low heat. Add marshmallows and stir until completely melted. Remove from heat. Add KELLOGG'S RICE KRISPIES Gluten Free cereal. Stir until well coated. Using 1/3-cup measuring cup coated with cooking spray divide warm cereal mixture into eighteen portions. Using buttered hands firmly press sixteen of the portions into 2 1/2-inch muffin-pan cups. Use the remaining two portions of cereal mixture to attach licorice pieces as basket handles. Cool completely. Remove baskets from muffin-pan cups. Spread about 2 teaspoons of the frosting in each basket. Top with tinted coconut. Arrange 3 to 4 M&M'S Brand Peanut Chocolate Candies in each basket. Best if served the same day.
