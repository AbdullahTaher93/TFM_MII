Prepare fresh pomegranate juice.* Peel potatoes and cut into cubes. Cover potatoes with water and bring to a boil; cook covered until soft, about 30 minutes. Peel and core apples; cut into 1/4-inch slices. Heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil in a large skillet. Brush Worcestershire sauce on pork chops. Salt and pepper the pork chops and put them into the heated skillet. Brown on both sides and lower the heat. Mix 1/2 cup pomegranate juice with balsamic vinegar and cornstarch, and pour into the skillet. Cover the skillet and cook until pork chops are tender, about 20 to 25 minutes. In a large saucepan, add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and apples; cook until they begin to soften. Add grated cabbage, bay leaf, 1/2 cup pomegranate juice, 1/2 cup water, fennel seeds, red wine vinegar and brown sugar. Add salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 30 minutes or until cabbage is soft. Remove potatoes from heat and drain. Mash with a potato masher; add 1/2 to 1 cup warmed buttermilk and butter (optional). Serve pork chops and cabbage with mashed potatoes.
