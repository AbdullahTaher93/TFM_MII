In a large bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. In another bowl, beat eggs, applesauce, oil, orange peel and vanilla. Stir into the dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in zucchini, nuts and chocolate chips. Divide batter between two greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees for 55-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely.
