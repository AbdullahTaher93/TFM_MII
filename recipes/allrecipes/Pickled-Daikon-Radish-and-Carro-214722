Heat vinegar and sugar in a saucepan over low heat until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat, and refrigerate to cool. Place daikon and carrot in a glass jar with the cilantro and chile peppers. Pour the cooled vinegar mixture over, submerging the vegetables. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight.
