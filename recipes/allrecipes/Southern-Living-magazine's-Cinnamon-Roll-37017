ROLL dough on a lightly floured surface into a 16- x 12-inch rectangle; brush with butter. COMBINE brown sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over butter, and top with pecans. ROLL up, jellyroll fashion, starting at a long edge; cut into 3/4-inch thick slices. Arrange in two lightly greased 13- x 9-inch pans. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees) 30 minutes or until doubled in bulk. BAKE at 375 degrees for 25 minutes or until golden brown. Whisk together powdered sugar and milk; drizzle over warm rolls.
