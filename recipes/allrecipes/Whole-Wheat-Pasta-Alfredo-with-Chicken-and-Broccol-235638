Prepare the linguine according to the package directions in a 3-quart saucepan. Add the broccoli during the last 2 minutes of the cooking time. Drain the linguine mixture well in a colander. Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until well browned and cooked through, stirring often. Stir the soup, milk, black pepper and linguine mixture in the skillet and cook until the mixture is hot and bubbling, stirring occasionally. Sprinkle with the cheese.
