Prick the sausages all over with a fork. Melt the butter in a large skillet. Add the sausages and cook over moderately low heat until lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of fat. Add the shallots and wine and bring to a boil. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the shallots are tender and the wine has reduced slightly, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and serve.
