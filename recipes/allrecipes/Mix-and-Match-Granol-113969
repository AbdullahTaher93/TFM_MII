Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the mixed nuts on a medium rimmed baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes, or until lightly toasted. Transfer the nuts to a plate and let cool completely. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. In a medium saucepan, warm the oil and honey over moderately low heat, stirring frequently, until the honey melts, about 2 minutes. In a large bowl, toss the oats, wheat germ, wheat bran and powdered milk. Pour the oil and honey mixture on top and stir until thoroughly coated. Spread the oat clusters on a large rimmed baking sheet. Bake in the center of the oven for 20 minutes, or until golden brown, stirring halfway through. Transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack and let cool completely. Add the nuts, dried fruit and sunflower seeds to the oat clusters and toss.
