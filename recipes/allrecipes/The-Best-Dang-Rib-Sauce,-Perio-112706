Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat, and cook and stir the poblano pepper and onion for 6 to 8 minutes, until the onion is translucent. Stir in the honey, molasses, brown sugar, tomato paste, vinegar, Marsala wine, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, cumin, oregano, smoke flavoring, salt and pepper, and whisk until smooth. Bring the sauce to a boil over medium-low heat, reduce heat to low, and simmer for about 35 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thick. Store refrigerated.
