In a pot, bring the basmati rice and 3 cups water to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Brown the corned beef in the saucepan, and cook the onion and garlic until tender. Season with ginger, turmeric, coriander, salt, chili powder, cinnamon, and cardamom. Place the bay leaves in the saucepan, and pour in 1 cup water. Bring to a boil. Mix in the potatoes, reduce heat to low, and simmer 30 minutes. Stir occasionally, and add more water as needed to keep the ingredients moist. Cover the saucepan, and continue cooking 10 minutes, until potatoes are tender. Serve the beef and potato mixture over the basmati rice.
