In a nonstick skillet, saute turkey in oil for 5-7 minutes or until no longer pink. Sprinkle with Greek seasoning; set aside. Cut two-thirds of the cucumber into thin slices; finely chop remaining cucumber. In a bowl, combine the chopped cucumber, sour cream, onion, dill and lemon juice. Place lettuce, tomato, sliced cucumber, turkey and feta cheese on top of pita breads. Top with cucumber sauce. Bring edges of pita over filling and secure with a toothpick.
