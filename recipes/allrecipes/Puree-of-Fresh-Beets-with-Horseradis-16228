Trim, wash, peel and dice the beets. Place in a medium saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer until beets are tender. Drain. Place beets in a blender or food processor. Add the butter, cream, sugar, lemon juice, horseradish and salt and pepper. Puree until smooth and strain puree through a sieve into saucepan. Gently reheat over very low heat, stirring frequently to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Spoon the puree onto serving plates and garnish with a sprig of dill and a few pink peppercorns.
