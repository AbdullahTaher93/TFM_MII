Pour maple syrup into a small saucepan. Heat to between 223 and 234 degrees F (106 to 112 degrees C), or until fine threads form when dripped from a spoon. If it reaches the temperature before your egg whites are ready, remove from heat, and set aside. In a medium bowl, whip the egg whites with salt until they can hold a peak. Gradually drizzle in the hot syrup while continuing to whip until thick and fluffy.
