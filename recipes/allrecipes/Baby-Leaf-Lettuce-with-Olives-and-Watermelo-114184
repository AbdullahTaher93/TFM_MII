In a blender or food processor, puree 1/2 cup of the watermelon chunks. Strain the juice through a fine sieve into a large bowl. You should have about 2 tablespoons. Discard the solids. Whisk the olive oil and white wine vinegar into the watermelon juice and season with salt and pepper. Add the lettuce, onion, chives, parsley, olives and the remaining 1 1/2 cups of watermelon chunks and toss gently. Transfer the salad to a large platter and serve right away.
