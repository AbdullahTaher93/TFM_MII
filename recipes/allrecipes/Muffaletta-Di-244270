Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine stuffed olives, black olives, and Italian dressing together in a bowl. Mix cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, ham, and salami together in a separate bowl. Spread cheese mixture into a pie plate. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, 15 to 20 minutes. Top dip with olive mixture.
