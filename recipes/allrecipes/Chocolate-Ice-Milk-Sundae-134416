To prepare ice milk: In large bowl, whisk together sugar and cocoa. Slowly whisk in milk and vanilla extract until dry ingredients are dissolved and no lumps remain. Pour into 8x8-inch baking pan. Freeze about 1 1/2 hours or until nearly frozen. Score the surface with a sharp knife and cut into chunks. Transfer to food processor or blender and process until smooth and creamy. Pour into a resealable container. Freeze 2 to 3 hours or until very firm. To prepare sauce: In small saucepan, combine sugar and cocoa. Stir in coffee. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring. Reduce heat to low and cook 8 minutes or until slightly thickened. Let cool slightly and stir in vanilla extract. Serve over scoops of ice milk.
