Heat grill. Rub chicken breasts with the Mexican Grilling Rub. Place chicken on grill over medium-high heat. Cover and cook 10 to 12 minutes or until chicken is fork tender and juices run clear, turning occasionally. Remove from heat; let stand 5 minutes before slicing into 1/2-inch thick slices. Meanwhile, toss remaining ingredients in large salad bowl. Divide salad among four serving plates; top with sliced chicken.
