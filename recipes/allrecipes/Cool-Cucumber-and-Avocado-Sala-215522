Place the cucumber slices into a colander set in the sink, and sprinkle with salt. Set aside and allow to drip. In a salad bowl, mix together the red onion, red bell pepper, lime zest and juice, cilantro, sugar, curry powder, and hot pepper sauce until thoroughly combined and the sugar has dissolved. Drain the cucumber slices, and pat them dry with paper towels. Stir the cucumbers into the salad. Gently toss the avocados with the salad and serve.
