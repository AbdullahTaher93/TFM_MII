Combine dates, cashews, flax meal, cinnamon, and salt in a food processor or blender; blend until very well mixed. While the processor is running, add coconut oil and blend until mixture holds together. Roll mixture into 20 balls (about the size of a large gum ball) and arrange on a plate or baking sheet. Freeze for at least 30 minutes. Keep energy balls stored in the freezer or refrigerator.
