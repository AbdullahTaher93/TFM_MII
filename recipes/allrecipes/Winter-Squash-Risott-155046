Heat oil in heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, cook until translucent. Add the rice, bacon, and sage, stir to coat with oil. Ladle one cup of hot broth into the rice, bring rice to a bubbling simmer. Cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon until the broth is absorbed by the rice, adding more broth as needed. After cooking 10 minutes add the squash along with one cup of broth. Continue to cook, adding additional broth as needed, until rice is creamy but a little firm. Add salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the butter and cheese.
