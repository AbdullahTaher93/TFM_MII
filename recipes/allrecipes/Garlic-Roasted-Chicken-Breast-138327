Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Slice tops from garlic heads, reserving bottoms; arrange tops, cut sides down, in center of an 11-by-17-inch roasting pan. Place 1 sprig oregano over each garlic top, and arrange chicken breasts over garlic. Place reserved garlic bottoms, cut sides up, next to chicken in pan. Drizzle chicken and garlic bottoms with olive oil. Season chicken with salt and pepper; place remaining 4 sprigs oregano on top. Roast chicken 30 minutes; turn garlic bottoms cut sides down, and rotate pan. Continue roasting chicken until skin is browned, juices run clear, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of meat registers 165 degrees F, about 30 minutes more. Pour pan juices into a measuring cup; skim fat from top. Serve with chicken. Use roasted garlic as desired.
