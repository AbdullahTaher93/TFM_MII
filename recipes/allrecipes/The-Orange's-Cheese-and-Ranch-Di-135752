Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a 10-inch saute pan over medium heat, heat the oil and swirl to coat the pan. Add the red onion, bell pepper, and celery and saute until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a mixing bowl. Add the cheddar cheese, package of Hidden Valley(R) Original Ranch(R) Salad Dressing & Seasoning Mix, vinegar, and sour cream to the vegetables in the bowl and toss to combine. Using a rubber spatula, transfer the dip to a baking dish. Bake until the dip is bubbly and heated through, about 12 to 15 minutes. If desired, arrange the orange segments so they form the letters S and U on top of the dip. Arrange the black olives around the letters to cover the top of the dip.
