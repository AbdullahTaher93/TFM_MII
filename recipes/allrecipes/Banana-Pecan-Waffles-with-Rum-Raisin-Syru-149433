To prepare the syrup: Combine SPLENDA(r) Granulated Sweetener and brown sugar in a small saucepan and whisk in the rum and water. Place over high heat and bring to a boil; let boil approximately 30 seconds, making sure the sugars have dissolved. Remove from the heat and add vanilla, cinnamon sticks and the raisins. Let cool while preparing waffles. To prepare waffles: Sift together the first five ingredients into a large mixing bowl. Mix in the pecans. Separate eggs. Beat the egg yolks in a medium mixing bowl. Add the buttermilk, melted butter and mashed bananas. Stir in the dry ingredients until just moistened; do not beat. Whip the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold egg whites gently into the batter. Pour the batter into a preheated lightly oiled or nonstick waffle iron and cook until golden brown but still moist inside, about 5 minutes. Remove the cinnamon sticks from the rum raisin syrup and pour syrup over warm waffles.
