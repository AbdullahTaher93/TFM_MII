Bring the wine, water, prunes, vinegar, honey, ginger, and cinnamon to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the prunes are tender, about 25 minutes. Combine the prune mixture with the flour in a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the prunes moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and return to a clean pot. Simmer over medium-low heat until the sauce has thickened, about 15 minutes.
