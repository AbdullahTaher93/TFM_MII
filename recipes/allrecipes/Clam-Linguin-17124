In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine olive oil, butter, garlic, tomatoes and parsley; simmer and let reduce. Add some clam juice if the sauce reduces too much. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 3 minutes or until al dente; drain. Add clams to the skillet and heat through; top with cheese and serve immediately.
