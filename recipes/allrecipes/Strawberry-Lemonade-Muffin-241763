Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper muffin liners. Stir strawberries, lemon extract, and 1 teaspoon white sugar together in a bowl. Whisk flour, brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Pour milk, oil, and eggs into flour mixture and mix until batter is well-combined. Stir strawberry mixture into batter. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Transfer muffins to a wire rack to cool completely.
