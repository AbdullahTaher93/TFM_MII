Combine chicken broth, 3/4 cup water, orzo, and Greek seasoning in 4-quart saucepan; bring to boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer 9-10 minutes or until orzo is just tender. Whisk together egg yolks, remaining 1/4 cup water and cornstarch in large bowl. Gradually whisk in about 2 cups of the hot broth mixture. Slowly whisk egg mixture back into the remaining broth mixture in pan. Cook over medium-low heat 5-7 minutes to slightly thicken. Do not boil. Stir in chicken and lemon juice; heat. Garnish each serving with thin slice of lemon and chopped parsley, if desired.
