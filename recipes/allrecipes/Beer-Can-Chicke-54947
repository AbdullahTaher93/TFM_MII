Rinse chicken; pat dry with paper towels. In cup, combine paprika, sugar, salt, and red pepper; season chickens inside and out with spice mixture. Rinse outside of 2 beer cans; open cans. Punch 2 additional holes in top of each can. Holding each chicken upright, place over can so that can goes into main cavity. Pull legs forward to form a tripod, allowing chicken to stand upright over can. Wash hands. Preheat grill for indirect heat. Surround disposable foil drip pan with hot coals; add 1 can beer and enough water to equal 2 cups to pan. Place chickens on rack, keeping cans upright, directly above the drip pan. Cover and grill 1 hour, or until juices run clear when thickest part of chickens are pierced or temperature on instant-read thermometer reaches 180 degrees F. Wearing barbecue mitts, carefully remove chickens and cans from grill. Insert large fork into neck of each chicken and lift chickens; holding each can with mitts to remove from chicken. Transfer to platter. (Refrigerate leftovers.)
