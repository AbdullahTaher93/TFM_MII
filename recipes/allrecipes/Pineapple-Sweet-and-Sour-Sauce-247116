Whisk 1/4 cup pineapple juice and cornstarch together in a small bowl until smooth. Combine cornstarch mixture, remaining 1 3/4 cup pineapple juice, sugar, ketchup, vinegar, soy sauce, crushed pineapple, and garlic powder in a large pot over high heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until sauce comes to a gentle boil. Reduce heat and continue to simmer until sauce is clear and reaches desired consistency, 15 to 25 minutes.
