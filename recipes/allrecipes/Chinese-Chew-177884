In a food processor, combine dates, walnuts, flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt. Whirl, using short on-off bursts, until dates and nuts are finely chopped. Add coconut and whirl until just mixed in. In a small bowl, beat eggs and vanilla until blended. With motor running, add egg mixture to the dry ingredients through the feeding tube of the food processor, all at once. Whirl just until mixture is well coated with eggs. Spread mixture evenly in a greased, lightly floured 8-inch-square baking pan. Bake in a 350 degrees F oven until top is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Let cool in pan on rack for about 10 minutes. Then cut into 24 bars. Using thin spatula, lift warm cookies from pan and turn slightly in powdered sugar to coat all sides.
