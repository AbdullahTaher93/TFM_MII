Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Saute onion and celery until tender, about 10 minutes. Pour in the chicken stock, and reduce heat to low. Cook for about 15 minutes. Add the artichokes and oysters, and simmer for 10 more minutes. Finally, stir in the heavy cream and half-and-half cream. Cook until heated through, but do not boil, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately.
