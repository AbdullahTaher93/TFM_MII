In a skillet saute onions in butter until tender; cool. Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the flour, sour cream, salt and caraway seeds if desired until blended. Add eggs and mix well. Stir in bacon and reserved onions. Unroll crescent roll dough into an ungreased 9-in. square baking pan. Press seams together to seal; press dough 1 in. up the sides of pan. Pour onion mixture into crust. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
