Fill a large stockpot halfway with water; add vinegar, seafood seasoning, and olive oil. Bring liquid to a boil. Mix collard greens, jalapeno peppers, and garlic into boiling water; return to a boil. Cover stockpot, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until greens are very tender, 3 to 4 hours. Drain water from greens and mash garlic cloves; season with salt and pepper.
