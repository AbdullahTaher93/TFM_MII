Cut fillets into serving-size pieces; place in an 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle with parsley and pepper. In a skillet, saute onion and garlic in margarine until tender; sprinkle over fish. Combine juices and orange peel; drizzle over fish. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
