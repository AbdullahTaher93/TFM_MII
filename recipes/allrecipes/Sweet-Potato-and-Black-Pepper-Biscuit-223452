Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Whisk flour, baking powder, sugar, pepper, baking soda, and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Cut butter into the flour mixture with a pastry cutter or fork until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir sweet potatoes and cream into the flour mixture until the dough is soft. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface; knead the dough, turning over about 5 times. Roll to about 1/2-inch thick. Cut 2-inch circles out of dough and arrange on a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes.
