In a medium saucepan, bring the rice and water to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes. In a skillet over medium heat, cook and stir the ground beef until evenly browned. Drain, and set aside. Heat the olive oil in the skillet over medium heat. Stir in the red bell pepper, green bell pepper, parsley, garlic and ginger. Season with red pepper, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until tender. Return the beef to the skillet. Mix in the beef stock, soy sauce, chile paste, and Worcestershire sauce. Cook and stir until thickened and heated through. Serve over the cooked rice.
