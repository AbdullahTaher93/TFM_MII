Heat oil in a 3- to 4-quart pan over high heat. Add onion, carrots, parsnips, and turnip; cook, stirring often, until onion is tender to bite (about 3 minutes). Add 1/4 cup of the broth; reduce heat, cover, and simmer until carrots and parsnips are tender to bite (3 to 4 more minutes). Stir in cumin, cinnamon, ginger, saffron, beans, currants, and remaining 2 cups broth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Stir in couscous; then cover tightly, remove from heat, and let stand until all liquid has been absorbed (about 5 minutes). Fluff with a fork before serving.
