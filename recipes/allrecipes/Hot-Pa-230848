Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat; cook and stir cabbage and garlic basil spread until cabbage begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Add sauerkraut, sweet hot mustard, and pastrami; cook and stir until hot, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in 2 cups shredded Swiss cheese and cook until melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Spread each hoagie bun with 1 tablespoon spicy brown mustard. Top with 4 slices Swiss cheese and evenly distribute the pastrami mixture among the sandwiches. Sprinkle with diced onion and top with tomato wedges.
