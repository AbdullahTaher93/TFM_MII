Heat oven to 475 degrees F. Line 15x10-inch baking pan with sides with foil. Rinse salmon and pat dry with paper towels. Place skin side down in foil-lined pan. Stir remaining ingredients in small bowl. Spread evenly over top of salmon. Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Cut salmon in serving-size pieces and use spatula to lift from pan, leaving skin behind.
