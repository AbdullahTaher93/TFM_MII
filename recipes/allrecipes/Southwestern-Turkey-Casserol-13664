Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a mixing bowl, combine the chicken soup, mushroom soup, chile peppers and sour cream. Line the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking pan with corn tortillas. Follow with a layer of turkey. Pour soup mixture over turkey, sprinkle with 1/2 of the cheese. Repeat layers and top with cheddar cheese. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes or until cheese is browned and bubbly.
