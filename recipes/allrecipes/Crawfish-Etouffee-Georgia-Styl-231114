Melt butter in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion, celery root, and bell peppers; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in crawfish, garlic, and bay leaves. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 12 minutes. Whisk flour into chicken broth and water in a bowl until smooth; pour into crawfish mixture. Season with smoked salt and cayenne pepper. Bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to medium; cook and stir until mixture thickens, about 4 minutes. Stir in parsley and green onions; cook 2 minutes more.
