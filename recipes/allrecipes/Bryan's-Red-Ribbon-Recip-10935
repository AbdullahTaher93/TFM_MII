Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Cream together the shortening, egg and egg yolk. Mix in the sugars, flour, baking soda and salt. Add the rest of the ingredients and mix ingredients at high speed until well mixed, occasionally scraping the sides of the bowl. Drop with a tablespoon on greased cookie sheet 1 1/2 - 2 inches apart. Bake for 14 minutes or until lightly browned. Immediately remove from sheet and place on wire rack for cooling process. NOTE: Cookies are great when lightly browned but some enjoy dark. ENJOY!!!
