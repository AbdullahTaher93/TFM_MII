Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Place a large sheet of Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil on a clean surface. Place a similarly sized sheet of Reynolds(R) Parchment Paper on top of the foil. Center the butter on the parchment. Add potatoes and then corn. Gently place the shrimp on top of corn and drizzle with olive oil and garlic. Top with a squeeze of lemon juice and a good pinch of salt. Add the chorizo slices on top of the seasoned shrimp. Bring up sides of the parchment/foil. Double fold top and ends to seal packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside. Cook for 8-9 minutes. Remove packet from the oven, carefully cut open the top of the foil packet using a pair of scissors to let steam out. Set aside. Mix the corn, potatoes and chorizo together in the foil. Remove to a serving platter and add the shrimp. Top with cilantro. Drizzle over any cooking liquid left in the packet. Serve with a fresh cut lemon wedge.
