Mix barbecue sauce, dressing and mustard in glass baking dish or large resealable plastic bag until well blended. Remove 6 Tbsp. of the marinade for later use. Add chops to remaining 3 Tbsp. marinade in baking dish; refrigerate at least 10 min. or overnight to marinate. Cook chops in large skillet on medium heat 5 min.; turn chops over. Add reserved marinade and carrots; cover. Cook 7 to 10 min. or until sauce thickens and chops are cooked through, stirring occasionally. Serve with the hot cooked rice.
