In a 1- to 1 1/2-quart pan, combine tea, 1/2 the lemon slices, and ginger; bring to boiling. Cover and chill until cold, at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. Pour tea mixture through a fine strainer into a pitcher; discard used lemon slices and ginger. Add ginger ale to pitcher. Pour tea into tall, ice-filled glasses. Drop remaining lemon slices into tea, or use to garnish glasses.
