Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat eggs into a large bowl. Stir in cottage cheese, rolled oats, wheat germ, dry onion soup mix, and dried thyme. Form into 8 patties. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place patties in oil, and brown on both sides. Remove patties to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour condensed soup into a small bowl. Stir in 1/2 can of water (or milk) to dilute, then pour over patties. Bake in a preheated oven until the soup is bubbly, about 20 minutes.
