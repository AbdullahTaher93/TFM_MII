Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook sausage for 30 minutes. Cut into bite sized pieces, and set aside. In a Dutch oven, saute onion and mushrooms in olive oil until tender. Remove with slotted spoon, and set aside. Stir into Dutch oven: tomato paste, tomato juice, Italian tomatoes, and wine. Stir until smooth. Mix in oregano, basil, parsley, garlic, garlic salt, and sugar. Return sausage and onion and mushroom saute to sauce. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for at least 3 hours. Cover pot if sauce becomes too thick. Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain. Serve sauce over pasta.
