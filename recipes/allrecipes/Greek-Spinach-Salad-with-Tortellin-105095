In a small bowl, whisk oil, lemon juice, vinegar, oregano and salt; set aside. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook according to package directions; drain and transfer to a large salad bowl. Toss with dressing to coat and set aside to cool. When the pasta has cooled, add spinach, feta, red onion and tomatoes. Season with black pepper and toss lightly. Transfer equal portions of salad to 4 dinner plates. Arrange quartered hard-cooked eggs around each salad.
