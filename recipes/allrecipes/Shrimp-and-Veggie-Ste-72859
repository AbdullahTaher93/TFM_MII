In a large resealable plastic bag, toss the shrimp with the lime juice to coat. Set aside. Remove the seeds from 2 of the jalapeno peppers and 4 of the banana peppers. In a food processor, chop all the jalapeno peppers, all the banana peppers, onion, and okra. Spray a large, deep skillet with cooking spray. Place the pepper mixture in the skillet, and cook and stir 5 minutes over medium heat. Mix in the diced tomatoes and juice, tomato paste, and squash. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 10 minutes, until squash is tender. Season with thyme. Mix the shrimp into the skillet. Bring the mixture to a boil, and cook 5 minutes, until shrimp are opaque.
