Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain and rinse with cold water. Combine pasta and remaining salad ingredients, except Parmesan cheese, in a large serving bowl. Whisk together dressing ingredients in a small bowl. Pour over salad and mix well. Refrigerate at least 10 minutes for flavors to blend before serving. Serve with grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.
