Rinse pork tenderloin with cold water, pat dry, and place in a baking dish. Whisk chili powder, garlic powder, and paprika together in a bowl. Rub mixture all over pork tenderloin until completely covered. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil and refrigerate for 24 hours. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Brush a thin coat of sweet and sour sauce all over tenderloin and let rest for 10 minutes. Whisk honey and mustard together in a bowl. Brush a heavy coat of honey mustard onto the tenderloin. Pour water into the baking dish to reach a depth of 1/2-inch. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. Cook until pork is slightly pink in the center, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
