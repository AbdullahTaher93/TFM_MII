Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Remove turkey from brine and pat dry inside and out. Tie together celery, fresh sage, thyme sprigs, and bay leaf into a bundle and place inside body cavity along with ancho pepper and shallots. Mix ground cumin, pepper, dried thyme, dried sage, and salt with olive oil. Carefully loosen turkey's skin without tearing from the breast and legs, and massage oil and spice mixture all over and under the skin. Tie the end of the drumsticks together over the body opening and tuck the wingtips underneath. Place on roasting rack in large roasting pan and roast in oven for 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F and continue to roast for another 2 to 2 1/2 hours, basting every 30 minutes until an instant-read thermometer stuck into the thickest part of the thigh registers 170 degrees F. Remove from oven and let turkey rest on serving platter while you continue with making the gravy. Discard the contents of the turkey cavity except for the shallots. Pour off all the liquid and solids from the roasting pan into a saucepan to make gravy.
