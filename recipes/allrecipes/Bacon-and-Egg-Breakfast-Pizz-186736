Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Place pizza crust on baking sheet. Reserve sauce for another use. Whisk eggs together with milk in a medium bowl. Melt butter in medium nonstick skillet. Scramble eggs in skillet by stirring occasionally until large moist curds just form. Season with salt and pepper. Spread eggs over crust, leaving a 1-inch border. Sprinkle bacon over eggs and top with shredded cheese. Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until cheese is melted and crust is crisp.
