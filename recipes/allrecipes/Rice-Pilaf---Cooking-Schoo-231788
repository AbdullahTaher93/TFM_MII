Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and bell pepper in the hot oil until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add rice and cook until toasted, about 3 minutes. Pour chicken broth and salt into the rice mixture and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the broth is nearly all absorbed and the rice is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to sit, covered, until all the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork and fold almonds and parsley into the pilaf. Season with salt to taste.
