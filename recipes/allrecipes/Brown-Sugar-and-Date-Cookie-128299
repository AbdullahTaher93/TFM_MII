Preheat the oven to 375F (190C). Lightly coat several large baking sheets with nonstick spray. In a medium bowl, whisk the flours, cinnamon, allspice, baking powder, baking soda, ginger, and cloves. Stir in the dates. In a large bowl, whisk the brown sugar, egg white, honey, corn syrup, oil, milk, and vanilla until well blended. Stir in the dry ingredients just until evenly blended. Drop heaping teaspoonfuls of dough on the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches (5 cm) between cookies. Bake one sheet of cookies at a time in the center of the oven until the cookies are tinged with brown at the edges, 9 to 11 minutes. (The cookies will firm up as they cool.) Using a spatula, transfer the cookies to wire racks. Let completely cool.
