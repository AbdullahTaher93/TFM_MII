Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until done. Meanwhile, mix together tuna, olives, pine nuts, garlic, parsley, basil, and crumbled feta cheese. Drain pasta. If you are serving it cold, then rinse with cold water until chilled. In a large bowl, toss pasta with lemon juice and olive oil. Stir in tuna mixture. Serve hot, or chill for about 1 hour before serving.
