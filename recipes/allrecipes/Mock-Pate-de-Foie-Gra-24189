Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place pecans on a medium baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven 5 minutes, or until toasted. In a medium bowl, mix together cream cheese, braunschweiger liver sausage, onion, Worcestershire sauce and lemon juice. Form the mixture into a ball. Place toasted pecans in a pie pan. Place cream cheese mixture ball into the pie pan, and roll to coat with pecans. Cover with plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator until serving.
