Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Beat sugar, butter, and vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and fluffy. Add egg and beat well. Stir flour, pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice, and salt into creamed butter mixture until well mixed, kneading lightly. Cut dough into 1-inch squares and arrange on the baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until scones are risen, about 15 minutes.
