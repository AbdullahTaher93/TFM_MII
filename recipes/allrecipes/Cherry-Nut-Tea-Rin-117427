In bread machine pan, place the first eight ingredients in order suggested by manufacturer. Select dough setting (check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water or flour if needed). For filling, combine the sugars in a small bowl; cut in shortening until crumbly. Stir in the cherries, raisins and walnuts; set aside. When cycle is completed, turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 20-in. x 10-in. rectangle; sprinkle with filling to within 1 in. of edges. Roll up tightly jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; seal ends. Place in a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan; pinch ends together to form a heart. With scissors, cut from outside edge two-thirds of the way toward center of ring at 1-in. intervals. Separate strips slightly; twist to allow filling to show. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 40 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown, covering with foil to prevent overbrowning during the last 10 minutes. Remove to a wire rack to cool. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
