Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch square glass baking dish. In a medium bowl, combine 1/3 cup of the flour with 1/2 cup of the sugar and the cinnamon. Using your fingers, rub in the butter until the mixture is crumbly. In a small bowl, whisk the remaining 1 cup of flour with the baking powder and salt. In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer, beat the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar with the shortening. Beat in the egg. Beat in the flour mixture in 2 batches, alternating with the milk. Spread the batter in the prepared baking dish. Scatter the blueberries over the batter. Sprinkle with the cinnamon topping and bake for 40 minutes. Let cool slightly. Serve warm or at room temperature with whipped cream.
