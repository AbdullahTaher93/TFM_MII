Peel back the corn husk and remove the silk on all 4 ears of corn. Break off the corncob at the base, leaving the husk attached. With a sharp knife, slice the kernels off the cobs of 2 of the ears. Put aside the other 2 ears. Prepare a hot fire. Fold back a few of the leaves of each corn husk and place a catfish fillet in each. Top each fillet with one-quarter of the corn kernels, green onions, bell pepper, capers, and butter, and top with a sprig of thyme. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Tie the husk together with strips of the corn husk or kitchen twine. (This can be done earlier in the day and kept refrigerated until ready to grill.) When ready to grill, place the catfish fillets in corn husks on the grill directly over the fire and grill for 5 minutes. Then move to the indirect side of the grill and continue to cook for another 6 to 7 minutes with the grill lid closed. Serve the corn husk packets by folding back the top of the corn husk to display the fish inside.
