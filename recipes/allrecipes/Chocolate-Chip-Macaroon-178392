Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk together egg whites, SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend, almond extract and salt until frothy. Add coconut and mini chocolate chips, mixing until the chocolate chips are evenly distributed throughout the mixture. Scoop batter using a small ice cream scoop or tablespoon, placing batter 2 inches apart on the baking sheet. Bake 20 to 30 minutes or until golden brown. Rotate sheet half way through the baking process for more even browning. Transfer warm chocolate coquitos to a cooling rack and let sit until completely cooled. Store coquitos in an airtight container at room temperature for up to three days.
