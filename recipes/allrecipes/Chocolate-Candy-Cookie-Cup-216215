Heat oven to 375 degrees F. In large bowl, stir cookie mix, oil, water and egg until soft dough forms. Form dough into thirty-six 1-inch balls (about 2 teaspoons each); press into ungreased mini muffin cups. Cut each candy bar in half; press one piece of candy bar into center of dough in each cup. Bake 9 to 11 minutes or until edges are light golden brown. Cool completely in pan, about 30 minutes. Remove from pan to serving plate. Spoon frosting into pastry bag fitted with star tip. Pipe frosting on top of each cookie cup. Decorate with sprinkles.
