Coat a 2-quart square baking dish with cooking spray; set aside. In a large mixing bowl combine egg yolks, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed about 4 minutes or until thick and lemon colored; set aside. Thoroughly wash beaters. In a medium bowl beat egg whites on medium speed until soft peaks form (tips curl); gently fold into egg yolks. Fold in 1 tablespoon fresh basil. Spread egg mixture evenly in prepared dish. Bake, uncovered, in a 350 degrees F oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until a knife inserted near center comes out clean. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan heat olive oil. Add zucchini, onion, and garlic; cook and stir about 5 minutes or until tender. Stir in tomatoes and remaining 1 tablespoon basil; cook and stir until heated through. To serve, divide omelet evenly among serving plates. Top with tomato sauce. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
