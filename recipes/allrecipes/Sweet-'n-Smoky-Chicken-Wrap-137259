In small bowl, mix mayonnaise, cucumber, 1/2 teaspoon of the paprika, the pepper and 1 tablespoon of the honey; cover and refrigerate. Heat 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat; add oil and heat until hot. Add chicken; cook 5 to 8 minutes, stirring frequently, until no longer pink in center. Stir in salsa, 1 teaspoon of the paprika and remaining tablespoon honey. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer uncovered 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. For more paprika flavor, stir in up to 2 additional teaspoons paprika. Heat tortillas as directed on package. Spread about 1 tablespoon mayonnaise mixture on each warm tortilla. Top each with 1 lettuce leaf and scant 1/2 cup chicken mixture. Fold bottom of each tortilla up over chicken mixture; roll sides in toward center. If necessary, secure with toothpicks; remove toothpicks before eating.
