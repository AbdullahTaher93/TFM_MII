Heat the ghee in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the serrano, and continue to cook for another 3 minutes. Season with the cloves, garam masala, coriander, chile powder, turmeric, and cumin, cook for 2 to 3 more minutes to release the flavor. Stir in the beef and salt, cook for 3 minutes more. Add the tomatoes, coconut milk, and spinach. Bring to a simmer, then cover, and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Uncover, then stir in the lemon juice, and cook for 10 more minutes, stirring frequently, until the sauce has thickened.
