Stir broth and water together in a pot; bring to a boil. Stir frozen tortellini into broth mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until tortellini float to the top and the filling is hot, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir watercress and scallions into broth mixture and cook until watercress wilts, about 2 minutes. Add hot pepper sauce. Sprinkle with Romano cheese and black pepper to serve.
