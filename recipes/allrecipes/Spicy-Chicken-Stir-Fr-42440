In a bowl, stir 1 tablespoon oil, 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 1 teaspoon cornstarch until smooth. Add chicken; toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate 15 minutes. In a large skillet or wok, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken and pepper flakes; stir-fry for 5 minutes or until meat juices run clear. Remove and keep warm. Heat remaining oil; stir-fry broccoli, onion and garlic for 5-8 minutes or until tender. Combine broth, ginger and remaining soy sauce and cornstarch; stir until smooth. Add to the skillet; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Cook 2 minutes or until thickened. Add chicken and walnuts; heat through.
