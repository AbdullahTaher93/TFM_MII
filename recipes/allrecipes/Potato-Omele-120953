In a saucepan, saute potato, broccoli, onion, tomato and dill in 1 tablespoon butter until tender; keep warm. In a bowl, beat the eggs, water, salt and pepper. In a skillet, melt remaining butter; add egg mixture. As the eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. When eggs are completely set, remove skillet from the heat. Spoon vegetable mixture and cheese over half of the eggs; fold in half. Serve immediately.
