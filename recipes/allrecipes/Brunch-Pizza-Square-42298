In a skillet, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Unroll crescent dough into a lightly greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Press dough 1/2 in. up the sides; seal seams. Sprinkle with sausage. In a bowl, beat the eggs, milk and pepper; pour over sausage. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees for 15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted.
