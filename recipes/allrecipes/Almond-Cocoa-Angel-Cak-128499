Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). To make the cake: In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, salt, and 6 tablespoons of the sugar. In a large bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the egg whites until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and almond extract. Increase the mixer speed to high. Gradually add 1/2 cup sugar and beat until stiff, glossy peaks form and the sugar dissolves. Fold the flour mixture, one-third at a time, into the beaten whites. Place in an ungreased 9 inch x 5 inch (23 x 13-cm) loaf pan and bake for 25 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Turn upside down on a rack and cool for 30 minutes. To make the fruit sauce: In a small saucepan, whisk together the orange juice, cornstarch, and sugar. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Boil for 2 minutes, or until thickened. Remove from the heat and stir in the peaches and raspberries. Let cool. When the cake has cooled, using a knife, release the sides of the cake. Remove to a serving plate. Slice into 16 slices. To serve, place 2 slices of cake onto each of 8 dessert plates. Top the slices with the peach mixture.
