Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Fill each shell with 1/2 Tbsp pie filling and place in single layer on medium baking sheet. Bake 7 to 9 minutes until filling is warm and edges of shells are lightly browned. Remove from oven and transfer to large serving platter. Top each with 1/4 tsp syrup, then with a dollop of whipped topping if desired. Using a spoon, drizzle remaining syrup over platter from side to side to create a pattern. Serve immediately.
