Using a knife and starting at the very top of the first kiwi, slice off the top of the kiwi at a 45 degree angle. The sliced Kiwi will be the bird's body. Set aside. Cut the 2nd Kiwi fruit, lengthwise, revealing the white center core. Cut the core into a slim triangle shape for the beak. Using the tip of your knife, make a small divot in the face of the Kiwi you set aside and gently insert the 'beak.' Add two kiwi seeds for the eyes and an optional small green apple slice for the feet.
