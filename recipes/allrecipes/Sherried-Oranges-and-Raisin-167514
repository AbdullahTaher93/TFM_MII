Grate 1 teaspoon zest from one of the oranges and set aside. Remove the rind and white pith from the oranges with a sharp knife and discard. Working over a medium bowl, cut the orange segments from their surrounding membranes, letting them drop into the bowl. Squeeze any remaining juice from the membranes into the bowl. Holding back the orange segments with a spoon, drain the juice from the bowl into a small saucepan. Add the reserved orange zest, raisins and honey. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat. Cook until thickened and reduced, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in sherry. Let cool for 5 minutes. Divide the reserved orange sections among 4 dessert bowls and spoon the sherry-raisin sauce on top.
