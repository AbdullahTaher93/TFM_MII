Coat the ribs with the flour and seasonings as desired. Heat the oil in an 8-quart saucepot over medium-high heat. Add the ribs in 2 batches and cook until they're well browned on all sides. Remove the ribs with a slotted spoon and set them aside. Add the onions to the pot and cook for 5 minutes. Add the carrots, celery, garlic and rosemary. Cook for 3 minutes. Add the beef broth and wine. Return the beef to the pot. Heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until the meat is very tender. While the ribs are cooking, prepare the smashed vegetables: Place vegetable broth, squash, sweet potato, turnips, parsnips, onion and garlic in a 4-quart saucepot over high heat. Heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 20 minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Drain vegetables, reserving the liquid. Mash the vegetables with 1/2 to 1 cup reserved broth using a potato masher until the vegetables are desired consistency. Serve with the ribs.
