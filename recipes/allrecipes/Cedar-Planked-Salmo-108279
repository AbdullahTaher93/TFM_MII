Place cedar plank in a sink or a deep pan large enough to hold it lying flat. Add water to cover plank; if necessary, place another pan on top to keep plank submerged. Let plank soak at least 2 hours (to avoid scorching on grill). Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for indirect heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is balanced on the sides, not directly under the food). Rinse salmon and pat dry. Remove plank from water and pat dry. Place salmon skin side down on plank. With a knife, trim salmon to fit plank, if necessary. In a small bowl, whisk together lemon juice, oil, and minced chives. Spoon mixture evenly over salmon, then sprinkle with salt. Set plank on center of grill (not over direct heat). Cover charcoal grill and open vents; close lid on gas grill. Cook until salmon is opaque but still moist looking in center of thickest part (cut to test), 25 to 30 minutes. Serve salmon on plank or transfer to a clean platter (see notes); if desired, garnish with fresh whole chives. To serve, cut salmon into pieces and slide a spatula between meat and skin.
