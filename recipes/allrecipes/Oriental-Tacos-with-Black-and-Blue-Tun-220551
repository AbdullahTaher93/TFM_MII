Marinate tuna slices in soy sauce in a bowl, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove fish from soy sauce to a plate and season with black pepper; set aside. Whisk sour cream and wasabi paste together in a small bowl; cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Heat peanut oil in a heavy skillet over high heat. Sear tuna slices in hot oil until lightly browned, 15 to 20 seconds per side. Transfer rare tuna to a cutting board and cut into smaller pieces. Heat tortillas in a clean skillet over medium heat until warmed through, about 1 minute each. Serve tuna in warm tortillas topped with cabbage, green onion, and wasabi sour cream.
