Thoroughly rinse wild rice. In a saucepan bring to a boil wild rice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and water. Reduce heat and simmer 30 to 45 minutes or until tender. Melt butter, add onions and celery. Cover and cook gently for 5 minutes until vegetables are tender (avoid browning vegetables). Stir in 2 teaspoons salt, pepper, and flour. Remove from heat and add milk, stirring until flour is well blended. Return to low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until soup thickens. Add the cooked wild rice and simmer a few minutes to blend flavor. Serve hot, garnished with chopped chives.
