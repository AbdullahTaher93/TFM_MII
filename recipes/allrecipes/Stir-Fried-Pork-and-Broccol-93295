In a medium bowl, toss pork slices with sherry and 2 tablespoons of soy sauce until coated. Set aside. In a separate bowl, stir together the beef broth, sugar, remaining soy sauce, ginger and cornstarch. Place broccoli in a large skillet over high heat and pour in 1 cup of water. Cover and steam until tender but still crisp and bright green, about 4 minutes. Drain and transfer broccoli to a plate; set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in the same skillet over high heat until it begins to send up wisps of smoke. Add half of the pork slices; stir-fry until browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to the plate with the broccoli. Repeat the process with remaining pork and oil. Return the broccoli and pork to the skillet and add the garlic. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, until garlic is fragrant. Pour in the broth mixture and cook, stirring gently, for 1 minute or until thickened. Serve immediately.
