Heat the milk in a saucepan until small bubbles just begin to form; do not boil. Remove from heat. Place cocoa mix in a bowl and slowly add milk, stirring constantly. Do not whisk--that will cause bubbles to form. Add sugar, vanilla, and salt; stir until dissolved. Pour into ice pop molds and freeze until solid, 4 to 6 hours.
