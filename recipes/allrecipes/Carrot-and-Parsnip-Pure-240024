Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir carrots, parsnips, onion, water, chicken stock, and green onion with the butter; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, place a cover on the saucepan, and cook until the vegetables are very tender, about 30 minutes. Blend the vegetable mixture in the saucepan with an immersion blender; season with salt and pepper. Add more butter, to your taste.
