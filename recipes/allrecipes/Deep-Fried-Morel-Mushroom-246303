Place morels in a large bowl of warm salted water and leave to soak, about 30 minutes. Drain. Combine flour, cracker crumbs, paprika, black pepper, cayenne pepper, oregano, thyme, and cumin in a large resealable plastic bag to make breading mix. Whisk milk and egg together in a small bowl. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dip mushrooms, a few at a time, into milk mixture. Toss in breading mix until coated; shake off excess. Fry breaded morels in the hot oil, working in batches, until dark brown and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
