Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk the mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, garlic powder, cayenne, cilantro, sage, and black pepper together in a large bowl. Dip the pork chops into the sauce to coat thickly. Place chops in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake chops in the preheated oven until the juices run clear, about 50 minutes. Place a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pan fry the baked chops in the hot skillet, basting chops with sauce from the baking dish. Cook until glazed, about 3 minutes per side.
