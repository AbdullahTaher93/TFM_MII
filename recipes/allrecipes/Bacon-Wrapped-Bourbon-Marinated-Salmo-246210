Mix steak seasoning sauce, 6 tablespoons brown sugar, bourbon, and scallions together in a large bowl to make marinade. Toss salmon cubes in marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in the refrigerator, 4 to 6 hours. Wrap each salmon cube with bacon; use a toothpick to hold bacon in place. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar on top. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill bacon-wrapped salmon, turning frequently, until bacon begins to crisp, about 5 minutes.
