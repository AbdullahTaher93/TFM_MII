Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch loaf pan. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion, celery, and apple until the onion is translucent and the apple is softened, 5 to 8 minutes. Let the mixture cool. In a bowl, mix the cooked apple mixture with the bread crumbs, Romano cheese, eggs, milk, and poultry seasoning until well combined, and lightly stir in the ground turkey. Do not over mix or the meatloaf will be tough. Spoon the mixture into the prepared pan, and bake in the preheated oven until the loaf is cooked through to the center, about 45 minutes.
