On a work surface, butterfly the turkey breast by making a horizontal cut parallel with the work surface. Starting at one long side, cut through the middle of the breast almost, but not quite, through the other side. Open the two section like a book; lay flat. With a scaloppini pounder or heavy skillet, flatten it to 1-inch thickness. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Coat a 13 x 9-inch baking pan with oil. In a medium saute pan, cook the oil and garlic for 2 minutes over low heat, or until the garlic is fragrant. Add the spinach. Toss. Cover and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook for 2 minutes, or until wilted. Drain any liquid. Scatter the spinach over the turkey. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and cheese. Press lightly. Starting at one short end, roll into a cylinder. Tie with kitchen string at 3-inch intervals. Season all over with salt and coat well with oil. Place on a diagonal in the prepared pan. Roast, adding scant amounts of hot water if the pan juices start to brown too deeply, for about 1 hour, or until an instant-reading thermometer inserted into the center registers 165 degrees F. Remove to a cutting board. Allow to sit for at least 15 minutes, or until the internal temperature rises to 170 degrees F, before removing the string and slicing the turkey. Pour any pan juices into a microwaveable measuring cup. Skim off the fat. Pour 1/2 cup hot water into the baking pan, scraping to remove any browned particles. Add to the cup. Microwave for 1 minute to heat before drizzling over the turkey slices.
