Cook the beef, onion, garlic and Italian seasoning in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until the beef is well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat. Stir the picante sauce and cheese in the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted, stirring often. Stir in the pasta and cook until the mixture is hot and bubbling.
