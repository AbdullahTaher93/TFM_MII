In a large nonstick frying pan, heat the oil over moderately high heat. Season the turkey cutlets with 1/4 teaspoon each of the salt and pepper. Cook the cutlets until they are almost done, about 1 minute per side. Remove the cutlets from the pan, let cool, and then cut them into thin strips. Melt the butter in the same pan over moderate heat. Add the white part of the scallions, the mushrooms, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms let off their liquid and it evaporates, about 5 minutes. Add the brandy and cook until almost no liquid remains in the pan, about 2 minutes more. Add 1/2 cup of broth and simmer until almost completely evaporated, about 4 minutes. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the fettuccine until almost done, about 7 minutes. Drain the pasta and then add it to the mushrooms. Add the remaining 1/2 cup broth, the cream, the scallion tops, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the turkey strips. Simmer until the turkey is just done, about 1 minute longer. Top with the parsley.
