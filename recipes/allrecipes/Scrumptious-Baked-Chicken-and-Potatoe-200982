Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the chicken pieces in a large baking dish; pour the water into the bottom of the dish. Arrange the potatoes around and over the chicken pieces. Drizzle the olive oil over the mixture; season with the rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper. Bake the chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).
