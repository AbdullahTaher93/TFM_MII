In a large pot with boiling salted water cook pasta until al dente. Drain. Meanwhile, in a large pot cook ground beef with water over medium heat. Once beef has cooked, remove excess water with a spoon. Allow some liquid to remain to enhance flavor. Add tomato sauce, celery, green bell pepper, and soy sauce. Cook for 10 minutes. Add garlic, oregano, and basil to taste. Simmer for 10 to 20 minutes. Serve meat sauce over drained and cooked pasta.
