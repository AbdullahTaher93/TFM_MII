Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a 12-cup muffin pan with cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal, pastry flour, soy flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. In a small bowl, combine the egg, egg white, milk, oil, corn, and raisins. Add to the flour mixture and stir just until blended. Divide evenly among the prepared muffin cups. Bake for 18 minutes, or until the muffins are firm to the touch and lightly browned at the edges. Cool on a rack for 5 minutes. Remove to the rack to cool completely.
