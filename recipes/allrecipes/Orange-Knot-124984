In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add the next seven ingredients and 3 cups flour; beat until smooth. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down; roll into a 16-in. x 10-in. rectangle, about 1/2 in. thick. Cut into 10-in. x 3/4-in. strips; roll lightly and tie into a knot. Place on greased baking sheets; tuck the ends under. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire racks. Combine icing ingredients; drizzle over rolls.
