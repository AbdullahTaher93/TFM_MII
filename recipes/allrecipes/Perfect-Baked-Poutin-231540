Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine extra-virgin olive oil, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and parsley in a large zip lock bag; add cut red potatoes and shake until potatoes are covered. Line a cookie sheet with foil; lightly cover with oil. Arrange potatoes on cookie sheet. Bake potatoes, flipping every 20 minutes, until golden brown, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Transfer fries to a large bowl. Whisk brown gravy mix with chicken broth in a saucepan, place over medium heat, and bring to a boil, whisking often. Reduce heat to low; simmer for 1 minute, continuing to whisk. Let stand off the heat for 1 minute for gravy to thicken. Layer cheese curds over fries and top with prepared gravy.
