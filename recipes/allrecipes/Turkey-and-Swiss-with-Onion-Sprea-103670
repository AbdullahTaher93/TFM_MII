Heat a large griddle or skillet over low heat. In a medium bowl, stir together red onion, thyme, mayonnaise, coarse-grain mustard and spicy brown mustard in a medium bowl. Spread this mixture on one side of each slice of bread. Cover the spread with a slice of cheese, 2 slices of turkey and 2 slices of tomato. Top with remaining cheese, and then the 4 remaining bread slices, spread facing in. Spread butter over the top of each sandwich. Place, buttered side down, on the griddle or skillet; spread remaining butter over top bread slices. Increase heat to medium and cook until golden brown on each side, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Slice each sandwich in half and serve immediately.
