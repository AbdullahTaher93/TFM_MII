Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir baby spinach in hot oil until very tender, about 5 minutes. Season spinach evenly with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder, turning with tongs while sprinkling. Add tomatoes; cook and stir until tomatoes begin to soften, about 90 seconds. Sprinkle with feta cheese off heat and toss to serve.
