In a bowl, beat eggs and milk. Add the bread crumbs, ham and pork; mix well. Using about 3 tablespoons for each, shape mixture into logs. Place in a lightly greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, bring the brown sugar, vinegar, pineapple juice, mustard and cloves to a boil. Pour over logs. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 1-1/4 hours, basting occasionally with sauce. Uncover and bake 15 minutes longer. Discard cloves. Serve warm.
