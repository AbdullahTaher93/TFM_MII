Heat a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat. Stir the almonds and 3 tablespoons sugar together in the skillet; cook until the sugar has melted and coats the almonds; 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside. Whisk the vegetable oil, vinegar, hot sauce, 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Toss the spring mix, oranges, strawberries, celery, onion, and parsley together in a large mixing bowl; drizzle the vegetable oil mixture over the lettuce mixture and stir gently to coat. Sprinkle the toasted almonds over the salad to serve.
