Place 4 slices of 100% whole wheat bread on a baking sheet. Spread each slice with 1/2 tablespoon mustard. Place tomato slices on bread slices. Cut turkey bacon in half crosswise and arrange 2 pieces of bacon and sprinkle 2 tablespoons of cheese on top of each sandwich. Place pan under broiler unit in oven (4-inches away from the source of heat), and broil for 1 to 2 minutes, or until cheese is melted. Place 1/2 cup spinach leaves on top of each sandwich and cover with remaining slices of bread. Enjoy!
