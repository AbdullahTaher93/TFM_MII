Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Using an electric knife, slice bread into very thin (1/8-inch thick) slices. Place bread slices in a large mixing bowl. Combine remaining ingredients in a small bowl. Pour over bread slices; toss well to coat. Spread on lightly greased baking sheets. Bake 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until golden brown and crisp. Store in airtight container up to two weeks.
