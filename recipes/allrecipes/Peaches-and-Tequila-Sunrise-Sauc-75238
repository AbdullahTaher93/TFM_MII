In a medium bowl, stir together the peach preserves, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, orange juice, tequila, onion, garlic, salt and pepper. Use half of the mixture to marinate your meat. Pour the remainder into a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Boil for about 10 minutes, or until thickened. Use as a sauce for your cooked meat.
