Cook the sausage, onion and thyme in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until the sausage is browned, stirring frequently to break up the meat. Pour off any fat. Stir the soup, tomatoes and vegetables in the skillet. Heat to a boil. Remove the skillet from the heat. Add the stuffing and stir lightly to coat. Spoon into a 1 1/2-quart casserole. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 30 minutes or until it's hot and bubbling.
