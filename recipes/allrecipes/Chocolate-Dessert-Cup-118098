Cut out four 6-in. circles from waxed paper; place on a baking sheet. In a microwave, melt chocolate and shortening; stir until smooth. Pour 2 tablespoons melted chocolate into the center of each circle; spread chocolate to within 1 in. of edge. Refrigerate for 3-4 minutes or until chocolate does not spread when handled. Drape circles, waxed paper side down, over inverted 6-oz. custard cups or small bowls. Shape edges if desired. Chill for 10 minutes. Carefully peel waxed paper from chocolate cups.
