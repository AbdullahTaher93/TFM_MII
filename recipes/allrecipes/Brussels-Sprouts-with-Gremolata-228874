Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook Brussels sprouts in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain. Mix parsley, lemon zest, and garlic together in a small bowl. Drizzle butter over cooked Brussels sprouts; sprinkle with parsley mixture, salt, and black pepper.
