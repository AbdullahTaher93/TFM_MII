Check the trout fillets for bones by running your fingers over the flesh. (Tweezers are useful for removing any stray bones, if necessary.) Lay the fillets skin side down and season them. Pull the fronds off the dill sprigs and sprinkle them over the fish. Roll up the fillets from tail to head end, with the skin on the outside; set aside. Put the beans in a large, shallow pan - a skillet or saute pan with a lid is ideal, but a Dutch oven can also be used. Arrange the fish rolls, seams down, on top of the beans. Sprinkle the capers on top and pour in the wine and fish stock. Bring the liquid almost to a boil, then reduce the heat and cover the pan. Simmer until the fish and beans are just tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Stir the flour and pesto together to make a smooth paste. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the fish rolls and beans to warm plates. Bring the cooking liquid to a boil. Whisk in half the pesto-and-flour paste until thoroughly combined with the sauce, then whisk in the remaining paste. Continue boiling, still whisking, until the sauce is lightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning, if necessary. Spoon the sauce over the fish and beans. Garnish with sprigs of dill.
