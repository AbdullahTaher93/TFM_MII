Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir the sour cream, ricotta cheese, 3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, and herb and garlic soup mix together in a 1-quart casserole dish. Sprinkle 1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese over the top of the mixture. Bake in preheated oven until bubbly, about 30 minutes. Serve with the Italian bread.
