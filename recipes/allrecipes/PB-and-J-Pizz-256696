Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Separate and spread crescent roll dough on a clean work surface. Spread peanut butter and jelly onto each piece of dough. Fold dough around filling, sealing the edges together like a pizza pocket. Arrange pockets on the prepared baking sheet, at least 1/2 inch apart. Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
