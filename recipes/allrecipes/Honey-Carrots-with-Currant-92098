In a 4- to 5-quart pan, bring 1 1/4 cups water to boiling; add carrots, honey, and lemon juice. Stir often until carrots are barely tender to bite, about 3 minutes. Drain carrots, reserving liquid. Put carrots in a serving bowl; set aside. Return liquid to pan and boil over high heat, uncovered, until only about 1/4 cup liquid remains, 6 to 8 minutes. Add currants; stir until mixture begins to caramelize and currants puff, about 1 minute. Stir in chutney and orange juice, then pour sauce over carrots. Mix gently, then sprinkle with orange peel and serve. Add salt to taste.
