Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. If you are not all that partial to the taste of turnips you can peel them since that is where the flavors are concentrated. Cut off and discard the root and stem ends. Cut in half, then slice each half about 1/4 inch thick, forming half moon shapes. Mince the scallions. Measure out the cream and then add the mustard to the cream and stir in well. Add the salt and pepper to the cream. In a small casserole dish, make a layer with half the turnips. Cut pieces to help make them fit together like a jig-saw puzzle. Evenly sprinkle 1/2 of the herbs de Provence and 1/2 of the scallions over the turnips. Then sprinkle about 1/3 of the cheese. Make the next layer the same way. Then pour the cream mixture over the casserole and top with the remaining cheese and a light dusting of paprika. Cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees F for an hour.
