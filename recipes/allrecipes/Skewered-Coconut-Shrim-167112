Prepare sugarcane. If using canned sugar cane, drain and cut the cane lengthwise into 1/8th inch thick strips. If using fresh sugarcane, peel the cane, cut width-wise into 4-inch cylinders and slice lengthwise into 1/8th inch strips. You should have 8 skewers when completed. Set aside until ready to use. Mix the flour, salt and pepper together in a shallow pan. Set aside. Mix the eggs and LACTAID(R) Milk in a second shallow pan using a wire whisk until just blended. Stir together the coconut and breadcrumbs in a third shallow pan. Dredge shrimp in flour, then dip into the eggs, and finally coat with the coconut mixture. Skewer one shrimp onto each sugarcane strip (If using canned sugarcane you will have more strips than shrimp). Arrange the skewers on a parchment-lined baking sheet and set in the refrigerator until the coating is firm (30 to 60 minutes). Heat oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat (Check to see if the oil is hot enough by carefully placing the end of a sugarcane strip in the oil; if the oil gently bubbles around the edges of the strip it is ready). Lower 2 to 3 shrimp skewers at a time into the hot oil and fry until the shrimp are golden brown. Set on paper towels to drain and keep warm while frying the remaining skewers. To Serve: Arrange the skewers on a large platter and set the mustard on the side for dipping.
