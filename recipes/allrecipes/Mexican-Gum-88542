Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add macaroni, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain. While the macaroni is cooking, crumble the ground beef into a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, and cook and stir until browned. Drain off the grease. Reduce the heat to medium, and mix in the corn, tomatoes, cheese and cooked noodles. Cook, stirring gently, until bubbly.
