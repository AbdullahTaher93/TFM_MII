In a small mixing bowl, beat the milk, butter, flour and salt until blended. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Fill buttered popover pans or large custard cups three-fourths full. Bake at 450 degrees F for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F; bake 20 minutes longer or until very firm. Remove from the oven and prick each popover with a sharp knife to allow steam to escape. Serve immediately.
