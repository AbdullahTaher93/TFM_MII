In a 2 1/2- to 3-inch deep 12-inch frying pan or 5- to 6-quart pan, bring about 1 inch of water to a boil over high heat. Cut out and discard cabbage core. Carefully separate leaves from head, keeping them whole. Add cabbage to pan, cover, and cook until leaves are wilted, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain water from pan and fill with cold water. Drain again, and remove leaves from pan. Cut thickest parts of tough stems from the 8 largest leaves; set leaves aside. Finely chop stems and remaining leaves. In pan, mix chopped cabbage with sauerkraut and paprika; spread flat. In a bowl, mix ground turkey, onion, egg white, rice, parsley, bread crumbs, 3 tablespoons water, salt and pepper. Mound 1/8 of meat mixture at stem end of cupped side of each reserved cabbage leaf. Form meat into a horizontal log 2 1/2 to 3 inches long, fold leaf sides over meat, then roll from stem end to enclose. Set rolls, seams down, on sauerkraut mixture in pan. Mix tomato juice and broth. Pour over cabbage rolls. Cover pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until meat is no longer pink in center of thickest part (cut to test), 10 to 12 minutes. Spoon stuffed cabbage rolls and sauerkraut mixture into shallow, rimmed bowls and garnish with sour cream, if desired.
