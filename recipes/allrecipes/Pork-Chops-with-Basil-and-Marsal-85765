Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix the flour and garlic salt in a large resealable plastic bag. Place pork chops in the bag, and shake to coat. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat, and brown chops on both sides. Transfer to a baking dish, and sprinkle with basil. Cover pan with aluminum foil. Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove foil, pour in Marsala wine, and continue baking 15 minutes, basting occasionally with the wine. Skim off and discard any fat and season chops with salt and pepper to serve.
