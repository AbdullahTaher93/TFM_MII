Place bulgur in a large bowl, and pour the boiling water and olive oil over it. Stir, cover, and let stand for 15 to 20 minutes. When all of the water has been absorbed and the bulgur is tender, stir in the lemon juice, cucumber, green onions, parsley, and mint. Season with coriander, ginger, salt and pepper. Garnish with shrimp.
