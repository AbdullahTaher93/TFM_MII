Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Place roast in deep pan with enough water to cover; add tomatoes and garlic. Cover pan with aluminum foil or a lid. Roast beef, adding water regularly to keep meat covered, until the meat pulls apart easily with a pair of forks, about 5 hours. Remove roast to a cutting board and shred meat completely. Put shredded meat in a mixing bowl; add Italian-style dressing and green chiles and mix. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
