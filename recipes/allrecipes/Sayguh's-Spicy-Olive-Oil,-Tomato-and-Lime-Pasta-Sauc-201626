Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium-low heat for about 5 minutes. Add the grape tomatoes and chopped tomato to the hot oil. Squeeze the limes over the tomatoes and add the lime halves to the pan. Season with the chili flakes, pepper, and salt. Allow the mixture to simmer until it thickens, about 30 minutes.
