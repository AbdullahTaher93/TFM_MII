Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 2-quart casserole dish. Blend together the butternut squash, sweetened condensed milk, eggs, butter, vanilla, whipping cream, and sugar. Pour into prepared casserole dish. Prepare topping, if desired: combine brown sugar, flour, 1/3 cup butter, and chopped nuts. Mix together and sprinkle over squash. Bake in preheated oven until set and edges begin to bubble, 30 to 45 minutes.
