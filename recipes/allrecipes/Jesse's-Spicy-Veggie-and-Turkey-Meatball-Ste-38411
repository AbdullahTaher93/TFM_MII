Roll the ground turkey into small meatballs. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook meatballs 5 minutes, or until evenly browned. Drain, and set aside. Heat remaining oil in a large pot over medium heat, and cook the green bell peppers, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, and onions until tender. Stir in the sofrito and tomato sauce, and continue cooking until heated through. Mix in potatoes, carrots, and broccoli. Pour in the water and salsa, and bring to a boil. Place meatballs in the pot. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 30 minutes. Top with mozzarella cheese to serve.
