Heat a stockpot over medium heat; add ground beef. Stir in garlic paste, ginger paste, coriander, cumin, turmeric, garam masala, 1/2 teaspoon ground red chile, and salt to taste. Add water and dal; simmer until meat is fully cooked and all water has evaporated, 30 to 35 minutes. Blend beef and dal mixture together using an immersion blender in the stockpot. Add 1/2 cup cilantro; blend to combine. Roll spoonfuls of beef and dal mixture into into walnut-sized balls; shape into smooth flat patties. Whisk eggs, 1 tablespoon cilantro, 1/2 teaspoon ground red chile, and salt to taste together in a bowl. Place bread crumbs on a plate. Dip each patty into egg mixture, then roll in bread crumbs. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry patties in a single layer until golden brown and crisp, 2 to 4 minutes per side.
