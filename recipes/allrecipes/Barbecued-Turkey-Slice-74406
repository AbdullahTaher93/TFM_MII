In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the soda, soy sauce, oil, garlic powder and horseradish. Add turkey slices. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 6-8 hours or overnight. Drain and discard the marinade. Grill the turkey, uncovered, over medium heat for 4-5 minutes on each side or until the turkey juices run clear.
