In a saucepan, combine potatoes and milk. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. While potatoes are simmering, melt butter in a skillet over medium high heat. Saute onions until soft and translucent. When potatoes are soft, mix in sauteed onions and corned beef. Cook an additional 10 minutes, or until heated through. Season with salt and pepper.
