Mix Cheddar cheese, baking mix, ham, Parmesan cheese, 2/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon milk, parsley, and mustard together in a bowl; form into 36 balls. Arrange balls on a baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and put in freezer until firm, about 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Arrange ham balls on prepared baking sheet; bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted, 25 to 35 minutes.
