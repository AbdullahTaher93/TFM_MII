Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Mix in zucchini, mushrooms, onion, green pepper, and garlic, and saute until tender. Remove from heat and let cool slightly. In a large bowl, beat together the egg substitute and cream. Stir in cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, bread cubes, and the sauteed vegetables. Season with salt and pepper. Mix well, and pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until center is set. Serve hot or cold.
