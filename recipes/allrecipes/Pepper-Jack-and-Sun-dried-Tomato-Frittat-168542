Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Break eggs into large bowl and whisk until slightly foamy. Stir in the sun-dried tomato, salt, pepper, grated Pepper Jack and heavy cream and mix well. Pour the egg mixture into the well-greased muffin pans and bake for 30 minutes, or until tops are light golden brown and firm. If making one large frittata, bake for about 50 minutes, or until firm. Serve warm or at room temperature for brunch with waffles, for lunch or dinner with salad. Can be made a day in advance and reheated before serving.
