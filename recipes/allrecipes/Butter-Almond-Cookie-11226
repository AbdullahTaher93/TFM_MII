Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Cream the butter until light and fluffy. Add the well beaten egg, almonds, sugar, brandy, spices and flour. Mix until mixture is well combined. On a lightly floured surface roll the mixture to 1/4 inch thick and cut with round cookie cutters dipped in flour. Place cookies onto a parchment lined baking sheet. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 8 to 10 minutes until lightly browned.
