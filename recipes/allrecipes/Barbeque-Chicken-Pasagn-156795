Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken in the oil until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir the onion, green bell pepper, garlic, and barbecue sauce into the skillet. Cook and stir until vegetables are tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove phyllo dough from package and unfold onto a baking sheet. Cover with a damp kitchen towel to prevent the dough from drying out. Melt the butter in a small saucepan. Use a pastry brush to grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with the butter. Place 4 sheets of phyllo dough in bottom of the prepared pan; brush top of phyllo with butter. Spread a thin layer of chicken mixture on the top of the phyllo; sprinkle layer with cheese. Place 2 sheets of phyllo dough on top of the cheese; brush with butter. Continue layering chicken mixture, cheese, and buttered phyllo until chicken mixture is gone. Top final layer of chicken with cheese and 2 sheets of phyllo dough, brush top with butter, and sprinkle with remaining cheese and Italian seasoning. Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbly, about 30 to 35 minutes.
