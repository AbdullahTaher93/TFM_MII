Remove 24 rolls from package; thaw 30 minutes at room temperature. Spray a 12-cup Bundt pan with vegetable cooking spray. Sprinkle almonds in bottom of pan; set aside. Combine 1/3 cup SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend for Baking and cinnamon in a small bowl; set aside. Cut each roll into quarters; dip into butter and then into SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend for Baking mixture. Place in prepared pan. (At this point Monkey Bread may be covered and stored in the refrigerator 8 hours or overnight). Cover and let rise in a warm place, free from drafts, 50 minutes or until doubled in bulk. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F about 10 minutes prior to baking. Bake 30 minutes or until bread sounds hollow when tapped. Loosely cover with foil the last 10 minutes of baking time to prevent excessive browning. Remove from pan; cool on a wire rack. Drizzle warm glaze over warm bread. Serve warm. Sprinkle 1/3 cup SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend for Baking in a heavy saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend for Baking melts and turns light brown. Add whipping cream and continue stirring until blended (mixture will form a clump, don't panic). Continue to cook over medium heat until mixture boils; boil 1 minute.
