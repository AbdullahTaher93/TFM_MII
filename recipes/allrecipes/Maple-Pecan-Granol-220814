Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix oats, pecans, walnuts, flax seed, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Stir canola oil, maple syrup, maple flavoring, and salt together in a small bowl; pour over the oat mixture and stir to coat evenly. Spread the resulting mixture evenly onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 40 minutes. Set granola aside to cool completely before breaking into chunks. Store in an air-tight container.
