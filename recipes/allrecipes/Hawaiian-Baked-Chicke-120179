Arrange chicken in a shallow baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. In a small bowl, combine the pineapple, sherry or broth, mustard, honey and butter; mix well. Spoon over chicken; sprinkle with paprika. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 35-45 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees F.
