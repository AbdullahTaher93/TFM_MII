Saute onions in olive oil over medium heat until they become translucent. Add sliced chicken to the mixture and saute for few minutes. Deglaze with wine; reduce well. Add chicken stock and bring to a boil. Stir in spinach, tomatoes and pasta. Cook the pasta for half of the recommended cooking time. Season with pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt. Let rest for 20 minutes before serving. Serve drizzled with olive oil and shredded cheese on top.
