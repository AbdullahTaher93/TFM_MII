Combine the red wine and steak sauce in a large bowl. Stir in the orange slices, green onions, chile peppers, garlic, and ginger. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Place steak strips in a shallow dish and pour marinade over meat. Cover, and refrigerate 8 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Set grate 4 inches from heat. Soak wooden or bamboo skewers in water for 30 minutes to prevent them from burning. Remove steak from marinade, and discard; thread meat onto skewers. Arrange skewers on prepared grill, and cook until meat is no longer pink and juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes.
