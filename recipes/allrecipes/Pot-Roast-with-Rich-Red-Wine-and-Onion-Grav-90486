Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Set an empty soup kettle over medium heat. Pour oil into a large bowl; add roasts, and turn to coat. Generously sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper. Turn heat to medium-high. Place the first roast in the kettle, and cook until brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn, and cook until the other side is well brown, 4 to 5 minutes longer. Remove roast from pan to a baking sheet. Repeat with remaining roast. Add onions to kettle, and cook until soft and golden brown around the edges, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour in wine, and bring to a simmer. Remove from heat. Return pot roast to pan, and cover with a sheet of heavy-duty foil, pressing on foil so that it is concave and touches the roast. Using a potholder, seal completely around the edges. Place lid snugly on pan; return to a medium-high burner until pan juices start to bubble. Set pan in oven; cook until roasts are tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Carefully remove lid and foil, then remove roasts to a plate. Heat onions and pan drippings over medium-high heat. Mix flour with 1/2 cup of water, and add to drippings; simmer until thickened slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Slice roast, and serve immediately with gravy passed separately.
