Cook sausage in a Dutch oven over medium heat until browned, about 15 minutes. Stir in parsley and cook for about 2 minutes. Stir in white wine and cook until the wine has nearly evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in heavy cream, increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Stir in marinara sauce and water and return to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer sauce for 1 hour. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne, and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Combine pasta and sauce; remove from heat, cover and let sit for about 2 minutes. Serve pasta and sauce topped with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.
