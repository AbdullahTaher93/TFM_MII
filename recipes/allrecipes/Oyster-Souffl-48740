Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 1 quart casserole dish. Place a layer of crushed crackers in the bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Cover with a layer of oysters. Repeat layers ending with a layer of cracker crumbs on the top. Drizzle the half-and-half over all, and dot with pieces of butter. Sprinkle paprika over the top. Cover, and let stand for one hour to firm up. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until the top is golden, and the center is firm.
