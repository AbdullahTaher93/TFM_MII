Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Puree all gazpacho ingredients except yogurt in blender until smooth. Pour into bowl. Whisk in yogurt, cover, and place in freezer. Toss shrimp with Cajun spice, garlic, paprika, and salt and set aside. Heat olive oil in large nonstick saucepan on medium-high. Add onion and pepper and saute, shaking pan, until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons water and continue cooking for 3 to 4 minutes. Turn heat up to high, add shrimp, and saute until pink, about 3 minutes. Hollow out baguette pieces, leaving only crust. Place on baking sheet and toast in oven until crust is crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. To assemble, place 1/4 shrimp-onion mixture on each baguette bottom and cover with baguette top. Serve with ice-cold gazpacho on side.
