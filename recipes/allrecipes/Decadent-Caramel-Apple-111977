Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Insert wooden sticks into stem end of apples. Place caramels and milk in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring after 2 minutes, until caramels are smooth. Dip each apple into caramel, spooning mixture over apple until completely coated. Roll side and bottom of each apple in your favorite topping. Place on the baking sheet until set. Store loosely covered at room temperature or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
