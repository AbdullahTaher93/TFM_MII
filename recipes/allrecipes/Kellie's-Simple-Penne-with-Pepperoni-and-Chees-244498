Pour whole box of pasta into a large skillet (approximately 12 inches in diameter). Pour 1 1/2 cups of cold water and chicken broth into the pan, ensuring that the liquid covers the pasta. Add onion, turn the burner to high, then set your timer for 10 minutes (optional: add a bit of salt to taste). Cook on high, stirring occasionally, until almost all of the liquid has evaporated. When pasta is almost done, add pepperoni and garlic; gently cook through. Remove from heat and stir in cheese and basil. Serve immediately.
