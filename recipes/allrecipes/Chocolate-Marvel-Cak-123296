In a mixing bowl, combine coffee, milk, baby food, egg whites and vanilla; beat until well blended. Combine flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt; add to coffee mixture. Beat for 2 minutes or until well blended (batter will be thin). Pour into two 9-in. round cake pans that have been coated with nonstick cooking spray and lightly floured. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until cake pulls away from sides of pan. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pans to wire racks to cool completely. For frosting, in a mixing bowl, cream margarine, sugar and cocoa. Gradually add the milk, coffee and vanilla; beating well. Frost between layers and top and sides of cake.
