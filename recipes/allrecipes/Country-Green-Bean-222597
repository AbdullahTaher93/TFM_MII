Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Combine bacon, green beans, onion, butter, chicken broth, garlic, salt, and pepper in a saucepan. Cover and simmer on medium heat until beans are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
