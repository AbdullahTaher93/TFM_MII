In a food processor, blend cheese and butter. Add the eggs, garlic salt and onion salt; process for 1 minute or until creamy. Spread 1/2 cupful on each tortilla. Stack three tortillas, cheese side up for each sandwich; sprinkle with paprika. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or until golden and bubbly. If desired, add celery to resemble a pumpkin stem. Cut sandwiches into halves to serve.
