Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; chop. Pour celery soup and cheese soup into a slow cooker set to Low. Season with sea salt, pepper, oregano, garlic salt, garlic powder, and paprika. Stir in chicken broth, water, and butter. Place potatoes in a large microwave-safe bowl. Cook on high until slightly softened, 7 to 8 minutes. Stir potatoes into the slow cooker. Add bacon and frozen vegetables. Cook on Low, stirring every hour, until potatoes are soft, 4 to 5 hours.
