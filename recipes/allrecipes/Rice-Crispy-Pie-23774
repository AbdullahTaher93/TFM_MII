Chop chocolate and melt in the top of a double boiler, stirring occasionally, until chocolate is smooth. In a large bowl, combine rice cereal with melted chocolate, mixing quickly, until cereal is covered. Place equal amounts into individual paper liners in a muffin tin. Place in the refrigerator until the chocolate has hardened.
