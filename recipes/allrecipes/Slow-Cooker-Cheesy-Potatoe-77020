Grease your slow cooker with cooking spray or shortening. In a large bowl, stir together the hash browns, cheese soup, evaporated milk, and half of the French fried onions. Pour into the slow cooker. Cover, and cook on High for 4 hours, or Low for 8 hours. Top with remaining onions just before serving.
