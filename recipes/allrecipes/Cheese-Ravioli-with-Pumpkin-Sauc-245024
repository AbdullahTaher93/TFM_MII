Bring a pot of water to a boil. Combine chicken broth, pumpkin puree, milk, brown sugar, white sugar, butter, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg in saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until butter melts and sauce is heated through, about 10 minutes. Cook ravioli in the boiling water until they float to the top and the filling is hot, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain and transfer to a serving bowl. Top pasta with pumpkin sauce and Parmesan cheese.
