Place the asparagus in a steamer basket, and set over about 1 inch of boiling water. Cover, and steam for 5 to 8 minutes, or until tender and bright green. In a small saucepan, stir together the yogurt and lemon juice. Cook over medium heat until warmed. Place steamed asparagus onto serving plates, and spoon the sauce over, or serve sauce separately.
