Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the water. Melt 1 tablespoon in a large skillet over high heat. Saute shrimp in hot butter until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon to a bowl, retaining liquid in the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-high. Cook onion and garlic in the retained liquid in the skillet until the onions are translucent 5 to 7 minutes. Stir tomatoes into the onion mixture; cook and stir until the tomatoes soften, about 5 minutes. Stir asparagus into the tomato mixture and add the reserved water from cooking the pasta; bring liquid to a simmer and cook until the asparagus is tender, about 5 minutes. Add the shrimp and angel hair pasta; stir. Cook until the shrimp is completely opaque in the middle, 2 to 3 minutes more. Season with salt and garnish with Parmesan cheese and lemon wedges.
