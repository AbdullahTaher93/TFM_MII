Place flour in a very large mixing bowl. Add shortening and cut it into flour with a pastry blender until the crumbs are the size of peas. Dissolve salt in the water and add the water to the flour mixture a small amount at a time mixing it just until the water is absorbed and the dough holds together. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for four hours. Use 14 oz of dough for a two crust 9 inch pie or 11oz of dough for an 8inch pie.
