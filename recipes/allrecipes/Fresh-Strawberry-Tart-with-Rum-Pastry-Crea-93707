Coat a 12-inch round pizza pan with oil. Prepare the dough. Pat into the bottom and 1/2 inch up for a border around the edge of the pan. Prick all over with a fork. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake for about 30 minutes, pricking any big air bubbles with a fork, or until the entire surface is lightly browned. Remove to a rack. Store, covered with waxed paper, in a dry place for up to 24 hours. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, whisk the sugar and flour. In a measuring cup, beat the egg, egg yolks, and half-and-half or milk. Add to the pan; whisk until smooth. Cook, whisking constantly, over medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the mixture starts to bubble. Cook, whisking vigorously to prevent lumping, for 1 minute. Remove from the heat. Continue whisking until mixture cools slightly. Whisk in 1 tablespoon rum. Pour into a bowl. Set aside to cool slightly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or as long as 1 day. Place the preserves in a glass measuring cup. Cover and microwave on high for 60 to 70 seconds, or until bubbling. Press through a fine sieve. Discard the solids. Stir in 1 tablespoon rum. Up to 2 hours before serving, spread the pastry cream evenly over the crust. If using medium strawberries, cut them in half. Place the strawberry slices, slightly overlapping, or the whole berries stem side down, in rings on top of the pastry cream. Brush the top evenly with the apricot glaze. Refrigerate, uncovered, for up to 2 hours.
