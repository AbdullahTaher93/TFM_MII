In a small mixing bowl, beat butter and sugar for 2 minutes or until crumbly. Beat in flour and nuts. Coat a 9-in. fluted tart pan with removable bottom with nonstick cooking spray. Press crumb mixture onto the bottom and up the sides of pan. Bake at 425 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack. In a small saucepan, combine sugar and flour. Stir in milk until smooth. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until thickened and bubbly. Reduce heat; cook and stir 2 minutes longer. Remove from the heat. Stir a small amount of hot filling into egg yolk; return all to the pan, stirring constantly. Bring to a gentle boil; cook and stir 2 minutes longer. Remove from the heat; gently stir in extract. Pour over crust. Refrigerate until set. In a small bowl, whisk fruit spread until smooth; spread over filling. Garnish with raspberries.
