Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat together the sugar, flour, eggs, vanilla and milk and pour the mixture into a 9 inch pie pan. Place pie in a dish filled with hot water (water should reach halfway up the sides of the pie pan). Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Let cool and serve.
