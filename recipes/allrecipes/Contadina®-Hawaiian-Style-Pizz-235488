Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a large baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray. Press dough into a 15x10-inch rectangle, and decoratively pinch the edges, if desired. Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until edges begin to turn light golden brown. Meanwhile, cook bacon or deli ham until crisp in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat; crumble and set aside. Spread pizza sauce evenly over crust. Sprinkle with cheese and remaining toppings. Bake 10 to 15 minutes or until cheese is melted and crust is golden brown.
