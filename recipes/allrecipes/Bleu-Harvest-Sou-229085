Crumble bouillon cubes into water in a large pot; bring to a boil. Add squash to the boiling liquid; cook until squash is beginning to soften, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir carrots into the liquid; continue cooking until carrots are just tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook onion with rosemary in the hot oil until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir bacon into the onion; cook and stir until the bacon is crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Scoop bacon and onion mixture directly into the pot with the squash. Stir beans through the mixture. Garnish with blue cheese to serve.
