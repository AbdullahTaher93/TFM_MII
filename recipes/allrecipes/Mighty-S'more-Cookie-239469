Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat the first egg into the butter mixture completely before adding the second with the vanilla extract; continue beating until you get a smooth batter. Stir graham cracker crumbs and salt into the creamed batter. Dissolve baking soda in hot water in a small bowl; stir into the batter. Fold chocolate chips and marshmallows through the batter. Sprinkle flour into the batter while stirring until flour is completely incorporated and you get a cookie dough texture. Scoop small balls of the dough from the bowl and drop onto prepared baking sheets. Depress each dough ball slightly using the back of a spoon. Bake in preheated oven until the edges begin to brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before moving to cooling racks.
