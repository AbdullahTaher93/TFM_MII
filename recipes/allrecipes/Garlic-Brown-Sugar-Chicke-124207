Place chicken in a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. glass baking dish or large resealable plastic bag. Combine remaining ingredients; pour over chicken. Cover or close bag and refrigerate 2-4 hours. Transfer chicken and marinade to a large skillet; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover with lid ajar and simmer 45 minutes or until juices run clear.
