Whisk mayonnaise, sour cream, blue cheese, milk, honey mustard, vinegar, salt, garlic powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain and transfer to a bowl. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic and basil until fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour garlic mixture over penne. Mix cauliflower, tomatoes, red bell pepper, mozzarella cheese, green onion, and Parmesan cheese into penne mixture; toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate to blend flavors, about 1 hour.
