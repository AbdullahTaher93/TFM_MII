In a large bowl, combine the first six ingredients. In another bowl, beat the egg, milk and oil; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in pecans. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 375 degrees F for 18-22 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
