Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 muffin pans, or use paper liners. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Make a well in the center, and pour in eggs and oil. Mix well, then fold in strawberries and walnuts. Fill muffin cups 2/3 to 3/4 full. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
