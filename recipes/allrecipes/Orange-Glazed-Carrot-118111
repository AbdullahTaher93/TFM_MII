In a 1-1/2-qt. microwave-safe dish, combine carrots and 1/4 cup orange juice. Cover and microwave on high for 5-6 minutes or until carrots are crisp-tender. Combine the sugar, cornstarch, salt and remaining orange juice until smooth; stir into carrots. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 2-3 minutes or until sauce has come to a boil and is thickened, stirring twice. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
