Heat a large skillet over medium heat while preparing marinade and steak. Mix Worcestershire sauce, lime juice, soy sauce, and pressed garlic in a medium bowl; set aside. In a small bowl, mix together chili powder, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Rub steak with 1 tablespoon of oil, and sprinkle with chili powder mixture. A couple of minutes from sauteing, increase heat under skillet to medium-high. Add beef; saute, turning once until well browned and cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to bowl with marinade; toss to coat. Add remaining tablespoon of oil to the hot skillet, along with onions and red pepper; saute until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. When ready to serve, cut steak into bite-size strips. Fill warm tortillas with steak, some of the marinade, peppers and onions. Serve with lime wedges.
