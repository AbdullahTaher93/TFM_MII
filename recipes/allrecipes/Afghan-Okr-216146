Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in the onions, and cook until softened and dark brown, about 15 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste until no lumps remain. Add the okra, and sprinkle with turmeric, salt, and pepper. Pour in the water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the okra is very tender and the sauce has thickened slightly, 15 to 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper again before serving.
