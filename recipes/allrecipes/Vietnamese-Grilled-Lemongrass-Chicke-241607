Mix canola oil, lemongrass, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, and fish sauce together in a mixing bowl until the sugar is dissolved; add chicken and turn to coat in the marinade. Marinate chicken in the refrigerator for 20 minutes to 1 hour. Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken thighs from the marinade and shake to remove excess marinade. Discard the remaining marinade. Grill chicken until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
