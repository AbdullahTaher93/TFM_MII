In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the first six ingredients; add flank steak. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill. Drain and discard marinade. Grill steak, covered, over medium heat 6-8 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F). Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
