Layer the ginger evenly over the bottom of a steamer basket. Top with layers of the sugar snap peas, zucchini, carrot, bell pepper and mushrooms. Sprinkle with the lemon zest. Place the salt, sesame seeds, parsley and red pepper flakes in a resealable plastic bag and lightly smash the seasonings with the back of a knife until coarse; set aside. Fill the steamer base with about 2 inches of water and add the lemon juice. Bring the liquid to a simmer, place the steamer basket on top and cover. Steam the vegetables over medium heat until fork-tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer the steamed vegetables to a serving platter, sprinkle with some of the seasoned salt and drizzle with the olive oil.
