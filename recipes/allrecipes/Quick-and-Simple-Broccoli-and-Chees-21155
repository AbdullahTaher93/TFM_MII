Place broccoli in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water, and cover. Cook until tender but still firm, about 2 to 6 minutes. Drain and transfer to a microwave safe casserole dish. Pour melted butter over broccoli (use more or less, to taste) and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle cheese over the top and microwave, on high, for 1 minute, or until cheese is melted.
