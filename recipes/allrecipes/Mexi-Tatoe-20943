Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute tomatoes, onion, chile sauce, green onion, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Stir in potatoes and cook until heated through. Spoon potato mixture into a 2 quart casserole dish and sprinkle with cheese. Serve when the cheese has melted.
