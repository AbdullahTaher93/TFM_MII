Heat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat 12 muffin cups with nonstick spray. In a bowl, mix 1/4 cup (50 mL) of flour, 1/4 cup (50 mL) of brown sugar and cinnamon. Using a fork, stir in 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of oil. Mix until crumbly. In another bowl, whisk remaining 1 1/2 cups (375 mL) flour, remaining 1/2 cup (125 mL) brown sugar, wheat germ, baking powder and baking soda. In a medium bowl, whisk yogurt, bananas, remaining 3 tablespoons (45 mL) oil and egg. Add yogurt mixture to dry ingredients and stir just until moistened; divide batter among muffin cups. Sprinkle crumb mixture evenly over batter. Bake until a toothpick inserted into center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Remove muffins from pan and place on a wire rack to cool. Serve warm or cooled.
