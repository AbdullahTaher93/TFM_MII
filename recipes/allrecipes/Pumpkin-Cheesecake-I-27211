Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C.) In a large bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Blend in sour cream, vanilla and spice. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Blend in pumpkin puree until no streaks remain. Pour filling into 2 crusts. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until filling is set. Allow to cool, then refrigerate at least 4 hours before serving.
