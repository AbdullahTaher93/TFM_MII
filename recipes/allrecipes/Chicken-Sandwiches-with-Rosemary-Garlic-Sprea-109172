Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Coat chicken and onion with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, combine the garlic, mayonnaise, mustard and rosemary. Spread half the mixture on the insides of the sliced bread. Place chicken and onion slices on hot grill. Cook, turning once, until chicken is grill-marked and cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes; and onions are grill-marked and tender-crisp, about 12 minutes. Place bread on grill and cook, turning once, until grill-marked and warm on both sides, about 2 minutes. Slice chicken in half horizontally and place on bottom half of grilled bread. Spread chicken with remaining mayonnaise mixture, layer with basil and onions and top with remaining half of grilled bread. Slice into 4 equal portions and serve.
