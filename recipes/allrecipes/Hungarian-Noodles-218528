Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the noodles, and return to a boil. Cook the noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until they are cooked through, but still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a large casserole dish. Mix the noodles, cottage cheese, sour cream, onion, Worcestershire sauce, poppy seeds, and salt together in a large bowl. Spread mixture in the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese and paprika on top. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 30 minutes.
