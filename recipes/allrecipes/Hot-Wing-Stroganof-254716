Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add chicken breasts; cook until no longer pink, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Stir in mayonnaise, milk, hot pepper sauce, mustard, and ranch dressing mix. Bring to a simmer; cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir sour cream and Parmesan cheese into the saucepan; bring to a simmer. Stir in heavy cream until sauce thickens to the consistency of gravy. Remove from heat; let stand before serving, about 5 minutes.
