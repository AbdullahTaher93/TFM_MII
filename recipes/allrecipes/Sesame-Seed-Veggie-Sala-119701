Place beans in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5-7 minutes or until crisp-tender. Drain and rinse with cold water; pat dry. In a large bowl, combine the beans, peas, tomatoes and onion. In a small bowl, whisk the vinegar, oil, garlic, salt, red pepper flakes and mustard; pour over bean mixture. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Toss to coat. Let stand for 1 hour at room temperature before serving.
