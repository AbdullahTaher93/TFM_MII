Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large heavy skillet, over medium-high heat, melt half of the butter. Fry the pork chops on both sides until a nice golden color. Transfer the chops to a 2 quart casserole dish with a lid, and sprinkle with thyme. Melt the remaining butter in the pan, and fry the onion and garlic until tender. Transfer them to the casserole dish. Fry the apple rings in the pan for a few seconds on each side to give them color, then remove to the casserole dish. Sprinkle with sugar. Spoon any excess fat from the frying pan and pour in the apple cider. Stir to remove any flavorful bits from the bottom. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then pour over the pork chops and apples in the dish. Season with salt and pepper. Bake the casserole, covered for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the pork chops are cooked through. Remove the pork chops and apples to a serving platter and stir the cream into the juices. Serve sauce over pork chops.
