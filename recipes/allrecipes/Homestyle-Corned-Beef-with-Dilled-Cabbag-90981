Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place corned beef brisket and 2 cups water in Dutch oven and bring just to a simmer on the stovetop over medium-high heat; do not boil. Cover tightly and cook in oven 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours or until fork-tender. About 20 minutes before brisket is done, steam cabbage 15 to 20 minutes or until tender. Remove brisket from water; trim fat. Place on rack in broiler pan so surface of beef is 3 to 4 inches from heat. Combine honey and 1 tablespoon mustard. Brush top of brisket with 1/2 of glaze; broil 3 minutes. Brush with remaining glaze; broil 2 minutes or until glazed. Combine butter, 1 tablespoon mustard and dill; spread on hot cabbage. Carve brisket diagonally across the grain. Serve with cabbage.
