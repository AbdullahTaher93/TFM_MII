Mix 4 cups flour, 1 cup Parmesan, yeast and salt in large bowl. Add water and oil; stir until mixture forms soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface 5 minutes or until smooth and elastic, gradually adding remaining flour. Cut dough into 4 pieces. (Each piece is enough for a 12-inch pizza.) Spray 1 dough piece with cooking spray; cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let stand 15 minutes. See tip for how to store remaining dough for another use. TO MAKE ONE PIZZA: Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Roll 1 dough piece (after standing 15 minutes) into 12-inch round on lightly floured surface; place on pizza pan. Bake 6 minutes. Top with tomato sauce, drained tomatoes, mozzarella, pepperoni and 1 tablespoon Parmesan. Bake 15 minutes or until mozzarella is melted and edge of crust is golden brown. Cut pizza into 6 slices.
