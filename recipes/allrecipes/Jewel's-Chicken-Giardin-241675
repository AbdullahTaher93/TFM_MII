Combine chicken, 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/2 juiced lemon, chopped fresh rosemary, and garlic in a bowl; marinate chicken in refrigerator, at least 30 minutes. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir garlic pepper, thyme, and dried rosemary into melted butter and cook for 1 minute. Whisk chicken broth, water, wine, milk, and 4 teaspoons lemon juice together in a bowl. Add cornstarch and whisk until lumps have dissolved; pour into butter mixture. Whisk sauce and bring to a boil; season with salt and pepper and remove saucepan from heat. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; add 1/4 cup olive oil. Remove chicken from marinade, discarding the marinade. Cook and stir chicken in the hot olive oil until no longer pink in the center, about 8 minutes. Add asparagus, tomatoes, broccoli, spinach, zucchini, yellow squash, red bell pepper, peas, and carrots to chicken; cook and stir until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Mix pasta and sauce in with chicken and vegetables; stir until evenly combined.
