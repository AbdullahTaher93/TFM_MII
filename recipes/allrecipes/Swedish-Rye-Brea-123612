In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup water. Add sugar, molasses, shortening, salt and remaining water; stir well. Add rye flour; beat until smooth. Add enough all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours. Punch dough down. Shape into four round loaves. Place on greased baking sheets. Cover ad let rise until doubled, about 45-60 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Brush with butter.
