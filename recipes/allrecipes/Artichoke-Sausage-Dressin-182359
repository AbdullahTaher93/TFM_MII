Cut bread into 1-inch cubes and put in a large bowl (Tip A). Add chicken broth and mix to moisten bread; set aside. Add sausage to a 12-inch frying pan over high heat. Cook, breaking sausage into 1/2-inch lumps, until meat is lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add mushrooms, onions, and poultry seasoning; reduce heat to medium-high, cover pan, and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are juicy, 8 to 10 minutes. Uncover, turn heat back to high, and cook, stirring often, until juices have evaporated and vegetables begin to brown, about 5 minutes (Tip B). Remove pan from heat. Meanwhile, add parsley, artichoke hearts, and cheese to bread cubes in bowl. Add hot sausage and vegetables; mix well (Tip C). Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon dressing into a 9- by 13-in. casserole. Put dressing in oven and bake until top is browned and edges are crispy, 25 to 30 minutes. Cover with aluminum foil and set aside.
