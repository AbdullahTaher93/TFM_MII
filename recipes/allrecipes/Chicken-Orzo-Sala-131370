Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add orzo. Return to boil and cook until orzo is al dente, about 6 minutes. Drain orzo and rinse briefly under cool water. Immediately toss orzo with chicken, oil, vinegar, oregano, and salt and pepper. Stir in scallions and goat cheese. If you like, serve on a bed of spinach leaves.
