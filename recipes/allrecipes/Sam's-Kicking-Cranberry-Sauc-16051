In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the fresh whole cranberries, cranberry sauce, orange marmalade, onion, apple, green bell pepper, salt, jalapeno, lime juice and liqueur. Cook until cranberries crack open. Reduce heat and simmer until contents reduce by one third (approximately 3 hours). Remove from heat, cover and allow to cool overnight.
