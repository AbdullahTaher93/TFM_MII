Cook beef in 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until brown; drain. Stir in hot water, milk, uncooked Pasta and Sauce Mix. Heat to boiling, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat; cover and simmer 13 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until pasta is tender. Remove from heat and uncover (sauce will thicken as it stands). Arrange 1 cup tortilla chips on each of 5 serving plates. Spoon about 1 cup beef mixture over tortilla chips on each plate. Top each with 1/4 cup salsa and about 2 tablespoons sour cream. Sprinkle with olives and onions.
