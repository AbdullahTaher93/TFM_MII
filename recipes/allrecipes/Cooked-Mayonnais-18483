In small saucepan, stir together egg yolks, lemon juice, water, sugar, mustard, salt and pepper until thoroughly blended. Cook over very low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture begins to bubble around edges. Remove from heat and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Pour into blender container; cover and blend on high speed. While blending, very slowly add oil. Blend until thick and smooth. Occasionally, turn off blender and scrape down sides of container with rubber spatula, if necessary. Cover and refrigerate until chilled.
