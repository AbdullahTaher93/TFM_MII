Pour whole box of pasta into a large skillet (approximately 12 inches in diameter). Pour 2 cups of cold water and 1 cup milk into the pan ensuring that the water covers the pasta. Turn on the burner to high and set your timer to 10 minutes (optional: add about 1/2 teaspoon of salt to taste). Cook on high, stirring regularly, until most of the water and milk are absorbed, about 10 minutes but may vary by stove. After 7 minutes add beef; cook an additional 3 minutes. Remove skillet from the heat. Fold in cheese and giardiniera. Serve immediately.
