Preheat oven to 325 degrees F if using a silver 9-inch springform pan (or to 300 degrees F if using a dark nonstick 9-inch springform pan). Coarsely chop 2 of the grahams; set aside for later use. Finely crush remaining 8 grahams. Mix graham crumbs, 3 Tbsp. of the sugar and the butter; press firmly onto bottom of pan. Bake 10 min. Cool. Meanwhile, beat cream cheese, remaining 3/4 cup sugar and the vanilla in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Add eggs, 1 at a time, mixing on low speed after each addition just until blended. Stir in 1 cup each of the marshmallows and chocolate chunks. Pour over crust. Sprinkle with reserved chopped grahams, remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chunks and remaining 1 cup marshmallows. Bake 50 to 55 min. or until center is almost set. Run knife or metal spatula around rim of pan to loosen cake; cool before removing rim of pan. Refrigerate 4 hours or overnight. Store leftover cheesecake in refrigerator.
