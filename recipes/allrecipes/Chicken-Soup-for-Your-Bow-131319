In a saucepan, heat broth to medium. Microwave the dinner according to package instructions, then stir it into the broth. Add soy sauce (for some reason, it helps balance the taste of the chicken broth - trust us). Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add cilantro just before serving.
