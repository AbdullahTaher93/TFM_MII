Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray the bottom of a Dutch oven or covered casserole dish with cooking spray. Combine lime juice, brown sugar, vinegar, and soy sauce in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes. Place cod in the prepared Dutch oven. Pour sauce over fish and arrange tomatoes around fish. Cover dish with an oven-safe lid. Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes.
