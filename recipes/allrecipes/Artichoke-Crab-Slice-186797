Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Brush baguette slices with olive oil, using an additional 1 tablespoon if needed. Place bread slices on a baking sheet; bake for 6 to 8 minutes or until lightly toasted. Meanwhile, stir together remaining ingredients except cheese. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the spinach crab mixture onto each bread slice. Top with cheese; bake an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until the cheese is melted. Serve warm.
