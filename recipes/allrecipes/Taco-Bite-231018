Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray mini muffin cups with cooking spray. Mix cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, salsa, green onion, garlic powder, and sugar together in a bowl. Add eggs and mix well; spoon into the prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until each taco bite is set in the middle, about 15 minutes.
