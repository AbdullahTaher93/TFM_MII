In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites and salt until soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar, beating until stiff peaks form, about 5-8 minutes. Fold in vanilla and pecans. Drop by well-rounded teaspoonfuls onto greased baking sheets. Bake at 200 degrees F for 50-55 minutes or until firm to the touch. Store in airtight container.
