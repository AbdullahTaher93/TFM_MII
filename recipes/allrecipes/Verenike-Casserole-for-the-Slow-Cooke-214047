Mix together the cottage cheese, eggs, sour cream, evaporated milk, ham, salt, and pepper in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Pour about half of the mixture into the bottom of a slow cooker. Layer the noodles over the cottage cheese mixture, breaking as needed to fit; top with the remaining cottage cheese mixture. Cook on Low until the noodles are cooked through, 5 to 6 hours.
