Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Cut each apricot into four strips. Cut each slice of prosciutto into four short strips. Make a slice in each smoked sausage and stuff with an apricot piece. Wrap a piece of prosciutto around the smoked sausage and place on the baking sheet. Bake for 15 to 18 min until prosciutto is just crisping. Stir together vinegar and honey and drizzle on smoked sausages just before serving with party picks.
