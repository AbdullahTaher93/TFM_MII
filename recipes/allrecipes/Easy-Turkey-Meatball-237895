Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray. Place bread pieces in a bowl. Pour milk over bread; allow bread to soak for 1 minute. Squeeze excess moisture from the bread and place bread in a bowl; discard milk. Mix ground turkey, turkey Italian sausage, Parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Add soaked bread to turkey mixture and gently mix. Form turkey mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls; place on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
