Pour about 1/2-inch depth of oil in a large saucepan or electric skillet and heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix carrots, green onion, flour, and baking powder together in a bowl until carrots are evenly coated. Beat eggs, salt, and pepper together in a separate bowl; pour over carrot mixture. Stir mixture until combined and moistened. Spoon small mounds of carrot mixture, working in batches, into the hot oil; cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer latkes using a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate.
