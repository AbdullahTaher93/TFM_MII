Combine the milk and the cornstarch in the top of a double boiler and stir until the cornstarch is completely dissolved. Add the brown sugar, egg whites, and oil; whisk to mix well. Place the top of the double boiler over simmering water and cook, stirring constantly, for about 4 minutes, or until the mixture comes to a simmer and thickens. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Add the cream cheese and continue stirring until the cheese melts and the mixture is smooth. Fold in the raspberries and spoon into 8 ramekins or custard cups. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. To serve, sprinkle 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of sugar evenly over the top of each brulee. Arrange on a baking sheet and broil until the sugar melts, bubbles, and starts to brown. Serve immediately.
