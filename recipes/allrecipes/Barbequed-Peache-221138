Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Slice flesh-side of peach halves diagonally about 1/4-inch deep, twice in each direction. Drizzle flesh-side of each peach half with barbeque sauce; brush sauce for an even coat. Place peaches, flesh-side up, on the grill. Cook until barbeque sauce bubbles slightly and peaches are a little softer than when you put them on the grill, 7 to 10 minutes.
