Mix shredded turkey, pepper Jack cheese, green onions, salt and pepper together in a bowl. Wrap stack of tortillas in a paper towel and place in a sealable plastic bag. Seal the bag only halfway. Microwave on high until tortillas are hot and flexible, about 45 seconds. Keep tortillas warm in the bag as you fill the others. Place 2 tortillas on a work surface, one about 2 inches off center of the first creating a longer partially double tortilla. Spoon about 1/4 to 1/3 cup turkey mixture in a row just below the center of the long side of the tortilla. Paint a bit of egg white along the top edge of the tortillas. Bring bottom edge of the tortilla up and over the filling and roll rather tightly toward the top edge over the egg white. Set aside with the fold on the bottom while you fill the remaining tortillas. Place 1/4 inch vegetable oil in a saute pan over medium heat. When oil is hot, place flautas in oil, seam side down. Press down gently with a spatula a couple of seconds to flatten bottoms. Fry in batches until flautas are crispy, golden, and heated through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Drain about a minute on paper towels. Serve topped with shredded cabbage, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, and chopped cilantro.
