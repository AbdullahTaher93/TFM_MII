Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the pork chops into a buttered 9x13 inch baking dish. Add the apple and raisins. Pour the soup and water into a small bowl, and mix together. Pour the soup over the pork chops. Bake, covered, in the preheated oven until the pork chops are fully cooked, about 1 hour.
