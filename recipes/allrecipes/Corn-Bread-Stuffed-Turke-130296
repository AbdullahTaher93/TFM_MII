Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Clean out the fresh or thawed Turkey from any settled blood, and extra organs. Using a cold stuffing, stuff the turkey and place into a baking dish. Pour one cup of chicken stock with 4 tablespoons of butter over the turkey and season with Salt and Pepper. Cover well, if using aluminum foil make sure there is extra foil so that it does not touch the turkey. Bake the turkey covered for 3 1/2 to 4 hours, or until temperature registers 170 degrees F when checked by a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the meat (in between bone joints), and in the center of all dark meat.
