Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease two 8-inch round cake pans. Dust with flour; tap out excess. In a bowl, beat together the yogurt, milk, and lemon juice. In another bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cocoa. In a large bowl, beat together the butter and brown sugar until pale and fluffy. Gradually beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Alternately fold in the flour and yogurt mixtures. Divide the batter evenly between the pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean, 30 minutes. Cool completely in the pans. To prepare filling, heat the apricots and orange juice in a saucepan until the apricots swell. Cool completely, then drain. Whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Slice each cake in half horizontally to make 4 layers. Spread the whipped cream over 2 cake layers. Sprinkle with the apricots and maple syrup. Spread the apricot jelly over the remaining 2 cakes. Put one cream-topped cake on a serving plate. Top with a jelly layer, then another cream layer and finally, the remaining jelly layer. To prepare the frosting, melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Fold in the sour cream. Spread over the top and sides of the cake. Garnish with the chocolate curls (see below) and dust with confectioners' sugar.
