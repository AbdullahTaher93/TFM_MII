In a microwave-safe dish, combine the first six ingredients. Microwave, uncovered, until the preserves are melted, about 1-2 minutes on high. Stir to blend. Set aside half to serve with turkey. Grill turkey, covered, over indirect medium heat for 3 minutes on each side. Brush with remaining apricot sauce. Grill 7-10 minutes longer or until juices run clear and a meat thermometer reads 170 degrees F. Slice; serve with the reserved apricot sauce.
