Preheat the oven to 200C/400F. Place the chicken in a roasting tin, drizzle over 4 tbsp of the olive oil. Season well. Roast for 25 mins. Add the white wine to the chicken, then roast for a further 5 mins until golden and tender. Thinly slice the chicken and leave to cool in the pan juices. Place the peppers in the oven to roast for 20 mins. Remove from oven, place in a plastic bag and leave to cool. Skin, deseed then finely slice the flesh. In a large bowl, mix 4 tbsp of the olive oil with the remaining ingredients. Add the chicken and pan juices, strips of pepper and toss well. Adjust the seasoning to taste. Divide the salad between six serving plates. Dress each plate with a little diced tomato and snipped fresh chives if liked. Drizzle a little of the remaining oil around each salad and serve immediately with crusty bread to mop up the juices.
