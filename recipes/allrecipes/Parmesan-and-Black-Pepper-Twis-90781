Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. On a lightly floured board, carefully unfold 1 sheet of puff pastry and lay it flat. Cutting parallel to fold lines and using a ruler as a guide, cut pastry sheet into 18 strips, each about 1/2 inch wide. Repeat to unfold and cut other sheet of puff pastry. If you have two ovens and four baking sheets, you will be able to bake all the twists at one time. If you have only one oven, keep the pastry strips you aren't currently working with covered lightly with plastic wrap. Pick up one strip of pastry by the ends. Very gently twist strip, turning the ends in opposite directions. Gently pull twisted strip to lengthen to about 12 inches long. Place twist on an ungreased 10- by 12-inch baking sheet and press ends down onto sheet with fingers. Repeat with remaining strips, placing 9 or 10 twists per baking sheet. With a pastry brush, gently brush butter equally over twists. Using your fingers, sprinkle twists equally with parmesan and pepper to taste. Carefully brush off any excess cheese on baking sheet before baking. Bake twists until golden brown and crisp, 10 to 13 minutes. If necessary, rotate baking sheets halfway through baking to ensure even browning. With a spatula, carefully transfer twists to a wire rack to cool slightly. Serve warm or at room temperature. If making ahead, cool completely, package airtight, and store at room temperature up to 1 day. Reheat before serving by warming on baking sheets in a 350 degrees F oven for 5 minutes.
