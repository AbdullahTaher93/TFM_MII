Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Combine flour, sugars, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger in large bowl. Using electric mixer, add butter, egg and vanilla. Beat at low speed until dough holds together. Press into a well greased 15x10 jelly roll pan. Bake for 25 minutes, or until lightly browned. Immediately sprinkle with chocolate chips; let stand 5 minutes. Spread chocolate evenly over top; sprinkle with pecans. Cut into bars while still warm.
