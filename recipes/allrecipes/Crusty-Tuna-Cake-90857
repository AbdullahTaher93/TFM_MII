In a large bowl, beat egg with a fork to blend white and yolk; mix in bread crumbs to moisten evenly. Add tuna, bell pepper, mayonnaise, capers, and tarragon. Mix lightly until well combined. In a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan, heat oil over medium heat. Spoon tuna mixture in 8 equal mounds into hot oil; flatten to make 3/4-inch-thick cakes. Cook, turning once with a wide spatula, until cakes are crusty and golden brown (about 10 minutes total). Serve hot with malt vinegar to add to taste.
