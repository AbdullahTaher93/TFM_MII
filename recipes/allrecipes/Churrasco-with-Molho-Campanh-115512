Preheat grill to high (see broiling variation note). To prepare churrasco: Combine garlic, hot pepper, oil and salt in a small bowl. Rub the mixture on both sides of steak. To prepare molho campanha: Combine hearts of palm, tomatoes, onion, hot pepper, cilantro, vinegar and salt in a medium bowl. Reduce grill heat to medium and grill the steak 4 to 6 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board, tent with foil and let rest for 5 minutes. Cut the steak across the grain into thin pieces. Serve with the molho campanha.
