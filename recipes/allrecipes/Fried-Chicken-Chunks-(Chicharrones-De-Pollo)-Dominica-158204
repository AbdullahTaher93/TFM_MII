Combine the chicken, rum, lemon juice, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, adobo seasoning, onion powder, pepper, coriander, and sazon seasoning in a bowl; stir. Cover and allow to marinate in refrigerator 4 hours. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat to about 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Spread the flour into the bottom of a shallow dish. Coat each piece of marinated chicken with flour. Fry the coated chicken pieces in the hot oil in small batches until no longer pink in the center and golden brown on the outside, 5 to 10 minutes.
