In a Dutch oven, saute carrots, celery and onion in butter for 10 minutes. Add consomme, 4 cups water, salt and pepper. Cover and cook over low heat for 15 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Add turkey and beans; cook for 5 minutes. Combine flour, Worcestershire sauce and remaining water until smooth; stir into turkey mixture. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5 minutes. For dumplings, combine flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Stir in parsley and poultry seasoning. Combine milk and egg; stir into flour mixture just until moistened. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto simmering stew. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes; uncover and simmer 10 minutes longer.
