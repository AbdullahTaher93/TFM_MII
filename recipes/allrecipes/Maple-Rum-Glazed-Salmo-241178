Whisk rum, maple syrup, and mustard together in a large glass or ceramic dish until marinade is well-combined. Place fillets in marinade and turn to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Remove salmon from marinade, and shake off excess. Place fillets in a glass baking dish. Pour marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until glaze is reduced, about 10 minutes; set aside. Bake fillets in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 20 to 30 minutes. Top fillets with glaze.
