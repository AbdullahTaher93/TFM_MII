Pull off and discard any bruised cabbage leaves. Rinse cabbage, halve, core, and thinly slice. In a large bowl, mix 6 tablespoons rice vinegar, sugar, horseradish, red onion, and ginger. Add cabbage and then salt to taste; mix well. For more mellow flavor, let salad stand at least 10 minutes, then mix again. Arrange salad on serving platter or individual plates. Rinse and core pears. Coarsely chop 1 pear and mix with salad. Slice remaining pear, moisten with a little rice vinegar, and arrange on salad. Sprinkle with chives.
