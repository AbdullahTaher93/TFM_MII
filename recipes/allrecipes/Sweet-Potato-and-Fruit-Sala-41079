Scrub sweet potatoes thoroughly with a brush. In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, cook potatoes in boiling water for 15 to 20 minutes or just until tender; cool. Peel and cut potatoes into 3/4-inch cubes. Finely shred enough orange peel to make 2 teaspoons; set aside. Peel and section the oranges over a small bowl, reserving juices. Stir together potato cubes, orange sections, grapes, raisins, and celery in a large mixing bowl. For dressing, stir together the orange peel, cream cheese, and honey in a small bowl. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the reserved orange juice. Pour over potato mixture, gently toss. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 4 to 24 hours. Cover and chill remaining orange juice. Before serving, stir in 2 tablespoons more of the reserved orange juice, if necessary, to make salad of desired consistency. Stir in pecans.
