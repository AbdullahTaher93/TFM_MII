Combine dry gelatin mix, soft drink mix and sugar in medium bowl. Add boiling water; stir at least 2 min. until gelatin is completely dissolved. Stir in cold water. Pour evenly into 12 (5-oz.) paper or plastic cups. Freeze 2 hours until almost firm. Insert wooden pop stick or plastic spoon into center of each cup for handle. Freeze an additional 3 hours or overnight. To remove pops from cups, place bottoms of cups under warm running water for 15 sec. Press firmly on bottoms of cups to release pops. (Do not twist or pull pop sticks.) Store leftover pops in freezer.
