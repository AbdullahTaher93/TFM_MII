Heat oil in large saute pan on medium-high heat. Add steaks; cook 3 to 4 minutes on each side or until seared on both sides. Add garlic, shallots, brandy and pepper; stir. Simmer 1 minutes. Add steak sauce and butter; stir until butter is melted. Cook until steak is cooked through (160 degrees F) and sauce just starts to boil. Serve steaks topped with the sauce. Garnish with arugula.
