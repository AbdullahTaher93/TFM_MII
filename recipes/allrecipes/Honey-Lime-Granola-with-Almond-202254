Preheat an oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Lightly grease a foiled-lined baking sheet. Mix oats, almonds, wheat germ, coconut, oat bran, and flax seeds together in a large bowl. Whisk together honey, vegetable oil, limeade concentrate, salt, vanilla, lime zest, and lime juice in a separate bowl. Pour lime mixture into the oat mixture and stir well. Spread oats on to the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and lightly crispy, about 1 hour and 30 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.
