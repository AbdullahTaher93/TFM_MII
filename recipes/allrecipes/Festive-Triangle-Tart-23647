Combine flour, sugar and salt in large bowl; add butter and cream cheese. Beat at low speed, scraping bowl often, until mixture resembles coarse crumbs (2 to 3 minutes). Add water; continue beating just until dough forms (20 to 30 seconds). Shape dough into a ball; divide in half. Flatten each half; wrap in plastic food wrap. Refrigerate until firm (at least 3 hours or up to 3 days). Stir all filling ingredients together in small bowl. Set aside. Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface, one-half at a time (keeping remaining dough refrigerated), to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut dough with floured 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter. Place cookies 1 inch apart onto ungreased cookie sheets. Spoon 1/2 teaspoonful filling in center of each round. Lift up edges of each circle at 3 points; pinch points together very firmly, forming a triangle, and leaving center open. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. (Tarts will open slightly as they bake.) Remove from cookie sheets. Cool completely. Combine powdered sugar, 1/4 teaspoon lemon extract and enough water for desired glazing consistency in small bowl. Drizzle on cooled tarts.
