Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange layers of onions, potato chips and shredded cheese in the prepared baking dish. Mix together the cream of mushroom soup and milk; pour over the casserole. Sprinkle cayenne pepper over the top. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until browned and bubbly.
