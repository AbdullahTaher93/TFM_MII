Place the salmon and thousand island dressing in a bowl, and mash with a fork to combine. Stir in the green onion, cover, and refrigerate about 15 minutes. To make the sandwiches, place 5 whole spinach leaves on two toasted slices of bread, covering as much of the slice as possible. Spread half of the salmon mixture on top of each sandwich, and top with 5 more leaves of spinach. Place the remaining slices of toasted bread on top.
