In a saucepan over low heat, melt chocolate and butter. Remove from the heat; cool slightly. Stir in the sugar, flour, salt, vanilla and eggs; mix well. Spread half of the batter into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. In a bowl, combine the filling ingredients. Spoon over chocolate layer. Carefully spread remaining chocolate mixture over filling. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until the sides pull away from the pan. Immediately sprinkle with chocolate chips. Allow chips to soften for a few minutes, then spread over bars. Sprinkle with walnuts. Cool completely before cutting.
