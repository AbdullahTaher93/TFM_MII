Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a 2-quart casserole dish, stir together the sliced hot dogs, green beans and their liquid, and stewed tomatoes with their juice. Bake in the preheated oven until the juice is thickened, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven, stir again, and sprinkle the casserole with mozzarella cheese. Heat the broiler of the oven, and place the casserole under the broiler until the cheese is melted, bubbling, and starting to brown, about 5 minutes.
