Season steak with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat; cook steak** in it about 3-4 minutes or until browned and no longer pink, stirring frequently. Remove from pan; keep warm. Add remaining oil, broken pasta and garlic to pan. Carefully toss pasta in oil to coat; cook until pasta is golden brown, stirring constantly. Stir in tomato sauce until pasta is well coated. Cover; reduce heat to low. Cook about 10 minutes or until pasta is tender. Combine steak and broccoli with pasta; toss all together. Cover; cook on low until heated through. Serve.
