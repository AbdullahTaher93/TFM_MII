Heat olive oil in a stockpot over medium-low heat; cook and stir onion, leek, and garlic until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Add cauliflower, broccoli, and potatoes to onion mixture; cook and stir until potatoes are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high; stir broth and enough water to cover vegetables into mixture. Stir curry powder, turmeric, bay leaf, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper into broth-vegetable mixture. Loosely cover pot with a lid and bring soup to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until vegetables are softened, 20 to 25 minutes. Whisk milk and flour together in a bowl until smooth and thickened; stir into soup along with nutritional yeast until soup is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove soup from heat and allow to slightly cool and thicken.
