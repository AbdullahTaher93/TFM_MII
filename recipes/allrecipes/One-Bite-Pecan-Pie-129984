Beat cream cheese and butter with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Add flour; mix well. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour or until chilled. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Divide dough into 24 balls. Place 1 ball in each of 24 miniature muffin cups; press onto bottoms and up sides of cups to form shells. Beat egg lightly in small bowl. Add brown sugar and vanilla; mix well. Stir in pecans. Spoon evenly into pastry shells, filling each shell three-fourths full. Bake 25 min. or until lightly browned. Let stand 5 min.; remove from pans to wire racks. Cool completely. Drizzle with melted chocolate. Let stand until set.
