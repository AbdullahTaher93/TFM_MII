Preheat your oven's broiler. Split the lobster down the back shell, remove the vein from the lobster's tail, and the sac that is behind the eyes. Insert a long skewer into the tail to keep from curling. Broil the lobster about 5 inches from the heat for about 5 minutes on each side, or until the meat is opaque. Remove skewer from tail. While the lobster is cooking, make the chocolate sauce. In a small glass bowl, combine the chocolate, milk, and butter. Microwave on high, stirring every 15 to 20 seconds until melted and smooth. Pour chocolate sauce over lobster, and serve.
