Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bring a large bowl of salted water to a boil. Stir in lasagna noodles and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the noodles have cooked through but are still slightly firm, about 8 minutes. Drain. Mix eggs, cottage cheese, ricotta cheese, and Italian seasoning in a bowl; set aside. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir mushrooms, onion, and garlic in the hot oil until vegetables are tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir flour and black pepper into mushroom mixture until thoroughly combined; add milk. Cook and stir until sauce is thick and bubbly. Remove skillet from heat and stir spinach and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese into the mushroom sauce. Arrange 3 lasagna noodles in a single layer in the prepared baking dish. Spread 1/3 of the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles. Spread 1/3 of the mushroom sauce over the cottage cheese mixture. Sprinkle 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese on top. Repeat the layers twice more. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese over the lasagna. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbly, about 35 minutes. Allow lasagna to rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
