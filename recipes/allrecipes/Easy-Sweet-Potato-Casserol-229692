Place sweet potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes; drain. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a deep casserole dish with butter. Mash potatoes with a potato masher in a bowl until no large lumps remain. Stir white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter into the mashed sweet potatoes; transfer to prepared casserole dish. Cover sweet potato mixture with a layer of miniature marshmallows. Bake in preheated oven until marshmallows are browned, about 30 minutes.
