Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until halfway cooked, about 4 minutes. Drain. Combine heavy cream, milk, and Gruyere cheese in a large bowl. Add elbow macaroni and mix well; season with salt and pepper. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours. Bring the macaroni mixture to room temperature, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Pour into a 2-quart baking dish. Sprinkle remaining Gruyere cheese on top. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven until golden and crispy, 15 to 20 minutes.
