Place chicken pieces in a saucepan. Add fusilli, onions, celery, and carrots, ketchup, thyme, salt, and cayenne pepper. Pour chicken broth into pan. Place pan over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until vegetables soften and pasta is thoroughly cooked, stirring occasionally, 25 to 35 minutes.
