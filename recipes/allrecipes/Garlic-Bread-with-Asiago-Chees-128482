Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Slice the top 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) from each garlic bulb. Discard the tops. Lightly brush the bulbs with 1 tablespoon of the oil. Place in a shallow baking dish. Cover with foil. Bake for 55 to 60 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for 10 minutes, or until the garlic skin is browned and the interior is very soft. Let cool for several minutes. When the bulbs are cool enough to handle, squeeze the cloves into a bowl and mash with a fork. Discard the skin. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons oil. Mash until smooth. Preheat the broiler. Brush the garlic mixture over the bread halves. Sprinkle the cheese and paprika over the slices. Broil until golden. Cut into 16 slices.
