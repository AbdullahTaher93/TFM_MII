Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Trim off and discard the ends of the eggplant. Slice it into six rounds. Salt both sides of each round and place in a colander with a weighted bowl placed on top. Or place on thick, folded dish towels and put a weighted casserole dish on top. Let the eggplant drain for about 20 minute. Rinse and pat dry. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion and saute for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the cumin, oregano, cinnamon and cayenne pepper and cook one full minute more. Add the lamb and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook for about 5 minutes or until nicely browned. Be sure to stir frequently. Remove from heat. Drain out most of the fat. Stir in the pasta sauce. In a baking dish, place two eggplant rounds. Spoon on top 1/3 of the lamb. Sprinkle on top of that a little bit of the cheese. Then create two more layers of eggplant, lamb and cheese the same way. Sprinkle on top any remaining cheese. Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes at 375 F. Remove the foil and bake another 15 minutes. Serve immediately with a garnish of chopped parsley.
