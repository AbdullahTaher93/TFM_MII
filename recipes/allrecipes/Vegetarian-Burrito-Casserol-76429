In a saucepan bring water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place soy crumbles, tomatoes, reserved tomato juice, chili powder, cumin, and taco seasoning in a medium frying pan over medium high heat. Cook and stir, breaking up tomatoes, for 10 minutes. Lay 1 flour tortilla in a lightly greased 8x8 inch baking dish. Layer with one half of the beans, jalapeno slices, rice, salsa, soy mixture, and 1 cup Cheddar cheese. Repeat layers with remaining ingredients, beginning with the flour tortilla, and top with remaining 1 1/2 cups Cheddar cheese. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until heated through and cheese is melted. Serve immediately.
