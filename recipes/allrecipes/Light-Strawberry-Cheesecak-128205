Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150C). Coat a 9-inch (23-cm or 2.5-L) springform pan with nonstick spray. In a medium bowl, mix the crumbs and margarine. Press onto the bottom and 2 inches (5 cm) up the sides of the pan, set aside. Using an electric mixer, beat the ricotta until smooth. Add 3/4 cup (175 mL) of the sugar, plus the flour, egg yolks, lemon peel, and vanilla; mix well. Blend in the sour cream. In another bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry; fold them into the cheese mixture. Pour the cheese mixture into the prepared crust and smooth the top. Bake 1 hour. Turn off the oven; cool the cheesecake for 1 hour in the oven with the door ajar. Remove the cake from the oven, allow to cool and chill the cake thoroughly. Meanwhile, in a blender or food processor, puree 2 pint baskets (about 800 mL each) of the strawberries with the remaining 1/4 cup (50 mL) of sugar and the lemon juice. Strain the sauce. Cover and chill. Just before serving, halve the remaining strawberries and arrange them on the cake. Brush the strawberries with the jelly. Serve with the sauce.
