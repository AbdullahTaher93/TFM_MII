Bring a large pot with lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook rotini at a boil until the pasta is cooked yet slightly firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Rinse the pasta with cold water until completely chilled; drain completely. While the pasta cooks, whisk the apple cider vinegar and olive oil together in a large bowl until blended. Stir feta cheese, basil, salt, and black pepper into the vinaigrette. Fold the asparagus, tomatoes, carrots, green onions, and garlic into the vinaigrette to coat evenly. Stir the cooled pasta into the vegetable mixture; toss until evenly mixed.
