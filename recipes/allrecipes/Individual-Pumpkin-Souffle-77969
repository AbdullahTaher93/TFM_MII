Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Lightly spray 8 4-ounce ramekins with nonstick spray. In a medium bowl, lightly beat eggs and egg whites. Add the pumpkin and mix well. Blend in the fructose or sucralose, salt, cinnamon, evaporated milk, and vanilla. Fill each ramekin with 1/2 cup mixture. Place the ramekins in a baking dish and add enough warm water to come 2/3 of the way up the cups. Bake 40 minutes or until knife inserted in center of custard comes out clean. Remove from oven. Serve warm or room temperature and top with fat-free whipped topping, if desired.
