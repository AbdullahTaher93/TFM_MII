Spread a layer of onions in the bottom of a slow cooker, top with 1/2 of the steak. Spread another layer of onions over steak and pour 1 can of diced tomatoes over onions; top with 1/2 of the garlic. Repeat layers with remaining onion, steak, tomatoes, and garlic. Gently pour beef broth over steak mixture and add bay leaf. Cook on Low for 8 to 10 hours. Shred beef and return to slow cooker; stir mixture together until meat absorbs some of the broth, 5 to 10 minutes.
