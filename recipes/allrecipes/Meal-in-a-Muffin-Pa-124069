Grease a 12-cup muffin pan. Divide hash into six of the cups; press into the bottom and up the sides to form a shell. Break an egg into each shell; season with salt and pepper. Mix muffins according to package directions. Spoon batter into the other six cups. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until muffins are golden brown and eggs are cooked to desired doneness.
