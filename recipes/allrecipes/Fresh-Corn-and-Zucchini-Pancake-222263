Combine zucchini, corn, onion, and Parmesan cheese in a large bowl. Whisk flour, baking powder, milk, eggs, and melted butter in a separate bowl until moistened; pour batter over zucchini mixture. Stir until mixed. Heat vegetable oil in a griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. Drop 1/3 cup portions of the zucchini batter onto the griddle; pan-fry until browned, about 5 minutes on each side.
