Whisk olive oil, vinegar, garlic, Dijon mustard, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper in a bowl. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 12 minutes. Drain. Mix fusilli, basil, salami, pepperoni, artichoke hearts, provolone cheese, Asiago cheese, olives, roasted red peppers, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl; drizzle vinaigrette over salad. Toss to evenly coat.
