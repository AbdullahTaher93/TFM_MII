Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Remove oyster meat from shells and rinse in cold water, being sure to remove any shell fragments or the beginnings of a pearl. Pat dry with paper towels. Cut each piece into 5 smaller pieces. Rinse lower shell halves well. Discard flat tops. Melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and green onion; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Whisk mayonnaise, red miso, cayenne, and black pepper together in a small bowl. Spread a thin layer in the bottom of each shell. Divide oyster meat among shells. Top with mushroom mixture. Cover thickly with remaining mayonnaise mixture. Arrange shells on a baking sheet. Bake on the top rack of the preheated oven until tops are dark brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Garnish baked oysters with roe and serve with lemon wedges.
