Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Arrange crackers in 1 layer on a baking sheet, keeping space between each cracker. Fold each piece of American cheese in half and fold each half in half, creating 24 squares. Place 1 cheese square on top of each cracker. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Allow crackers to cool before serving.
