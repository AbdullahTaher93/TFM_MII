Preheat an oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Combine crumbs and butter; press into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 8 minutes. Cool. Meanwhile, for the topping, combine water and sugar in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat; boil 1 minute. Stir in berries; cover and reduce heat. Cook until most berries have popped, about 3 minutes. Add lemon juice. Press mixture through a sieve or food mill; set aside. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). For the filling, beat cream cheese in a large mixing bowl until light. Gradually beat in sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Add lemon juice. Pour into crust; spoon 4 tablespoons topping on filling and "marble" with a knife or spatula. Bake at in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Turn oven off; let cake stand in oven 2 hours. Remove from oven; cool. Pour remaining topping on top; refrigerate overnight.
