To Make the Sauce: In a medium bowl, combine the soy sauce, vinegar, water, scallions, sugar, ginger, oil, and red-pepper flakes. Transfer 1/3 cup (75 mL) of the sauce to a large bowl. Cover and refrigerate the remaining sauce. To Make the Chicken: Place the chicken in the large bowl with the sauce. Toss well to Coat. Allow to marinate for 15 minutes. Line a baking sheet with foil. Coat with nonstick spray. Meanwhile, in a shallow bowl, combine the egg whites and water. Beat lightly with a fork. In another shallow bowl, combine the flour and sesame seeds. Dip the chicken strips, one at a time, first into the egg-white mixture and then into the flour mixture, shaking off any excess. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Cover loosely with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Remove the plastic wrap from the baking sheet. Coat the chicken with nonstick spray. Bake for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven. Turn the chicken strips over. Coat with nonstick spray. Bake for 5 minutes longer, or until golden and cooked through. Serve on a platter with the sauce on the side.
