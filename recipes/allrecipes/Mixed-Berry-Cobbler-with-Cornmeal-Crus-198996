Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat an 8 x 8-inch baking dish with non-stick cooking spray. Set aside. To prepare berries: In a mixing bowl, combine SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend and cornstarch. Stir to mix. Add berries and their juice; toss to combine. Transfer to prepared baking dish. Wipe bowl clean with paper towels. To prepare crust: In wiped bowl, combine flour, cornmeal, SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, baking powder, and salt. Stir with fork or pastry blender. Add buttery stick chunks and cut them into dry ingredients until pieces are pea-sized. Add buttermilk and stir just to moisten. Drop 9 scant quarter-cups of batter over fruit. Bake 40 to 45 minutes, or until topping is golden and fruit is bubbling. Let stand 20 to 30 minutes before serving to allow sauce to thicken.
