Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Mix dressing and honey in medium bowl. Add peaches; toss to coat. Grill peaches 6 to 8 min. or until softened, turning occasionally and brushing with the dressing mixture. Place 2 peach halves in each of 4 dessert dishes; top each with 2 Tbsp. of the whipped topping. Garnish with fresh mint leaves, if desired.
