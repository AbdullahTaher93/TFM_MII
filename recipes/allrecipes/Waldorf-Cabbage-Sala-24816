Use a chef's knife to slice cabbage into thin pieces 1 to 2 inches long. Do not use the large ribs of the cabbage, as they are too strongly flavored. In a large bowl, toss together the cabbage, apples, walnuts, celery, mayonnaise, sugar and salt until evenly coated. Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator for up to one day.
