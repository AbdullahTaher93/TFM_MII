Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook pork chops until evenly brown on both sides; remove from skillet. Pour in orange juice, soy sauce and sugar. Boil for 2 minutes, scraping the bottom of pan. In a small bowl, mix together water and cornstarch, and stir into sauce. Return pork to skillet and cook briefly until thickened and heated through.
