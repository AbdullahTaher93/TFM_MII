In a large frying pan, heat the oil over moderately high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Stir in the chili powder, salt, and pepper. Add the salsa and simmer over low heat to allow the flavors to combine, about 10 minutes. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the cavatappi until just done, about 13 minutes. Drain the pasta and toss it with the sauce, lime juice, cilantro, and 1 cup of the cheese. Stir until the cheese is melted. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup cheese and serve with wedges of lime if you like.
