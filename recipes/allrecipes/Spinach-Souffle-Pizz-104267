Press pizza crust dough to fit in a 12-inch round pizza pan. Spread pizza sauce over dough. Bake crust at 425 degrees F for five minutes. Heat oil in large skillet. Saute mushrooms 1 minute; add spinach and continue sauteing just until spinach wilts. Season with 1 teaspoon Morton(R) Kosher Salt. Spoon spinach/mushroom mixture evenly over crust. In small bowl, combine blue cheese and mayonnaise; set aside. In clean, medium bowl, lightly combine remaining 1/4 teaspoon Morton Kosher Salt and egg whites; beat until stiff, but not dry, peaks form. Gently fold in cheese/mayonnaise mixture. Spread egg white/mayonnaise mixture over spinach/mushroom mixture; lightly smooth top. Bake at 425 degrees F for 10 to 12 minutes, or until top is golden brown and slightly puffed. Cut into wedges; serve immediately.
