Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for indirect, medium-low heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above cooking grate only 5 to 6 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). Set a 10- by 12-inch foil drip pan beneath center of cooking grate; fill with 2 quarts water. In a small bowl, mix 1 tablespoon brown sugar, 2 teaspoons allspice, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt; rub over pork. Place pork fat side up on oiled cooking grate over drip pan (not over direct heat). If using charcoal, add 5 briquettes to each mound of coals now; repeat every 30 minutes of cooking. Cover charcoal grill and open vents; close lid on gas grill. Cook meat until tender when pierced, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, in a food processor, whirl remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 1 teaspoon allspice, and 1/2 teaspoon salt; green onions; garlic; chiles; tomato paste; thyme; pepper; and vinegar and whirl until smooth. When meat is tender, generously baste with half of onion mixture. Cook for 15 minutes and baste again. Cook until coating is brown and meat shreds easily with fork, about 30 minutes more. Lift pork to a bowl; tent with foil. Skim and discard fat from pan liquid. Measure liquid; if more than 1 1/2 cups, pour into a medium saucepan and boil over high heat until reduced to 1 1/2 cups. Cut meat from bone (discard bone). With 2 forks, pull meat into thin shreds; discard fat. Stir in cooking liquid. Spoon about 1/3 cup pulled pork into each roll. Offer with lime and salt to add to taste.
