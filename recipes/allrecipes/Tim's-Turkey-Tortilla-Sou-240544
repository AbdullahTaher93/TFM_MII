Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir turkey in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Transfer turkey to a 5-quart pot. Mix broth, picante sauce, cilantro, lime juice, and olive oil into turkey; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover pot, and simmer until flavors blend, about 40 minutes. Transfer soup to serving bowls and top with tortilla chips.
