Place noodles in a large bowl and cover with hot water. Stir and allow to soak until softened, about 15 minutes. Drain and rinse thoroughly. Combine garlic, rice vinegar, fish sauce, chile paste, brown sugar and salt in a bowl. Stir in green onions, carrots, basil, mint, and cilantro. Toss in rice noodles, peanuts, and sesame oil. Allow to sit for 30 minutes to absorb flavors. Garnish with additional green onions and peanuts. If using, top with grilled chicken and Fresno chiles.
