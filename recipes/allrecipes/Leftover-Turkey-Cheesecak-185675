Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine stuffing and 1 tablespoon gravy in a bowl. Press the stuffing into the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan. Beat the cream cheese, ricotta cheese, eggs, and 3 tablespoons gravy with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Fold in the diced turkey. Spoon the filling into the pie pan. Bake in a preheated oven for 35 minutes. Remove from oven and cover the top of the cheesecake with the cranberry sauce.
