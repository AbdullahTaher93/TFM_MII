Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Set the ground turkey and ground pork out at room temperature to warm slightly. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the carrot, bell pepper, onion, garlic, and spinach in the heated oil until soft; set aside to cool. Mix together the turkey, pork, bread crumbs, wheat germ, eggs, 2 tablespoons ketchup, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add the vegetable mixture and continue to mix until evenly combined; shape into a loaf; lay on the prepared baking sheet. Whisk together the honey and 1 tablespoon ketchup in a small bowl; spread over the meatloaf. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 60 to 70 minutes; remove to a serving platter and allow to rest 5 minutes before slicing.
