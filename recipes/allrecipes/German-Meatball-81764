In a large mixing bowl, add the eggs, Worcestershire, mustard, paprika, oregano, garlic powder, and liquid smoke. Mix well with a fork or whisk. Add the ground beef and blend well using your well washed hands. Form meatballs by rolling a small portion in the palm of your hands (rubbing a little oil on your hands will help keep the meat from sticking). Place meatballs on a tray or platter until ready to cook. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add one batch of meatballs at a time and brown well on all sides and cook through (about 8 minutes per batch). Gently transfer to a bowl and cover (to retain the heat). Repeat until all the meatballs have been cooked. Pour off any grease (but leave the bits of meat in the skillet). Add the canned mushrooms with the liquid. Reduce heat to medium. Add the Kitchen bouquet and the sour cream. Stir until well mixed. Gently add the meatballs back to the skillet and spoon the sauce over the meatballs to cover. Cook until heated through (but do not boil). This should only take a minute or two. Transfer to serving platter and serve immediately.
