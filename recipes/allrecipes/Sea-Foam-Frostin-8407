Stir the unbeaten egg whites, sugar and water together in the top of a double boiler. Cook over briskly boiling water, beating with a rotary beater for 7 minutes or until frosting looks fluffy and holds a soft, gentle shape. Remove from boiling water, add vanilla extract and continue beating until frosting holds definite peaks. Spread between layers of cake and then frost the sides and top.
