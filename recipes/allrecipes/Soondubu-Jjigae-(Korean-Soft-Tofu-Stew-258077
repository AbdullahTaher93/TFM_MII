Place a clay pot over medium-high heat. Add garlic, oil, and red pepper power; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in ground beef; cook until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Scoop tofu into the pot using a spoon. Add water, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Crack egg into the center of the pot. Sprinkle green onions over the soup. Simmer until egg starts to set, about 3 minutes.
