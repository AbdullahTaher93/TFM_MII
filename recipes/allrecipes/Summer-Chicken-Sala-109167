Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Coat chicken with 1 tablespoon of oil, sprinkle with salt, pepper and 1 teaspoon of sugar. Place chicken on hot grill; cook, turning once, until grill marks form and chicken is cooked through, 10 to 14 minutes. Remove from grill; when cool enough to handle cut into bite-size pieces. In a blender, combine the remaining oil and sugar, red wine vinegar, mustard, salt and pepper. Process until smooth. Place lettuce, strawberries, pecans, onion and chicken in a large bowl. Add dressing; toss to coat and serve.
