Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. On a sheet of foil, drizzle the olive oil on the unpeeled garlic, wrap up and bake for 40 minutes. In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil, add the wax beans and cook them until just tender, about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer them to a large bowl. Add the sliced garlic, bay leaves, thyme, lemon zest and juice, cayenne and 1 1/2 teaspoons each of salt and pepper to the saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes. Add the shrimp and simmer for 3 minutes. Transfer the shrimp to a baking sheet. Let the shrimp boil cool to room temperature, then return the shrimp to it. Peel the roasted garlic. In a mini food processor, puree the roasted garlic with the mustard, rice vinegar and honey. Slowly blend in the 1/4 cup of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Toss the wax beans with the edamame, chickpeas and dressing. Mound the salad on plates, top with the shrimp and serve.
