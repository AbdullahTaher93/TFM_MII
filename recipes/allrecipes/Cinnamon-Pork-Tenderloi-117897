In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the first six ingredients. Add the pork; seal bag and turn to coat. Refrigerate 4-6 hours. Drain and discard marinade. Grill pork, uncovered, over medium heat for 15-20 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), turning occasionally. Let stand for 5 minutes before slicing.
