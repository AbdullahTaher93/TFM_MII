In a large saucepan, cook beef and sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Sprinkle with flour. Add the soup, tomatoes, onion and garlic powder; mix well. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Reduce heat. Stir in cheese until melted. Serve warm with tortilla chips. Refrigerate any leftovers.
