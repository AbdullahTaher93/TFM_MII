FOR MEATBALLS: PREHEAT oven to 350 degrees F. MIX all meatball ingredients lightly but thoroughly in medium bowl. Shape into 2-inch balls. Place in jelly-roll pan. BAKE for 20 to 25 minutes or until no longer pink. Drain; reserve fat drippings. Keep meatballs warm. FOR GRAVY: COMBINE 1/2 cup fat drippings from meatballs (adding vegetable oil to make 1/2 cup) and flour in large saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil. Boil for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in broth, evaporated milk, dill and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil and thickens slightly. Add meatballs to sauce; stir. Serve over noodles.
