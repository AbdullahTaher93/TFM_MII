Chop chocolate and place in small microwavable glass bowl. Microwave at 50% power for 1 minute 15 seconds. Stir until all chocolate is melted and bowl no longer feels warm. Holding strawberry by green top, dip into chocolate, covering about 2/3 to 3/4 of the berry. Gently let excess drip off. Place berry on waxed paper. Repeat with remaining berries. Let berries stand until chocolate hardens.
