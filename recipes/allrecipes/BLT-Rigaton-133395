In a medium skillet, cook the pancetta over medium heat until crisp, about 6 minutes. Drain on paper towels and coarsely chop. In a medium saucepan, heat the 3 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the wine, bring to a simmer and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, season to taste with salt and pepper and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 20 minutes. In a large bowl, combine the cooked rigatoni with the sauce. Add the pancetta, basil and arugula; toss. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with the cheese.
