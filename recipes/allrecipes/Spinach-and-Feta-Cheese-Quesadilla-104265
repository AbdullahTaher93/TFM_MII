In small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons olive oil with 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning and Morton(R) Kosher Salt. Brush mixture on one side of each tortilla. Place tortillas, oil-side-down in single layer, on lightly greased large baking pans. Evenly spread basil pesto on top of tortillas. In small bowl, combine chopped spinach, onions, feta cheese and remaining 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning and tablespoon of olive oil. Toss to coat spinach with oil. Top two tortillas evenly with spinach/green onion mixture, and then sprinkle each with 2 tablespoons Monterey Jack. Cover with second tortilla; press down firmly. Bake quesadillas at 375 degrees F. 10 to 15 minutes or until tortillas are light golden brown along edges and cheese melts. Cut into wedges; serve immediately.
