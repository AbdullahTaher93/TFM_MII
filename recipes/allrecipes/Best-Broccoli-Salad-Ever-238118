Whisk mayonnaise, cider vinegar, and sugar together in a small bowl until sugar dissolves and the dressing is smooth. Toss broccoli, grapes, walnuts, red onion, sunflower seeds, cranberries, and bacon bits together in a large bowl. Drizzle dressing over the salad and gently fold so ingredients are evenly coated. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 3 to 4 hours. Stir before serving.
