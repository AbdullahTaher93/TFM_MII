Heat oven to 400 degrees F. In large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon, bell pepper and onion 10 minutes or until crisp; drain. In bowl, combine chili, bacon mixture and hot sauce. Roll out each package of crescent roll dough into rectangle; press perforations to seal. Cut each rectangle into 8 squares. Top 16 squares with chili mixture and cheese. Cover with remaining crescent dough squares. Pinch seams together. Tuck two sides of the square under and pinch the ends to form the shape of a football. Place on baking sheets. Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until golden brown.
