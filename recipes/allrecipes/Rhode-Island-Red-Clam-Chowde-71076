Pour clam juice, and the juice from the canned clams into a large pot. Bring to a boil. Add onion, carrots, and potatoes; and simmer over medium heat for 15 minutes, or until tender. Stir in the tomato soup and tomato sauce, and season with parsley and black pepper. Add clams last, and cook just until heated through.
