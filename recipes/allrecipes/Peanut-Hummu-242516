Bring water and peanuts to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat to low and simmer until peanuts are soft, about 30 minutes. Blend peanuts and water with a hand blender until smooth; add more water, if necessary, to reach desired consistency. Continue blending and add onion, peanut butter, and garlic; season with salt. Transfer mixture to a serving dish and sprinkle with chipotle powder.
