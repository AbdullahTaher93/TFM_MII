Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet over medium-high heat, saute the ground beef for 5 minutes, or until browned. Drain excess fat and set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, soup, ketchup and milk. Mix well and stir in the ground beef. Pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15 minutes, place the biscuits on top and bake for 15 minutes or until biscuits are golden brown.
