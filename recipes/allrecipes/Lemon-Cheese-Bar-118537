In a bowl, combine the dry cake mix, one egg and oil until crumbly. Set aside 1 cup for topping. Press the remaining crumb mixture into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15 minutes. In a small mixing bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth; add the sugar, extract and remaining egg. Spread over crust. Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. Refrigerate leftovers.
