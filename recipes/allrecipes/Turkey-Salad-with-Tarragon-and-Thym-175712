Spread walnut halves out in a small baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F, shaking occasionally, until golden brown, about 10 minutes. While nuts roast, cut turkey meat into bite-size pieces. Remove nuts from oven, pour from pan, and cool. In a large bowl, combine the turkey, walnuts, grapes, celery, green onions, tarragon, and thyme. Mix gently. In a separate bowl, whisk together the yogurt and mayonnaise. Add to turkey mixture and stir until well blended. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately or cover airtight and chill up to one day.
