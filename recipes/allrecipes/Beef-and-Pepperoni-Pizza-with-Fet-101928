Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and cook until meat loses its raw color, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add pepperoni and pizza sauce; simmer to heat through, about 1 minute. Place pizza crust on a cookie sheet pan; spread sauce mixture over crust followed by feta and bake for 15 minutes. Sprinkle mozzarella and oregano; bake until cheese melts and crust is crisp, about 5 minutes. Cut into wedges and serve.
