In a small saucepan, combine pineapple juice, honey, mustard and ginger; bring to a boil. Combine cornstarch and water; whisk into honey mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, for 2-3 minutes or until thickened. Reserve 3/4 cup to serve with chicken if desired. Brush chicken with remaining glaze. Grill, covered, over medium-low coals for 30 minutes. Turn chicken; brush again with glaze. Grill, uncovered, for 20 minutes or until juices run clear. Serve with reserved glaze if desired.
