In a bowl, combine the flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut in butter until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Stir in dates. Combine eggs and milk; stir into crumb mixture just until blended (dough will be soft). Turn onto a lightly floured surface. With lightly floured hands, gently knead dough 10 times. Pat into a 9-in. x 6-in. rectangle. Using a floured knife, cut into six 3-in. squares; cut each square diagonally in half. Place on a greased baking sheet. Combine the cinnamon and remaining sugar; sprinkle over scones. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to a wire rack.
