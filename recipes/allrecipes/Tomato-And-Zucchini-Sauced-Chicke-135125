Sear the chicken in a skillet on medium-high heat (about 4 to 5 minutes per side), seasoning each side with a pinch of salt and pepper as the other side cooks. Remove the breasts from the skillet, and reduce the heat to medium. Add the olive oil and garlic to the skillet, stirring frequently and scraping with a spoon to release the brown bits left behind by the meat (about 30 seconds). Add the zucchini and basil. Let the mixture rest for 1 minute. Stir in the tomatoes and place the chicken breasts back in the skillet. Cover and cook for 2 minutes more.
