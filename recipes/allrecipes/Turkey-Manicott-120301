Place the bulgur in a bowl; stir in boiling water. Cover and let stand for 30 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed. Drain and squeeze dry. In a nonstick skillet, cook turkey over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Add the cottage cheese, basil, oregano, salt, pepper and bulgur; mix well. Stuff into uncooked manicotti shells. Arrange in a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Combine spaghetti sauce and water; pour over shells. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until shells are tender and sauce is bubbly. Uncover; sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Bake 5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.
