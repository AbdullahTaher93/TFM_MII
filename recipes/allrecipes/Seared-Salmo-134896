Line the broiler pan with foil, coat it with nonstick cooking spray, and lay the fillets on top. In a small bowl, mix together the sour cream, mustard, and lemon juice. Pour the mixture over the fillets and broil 5 inches from the heat for 10 to 12 minutes, or until opaque in the center. Top with lemon before devouring.
