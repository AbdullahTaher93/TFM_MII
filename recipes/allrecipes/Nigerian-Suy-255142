Mix ground peanuts, cayenne pepper, paprika, salt, ginger, garlic powder, and onion powder together in a bowl. Combine spice mixture and beef in a resealable plastic bag; shake until well coated. Marinate in the refrigerator, about 30 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Place beef, bell pepper, onion, and mushrooms in alternating order onto skewers. Cook on the preheated grill, flipping once, until meat is browned and vegetables are soft, 10 to 15 minutes.
