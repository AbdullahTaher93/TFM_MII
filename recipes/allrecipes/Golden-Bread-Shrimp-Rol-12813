In a medium size bowl combine the shrimp, onion, curry powder, and salt and pepper. Marinate for 30 minutes. Lay the flattened the white bread on a level surface. Place one marinated shrimp and some onion onto the bread. Roll the bread so that the shrimp and onion are held in the middle of the bread with the tail sticking out of one end. Seal the edges of the roll closed with the beaten egg. Continue this process with each shrimp. Pour enough vegetable oil in a large skillet to cover the shrimp rolls. Heat the oil over a medium heat. Oil is ready for frying when bubbles begin to rise. Place a few shrimp rolls in the oil at a time. Fry until the bread turns a golden brown color. Drain on a paper towel and serve on a plate of lettuce.
