Place pork in a shallow dish and coat with Italian dressing. Cover and refrigerate for two hours. For the relish, stir the black olives, green olives, garlic, onion, and peppers together in a bowl; stir in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. When pork has finished marinating, preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Slice the pork loin down the center lengthwise, cutting about 3/4 of the way through to the other side. Stuff full with the olive relish. Cover and bake in the preheated oven for about 2 hours, or until internal temperature has reached 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
