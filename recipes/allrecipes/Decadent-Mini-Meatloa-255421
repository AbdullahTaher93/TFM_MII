Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a rimmed baking sheet. Mix ground chuck, egg, salt, pepper, and garlic powder together in a bowl. Shape into 6 mini meat loaves and place on prepared baking sheet. Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Cook and stir onion until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add figs and heat through. Spread fig mixture over mini loaves. Top with crumbled cheese and fresh basil. Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 30 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Prepare Idahoan Signatureâ„¢ Russets Mashed Potatoes according to package instructions. Serve as a side to the meatloaf.
