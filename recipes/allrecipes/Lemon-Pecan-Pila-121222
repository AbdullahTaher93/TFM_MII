In a saucepan, bring broth to a boil. Stir in rice; return to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes or until the rice is tender. Meanwhile, melt butter in a nonstick skillet. Add the pecans; sauce until golden. Stir in the lemon juice and peel. Pour over rice and stir to coat. Sprinkle with parsley.
