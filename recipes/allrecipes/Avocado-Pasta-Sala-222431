Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook corkscrew-shaped pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and cool. Mix pasta, tomatoes, apple, carrot, celery, peas, red bell pepper, black olives, and red onion together in a large bowl. Whisk avocado, olive oil, lime juice, dill, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder together in a separate bowl until smooth; stir into pasta salad to coat; garnish with Parmesan cheese and fresh parsley.
