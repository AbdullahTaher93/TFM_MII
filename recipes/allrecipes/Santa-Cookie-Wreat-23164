Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Mix gingerbread mix (dry), hot water, flour and margarine in medium bowl with spoon until dough forms. Reserve one-fourth of the dough. Roll remaining three-fourths of the dough into 9 1/2-inch circle, 1/4 inch thick. Cut 4-inch circle out of center of 9 1/2-inch circle to form wreath shape. (Add 4-inch circle of dough to reserved one-fourth dough.) Place 9 1/2-inch wreath on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 15 minutes or until edges are firm. (Do not overbake.) Cool 1 minute before removing from cookie sheet. Roll reserved one-fourth dough until 1/4 inch thick. Cut with 2-inch holly leaf-shaped cookie cutter. Bake 9 minutes or until edges are firm. (Do not overbake.) Cool 1 minute before removing from cookie sheet. Heat candy coating over low heat until melted. For each Santa cookie, dip one end of peanut butter cookie into coating to look like Santa's beard. Let dry on cookie sheet lined with waxed paper. When coating is dry, dip other end of cookie into coating (leaving middle of cookie plain to decorate for Santa's face). Immediately sprinkle wet coating with red sugar for Santa's hat, leaving 1/4 inch of coating near cookie center plain to look like trim of hat. Place a marshmallow fourth on the side of the hat to look like a pom-pom. Attach 2 chocolate chips to cookie with coating for the eyes. Attach 1 cinnamon candy to cookie with coating for the nose. Use remaining candies to decorate holly leaves. Attach Santas and holly leaves to wreath with coating.
