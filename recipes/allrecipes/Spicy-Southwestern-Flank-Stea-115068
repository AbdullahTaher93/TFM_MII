Whisk first 9 ingredients together in a small bowl until marinade is combined. Place flank steak in a zipper-lock bag or in a shallow, nonreactive pan. Pour marinade over contents and seal or cover. Transfer bag or pan to refrigerator and marinate steak, turning zipper-lock bag or stirring contents of pan occasionally to evenly distribute the marinade, for at least 3 hours, 24 hours if possible. Heat grill or broiler. Remove steak from bag or pan and sprinkle with salt. Place on a roasting pan or hot grill rack. Cook steak on grill or under broiler, turning once, until medium-rare, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer steak to a platter and cover with aluminum foil to let juices settle, about 5 minutes. Holding knife at a slight angle, cut thin slices across the grain. Serve immediately.
