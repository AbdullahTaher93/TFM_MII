In a bowl, beat eggs. Add the cheeses, salsa, salt and pepper; mix well. Roll out pastry into a 12-in. circle on a foil-lined baking sheet. Spread with cheese mixture to within 1 in. of edge. Fold edge of pastry over outer edge of filling. Bake at 400 degrees F for 22-26 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand for 5 minutes before cutting into wedges. Refrigerate any leftovers.
