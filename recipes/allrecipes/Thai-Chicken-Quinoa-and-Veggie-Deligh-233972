Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add quinoa, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, about 25 minutes. Fluff quinoa with a fork; set aside to cool for 10 minutes. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir mushroom and garlic in hot oil until the mushrooms are tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer mushroom mixture to a bowl. Return skillet to heat. Cook and stir diced chicken in the skillet until no longer pink the center, 10 to 15 minutes; season with sea salt and pepper. Stir carrot, red onion, tomato, and green onion with the chicken; cook and stir until the vegetables are hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Add quinoa and stir. Top with cilantro and lime juice.
