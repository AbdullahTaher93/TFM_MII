In bread machine pan, place the first seven ingredients in order suggested by manufacturer. Select the dough setting (check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water or flour if needed). When cycle is completed, turn dough onto a floured surface and punch down. Divide into 40 portions. In a bowl, combine the sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle 2 teaspoons in a greased 10-in. fluted tube pan. Arrange about a third of the pecans, cherries, raisins and cranberries in bottom of pan. Dip half of the dough pieces in butter, then roll in sugar mixture. Arrange evenly in pan. Repeat. Arrange remaining pecans and fruit over top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes or until golden brown. Cool in pan for 5 minutes before inverting onto a serving platter.
