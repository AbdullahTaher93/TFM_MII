In a large, shallow salad bowl, whisk together vinegar, shallots, mustard, olive oil, salt, and pepper until smooth. In a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. When very hot, add the figs, cut sides down, and cook for 30 seconds. Remove pan from heat and leave figs to sizzle in pan while you assemble the salad. Place arugula and frisee in bowl and toss with tongs until greens are evenly coated with the dressing. Divide salad between four plates and scatter quartered mozzarella around the edges. Place 4 warm fig halves on top of each salad and serve at once.
