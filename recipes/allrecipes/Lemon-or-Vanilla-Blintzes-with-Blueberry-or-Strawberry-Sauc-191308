In a small bowl, mix together, Dannon(R) All Natural Lemon or Vanilla Lowfat Yogurt, farmers cheese and cinnamon, if using. Set filling aside. In a medium sauce pan, add 3 tablespoons water, sugar, and potato starch. Stir together. Add berries of choice and cook over medium-high heat until mixture comes to a boil. Reduce heat and cook for an additional 8 to 10 minutes, stirring often, or until mixture thickens and berries are soft. Set sauce aside; mixture can be warmed up just before serving. In a large bowl, mix together matzoh meal, eggs, sugar and low fat milk to form batter. In a 10-inch nonstick pan, heat 1/4 teaspoon butter and brush around pan. Once hot, add 1/4 cup batter and turn pan so batter spreads to fill the bottom of the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until lightly browned. Flip and cook on the other side for about a minute. Remove from the pan and place on a plate. Repeat with rest of batter. You should have 8 very thin pancakes. (Note: there is a little extra batter just in case your first pancake does not look as good as the others.) Once all the pancakes have been cooked, lay 1 pancake on a flat surface, nicer side should be facing down on the surface. Place 4 tablespoons of filling in center and fold up bottom to cover filling. Fold down the top, and then fold in the sides. Place folded side down on a plate. Repeat with remaining pancakes. These can be made a day ahead; cover and chill until ready to fry. Heat 2 teaspoons butter in nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Add 4 blintzes and fry until golden brown on both sides, about 1 to 2 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining blintzes. Serve hot with sauce.
