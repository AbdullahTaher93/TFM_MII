Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Combine zucchini, crackers, onion, eggs, Cheddar cheese, salt, and pepper in a bowl using a spoon or your hands until mixture is evenly combined. Form mixture into small patties. Fry patties in the hot oil until lightly browned and heated through, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
