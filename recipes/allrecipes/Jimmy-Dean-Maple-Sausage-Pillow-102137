In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook sausage and onion, stirring frequently until meat is finely crumbled and no longer pink and onion is translucent; remove from heat. Stir in apple, raisins, spices, maple syrup and orange zest; add pine nuts if desired. Preheat oven to 375 F. Unfold a pastry sheet and cut each into 3 equal strips lengthwise, then cut each strip into 3 squares for a total of 9 squares per sheet. Before filling each square, press to enlarge slightly. Place 1 slightly rounded tablespoon sausage mixture in the center of each square; brush edges of pastry with water. Fold dough over filling to create a triangle, pressing the edges to seal. Repeat with remaining pastry and filling. Bake on an ungreased baking sheet 18 minutes, or until dough puffs and turns golden brown. Optional garnishes: dust with powdered sugar; decorate serving platter with orange slices and mint leaves.
