Trim and discard any remaining fat from chop rims. Rinse meat and pat dry. On a counter, place chops well apart between sheets of plastic wrap. With a flat mallet, pound meat until about 1/8 inch thick. In a small bowl, stir Thai seasoning to blend with rice vinegar. Remove top piece of plastic from meat and evenly rub surfaces with the vinegar mixture, using all; let stand about 5 minutes. In a blender, whirl cilantro with garlic, lime juice, and oil, scraping container sides often, until a paste forms. Scrape cilantro sauce into a small bowl and add salt to taste. Lift meat from plastic wrap and lay on a lightly oiled barbecue grill over solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning once, until meat is still moist looking but no more than faintly pink to white in the center (cut to test), 5 to 7 minutes total. Transfer chops to plates and top portions equally with cilantro sauce and hot-sweet mustard and salt to taste.
