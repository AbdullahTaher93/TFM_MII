Combine Ragu(R) Sauce and water in a large pot. Break the spaghetti in half (if desired) and place into the pot. Bring to a boil, stirring often. Stir in artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, capers, garlic, grape tomatoes, crushed red pepper flakes, and parsley. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until pasta is cooked to desired tenderness, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from the heat and serve warm. Garnish with additional fresh parsley and red pepper if desired.
