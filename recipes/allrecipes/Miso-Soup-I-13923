Pour oil into the bottom of a large saucepan, and place over medium heat. Add onion; saute until tender and almost brown. Add garlic and ginger; saute until fragrant, just a minute or two. Add tofu. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned; this should take about 5 minutes Stir in soy sauce, thoroughly coating tofu. Add water and sherry. Bring back up to heat, and add carrots and spinach. Heat through. Thin miso with some of the soup, and add back into the soup. Simmer over medium low heat for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with black pepper to taste. Serve.
