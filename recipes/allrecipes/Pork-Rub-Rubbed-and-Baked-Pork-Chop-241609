Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Mix paprika, sugar, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper together in a wide, shallow bowl. Dredge pork chops in the spice mixture to coat and arrange on a baking sheet. Bake chops in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
