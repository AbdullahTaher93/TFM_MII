Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. With sharp knife, cut circle in top rind of cheese, leaving 1/4 inch border around top of cheese. Do not cut through bottom. Carefully remove center circle leaving a "bowl." Place cheese on pie plate or other small shallow ovenproof baking dish. In small saucepan, stir together cranberry sauce, sugar, ginger, orange zest, cornstarch and allspice. Stir over medium heat until mixture comes to a boil and thickens slightly. Remove from heat. Spread cranberry mixture on top of cheese. Bake 5 to 10 minutes, until cheese is soft but not runny. (Do not overheat.) Sprinkle with nuts and chives. Serve with Toasteds(R) crackers.
