Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix cottage cheese, spinach, eggs, and Parmesan cheese together in a bowl; pour into an 8-inch square baking dish and smooth into an even layer. Bake in preheated oven until the cheese is bubbling along the edges, 20 to 30 minutes. Season with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
