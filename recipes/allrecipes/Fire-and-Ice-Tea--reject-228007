Place the Sweet'N Low, jalapeno, and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Off the heat, mix in the mint. Set aside until the syrup is room temperature. The syrup can be refrigerated in a covered container for 24 hours. Fill a tall glass with ice cubes. Pour in the tea. Add the lime juice and 1-2 tablespoon of the syrup, to taste. If desired, garnish with the pineapple and mint.
