Top with blueberries. Drop spoonfuls of remaining batter over berries, spreading to cover. (Batter may not completely cover berries.) Mix streusel from packet, granola and the 2 tablespoons butter together in another medium bowl. Sprinkle over batter. Bake 45 to 50 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.
