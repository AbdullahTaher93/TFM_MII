Combine orange chunks, green onions, and jalapeno pepper together in a small bowl. Let sit until flavors combine, about 10 minutes. Season tilapia fillets with lemon juice, salt, and black pepper. Heat butter and oil in a large grill pan over medium-high heat. Cook fish until opaque on one side, about 3 minutes. Flip fish and cook until lightly browned and fish flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes more. Top fish with orange salsa and a sprinkle of lemon juice.
