Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Stir chile-garlic sauce and honey together in a small bowl. Thread shrimp onto soaked bamboo skewers, piercing through the head and tail ends. Cook the skewers on the preheated grill, frequently turning and basting with the sauce mixture, until shrimp are firm and pink on all sides, about 10 minutes.
