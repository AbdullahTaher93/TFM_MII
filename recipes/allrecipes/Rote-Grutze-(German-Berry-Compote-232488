Combine berries and sugar in non-stick saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil while stirring constantly. Whisk cornstarch into cold water in a small bowl until dissolved completely; stir into the berry mixture. Reduce heat to medium low and cook mixture at a simmer until it begins to thicken, about 3 minutes. Remove berry mixture from heat. Stir lemon juice and vanilla extract into the berry mixture; transfer to a bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours.
