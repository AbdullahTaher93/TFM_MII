Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; saute onion and garlic until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add water to onion mixture and bring to a boil. Stir dates, cranberries, raisins, and peanuts into onion mixture and bring to a boil again. Add couscous and cilantro to dried fruit-onion mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover skillet, and simmer until water is mostly absorbed, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir mango into couscous mixture, return cover, and simmer until all the water is absorbed and couscous is tender, about 5 more minutes.
