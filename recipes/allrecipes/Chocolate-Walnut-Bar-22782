Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8 inch square pan. In a medium bowl, cream together the 6 tablespoons of butter and 1/3 cup sugar until smooth. Stir in the flour and walnuts. Press into the prepared pan. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven. To make the topping: Beat the 2 tablespoons butter, water, cocoa, 1/2 cup sugar, eggs, vanilla and salt together in a medium bowl until smooth and shiny. Spread evenly onto the baked crust. Return to the oven and bake for an additional 20 minutes, or until set. Dust with confectioners' sugar and cut into 24 bars when cool. These taste best served chilled.
