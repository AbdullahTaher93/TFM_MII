In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. In another bowl, beat eggs. Add oil, sugars and vanilla. Pour over dry ingredients; mix well. Stir in zucchini, apples and pecans (batter will be stiff). Spoon into three greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-55 minutes or until done. Cool in pans for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
