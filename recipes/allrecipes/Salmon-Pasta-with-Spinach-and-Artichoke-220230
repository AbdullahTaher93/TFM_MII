Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Coat salmon fillet with 2 tablespoons pesto. Place in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from oven and flake salmon into chunks; set salmon aside. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in rigatoni, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until rigatoni has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain in a colander. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook and stir spinach in oil until wilted, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove spinach and set aside. Cook and stir garlic, shallots, red pepper flakes, and black pepper in the same skillet until garlic and shallots are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Pour in extra oil if needed. Stir in drained artichoke hearts and cook until heated, about 3 minutes. Pour in white wine and simmer until slightly reduced, 5 to 10 minutes. Combine 2 tablespoons pesto, cooked spinach, salmon, Parmesan cheese, and cooked pasta in the skillet and lightly toss until mixed, 1 to 2 minutes.
