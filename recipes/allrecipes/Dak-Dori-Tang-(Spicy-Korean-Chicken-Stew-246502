Combine soy sauce, gochujang, brown sugar, garlic, sesame oil, ginger, and chile powder in a bowl for the marinade. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a stockpot over medium heat. Add chicken and cook until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer chicken to bowl with marinade and toss to coat. Heat remaining vegetable oil in stockpot. Stir in carrots, potatoes, leek, and onion. Cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 10 minutes. Stir in habanero pepper and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Pour water into stockpot, stir in chicken and marinade, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, adding more water as desired, until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.
