Kabobs: Pre-heat grill to medium-high. Avoid crowding, thread the chicken sausage, pineapple, onion, peppers, and tomato, alternating each ingredient, onto each skewer. Lightly coat with cooking spray and season with salt and pepper. Apple Marinade and Sauce (optional): Combine apple cider, onion, olive oil, cider vinegar, mustards, and herbs. Brush each kabob with marinade. Grill the kabobs uncovered over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes, turning to cook on all sides, until the veggies are browned and chicken sausage reaches internal temperature of 165 degrees F. Garnish with scallions.
