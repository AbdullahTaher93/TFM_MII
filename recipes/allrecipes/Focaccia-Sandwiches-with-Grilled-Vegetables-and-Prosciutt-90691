Cut each focaccia loaf into 4 equal pieces, then split each piece in half horizontally. Set out ingredients buffet-style for guests. To make a sandwich, top each focaccia bottom half with provolone or chevre. Layer on prosciutto slices, then arugula or watercress. Top equally with grilled vegetables and moisten with some of the marinade. Add salt and pepper to taste, then cover with top halves of focaccia.
