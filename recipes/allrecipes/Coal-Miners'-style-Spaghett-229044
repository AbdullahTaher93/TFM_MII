Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan and stir in the pancetta. Cook until crispy. Set aside and keep warm. Cook the spaghetti until it is al dente, in 4 quarts of rapidly boiling, salted water. Reserve 2 tablespoons of spaghetti cooking water. Drain the spaghetti in a colander. Immediately return the spaghetti to the pot and, keeping the heat very low, rapidly stir in the eggs, reserved water, and half the cheese. Toss continuously until the eggs are gently cooked and the sauce is creamy. Add the reserved pancetta and any drippings. Stir well. Add a generous grinding of pepper. Transfer to a platter and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Serve immediately.
