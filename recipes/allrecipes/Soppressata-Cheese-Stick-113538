Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment or wax paper. In a food processor, work the soppressata with the Pecorino, mustard and water to a fine paste. Transfer the paste to a bowl. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the puff pastry 1/8 inch thick. Spread the soppressata paste evenly over the bottom half of the dough, leaving a 1/4-inch border on the sides. Fold the top half of the dough over to cover the paste and press the edges to seal. Using a rolling pin, lightly press the top and bottom together. Slide the puff pastry onto a lined baking sheet and chill until firm. Roll out the pastry a scant 1/8 inch thick and cut into 3 long 6-inch wide strips. Working with 1 strip at a time and keeping the others refrigerated, trim the pastry to a neat rectangle. Brush with the egg wash and sprinkle with one-third of the sesame seeds. Cut the dough crosswise into 3/4-inch-wide sticks and arrange them 1/2 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. Refrigerate until chilled. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bake the soppressata sticks for about 16 minutes, or until golden and crisp, shifting the pans halfway through baking. Serve warm or at room temperature.
