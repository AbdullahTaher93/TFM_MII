Remove the skin from the chicken. Rinse well and set aside. Wash hands thoroughly. In a large skillet over medium-heat, melt the butter and add the onion. Saute until almost translucent (about 1 or 2 minutes) stirring frequently. Add the chicken and cook for about 2 minutes on each side. Turn the pieces so that the bone side is down and the fleshy side is up (so that the meat does not over-cook and the bones can add some extra flavor). Then carefully add the chicken stock and then the paprika. Add a tiny pinch of salt and pepper (however, if you are using canned chicken stock, DO NOT add salt at this time - wait until after the sour cream and see if it is needed then). Stir lightly between chicken pieces to blend, until the liquids come to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for 40 minutes. Use aluminum foil if you do not have a cover. Turn the chicken over during the last 10 minutes of cooking. Remove chicken to serving platter, cover to keep warm (placing in a 180 degrees F oven is even better). Increase heat to boil and reduce the liquids to about 1/2 of a cup (5-8 minutes). Stir frequently and be sure to scrape up any brown bits stuck to the bottom of the skillet. When liquids are reduced, turn down the heat to low, add the sour cream and stir or whisk until it is well incorporated. Taste test to see if more salt is needed. Pour sauce over the chicken and garnish with the parsley. Chopped cilantro or chives are nice alternative garnishes. (If you do not have a fresh herb for a garnish then you can add a dried green herb before the reduction of the liquids.)
