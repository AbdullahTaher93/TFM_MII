Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Lightly brush a rimmed baking sheet and the chicken pieces with butter. Lay chicken, skin side up, on sheet; season with 2 teaspoons salt and the pepper. Roast chicken 20 minutes. Remove from oven. Carefully arrange shallots, cut side down, around chicken; season shallots with salt and pepper. Return to oven. Continue roasting, basting chicken occasionally with pan juices, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of the thigh (avoiding bone) registers 165 degrees F and shallots are tender and caramelized, about 20 minutes more. Transfer to a platter; loosely tent with foil. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
