Cook sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat, breaking meat apart into small pieces until completely browned, about 10 minutes. Drain, and remove sausage from the skillet. Chop cabbage into bite-sized pieces. Place into skillet, along with onion, carrots, celery, green onions, and garlic. Cook and stir vegetables over medium heat until bright but still crunchy, about 4 minutes. Add sausage and cook for 2 minutes more. Mix in soy sauce, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes until evenly combined, about 1 minute. Mix vegetable-sausage mixture evenly into a large bowl of cooked rice.
