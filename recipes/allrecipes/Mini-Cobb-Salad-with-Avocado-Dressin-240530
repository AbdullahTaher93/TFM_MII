Avocado Dressing: In a blender or mini-chopper, blend avocado, oil, lemon juice, garlic, cumin, salt, cayenne pepper and water, until smooth. Thin dressing with additional water if desired. Salad: Divide salad greens among individual plates. Place a mound of chicken in center of each. Arrange turkey-style bacon, tomatoes, egg wedges and red onion around chicken. Sprinkle with blue cheese. Drizzle with dressing just before serving.
