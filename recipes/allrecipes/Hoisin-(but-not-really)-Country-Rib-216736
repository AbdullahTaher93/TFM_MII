Heat the peanut oil in a large skillet over high heat. Brown the ribs evenly in the hot oil, about 5 minutes; remove from heat. Stir the tomato sauce, dried onion, hoisin sauce, and shiitake mushrooms together in a slow cooker. Add the ribs to the sauce mixture, turning to coat in the sauce. Cook on Low until the ribs are falling-apart tender, 8 to 10 hours.
