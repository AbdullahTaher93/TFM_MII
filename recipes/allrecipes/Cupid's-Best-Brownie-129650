Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line 13x9-inch baking pan with foil, with ends of foil extending over sides of pan. Grease foil. Microwave chocolate and butter in large microwaveable bowl on HIGH 2 min. or until butter is melted. Stir until chocolate is completely melted. Add sugar; mix well. Blend in eggs and vanilla. Stir in flour and walnuts until well blended. Spread batter into prepared pan. Bake 30 to 35 min. or until toothpick inserted in center comes out with fudgy crumbs. (Do not overbake.) Cool in pan. Lift brownies from pan onto cutting board, using foil handles. Cut into heart shapes using 2-inch cookie cutter. Reserve scraps for snacking or other use. (See Tip.) Decorate heart cutouts with the frosting and sprinkles.
