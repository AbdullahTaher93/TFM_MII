Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl, combine the mayonnaise, honey mustard and dill to make the honey mustard dill sauce. Place the bread slices side by side in a baking dish. Spread each slice with approximately 1 tbsp. sauce. Layer each slice with 1/4 of the cheese, cabbage and sausage. Bake for 10 minutes or until warmed through and the cheese has melted. Serve open-face style.
