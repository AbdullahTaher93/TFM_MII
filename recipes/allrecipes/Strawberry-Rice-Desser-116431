In a saucepan, combine the rice, 1-1/2 cups milk and salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender. In a microwave-safe bowl, sprinkle gelatin over remaining milk; let stand for 1 minute. Stir in sugar. Microwave on high for 45 seconds; stir. Let stand for 1 minute or until gelatin and sugar are completely dissolved. Stir into hot rice. Transfer to a bowl. Refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour. Fold in the whipped cream. Spoon into a 5-cup ring mold coated with non-stick cooking spray. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until firm. Meanwhile, drain the strawberries, reserving 1 cup juice. In a saucepan, combine cornstarch and reserved strawberry juice until smooth. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat; stir in lemon juice. Cool for 10 minutes. Add strawberries and stir to coat. Refrigerate until chilled. Invert rice mold onto a serving platter and unmold. Fill center with strawberry mixture. Garnish with mint if desired.
