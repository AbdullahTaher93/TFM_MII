Light charcoal briquettes or preheat broiler. In large non-reactive bowl, combine yogurt, rice vinegar, ginger, garlic, cumin, pie spice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; set aside. Pound chicken to 1/2-inch thickness; cut into 1-1/2-inch wide strips. Add chicken to yogurt mixture; toss to coat. Cover; refrigerate at least 20 minutes or up to 24 hours. Thread chicken onto skewers; spoon marinade over both sides of chicken. Discard any remaining marinade. Grill or broil chicken until no longer pink in center, about 3 to 4 minutes per side.
