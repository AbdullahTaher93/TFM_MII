Pound steaks to be 1/4 inch thick, and sprinkle each side with salt, black pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon mustard; rub into the meat. Melt margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry 2 of the steaks for 2 minutes on each side, and transfer to a hot serving plate. Repeat with remaining 2 steaks. Add lemon juice, chives, Worcestershire sauce, and remaining mustard to the pan, and bring to a boil. Return the steaks to the pan to heat through, and coat with sauce.
