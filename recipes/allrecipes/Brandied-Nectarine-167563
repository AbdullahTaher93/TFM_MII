Stir together brandy and sugar in a skillet large enough to hold the nectarines in a single layer. Add vanilla bean. Place nectarines cut-side down in the skillet and bring to a simmer over low heat. (Be careful working over a gas burner, as the warm brandy is quite flammable.) Cover the pan and simmer the nectarines until just tender when pierced with a skewer, 10 to 15 minutes. Check occasionally to be sure the nectarines are not sticking to the bottom of the pan. Remove the pan from the heat, uncover and let cool briefly; slip off and discard the nectarine skins if they come away easily. Transfer the nectarines cut-side up to a serving dish and spoon the syrup over the top. Serve warm.
