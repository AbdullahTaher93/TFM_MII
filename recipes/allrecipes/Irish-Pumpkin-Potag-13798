Halve the pumpkin and scrape out the seeds and pith. Cut into 1 inch pieces. In a large skillet, saute the pumpkin, leeks, onion and garlic in olive oil. Add chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Strain vegetables, place in food processor and blend until smooth. Transfer puree to pot or crock pot; add enough milk to reach smooth consistency. Add the cayenne pepper, paprika, ground pepper and nutmeg; simmer for 30 minutes and do not allow to boil.
