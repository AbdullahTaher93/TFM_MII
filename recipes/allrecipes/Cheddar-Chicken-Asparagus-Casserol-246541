Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange chicken in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer asparagus over chicken. Melt margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and mushrooms; cook and stir until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add cream of mushroom soup, Cheddar cheese, evaporated milk, soy sauce, pimento peppers, flavor enhancer, black pepper, and hot pepper sauce; stir until smooth. Pour mixture over asparagus; top with almonds. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 30 minutes.
