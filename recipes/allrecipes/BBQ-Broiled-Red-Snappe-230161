Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and lightly coat with cooking spray. Combine mayonnaise, lemon juice, and barbeque sauce in a bowl. Place red snapper fillets on the prepared baking sheet and season with salt. Spread half the mayonnaise mixture over the top of each fillet and sprinkle with cayenne pepper. Cook under the preheated broil until top is browned and bubbling and fish flakes easily with a fork, rotating the baking sheet if necessary, about 7 minutes.
