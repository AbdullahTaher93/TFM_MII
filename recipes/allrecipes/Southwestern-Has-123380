In a skillet, cook bacon until crisp. Drain, reserving 2 tablespoons drippings; set the bacon aside. In the drippings, saute onion and garlic until tender. Stir in hash browns and chilies. Cook and stir over low heat for 20 minutes or until lightly browned and heated through. Just before serving, add tomato. Spoon onto plates; top with eggs and bacon. Serve with salsa.
