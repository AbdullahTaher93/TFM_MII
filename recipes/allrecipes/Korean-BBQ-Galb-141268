Place the ribs in a large stockpot and cover with cold water. Soak ribs, refrigerated, for 1 hour to pull out any blood. Drain. Combine garlic, onion, and Asian pear in a blender and puree. Pour into a large bowl and stir in the soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, sesame oil, and black pepper. Marinate ribs in the soy mixture, covered, overnight. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Grill ribs until the meat is tender and the outside is crusty, 5 to 10 minutes per side.
