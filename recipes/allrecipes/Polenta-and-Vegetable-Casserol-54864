Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a 9x13 inch baking dish. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, green pepper, eggplant, and mushrooms in oil until soft. Mix in fajita seasoning. Line prepared baking dish with slices of polenta. Spread beans and corn evenly over the polenta, and then spread onion mixture over the beans. Top with salsa, mozzarella cheese and black olives. Bake until heated through, about 20 minutes.
