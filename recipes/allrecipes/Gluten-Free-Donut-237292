Heat oil in a deep fryer or in a large saucepan to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Beat coconut milk, all-purpose flour, egg, almond flour, coconut flour, honey, and guar gum together in a bowl using a hand blender until batter resembles thick pancake batter. Drop batter by rounded spoonfuls, working in batches, into the hot oil; fry until donuts are dark brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove donuts with a slotted spoon. Pour confectioners' sugar into a shallow bowl. Roll donuts in confectioners' sugar until coated.
