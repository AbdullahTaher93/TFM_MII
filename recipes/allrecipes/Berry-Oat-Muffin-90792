In a bowl with a mixer on high speed, beat 1/2 cup butter and the sugar until well blended. Beat in egg and yogurt. Add flour, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon. Mix on low speed until incorporated. Stir in oats. Add raspberries and stir gently to distribute evenly; batter will be stiff. Fill 12 buttered muffin cups (each 2-1/2 in. wide) equally with batter. Bake in a 350 degree F oven until muffins are browned, 25 to 30 minutes (20 to 25 minutes in a convection oven). Let cool about 5 minutes in pan, remove, and serve warm or cool.
