In a large microwave safe bowl, heat margarine and marshmallows at HIGH for 3 minutes, stirring after 2 minutes. Stir in vanilla. Stir in KELLOGG'S* RICE KRISPIES* cereal until well coated. Using lightly buttered spatula, press into buttered 3.5 L (13 x 9-inch) pan. Allow mixture to cool slightly. Using a heart shaped cookie cutter, cut cereal mixture into heart shapes. Decorate with icing and candy as desired, using prepared frosting to hold the candy in place.
