Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine the chicken, mushroom soup, chicken soup, nacho cheese soup, process cheese food and chili powder to taste. Spread a layer of tortilla chips in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Spread the mixture over the chips and top with the remaining chips. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 45 minutes, or until all the cheese is melted and bubbly.
