Roll out dough on a lightly-floured work surface to 1/2-inch thickness. Transfer to a baking sheet. Pierce dough several times with a fork. Spread olive oil over dough evenly with a pastry brush or by hand. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let stand, 1 hour to overnight. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Sprinkle dough with thyme and salt. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
