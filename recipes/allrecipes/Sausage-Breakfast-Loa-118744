In a large skillet, saute the sausage; cool. In a bowl, combine the sausage, cheese, one egg, parsley, onion salt and garlic salt; mix well. Unroll pizza dough; roll into a 12-in. x 8-in. rectangle. Spread sausage mixture down the center of dough. Bring dough over filling; pinch seams to seal. Place seam side down on a greased baking sheet; tuck ends under. Beat remaining egg; brush over top. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand for 5 minutes before slicing.
