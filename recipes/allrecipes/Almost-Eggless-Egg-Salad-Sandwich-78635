In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, sweet pickle relish, vinegar, mustard, turmeric, dill, and parsley. Mix well, and reserve. Place drained tofu in large bowl, and crumble with a fork. Stir in onion and celery. Mix in reserved mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Chill for several hours to allow flavors to blend. Spoon a generous 1/2 cup of the salad onto slices of toasted wheat bread. Top with lettuce, tomato, red onion, cucumber, and remaining slices of bread.
