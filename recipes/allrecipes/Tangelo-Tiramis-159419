Remove peel and white pith from tangelos and cut sections from membranes. Place sections in medium bowl. Squeeze juice from membranes into small bowl. Beat sugar, cream cheese, and mascarpone until smooth in medium bowl. Split ladyfingers lengthwise in half. Pour half of the tangelo juice into pie plate or shallow dish. Dip flat sides of half of the ladyfingers into juice. Arrange flat-side up in 8" x 8" baking dish. Spread half of the cheese mixture over top and cover with half of the tangelo sections. Repeat with remaining juice, ladyfingers (place flat-side down on fruit), cheese mixture, and fruit. Cover with plastic wrap and chill 2 to 24 hours to allow flavors to blend.
