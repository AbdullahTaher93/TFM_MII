Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spiral pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 12 minutes; drain. Fry bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crisp, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels and crumble. Reserve about 2 tablespoons of bacon grease. Wilt spinach in the skillet with reserved bacon grease over medium heat, 2 to 3 minutes. Toss cooked pasta with 1/3 cup Italian-style dressing in a large bowl; stir bacon, spinach, and green onions into coated pasta. Stir creamy Italian-style dressing, tomatoes, and olives into pasta mixture. Chill in refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight.
