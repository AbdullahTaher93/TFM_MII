Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 2-quart casserole dish with cooking spray. Stir beef broth, brown rice, carrots, milk, mushrooms, cream of chicken soup, and butter in a bowl until well combined. Pour mixture into prepared casserole dish. Bake uncovered in preheated oven until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 1 hour.
