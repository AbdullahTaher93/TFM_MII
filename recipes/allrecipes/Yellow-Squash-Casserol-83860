Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x9 inch baking dish. In a saucepan, boil sliced squash in enough water to cover for 10 minutes. Remove squash to paper towels. Dab off excess moisture. In a medium bowl, beat eggs together with wine. Add squash and cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Then pour mixture into a baking dish. Bake in a preheated oven for 1 hour.
