Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add millet and cook until half of the water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Add butternut squash and salt carefully to the millet and simmer until millet and squash are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Mash the squash using a potato masher until mixture becomes the texture of porridge.
