In a 1 1/2- to 2-quart fondue pan or a heavy-bottom metal pan over medium heat, warm 1 cup milk until bubbles form and slowly rise to surface, about 6 minutes. In a bowl, mix jack cheese, cheddar cheese, cornstarch, and cumin. Add cheese mixture, a handful at a time, to hot milk, stirring until fondue is smoothly melted and beginning to bubble. Stir in diced chilies. Set pan over an ignited alcohol or canned solid-fuel flame. (If pan is ceramic, place a heat diffuser between it and heat source.) Adjust heat so fondue bubbles very slowly. Stir across bottom often to prevent scorching; if it gets too hot, reduce or turn off heat, then resume heating when mixture begins to cool. To eat, spear bread cubes, vegetables, and sausages one at a time and swirl through fondue. If fondue gets too thick for easy dipping, stir in more heated milk, a few tablespoons at a time.
