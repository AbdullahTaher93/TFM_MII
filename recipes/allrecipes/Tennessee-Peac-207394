Do ahead: In a blender, puree entire can of peaches. Transfer peach puree to a separate bowl/pitcher. Keep chilled. Rinse blender bowl and return to base. (Makes enough to prepare the recipe 3 times, for 6 servings.) To make 2 cocktail drinks: Juice two limes and pour lime juice into blender bowl. Add whiskey, 5 ounces peach puree and sugar. Fill a serving glass with ice, then add ice to blender and repeat, adding another glass of ice. Blend until smooth. Pour into two 14-ounce cocktail glasses. Garnish with whipped cream, if desired.
