Place the water, bell peppers, cabbage, cauliflower, and onion in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cover and steam until the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Pound each piece of the chuck to 1/2 inch thick, cut into quarters. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in beef, and cook, turning frequently, until browned on all sides; remove from pan. Drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil into the pan and stir in the orange sections, zest, and green onion. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Toss meat and vegetables together with the orange in the pan. Stir in teriyaki and oyster sauce. Continue cooking for an additional minute, stirring constantly.
