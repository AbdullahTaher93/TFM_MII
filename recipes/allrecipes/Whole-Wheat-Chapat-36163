Sift together flour and salt in a bowl. Stir in olive oil and water, and then knead until firm and elastic. Divide into four balls, and roll as flat as possible with a rolling pin. Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook the chapati on both sides until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. If desired, sprinkle with additional olive oil before serving.
