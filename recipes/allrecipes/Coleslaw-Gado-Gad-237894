Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread almonds onto a baking sheet. Bake almonds in the preheated oven until toasted and fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove baking sheet from oven and cool almonds. Combine cabbage, carrots, red bell pepper, and red onion in a large bowl. Whisk olive oil, vinegar, peanut butter, maple syrup, tamari, ginger, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, and salt together in a bowl until dressing is smooth; pour over cabbage mixture and toss to coat. Refrigerate salad until chilled and flavors blend, about 2 hours. Stir toasted almonds and chow mein noodles into salad.
