Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (225 degrees C). Arrange the snapper fillets in a single layer in the bottom of a lightly greased shallow baking dish. In a medium bowl, stir together the mandarin orange juice, lime juice, brown sugar, soy sauce and sesame oil. Mix in the red pepper flakes, ginger and chopped mandarin oranges. Pour over the snapper in the dish. Bake uncovered for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until fish is opaque. Transfer fillets to serving plates and spoon the sauce over them. Garnish with a sprinkle of cashews and green onion.
