Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir rice in the melted butter until rice is lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir bell pepper and onion into rice and cook until bell pepper is softened and onion is translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Break the ground beef into the rice mixture; cook and stir until beef is completely browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir tomato sauce and diced tomatoes into ground beef mixture. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
