Place the tofu on a pie plate. Weight a second plate on top of the tofu with a heavy can or two and press for at least 15 minutes. Drain the excess water. Place the drained tofu on its side and cut into three equal squares, then in half into triangles. Cut each triangle in half again to make 12. Pat dry and set aside. In a small bowl, whisk together the brown rice syrup, shoyu, sake, apple juice, and toasted sesame oil. Heat the remaining oil in a large nonstick skillet. Add the tofu and saute on each side, about 2 minutes. Add the sauce and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is syrupy and coats the tofu, about 15 minutes.
