In a large bowl, combine the cookie crumbs and 1 cup (250 mL) of the confectioners' sugar. In a medium bowl, whisk together the honey and peanut butter until well combined. Add the honey mixture to the cookie crumb mixture and stir until well combined. The mixture may be crumbly at this point. With your hands, shape the mixture into 36 1-inch (2.5-cm) balls. The mixture should hold together as you shape it. Set the balls aside at room temperature until ready to serve or store them in an air-tight container at room temperature for 2 to 3 days. Just before serving, roll each ball in the remaining 2 tablespoons (25 mL) of confectioners' sugar.
