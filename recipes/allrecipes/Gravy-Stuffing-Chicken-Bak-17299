Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Shred or tear the chicken into bite size pieces. Try to get most off the whole chicken as possible, or as much as you think you can handle. Place torn chicken in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Mix corn and carrots around with the chicken, then pour chicken gravy and turkey gravy on top and mix. Sprinkle stuffing over top to cover.. Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for about 30 minutes, or until golden brown.
