Combine walnuts and onions in a food processor; process until mixture is finely chopped. Transfer to a shallow bowl. Cut goat cheese crosswise into 12 slices. Press each slice into walnut mixture, turning and patting to coat. Place on a foil-lined baking sheet. (At this point, goat cheese may be covered and refrigerated up to 4 hours before baking.) Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Bake goat cheese for 5 minutes. Turn oven to broil; broil 5 to 6 inches from heat source for 2 to 3, minutes or until golden brown. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together oil, honey and vinegar; set aside. In a large bowl, combine greens, bell pepper, oranges and olives. Add oil mixture; toss well and arrange on four serving plates. Transfer goat cheese to salad; top each round of goat cheese with a dollop of Olivada.
