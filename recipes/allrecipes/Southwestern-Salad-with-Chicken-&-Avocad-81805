Mix together the oil, lime juice, cumin and minced jalapeno. I like to put the dressing ingredients in a small jar and then shake it to mix it up. In a large bowl, combine the lettuce, cilantro and onion rings. Toss with a little bit of the dressing, just enough to lightly coat. To neatly slice the avocado, try this method: Cut the avocado in half and remove the pit. With a thin knife, slice through the avocado down the center; all the way through the flesh but not through the skin. Then make a slice on either side; evenly spaced Holding the ends with your thumbs, roll back the skin (turning it inside out) and let the avocado slices fall gently out (you may need to cut the wedges from the skin). Repeat with the other half. This will make 8 slices. Divided the greens onto 4 serving plates. Arrange the chicken, avocado, olives and bell peppers. Drizzle some more dressing over the top and serve.
