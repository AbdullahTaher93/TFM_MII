Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Stir oat flour with all-purpose flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, allspice and salt to combine. Use an electric mixer, on medium speed, to beat sugar with ketchup and oil for 2 minutes. Add egg, molasses and vanilla; beat just until combined. Reduce the mixer speed to low; gradually add the flour mixture and mix until well-blended. Scoop dough by rounded spoonfuls (about 1 1/2 tbsp each); form into balls and roll in additional sugar to coat. Place 2-inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown on the edges and cracked on top. Cool for 2 minutes on the baking sheet; transfer to a rack to cool completely.
