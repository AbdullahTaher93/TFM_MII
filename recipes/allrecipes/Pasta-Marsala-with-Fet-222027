Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, garlic, and basil in the hot oil until onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Stir snap peas into onion mixture and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour chicken stock, Marsala wine, and white wine into skillet. Add penne pasta; cook and stir until liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Divide pasta and snap pea mixture into 2 bowls and sprinkle with crumbled feta cheese to serve.
