Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Boil fiddlehead ferns for 10 minutes; drain. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir red pepper, yellow pepper, and garlic until peppers begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir fiddleheads into the skillet, and continue to cook and stir until fiddleheads are tender, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
