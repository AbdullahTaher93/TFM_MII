In a large skillet, brown and stir sausage until the meat is crumbled and no longer pink; drain. In a small bowl, combine cooked sausage, cream cheese and Parmesan cheese. Spoon mixture into prepared peppers. Arrange filled peppers on an ungreased baking pan. Bake in a preheated 400 degrees F oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned.
