In a medium saucepan, bring 4 cups of water to boil. Add rice, stir with a fork to ensure rice is level and covered in water. Cover and reduce heat to low and allow to simmer for about 20 minutes. (As a quicker option, 2 cups of white instant rice prepared according to directions). Heat 4 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet. Once olive oil is heated place onion slices across the bottom of the skillet. Season pork chops with the garlic salt and pepper. Place pork chops over onions and cover skillet with a lid. Cook for 20 minutes. Pour HERDEZ(R) Salsa Verde over pork chops and simmer for 5 minutes. Serve.
