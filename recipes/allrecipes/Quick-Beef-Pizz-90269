Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place beef in a skillet over medium heat, and cook until evenly brown. Drain grease. Spread cream of mushroom soup over the pizza crust. Layer cooked beef over the soup, and top with cheese. Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until cheese is melted and pizza is heated through.
