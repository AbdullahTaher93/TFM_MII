Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir walnuts in the hot skillet until toasted and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Mix olive oil, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; add kale and chickpeas and toss to coat. Spread kale and chickpeas mixture onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until kale is wilted and slightly crunchy, about 25 minutes. Toss kale and chickpeas mixture, walnuts, parsley, and lemon juice together in a bowl.
