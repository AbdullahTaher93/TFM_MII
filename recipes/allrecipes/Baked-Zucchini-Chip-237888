Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place zucchini in a bowl. Drizzle olive oil over zucchini and stir to coat; add bread crumbs and toss to coat. Spread coated zucchini onto a baking sheet. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese and oregano over coated zucchini. Bake in the preheated oven until zucchini are tender and cheese is browned, about 15 minutes.
