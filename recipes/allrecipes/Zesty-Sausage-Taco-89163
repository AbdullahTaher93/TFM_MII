Crumble sausage into medium skillet; cook over medium-high heat until browned, stirring occasionally. Drain off any drippings. Stir in taco sauce. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer 5 minutes. To assemble tacos, place 2 tablespoons sausage mixture in each taco shell and top evenly with cheese, onion, tomatoes and lettuce. Serve hot. Refrigerate any leftover filling.
