Arrange cucumber slices in a large bowl, generously seasoning each layer of cucumber with salt and pepper. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 3 hours. Drain liquid from cucumbers. Gently press cucumber slices with paper towel to absorb any remaining liquid. Stir half-and-half, sour cream, mayonnaise, green onions, ranch dressing mix, sugar, dill, celery salt, and lime juice together in a small bowl; pour over cucumber slices and gently stir to coat.
