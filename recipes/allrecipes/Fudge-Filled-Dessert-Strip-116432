In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and cream cheese. Gradually add the flour. Turn onto lightly floured surface; knead until smooth, about 3 minutes. Divide dough into fourths; cover and refrigerate for 1-2 hours or until easy to handle. In a heavy saucepan, melt the chocolate chips and milk. Stir in the walnuts. Cool to room temperature. Roll out each portion of dough onto an ungreased baking sheet into an 11-in. x 6-1/2-in. rectangle. Spread 3/4 cup chocolate filling down the center; press to seal all edges. Turn over so seam side is down. Bake at 350 degrees F for 27-32 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool. Cut into 1/2-in. slices. Dust with confectioners' sugar if desired.
