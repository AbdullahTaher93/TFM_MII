Preheat greased grill on medium-high. Set aside 1/3 cup of the dressing for salad. Brush remaining dressing lightly over one side of steak and insides of peppers. Grill steak and peppers 10 min., turning steak after 5 min. (peppers do not need turning) until medium doneness (160 degrees F). Meanwhile, arrange greens, tomatoes and onion on four serving plates. Cut steak across grain into thin slices and peppers into strips; arrange over greens. Drizzle reserved 1/3 cup dressing over salads.
