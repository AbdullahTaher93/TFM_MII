Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Dip chicken in egg, then bread crumbs, coating well. Arrange chicken in 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake 20 minutes. Top chicken with prosciutto, then 1-1/2 cups pasta sauce. Top with mozzarella cheese. Bake an additional 10 minutes or until chicken is thoroughly cooked. Serve over hot spaghetti tossed with remaining heated sauce. Sprinkle, if desired, with Parmesan cheese shavings.
