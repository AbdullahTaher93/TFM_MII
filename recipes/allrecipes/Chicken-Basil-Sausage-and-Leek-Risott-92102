Remove the roots and green top of leek. Slice in half lengthwise and rinse well under running water, removing any loose soil without separating the layers too much. Chop leek into 1/4-inch pieces to make 1/2 cup. Reserve any leftover parts of leek for another use. In a 2- to 3-quart pan over medium heat, combine butter and chopped leek. Stir until leek is limp, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add sausage and rice, and saute for another 2 minutes. Add wine and cook until wine is absorbed, about 1 minute. Add 1 cup broth, and cook rice over medium heat until all the liquid is absorbed. Continue to add hot broth, 1/2 cup at a time, until all the broth is used and rice is tender to bite, about 15 minutes. Add cheese, stir to combine, and spoon into wide bowls to serve.
