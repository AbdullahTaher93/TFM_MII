In large bowl cream together shortening and confectioners' sugar. Beat in uncooked egg yolks and hard-boiled eggs. Gradually blend in flour. Cover dough and chill for 8 hours or overnight. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and lightly grease two cookie sheets. Roll out dough on floured surface to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into pencil thick strips about 6 to 8 inches long. For each cookie, braid three strips and form into a circle pinching ends together. Place cookies 1 inch apart on cookie sheets. Brush with the beaten eggwhites. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until lightly colored. Cool on wire racks.
