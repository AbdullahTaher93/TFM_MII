In a stockpot, bring the water to a boil with the wine, onion, tomato, carrot, zucchini, squash, leek, white mushrooms, thyme, rosemary, garlic, bay leaf, celery seeds, peppercorns and 1 teaspoon of salt. Reduce the heat to moderately low and simmer for 40 minutes. Strain the stock into a large heatproof bowl. Transfer 4 cups of the stock to a small saucepan and freeze the rest for another use. Bring the reserved stock to a simmer and keep hot. In a heavy, medium saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add the shallots and cook over moderately high heat, stirring constantly for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the rice, chile powder and bay leaf and cook, stirring for 2 minutes. Add 1 cup of the hot stock and cook, stirring frequently, until it is nearly absorbed. Continue adding stock, 1/2 cup at a time, and stirring constantly until it is nearly absorbed before adding more. The risotto is done when the rice is tender and the liquid is creamy. Meanwhile, in a medium nonstick skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the shiitakes and brown over moderately high heat, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir the shiitakes, cream, butter and cheese into the risotto. Season with salt and pepper and serve.
