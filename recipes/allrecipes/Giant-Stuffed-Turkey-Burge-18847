Preheat grill to medium-high and lightly oil grate. In a medium bowl, combine the turkey, oats, egg, garlic powder and pepper. Mix well, then divide mixture in half. On two pieces of wax paper, shape each half of the turkey mixture into a 6-inch diameter patty. Sprinkle one patty of turkey mixture with onions and relish, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the outside edges; top with ketchup and mustard. Over the ketchup and mustard, arrange cheese strips in a wheel-spoke fashion. Carefully place remaining turkey mixture patty on top of the cheese and remove the top layer of wax paper. Press the edges of the two patties together, to seal. Invert the giant burger onto the heated grill and remove wax paper; To turn burger, slide a flat cookie sheet underneath and invert onto another flat cookie sheet, then slide back onto grill rack. Grill for 8 minutes per side, or until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F (75 degrees C). To serve, cut burger into fourths and serve with lettuce leaves and tomato slices.
