In a bow, beat eggs; add cheese. Pour half into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Spoon the picante sauce over top. Top with remaining egg mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand for 15 minutes. Cut into 1-in. squares. Serve warm on crackers. Refrigerate any leftovers.
