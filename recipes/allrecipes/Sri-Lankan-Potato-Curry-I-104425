Combine the potatoes, salt, coconut cream, green chiles, curry leaves, cayenne pepper, saffron powder, garlic, and water in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the coconut cream thickens, about 15 to 20 minutes. Test the potatoes for doneness by piercing them with the tip of a paring knife. When the potatoes are tender, remove the pan from the heat. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving. Serve with plain rice.
