Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and run under cold water to cool. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, green bell pepper, and garlic until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add chicken and garbanzo beans to onion mixture; cook and stir until warmed, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix spinach and eggs into chicken mixture; cook and stir until eggs are set and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Place pasta in a serving bowl and top with egg mixture. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and feta cheese over egg mixture.
