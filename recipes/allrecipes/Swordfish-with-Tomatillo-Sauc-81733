In a food processor bowl, add the tomatillos, jalapeno, cilantro, chicken stock and lemon juice. Process until smooth. In a skillet over medium-high heat, add the canola oil, onions and garlic. Saute for 1 or 2 minutes until the onions start to become translucent. Add the tomatillo mixture and cook just until it comes to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Taste test. Add salt and pepper as needed. Meanwhile, season the swordfish with a dash of salt and the lemon pepper on each side. Grill or broil the swordfish steaks for about 4 minutes per side. Fish should be firm to the touch. Serve immediately with the tomatillo sauce poured over the swordfish.
