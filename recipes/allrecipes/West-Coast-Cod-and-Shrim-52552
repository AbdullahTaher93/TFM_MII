In a medium saucepan, bring water to a boil. Stir in the rice, reduce heat, and cover. Simmer 20 minutes, until water has been absorbed. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a medium baking dish with the olive oil. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, and saute the onion and garlic until tender. Stir in the heavy cream. In a small bowl, mix the milk and cornstarch, and stir into the saucepan to thicken the heavy cream mixture. Remove from heat, stir in the shrimp and mushrooms, and season with dill, seasoning salt, and pepper. Arrange cod in the prepared baking dish. Pour the heavy cream mixture over the cod. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and parsley. Cover, and bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until sauce is bubbly and fish is easily flaked with a fork. Serve over the rice.
