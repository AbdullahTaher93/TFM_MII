In a shallow bowl or pie plate, combine orange juice, orange peel, SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend, shallot, garlic, and ginger. Add chicken and toss to coat. Cover and marinate, turning frequently, for at least 30 minutes. Preheat broiler and coat broiler pan with non-stick cooking spray. Remove chicken from marinade, and reserve the marinade. Place chicken on prepared pan and sprinkle with salt. Broil chicken for 12 minutes, turning once, or until a thermometer inserted into chicken reads 160 degrees F and juices run clear. Meanwhile, bring marinade to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Place chicken on 4 plates and top with marinade. Garnish with orange slices, if desired.
