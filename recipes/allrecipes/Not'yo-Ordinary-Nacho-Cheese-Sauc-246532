Heat oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk in flour to form a thick paste. Whisk in 3/4 cup milk; cook and stir until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir Cheddar cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream into milk mixture until smooth, about 1 minute. Add remaining milk, diced tomatoes, chili powder, cumin, and paprika; cook and stir until thickened to sauce consistency, about 5 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.
