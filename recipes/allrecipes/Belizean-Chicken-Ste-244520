Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Season chicken with seasoned salt. Cook chicken in the hot oil until browned on the outside, about 5 minutes per side. Mix chicken broth, cabbage, onion, carrots, green bell pepper, celery, cilantro, tomato sauce, lime juice, garlic, hot sauce, salt, and black pepper into chicken and simmer, adding water if needed, until stew is thickened, about 2 hours. Ladle stew into bowls and top each with a piece of chicken.
