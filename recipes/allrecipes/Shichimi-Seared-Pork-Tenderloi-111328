Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it begins to smoke. Meanwhile, mix the white and black sesame seeds together with the togarashi powder; set aside. Season the tenderloins with salt, then press into sesame mixture until completely coated. Sear the tenderloins on all sides until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Transfer the tenderloins to a baking sheet, and bake in preheated oven until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 20 to 25 minutes. When done, remove pork, and allow to rest for five minutes in a warm place. While pork is roasting, prepare sauce by simmering the shallots, ginger, lime juice, and wine in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until it has reduced to about 2 tablespoons of liquid. Add the cream, and continue to simmer until it has reduced by half. Pour mixture into a blender, along with soy sauce and miso. Blend on low speed for 10 seconds until pureed, then slowly add butter, a few cubes at a time with blender running until it is incorporated. Season to taste with salt, and keep in a warm place until ready to use. To serve, slice the tenderloin into medallions, and pour warm sauce overtop; serve immediately.
