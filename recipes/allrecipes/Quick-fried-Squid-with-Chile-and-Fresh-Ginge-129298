Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Add the rice and boil until tender, 10 to 12 minutes, or according to the package directions. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a wok or heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat. Add the chiles, garlic, and ginger to release their flavor, about 2 minutes. Toss in the pepper, corn, and broccoli flowerets, and stir-fry until the broccoli is almost tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the squid and stir-fry until they are just firm and opaque, 1 to 2 minutes. Spoon in the soy sauce and 2 tablespoons water and scatter the scallions over. Simmer until bubbling, then serve immediately with the drained rice.
