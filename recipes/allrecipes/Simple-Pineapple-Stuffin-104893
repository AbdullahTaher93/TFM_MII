Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13 inch glass baking dish with vegetable cooking spray. Stir together, drained pineapple, milk, sugar, and eggs in a large bowl; mix well. Gently fold bread cubes in, until well moistened. Pour mixture into prepared dish. Bake in preheated oven until lightly golden on top, 25 to 30 minutes.
