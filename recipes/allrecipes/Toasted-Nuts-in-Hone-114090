Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the mixed nuts on a medium rimmed baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes, or until lightly toasted. Transfer the nuts to a plate. Let cool. Pour half of the honey into a 12-ounce clear-glass jar or into two 6-ounce jars. Add the nuts and top with the remaining honey. Seal the jar.
