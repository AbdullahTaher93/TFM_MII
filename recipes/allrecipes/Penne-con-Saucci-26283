Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and return to pan. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. To the sausage add the tomatoes, basil, parsley, crushed red pepper, salt and garlic. Stir in mushrooms and pasta sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Stir in cooked pasta and top with Parmesan cheese.
