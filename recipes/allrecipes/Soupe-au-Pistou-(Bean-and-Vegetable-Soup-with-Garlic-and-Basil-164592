Pistou Method: Puree 2 cups basil and garlic in a food processor. With the machine running, slowly add the olive oil, continuing until the mixture becomes pasty. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside. Soup Method: Drain the beans and set aside. Heat the olive oil in a saucepan and saute the onion until browned. Place the stock, tomatoes, sauteed onions, and herbes de Provence in a large stockpot. Bring to a rolling boil, for 2 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer, for 1 hour. Add the beans, macaroni, potatoes, carrots, zucchini and green peas and continue to simmer for 20 minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Remove from heat and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve in individual bowls, with a dollop of pistou, a sprinkling of Parmesan and a sprig of fresh basil.
