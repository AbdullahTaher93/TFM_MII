Preheat the broiler. In a medium bowl, mix Colby cheese, mayonnaise, green onions and black olives. Spread cocktail rye bread slices with butter. Top with equal amounts of the Colby cheese mixture. Arrange cocktail rye slices in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Broil in the preheated oven 5 to 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted and lightly browned.
