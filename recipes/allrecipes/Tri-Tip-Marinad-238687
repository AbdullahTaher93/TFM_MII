Combine lemon-lime soda, soy sauce, onions, lemons, and garlic in a large pot; add roast. Marinate roast in the refrigerator at least 24 hours. Preheat grill to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Remove the roast from the marinade and shake to remove excess moisture. Discard the remaining marinade. Cook roast on the grill until desired doneness and an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C) are reached, at least 30 minutes.
