Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl. In another bowl, whisk the egg, applesauce, and melted butter; stir into dry ingredients just until combined. Fold in the cranberries. Fill greased or paper lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely. In a small bowl, combine the confectioners' sugar and milk and whisk until smooth. Drizzle icing over the cupcakes.
