Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain water, reserving 1 cup pasta water. Melt butter in a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat; add zucchini, 3 cloves minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir zucchini mixture in the melted butter until most of the moisture has evaporated, 10 to 15 minutes. Heat olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add cherry tomatoes, remaining 2 cloves minced garlic, salt, and pepper to onion; cook and stir, crushing tomatoes to desired consistency, until heated through, about 5 minutes. Mix fettuccine and zucchini mixture into onion mixture, adding as much reserved pasta water to keep pasta moist. Stir goat cheese and basil into pasta mixture.
