Cook tortellini according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, combine the Alfredo sauce, vegetables and ham. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender. Drain tortellini; add to sauce. Stir in Parmesan cheese; heat through. Sprinkle with parsley.
