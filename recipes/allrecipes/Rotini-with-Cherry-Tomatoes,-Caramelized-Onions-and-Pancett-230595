Bring a large pot of water to a boil. In a large skillet cook pancetta until its rendered and crispy. Remove from skillet and drain on a paper towel. Add olive oil to the same skillet and caramelize the onions, about 5-6 minutes over medium heat. Add tomatoes and saute for 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Cook pasta 1 minute less than the package directions. Drain pasta reserving 1 cup cooking water. Add cooking water to sauce and bring to a simmer. Add pasta to sauce and toss. Remove from heat and toss with half the pancetta and half the cheese. Top with the remaining pancetta and cheese then serve.
