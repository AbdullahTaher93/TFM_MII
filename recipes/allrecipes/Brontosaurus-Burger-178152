Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate. Place the torn-up bread into a large bowl, and mix with the egg. Lightly mix in the ground chuck, ground sirloin, onion soup mix, Worcestershire sauce, steak seasoning sauce, hot sauce, and salt and pepper. Form the meat mixture into 6 large patties, 6 inches across by 1 inch thick. Place the burgers on the preheated grill, and cook 10 to 15 minutes per side, until the burgers are browned and no longer pink in the middle. Brush each burger with barbecue sauce, flip them and grill for 5 minutes to slightly char the sauce. Brush the other sides with sauce, flip, and grill for 5 more minutes to cook the other side.
