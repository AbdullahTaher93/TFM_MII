Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix flour, chia seeds, 1 1/2 teaspoons seasoned salt, and sea salt in a bowl; stir in water until dough is completely combined. Form dough into thin bite-size rounds and arrange on a baking sheet. Sprinkle rounds with seasoned salt. Bake in the preheated oven until crisp, about 15 minutes. Cool completely and store in an airtight container or resealable bag.
