To make Parmesan Wafers: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with nonstick pad. Stir together cheese and flour in a bowl. Make 4 mounds (about 3 tablespoons each) about 5 inches apart on baking sheet and spread each mound to form a 4- to 5-inch round. Bake until golden, about 10 minutes. Cool 2 minutes on baking sheet on a rack, then carefully transfer each wafer (they are very delicate) with a wide metal spatula to rack to cool completely. Stir cheese in bowl (to redistribute flour) and make 4 more wafers in same manner. To make roasted tomato soup: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat to 350 degrees F. Arrange tomatoes, cut sides up, in 1 layer in a large shallow baking pan and add garlic to pan. Drizzle tomatoes with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast tomatoes and garlic 1 hour, then cool in pan on a rack. Peel garlic. Cook onion, oregano, and sugar in butter in a 6- to 8-quart heavy pot over moderately low heat, stirring frequently, until onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, garlic, and stock and simmer, covered, 20 minutes. Puree soup in batches in a blender (use caution when blending hot liquids), then force through a sieve into cleaned pot, discarding solids. Stir in cream and salt and pepper to taste and simmer 2 minutes. Divide soup among 8 bowls and float 1 wafer in center of each.
