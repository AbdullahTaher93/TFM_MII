Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add 6 tomatoes. Boil tomatoes until skin starts to peel, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove tomatoes with a slotted spoon and place in a bowl of ice water until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes. Peel skin, cut in half, and remove seeds. Blend seeded tomatoes in a blender until smooth. Heat olive oil in a skillet over high heat. Cook and stir 2 cloves garlic until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add pureed tomatoes, cilantro, and lemon zest; bring to a boil, lower heat, cover, and simmer about 1 hour. Place 3 diced tomatoes, green bell pepper, mangoes, onion, and 2 cloves garlic in a large bowl. Pour tomato mixture into bowl; stir to coat. Add lemon juice, vinegar, and habanero peppers; mix well. Chill in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
