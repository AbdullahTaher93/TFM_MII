Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain, then rinse with cold water. Meanwhile, prepare the filling: Remove chard stems; finely chop and set aside. Cut leaves crosswise into strips and set aside. In a medium frying pan, cook onion and garlic in olive oil over medium heat until translucent, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Add chard stems and stir often until softened, about 2 minutes more. Increase heat to medium-high and add chard leaves (pan will be full). Stir often until all leaves are wilted and water evaporates, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. In a medium bowl, stir ricotta, half the Parmesan, and chard mixture to combine. Spread 1 cup marinara on bottom of a 9- by 13-inch baking dish. Fill each pasta shell with 1 tablespoon. chard mixture and arrange in a single layer in baking dish. Top with the remaining marinara, mozzarella, and remaining parmesan. Bake until cheese melts and shells are heated through, about 25 minutes.
