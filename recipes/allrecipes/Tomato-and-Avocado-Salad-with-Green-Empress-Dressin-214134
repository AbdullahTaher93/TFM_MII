To make the dressing, puree all of the dressing ingredients in a blender or food processor until smooth. Alternate the tomato slices, avocado wedges and mozzarella slices on a serving platter or 6 individual plates. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle half the dressing over salad and garnish with lemon wedges. Serve the remaining dressing on the side.
