Preheat barbecue grill. If using charcoal, cover firegrate with a single, solid layer of ignited coals. Let coals burn down until you can hold your hand at grill level for only 2 to 3 seconds or heat gas grill to high. Close lid on gas grill. Meanwhile, drain pineapple; save 1/4 cup of the juice. In a blender or food processor, whirl the 1/4 cup pineapple juice, banana, ginger, chili, and lime juice until pureed. Scoop into a small serving bowl and set aside. In a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over high heat, stir onion, bell pepper, and oil until vegetables are limp, 3 to 5 minutes. Add crushed pineapple and beans; stir just until hot, about 2 minutes. Cover and keep warm. Rinse salmon and pat dry. Lay fish, skin down, on a sheet of foil. Trim foil to fit salmon. Lay foil with salmon on grill. Cook fish until opaque but moist-looking in center of thickest part (cut to test), 6 to 8 minutes. Cut salmon into equal portions. Spoon bean mixture equally onto plates; top with salmon. Squeeze lime juice over fish and add salt to taste. Pass ginger-banana sauce at the table.
