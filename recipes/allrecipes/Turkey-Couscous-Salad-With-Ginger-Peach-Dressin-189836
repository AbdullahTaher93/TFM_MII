Pour 2 cups boiling water into a 4- to 5-quart casserole, bowl, or other non-plastic container with a lid. Stir in oil and couscous. Cover tightly for 5 minutes. When grains are hydrated, fluff them with a fork, re-cover, and place in the refrigerator to cool for 30 minutes. When cooled, fluff and separate couscous grains again with a fork. (If making ahead, refrigerate, covered, for up to 2 days.) Meanwhile, make dressing. In a blender or food processor, puree lemon juice, vinegar, oil, ginger, garlic, and peaches. Add salt and hot sauce to taste. Gently mix turkey, red bell pepper, cucumber, celery, green onion, carrot, and pineapple into cooled couscous. Add peach dressing. Stir mixture gently but thoroughly to ensure dressing is evenly distributed. Serve immediately.
