Put chicken, celery, 2 garlic cloves, 1 c carrots, the oregano sprig, and half of the onion into a large pot. Fill pot with cold water, 2 inches above ingredients; put over high heat. When water boils, cover and reduce heat to medium. Simmer 1 hour. Set aside chicken to cool and discard all veggies and herbs. Strain broth into a large bowl, skim fat from top, and set aside. Put oil, jalapeno, and the remaining oregano, garlic cloves (minced), and onion (chopped) into a large pot. Cook at medium heat until vegetables are just soft, about 5 minutes. Turn heat to high; add broth, potatoes, and remaining carrots. When broth boils, reduce heat to medium. Cook until potatoes and carrots are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove skin and bones from chicken. Shred meat into bite-size pieces. Add chicken, tomatoes, salt, and pepper to soup. Cook until warm.
