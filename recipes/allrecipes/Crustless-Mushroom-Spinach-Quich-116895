In a large nonstick skillet, saute the mushrooms, zucchini, green pepper, onion and garlic in oil until tender; drain. In a large bowl, combine ricotta cheese and egg substitute. Stir in the spinach, feta, parsley, thyme, salt and pepper. Stir in mushroom mixture. Transfer to prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45-55 minutes or until edges are lightly browned and a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand for 10 minutes. Carefully remove sides of pan.
