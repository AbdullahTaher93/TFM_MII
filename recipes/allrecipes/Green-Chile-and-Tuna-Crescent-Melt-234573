In bowl, mix tuna salad, chiles and cilantro. Separate or cut dough into 4 long rectangles (if using crescent rolls, press perforations to seal); shape rectangles into squares. Spoon tuna mixture in center of each square; sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon of the cheese. Fold dough over filling to form a triangle; firmly press edges with fork to seal. Place on ungreased cookie sheet. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake at 375 degrees F 12 to 15 minutes.
