Combine Italian-style tomatoes, crushed tomatoes, potatoes, onions, carrots, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, celery, and jalapeno peppers in a large stockpot. Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan. Stir in chicken bouillon and beef bouillon cubes until dissolved. Pour over tomato mixture in the stockpot. Stir clam juice cocktail, sugar, thyme leaves, chili powder, garlic salt, black pepper, and bay leaf into the stockpot. Cook chowder, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are very tender, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Combine clams, milk, and flour in a separate saucepan; cook and stir over low heat until clams are heated through, about 7 minutes. Stir into the stockpot and simmer until flavors combine, about 30 minutes.
