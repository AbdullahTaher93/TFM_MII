Combine soy sauce, grapefruit juice, hoisin sauce, ketchup, rice wine vinegar, brown sugar, ginger, habanero pepper, and garlic in a saucepan over medium high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 10 minutes, or until thick, stirring occasionally. Strain sauce to remove pepper and garlic. Refrigerate in a covered container until ready to use.
