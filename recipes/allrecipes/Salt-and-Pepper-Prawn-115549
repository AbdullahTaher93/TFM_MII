Whisk lime juice, soy sauce, sesame oil and sugar in a large bowl until the sugar is dissolved. Add cabbage and bell peppers; toss to combine. Combine rice flour, salt, pepper and five-spice powder in a medium bowl. Add shrimp and toss to coat in spice mixture. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp and cook, stirring often, until pink and curled, 3 to 4 minutes. Add jalapenos and cook until the shrimp are cooked through, about 1 minute more. Serve the slaw topped with the shrimp.
