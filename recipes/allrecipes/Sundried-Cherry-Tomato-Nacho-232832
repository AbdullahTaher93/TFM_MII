Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch pan with cooking spray. Mix Mexican 3-cheese blend, mayonnaise, 1/4 the cherry tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, half the black olives, green onions, jalapeno peppers, and garlic powder together in a bowl. Spread tortilla chips into the prepared pan; top with Mexican cheese-tomato mixture. Sprinkle sharp Cheddar cheese on top. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and browned, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle nachos with remaining cherry tomatoes and olives.
