Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine the flour, yeast, sugar, salt, cinnamon, baking powder, and baking soda together. In a separate bowl combine the eggs, oil, and warm water. Add this to the flour mixture and mix until you form a wet dough. Stir in the chocolate and the raspberries. Divide dough into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into long snake and then form into the shape of a bagel. Place bagels onto a baking sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 1 hour. Enjoy the craaaaaaaazy bagels.
