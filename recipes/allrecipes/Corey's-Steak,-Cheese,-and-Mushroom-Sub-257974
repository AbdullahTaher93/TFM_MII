Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms until tender, about 5 minutes. Add steak, increase heat to high, and season with soy sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir steak mixture until hot and sizzling, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cover. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Place rolls under broiler until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes. Layer 2 slices American cheese onto each roll and spoon in steak-mushroom mixture.
