Cook the mixed vegetables on the stove or in the microwave until crisp-tender. Drain; place in a large bowl. Add kidney beans, celery, onion and green pepper. In a saucepan over medium heat, bring sugar, vinegar and cornstarch to a boil, stirring constantly, until thickened. Cool slightly. Pour over vegetables and toss. Refrigerate.
