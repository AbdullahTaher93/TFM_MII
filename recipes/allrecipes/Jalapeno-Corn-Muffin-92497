Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a medium-sized bowl, combine cornmeal and milk; let stand 5 minutes. Add flour, red pepper, jalapeno pepper, baking powder, garlic powder and salt to cornmeal and milk; stir well. Add egg and canola oil, stirring until just moistened. Spoon into non-stick or sprayed mini muffin pans, filling 2/3 full. Bake 10 minutes, or until lightly browned.
