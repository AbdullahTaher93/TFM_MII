Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. In a large bowl combine flour, granulated sugar, and baking powder. Cut in the 1/2 cup butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Combine egg, LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, and ginger; add to flour mixture. Stir just to moisten. Spread in a greased 8 X 1 1/2-inch round baking pan. Bake in 450 degree F oven for 18 to 20 minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in pan for 10 minutes. Remove shortcake from pan; cool on a wire rack. Split the shortcake into 2 layers. In a large skillet melt the 3 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add apples, nectarines, and/or pears. Cook for 2 to 5 minutes or until almost tender. Stir in brown sugar and nutmeg. Cook for 1 to 3 minutes more or until fruit is tender and the liquid is reduced. Stir in blueberries. Cool completely. Place the bottom cake layer on a serving plate. Spoon about two-thirds of the fruit mixture and the whipped topping over cake. Top with second cake layer and remaining fruit mixture.
