Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets, or line with parchment paper. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, tahini, brown sugar, 3/4 cup of turbinado sugar, and almond paste until smooth. Mix in the egg, vanilla and orange juice. Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, almond meal, and cinnamon; stir into the batter until well blended. Mix in the cereal and sour cherries. Drop dough by heaping spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Sprinkle the remaining 3 tablespoons of turbinado sugar over the tops. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden at the edges. Cool for a few minutes on the cookie sheets, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.
