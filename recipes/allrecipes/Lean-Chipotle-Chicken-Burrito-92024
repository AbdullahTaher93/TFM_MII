Cut chicken into bite-size pieces (about 2 cups), then mix with chipotles and 1 to 2 tablespoons (depending on how spicy you want it) adobo sauce. Reserve any leftover chicken for another use. Keep warm. Combine 1 1/4 cups water and 1 cup salsa in a 2- to 3-quart pan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Add rice, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 25 minutes. Keep warm. Place a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat. When it's hot, lay a tortilla in the pan and let sit until its underside is hot, 10 to 15 seconds. Turn over and heat other side, 10 to 15 more seconds. Remove from pan and place on a flat surface. Toward one edge of the tortilla, place 1/6 of the chicken, rice, cheese, beans, sour cream, and cilantro. Fold edge over filling and roll up tightly to enclose. Repeat steps to warm and fill remaining tortillas. Serve burritos with additional salsa if desired.
