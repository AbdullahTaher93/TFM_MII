In a Dutch oven, saute onion and green pepper in oil until tender. Add rabbit and enough water to cover. Cover and simmer for 1-1/2 to 2 hours or until meat is very tender. Add sausage, salt, thyme, pepper and cayenne. Simmer, uncovered, for 15-20 minutes. Remove rabbit; cool. Debone and cut into bite-size pieces; return to pan. Stir in okra; bring to a boil. Serve in bowls over rice.
