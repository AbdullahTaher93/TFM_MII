Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a pizza stone. Stir soy flour, Parmesan cheese, and egg together in the bowl of a stand mixer; add water. Switch mixer attachment to a dough hook; mix, adding water as necessary, until a stiff dough forms. Roll dough out onto prepared pizza stone. Bake in the preheated oven until crisped, 15 to 20 minutes.
