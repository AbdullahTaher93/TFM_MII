Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 10-inch deep-dish pie pan with non-stick cooking spray. In a large bowl, whisk flour, 1/4 cup SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, 1/4 cup cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Stir in milk, oil, and vanilla. (Batter will be thick.) Spread batter in prepared pan and sprinkle on SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend, remaining 1/4 cup SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, and remaining 1/4 cup cocoa. Pour hot water over top. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until cake is set on top and pudding starts to bubble up through cake. Cool in pan 10 minutes. Spoon into bowls and serve.
