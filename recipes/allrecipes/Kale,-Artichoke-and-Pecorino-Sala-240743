Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir pancetta until crisp, about 7 minutes. Transfer pancetta to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon. Cook and stir artichoke hearts in the same skillet over medium heat until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer artichoke hearts to a plate. Place kale in a large bowl and top with artichoke hearts and pancetta. Drizzle 3 tablespoons olive oil over kale mixture and add lemon juice, salt, and pepper; toss. Sprinkle grated pecorino cheese over salad.
