Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8x12-inch casserole dish with cooking spray. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook ground beef and onion until meat is brown and onions begin to soften, approximately 10 minutes. Drain grease. Add minced garlic, canned tomatoes, Diamond Crystal(R) Fine Sea Salt, and Italian seasoning to the skillet. Simmer until thickened, about 30 minutes. Drain or blot moisture from the zucchini noodles; place evenly over the bottom of the casserole dish. Top with 1/3 of the sauce, half the cottage cheese, all the baby spinach, and 1/3 of the mozzarella. Make another layer of 1/3 of the sauce, the rest of the cottage cheese, 1/3 of the mozzarella. Top with the rest of the sauce, the rest of the mozzarella, and the Parmesan cheese. Bake until the cheese is slightly browned, about 30 minutes. Allow to cool for 15 minutes before serving.
