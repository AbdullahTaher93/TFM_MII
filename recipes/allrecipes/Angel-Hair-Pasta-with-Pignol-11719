Toast pignoli nuts slowly in a skillet, watching carefully not to burn. Remove from skillet when nuts are tan in color. Cook noodles in boiling salted water until al dente. Drain. Combine heavy cream, clarified butter, 2 1/3 tablespoons butter or margarine, nutmeg, and salt and pepper in a saucepan; heat thoroughly. Add noodles to the heated sauce. Let sauce reduce to a creamy consistency. Top with nuts, and serve.
