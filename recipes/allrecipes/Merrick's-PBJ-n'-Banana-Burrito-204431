Spread the peanut butter evenly over the middle of the tortilla; spread the apricot jelly in a layer over the peanut butter. Lie the banana atop the peanut butter and jelly layers. Drizzle the honey over the banana. Fold the two ends of the tortilla over the tips of the banana and roll the other two ends of the tortilla over the mixture to form a burrito.
