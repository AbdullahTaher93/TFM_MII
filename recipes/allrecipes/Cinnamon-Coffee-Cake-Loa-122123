In a bowl, combine the flour, 1 cup sugar, baking powder, 1-1/2 teaspoons cinnamon and salt. In another bowl, combine the eggs, buttermilk, oil and vanilla; stir into dry ingredients just until smooth. Pour half of the batter into a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. In a small bowl, combine the remaining sugar and cinnamon; stir in butter. Drizzle with remaining cinnamon-sugar mixture; swirl with a knife. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
