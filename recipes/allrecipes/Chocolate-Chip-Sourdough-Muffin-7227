Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease one 12-cup muffin tin. In a large bowl combine the sourdough starter, egg, milk, oil and vanilla. Stir in the salt, flour, sugar and cinnamon until just combined. Fold in the chocolate chips. Fill muffin tins about 2/3 of the way full. Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 20 to 25 minutes or until muffins test done.
