Place the lettuce in a bowl, and add the cherry tomatoes, hearts of palm, black olives, avocado, and cucumber. Season to taste with garlic salt, salt, and pepper. Rub the dried mint between the palms of your hands, and sprinkle over the salad. Drizzle with olive oil, and toss. Add additional olive oil if needed to lightly coat all ingredients.
