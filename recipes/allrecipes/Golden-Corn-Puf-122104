In a skillet, saute corn and tomato in 1 tablespoon butter until tomato is heated through; set aside. In a large saucepan, melt the remaining butter; stir in flour, salt, pepper and cayenne until smooth. Gradually add milk. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat. Add cheese and the reserved corn mixture. In a small mixing bowl, beat egg yolks until thick and lemon-colored, about 3 minutes. Stir in 1/3 cup hot corn mixture; return all to the pan. Cool to room temperature. In another mixing bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Add cream of tartar: beat until stiff peaks form. Gently fold into corn mixture. Transfer to a greased 2-1/2-qt. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until thermometer reads 160 degrees F and top is golden brown. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
