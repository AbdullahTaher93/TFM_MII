Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Bring dough to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a food processor, combine almond paste, 2 eggs, granulated sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves; pulse to form a smooth paste, scraping sides of bowl as necessary. Unroll 2 crusts onto a work surface; spread almond mixture evenly over both. Top with remaining 2 crusts; brush with egg white. Sprinkle with decorators sugar. Cut rounds in half, then cut widthwise into 3/4-inch strips. Form into twists. Place on parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake until golden, about 22 minutes.
