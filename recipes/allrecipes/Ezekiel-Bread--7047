Measure the water, honey, olive oil, and yeast into a large bowl. Let sit for 3 to 5 minutes. Stir all of the grains and beans together until well mixed. Grind in a flour mill. Add fresh milled flour and salt to the yeast mixture; stir until well mixed, about 10 minutes. The dough will be like that of a batter bread. Pour dough into two greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pans. Let rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until dough has reached the top of the pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes, or until loaves are golden brown.
