Broil poblanos to blacken skin. Cool, remove skin and seeds, cut into 1/2 dice and set aside. Melt butter over medium heat in a large stock pot. Add onion and saute until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Add broth and bring to a boil. Crush scalloped potatoes into small pieces and add along with the cheese packet. Cook 30 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. Add milk and bring back to a simmer. Stir in mashed potatoes and diced poblano and simmer 5 to 10 more minutes. Top with assorted toppings and serve.
