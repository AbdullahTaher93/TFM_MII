Heat oven to 350 degrees F. (If using dark pan, decrease oven temperature to 325 degrees F.) Generously grease 9x5-inch loaf pan with shortening or spray with cooking spray. In large bowl, beat sugar and butter with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Beat in eggs, bananas and yogurt. Add flour, baking soda and salt; beat until combined. Stir in 1/2 cup of the crushed granola bars until well combined. Pour batter into greased pan. In small bowl, mix remaining 1/4 cup crushed granola bars and the coconut. Sprinkle evenly over batter in pan; press in lightly. Bake at 350 degrees F for 60 to 70 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, covering with foil during last 15 to 20 minutes of baking to prevent excessive browning. Cool in pan on wire rack 15 minutes. Remove loaf from pan; place on rack. Cool completely, about 2 hours. Wrap tightly and store in refrigerator.
