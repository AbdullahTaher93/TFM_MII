Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Lightly spray a cookie sheet with no-stick cooking spray. Combine flour, corn meal mix and sugar in medium bowl; mix well. With pastry blender or fork, cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add buttermilk; stir with fork until a soft dough forms and mixture pulls away from sides of bowl. Knead dough on lightly floured surface with floured hands just until smooth. Roll out dough to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut with floured 2-inch round cutter; place biscuits on prepared cookie sheet Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
