Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place spaghetti squash cut-side down on a baking sheet. Bake squash in the preheated oven until soft and easily pierced with a knife, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from oven and cool until easily handled, 5 to 10 minutes. Use a fork to scrape insides of squash into spaghetti strands; transfer to a bowl. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and chard stems; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until soft, about 2 minutes. Stir in chard leaves; cook and stir until just wilted, about 3 minutes. Season with red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper. Stir squash, tomatoes, parsley, and thyme into the skillet. Cook and stir until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top before serving.
