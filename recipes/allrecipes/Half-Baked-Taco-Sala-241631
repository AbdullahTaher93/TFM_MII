Combine chili powder, cumin, black pepper, garlic powder, sea salt, paprika, onion powder, cayenne pepper, and oregano together in a bowl. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Mix spice mixture into ground beef until evenly coated; add water. Simmer beef until liquid is evaporated, 10 to 15 minutes. Add kidney beans and simmer until beans are heated through, about 10 minutes. Cut each tomato in half down the middle. Slice 1 of each half into thin, round cross sections. Chop the remaining halves. Spread romaine lettuce onto the prepared baking sheet; top with green bell peppers and tomato slices. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over tomato layer. Bake in the preheated oven until edges of romaine lettuce are crisp but not burned, 10 to 20 minutes. Top salad with taco meat mixture, Cheddar cheese, chopped tomato, and salsa. Transfer salad to a serving plate using a spatula.
