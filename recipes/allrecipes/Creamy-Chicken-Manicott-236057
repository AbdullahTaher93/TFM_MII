Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain and rinse with cold water; drain and set aside. For sauce, in a medium saucepan cook onion in hot butter over medium heat for 4 minutes or until tender but not brown. Stir in flour and salt. Add milk all at once. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Remove from heat; set aside. For filling, in a medium bowl combine Grilled & Ready(R) Grilled Chicken Breast Strips, ham, egg yolk, the 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, 1 cup of the Parmesan cheese and the ricotta cheese. Pour about 1/2 cup of the sauce into a buttered 2-quart rectangular baking dish; spread in a thin layer over bottom of dish. Use a pastry tube fitted with the largest tip to pipe the filling into the cooked manicotti. (Or carefully spoon about 1/3 cup of the filling into each shell.) Arrange the filled manicotti in the baking dish in a single layer. Pour the remaining sauce over the manicotti. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese over the sauce. Bake, uncovered, for 20 minutes or until manicotti are light golden and heated through. Let stand 5 to 10 minutes before serving. If desired, garnish with a sprinkling of ground nutmeg and parsley.
