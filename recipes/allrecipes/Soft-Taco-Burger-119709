In a bowl, combine the beans, 2 tablespoons green chilies, onion and salt. Crumble the beef over mixture and mix well. Shape into eight 5-in. patties. Top each patty with 2 tablespoons cheddar cheese; fold in half and press edges to seal, forming a half moon. If grilling the burgers, coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill. Grill burgers, uncovered, over medium heat or broil 4 in. from the heat for 7-9 minutes on each side or until meat is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F. Serve on tortillas with lettuce, tomato, salsa and remaining chilies.
