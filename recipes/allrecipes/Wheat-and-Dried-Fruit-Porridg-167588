Combine apricots, currants, honey, cinnamon, salt and water in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Stir in bulgur; cook, stirring constantly, until the bulgur starts to thicken, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover and let stand until most of the liquid is absorbed and the fruit is tender, about 3 minutes. Divide between 2 bowls, dust with a little cinnamon and serve.
