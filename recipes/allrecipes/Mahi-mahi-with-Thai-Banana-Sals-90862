Heat sesame oil in a wide nonstick frying pan over high heat. Add banana and cook, turning as needed, until well browned on all sides (about 8 minutes). Remove banana from pan, chop coarsely, and place in a bowl. Mix in raisins, 2 tablespoons of the cilantro, lemon grass, orange peel, and cayenne; set aside. Rinse fish, pat dry, and cut into 6 equal portions. Rub fish all over with olive oil; then pat remaining chopped cilantro over fish. Place a wide nonstick frying pan over high heat. When pan is hot, add vegetable oil and oiled fish. Cook, turning once or twice (drippings may scorch and smoke), until fish is done to your liking; cut to test. Cook mahi mahi until just opaque but still moist in thickest part (6 to 8 minutes); cook tuna until still pink in center (4 to 5 minutes). With a wide spatula, transfer fish to individual plates; serve with banana salsa. Garnish with cilantro.
