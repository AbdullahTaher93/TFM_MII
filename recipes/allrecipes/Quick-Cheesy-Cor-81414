In a baking dish, combine the corn, cheese, bacon bits, milk, and salt and pepper. Place baking dish, uncovered, in a cool oven. Then turn the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). When the oven is fully heated (about 10 minutes), remove the dish, and stir vigorously, until the cheese and milk make a sauce. Return dish to oven for 5 minutes.
