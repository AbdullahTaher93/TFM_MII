Combine squash, water, olive oil, salt, mustard seeds, cumin seeds, cayenne pepper, and turmeric in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until squash is tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir coconut milk and beans into the squash mixture; simmer until flavors blend, about 10 minutes. Serve curry with cilantro on top.
