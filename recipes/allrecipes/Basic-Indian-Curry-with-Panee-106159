Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking and stirring until onion is very tender and dark brown, about 20 minutes more. Stir in garlic and ginger, and continue cooking for 1 minute. Reduce heat to low, stir in chopped serrano chiles, and cook for an additional minute. Sprinkle in the red chile powder, cumin, coriander, garam masala, and turmeric; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in tomato puree and ketchup; thin with water to desired consistency. Stir in the paneer and peas; cook to soften peas, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in cream, and increase heat to medium-high. Allow the curry to come to a rolling boil, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.
