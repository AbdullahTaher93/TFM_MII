Combine all ingredients in a medium-size microwave-safe bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Microwave on medium for 4 to 6 minutes or until cheese is almost melted, stirring every 2 minutes. Remove from microwave and stir until all the cheese is melted and ingredients are blended. Serve in a fondue pot or warm bowl. Serve with tortilla chips, vegetables or crusty bread.
