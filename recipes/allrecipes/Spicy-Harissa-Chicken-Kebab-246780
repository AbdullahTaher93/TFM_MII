Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Whisk together the harissa, honey and lemon juice in a bowl. Add chicken and mix until coated. Skewer the chicken evenly among 8 wooden skewers and set aside. Mix together the squash, zucchini, onion, mushrooms, olive oil, cumin and salt and pepper until completely combined. Place a 1 1/2 to 2 feet long sheet of Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil on a table and place 1/4 of the vegetables in the center of the foil. Place 2 chicken skewers on top of the vegetables. Fold up the ends and then the outside of the foil to create a foil packet. Repeat the process 3 more times and place the foil packets on a cookie sheet. Bake in the oven at 425 degrees F for 20 minutes and then open the foil packets and cook for a further 15 minutes or until the chicken is lightly browned and cooked throughout. Optional Serving: Serve the individual foil packets alongside warm pita.
