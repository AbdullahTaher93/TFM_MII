Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Wash the mushrooms; arrange on a baking sheet with top side of the mushroom facing down. Whisk together the soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, and garlic in a small bowl; brush the mixture evenly over the mushrooms. Roast the mushrooms under the broiler until soft, about 10 minutes.
