Place carrots and water in a microwave-safe dish. Cover and microwave on high for 4 minutes or until crisp-tender. Add snow peas and onion. Cover and microwave for 1 minute or until tender; drain. In a bowl, combine the brown sugar, cornstarch, butter, salt and pepper until smooth. Stir into vegetables. Microwave, uncovered, for 1 to 1-1/2 minutes or until bubbly around the edges, stirring once.
