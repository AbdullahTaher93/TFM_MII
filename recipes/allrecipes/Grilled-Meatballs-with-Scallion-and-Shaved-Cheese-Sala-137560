Light a grill. In a large bowl, using your hands, mix the ground veal and lamb with the eggs, bacon, shallots, fresh bread crumbs, ricotta, Montasio and 2 teaspoons of salt. Shape the mixture into 40 golf ball-size meatballs. In a wide saucepan, bring the chicken stock and water to a boil. Add half of the meatballs and simmer over moderately low heat until just cooked through, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked meatballs to a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat the process with the remaining meatballs. On another large rimmed baking sheet, drizzle the scallions with vegetable oil and season with salt. Working in 3 batches, grill the scallions over high heat for about 2 minutes, turning once, until charred on both sides; return the grilled scallions to the baking sheet. Gently toss the grilled scallions with the olive oil and Parmigiano-Reggiano shavings. Grill the preserved lemon halves over high heat, cut side down, for about 4 minutes, or until charred. Squeeze the grilled lemon halves over the scallions and toss again. Arrange the scallions on a platter. Drizzle the meatballs lightly with vegetable oil and roll to coat. Grill the meatballs over high heat, rolling to turn them, until lightly charred all over and heated through, about 3 minutes total. Using tongs, arrange the meatballs on top of the scallions and serve.
