Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 1-quart baking dish. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir sausage, diced tomatoes with green chile peppers and its reserved liquid, cream cheese, sour cream, and chipotle chile power together in a bowl; spoon into prepared baking dish. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the sausage mixture. Bake in preheated oven until bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes.
