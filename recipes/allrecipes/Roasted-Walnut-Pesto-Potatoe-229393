Toss to coat potatoes with oil and spread into a single layer in pan. Roast 15 minutes; toss well and continue to roast 10 minutes. Now, lets make pesto. Have you ever grown your own basil? Its so easy. You can even grow it inside in a container if space is limited. Fresh basil and Carapelli is so very good. OK, back to our recipe. Using a food processor with the motor running, drop garlic through feed tube; process until minced. Add parsley, basil, walnuts and cheese; process until herbs and walnuts are minced. With motor running, drizzle remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil through feed tube; process until well combined. Spoon mixture over potatoes; toss well and continue to roast 5 to 10 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Looks fantastic, yes?
