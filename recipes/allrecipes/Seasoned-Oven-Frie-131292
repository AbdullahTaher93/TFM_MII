Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Cut peeled or unpeeled Russet or Idaho into shoestring- or steak-fry-sized pieces. Toss them with extra virgin olive oil and salt, to taste. Bake them for 8 minutes per side for thinner fries or as many as 15 minutes per side for thick, or until tender and slightly browning on outside.
