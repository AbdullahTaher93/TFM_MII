Heat the oil in a deep skillet set over medium heat. Add the onion, red pepper, garlic, thyme and bay leaf. Cook, stirring often, until softened. Stir in 3/4 cup (175 mL) of the ketchup, the tomatoes, Worcestershire and vinegar into the pan. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Discard the bay leaf. Reserve. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Cook the shells according to package directions. Drain and rinse under cold running water until cool enough to handle. Blend the broccoli, cream cheese, 1 cup (250 mL) Cheddar cheese and remaining ketchup with a spatula until combined. Spoon half of the sauce into a 9- x 13- in (3 L) casserole dish. Stuff the shells with the cheese mixture, using a spoon to divide the mixture evenly. Set the shells, stuffed side up in the pan. Spoon the remaining sauce over the shells. Cover and bake for 20 minutes. Uncover and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake for 10 minutes or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
