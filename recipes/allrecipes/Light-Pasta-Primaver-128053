Place the artichokes in a strainer set over a bowl and drain well, reserving 2 tablespoons (25 mL) of the oil. Cut the larger artichokes in half. Place on a plate lined with paper towels and allow to drain further. Place the reserved oil in a large nonstick skillet. Add the garlic. Saute over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Add the peppers and radishes; saute for 2 minutes. Add the zucchini and scallions; saute for 2 minutes. Add the peas, tomatoes, basil, parsley, broth, and artichokes; saute for 2 minutes. Spoon the vegetables over the pasta. Sprinkle with the Parmesan, black pepper, and red-pepper flakes. Toss lightly.
