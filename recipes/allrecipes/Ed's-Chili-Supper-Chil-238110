Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir onion into the beef. Season beef with chili powder and stir; add chili beans and tomatoes. Season chili with salt and pepper. Bring the chili to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until thick, at least 1 hour.
