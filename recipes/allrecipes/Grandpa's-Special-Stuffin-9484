Place bread cubes in a large bowl and sprinkle with enough water to moisten. Add the eggs, prosciutto, salami, pepperoni, Mozzarella, Parmesan, parsley and pepper; mix well. Place stuffing in a fowl or casserole dish. If using a casserole dish, bake uncovered at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 35 to 45 minutes.
