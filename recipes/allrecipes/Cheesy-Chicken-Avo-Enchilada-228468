Mix 1 tbsp of chili powder, 1 tsp of cumin, coriander, garlic powder, 1/2 tsp salt, black pepper, and 2 tbsp canola oil. Add to chicken and allow to marinate for 30 minutes. Heat 2 tbsp of oil over medium in a large pan. Remove chicken from marinade and sear on both sides for about 2 minutes. Add a 1/2 cup of water to the pan and cover allowing to cook for 15 minutes. Remove chicken and let it rest for 5 minutes before cutting. Whip cream cheese for 3 minutes on high speed, and then fold in the guacamole, red bell pepper, onion, and the remaining cumin, salt, and chili powder. Dice the chicken and add to the cream cheese mixture. Heat tortillas in either the microwave between 2 wet paper towels for 30 seconds (5 at a time) or quickly (30 seconds) dip each tortilla into a pan of warm oil over medium low heat. Wrap up 2 tbsps of filling into each tortilla, then top with guacamole salsa, and cook for 10 minutes at 350. Remove from oven and top with queso fresco or Monterey jack cheese.
