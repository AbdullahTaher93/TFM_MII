Mix the quinoa and water in a saucepan over medium heat, and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until all the water is absorbed, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in the dried pineapple, dried mango, coconut flakes, macadamia nuts, hot and regular mango chutney until thoroughly combined. Serve hot.
