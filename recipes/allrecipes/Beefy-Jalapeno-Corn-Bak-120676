In a skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain and set aside. In a bowl, beat eggs, corn, milk and oil. Combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder and salt; add to egg mixture and mix well. Pour half of the batter into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with 2 cups cheese; top with the beef, onion and jalapenos. Sprinkle with remaining cheese; top with remaining batter. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 55-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into corn bread topping comes out clean. Serve warm. Refrigerate any leftovers.
