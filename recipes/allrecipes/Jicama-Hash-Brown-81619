Cut off about 1/3 of a jicama and peel it (I think a knife works best) then grate it. This should make about 1 cup depending on the size of your jicama. Mince the scallions. In a fry pan over high heat, add the peanut oil and heat until it begins to quiver (but don't let it smoke). That's the perfect time to add the jicama. Stir fry until they have taken on some color but not too dark. Add the scallions, stir, and immediately transfer to a paper towel and toss with some salt and pepper (it'll need both). Serve with fried, scrambled or poached eggs.
