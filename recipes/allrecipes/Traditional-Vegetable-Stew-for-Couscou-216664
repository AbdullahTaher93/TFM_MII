Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir the onion and bell pepper in the hot oil until slightly softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the leek, carrots, potatoes, pumpkin, zucchinis, and Jerusalem artichoke to the pot; cover the skillet and cook another 10 minutes. Stir the water, saffron, and lentils into the vegetable mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low, return cover to the pot, and allow the mixture to simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. Add the chickpeas, broad beans, and peas to the stew. Season with the salt and pepper. Cover again and continue cooking until the lentils are mushy, about 15 minutes.
