In a bowl, dissolve gelatin in water. Stir in the raspberries, pineapple and salt. Pour half into an 8-cup ring mold coated with nonstick cooking spray; refrigerate for 30 minutes or until firm. Let remaining gelatin mixture stand at room temperature. In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and sour cream until smooth. Carefully spread over gelatin in mold; top with remaining gelatin mixture. Refrigerate for 6 hours or until firm.
