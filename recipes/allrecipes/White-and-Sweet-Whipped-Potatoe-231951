Combine russet potatoes and sweet potatoes in a large pot. Pour enough water over the potatoes to cover; add chicken bouillon. Bring water to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes; drain. Dump drained potatoes in a large bowl; add milk, butter, brown sugar, salt, pepper, allspice, and nutmeg. Whip the potato mixture with a potato masher or immersion blender until a desired consistency is reached.
