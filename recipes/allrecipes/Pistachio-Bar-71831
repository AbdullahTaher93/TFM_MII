Microwave the chocolate in a microwavable bowl on high for 2 minutes, stirring after 1 minute. Stir until completely melted. Stir the nuts into the chocolate. Spoon the chocolate and nut mixture onto a waxed paper-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate for 1 hour until firm. Break into bite-size pieces about an inch in size. Enjoy one piece as a treat.
