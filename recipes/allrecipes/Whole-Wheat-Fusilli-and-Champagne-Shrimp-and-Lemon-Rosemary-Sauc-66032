Combine all spices in a bowl except lemon zest and set aside. Heat 1/4 cup of butter in a large skillet over a medium high heat. Add mushrooms, green onions and half of the seasonings and saute until mushrooms are golden in color. Add champagne, bring to a slow boil and reduce the liquid by half, about 5 minutes. Add cream and continue to slow boil until sauce thickens. In another large skillet heat remaining butter and spices add shrimp, saute until shrimp have turned pink in color, add lemon zest and then combine shrimp and seasonings to mushroom sauce mixture and serve over prepared cooked pasta. And top with fresh chopped parsley.
