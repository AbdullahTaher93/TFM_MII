Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. In a large bowl, stir together protein powder, flour, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon and sugar. Add oil, applesauce, eggs, egg whites, pumpkin and water; stir well. Fold in walnuts. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in preheated oven for 16 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center of each muffin comes out clean.
