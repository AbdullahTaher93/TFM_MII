Pour stuffing mix into a large bowl; stir in seasoning packet and water until moistened. Mix chicken, onion, zucchini, bell pepper, and mushrooms in a separate large bowl; stir in cream of chicken soup. Spoon half the chicken mixture into a 4-quart or larger slow cooker; top with half the stuffing. Repeat layering with remaining chicken mixture and stuffing. Cook on Low until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the vegetables are tender, 5 to 6 hours (or 2 1/2 to 3 hours on High).
