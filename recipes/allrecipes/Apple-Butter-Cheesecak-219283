In a small bowl, combine crushed ginger snaps, sugar, and melted butter. Blend well. Press the crust with a spoon into a 10-inch spring form pan. Make sure to cover the bottom and the sides evenly. Bake the crust at 350 degrees F for 8-10 minutes, and then let it cool. In a large bowl, mix cream cheese, cornstarch, and sugar until smooth. Add sour cream to the mixture. Beat in the eggs. Add MUSSELMAN'S Apple Butter and butter, and beat until smooth. Pour the mixture into the prepared ginger snap crust. Bake at 350 degrees F in a water bath for about 2 hours.
