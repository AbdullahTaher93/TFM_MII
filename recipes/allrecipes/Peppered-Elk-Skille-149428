Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the elk strips and garlic; cook and stir until the elk has browned, about 4 minutes. Once done, season to taste with salt and pepper, and remove elk from skillet. Pour the remaining tablespoon of oil into the skillet, and stir in bell pepper and onion. Cook and stir until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes, then add the beef broth, soy sauce, tomatoes, mushrooms, and corn. Bring to a boil. Dissolve cornstarch in water, and stir into boiling vegetables; stir until thickened, about 30 seconds. Stir in the browned elk until heated through, then serve.
