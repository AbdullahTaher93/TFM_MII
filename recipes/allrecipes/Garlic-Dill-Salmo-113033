In a medium baking dish, combine the garlic, orange juice, lemon juice and dill. Place the salmon, skin side up, in the marinade and refrigerate for up to 3 hours. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Discard half of the marinade and bake the fish in the remaining sauce until cooked through, about 15 minutes.
