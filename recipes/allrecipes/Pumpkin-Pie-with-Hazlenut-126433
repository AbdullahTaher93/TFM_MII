First, make the dough: Put flour, pinch of salt, and sugar in the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine. Cut the chilled butter into small pieces and add to the bowl. Add the water and process for 15 seconds. If the dough is too dry, add water by droplets. The dough should just hold together. Wrap dough in waxed paper and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Roll out the pastry and fit it into a 9-inch pie plate, 2 inches deep. Prick the pastry with a fork all over the bottom. Bake for 10 minutes with pie weights. Increase the oven to 450 degrees. Combine hazelnuts, 1/4 cup granulated brown sugar, and butter. Work into a paste and spread over the partially cooked pastry shell. Bake for 10 minutes. Mix together the eggs, egg yolk, pumpkin puree, flour, 2/3 cup granulated brown sugar, spices, salt, and heavy cream. Pour into the pastry shell. Turn the oven down to 325 degrees and bake for 45 minutes. Serve pie at room temperature or cold. Optional: Serve with unsweetened whipped cream on the side.
