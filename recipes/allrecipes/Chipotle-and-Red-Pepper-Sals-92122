Slice onion into rings 1/2 inch thick. In an 8- to 10-inch frying pan, cook onion and garlic over high heat, turning occasionally, until slightly caramelized, 6 to 8 minutes. In a blender or food processor, whirl half the onion mixture and half the red peppers with the chilies and lime juice until smooth. Using a knife, chop remaining onion and red peppers and stir into puree. Add salt to taste.
