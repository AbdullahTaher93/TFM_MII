In a large skillet over medium heat, saute the sausage until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Add the sugar, peppers, tomatoes, onions, celery, scallions and garlic. Saute until the vegetables are tender, about 7 minutes. Add the chicken and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the rice, sausage, broth, bay leaves, Worcestershire sauce, Cajun spice and hot-pepper sauce. Cover and simmer until the rice is tender, about 10 minutes. Add the basil and thyme, and heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and discard the bay leaves.
