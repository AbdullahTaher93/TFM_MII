Place Brussels sprouts in a steamer basket over boiling water. Cover saucepan and steam 8-10 minutes or until Brussels sprouts are tender yet crisp. Melt the butter in a deep skillet, add the onions and 3 tablespoons vinegar; cook until onions brown. Add the Brussels sprouts, sugar and remaining vinegar. Saute over medium heat until the Brussels sprouts are lightly caramelized. Season with salt and pepper to taste and garnish with pistachios.
