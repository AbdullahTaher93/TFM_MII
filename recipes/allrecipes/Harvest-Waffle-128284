Heat a waffle iron. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and pumpkin pie spice. In a medium bowl, beat the egg, pumpkin, milk, oil, syrup, and vanilla. Add the pumpkin mixture to the flour mixture and stir just to blend. Bake in the waffle iron until the steaming stops. Serve with your favorite fruit topping.
