Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Top 4 of the bread slices with 2% Milk Singles, ham and remaining bread slices. Beat egg whites and milk in shallow dish or pie plate. Dip each sandwich into egg mixture, turning to coat both sides (let bread soak about 5 sec. on each side). Place sandwiches on baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray. Bake 6 min.; turn. Bake an additional 5 min. or until sandwiches are golden brown. Cut sandwiches diagonally in half.
