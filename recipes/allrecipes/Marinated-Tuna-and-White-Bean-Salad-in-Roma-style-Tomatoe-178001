In a large bowl, combine beans, drained tuna, onion, parsley, vinegar, oil, 3/4 tsp. paprika, and salt and pepper to taste; mix well. Cover and chill for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. Bring to room temperature about 10 minutes before serving. Fill each cored tomato or bell pepper with about 1 tbsp. salad, and arrange on a large serving platter. Top each filled tomato with a slice of hard-cooked egg and a sprinkle of paprika, if desired.
