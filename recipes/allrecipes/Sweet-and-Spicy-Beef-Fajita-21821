Cut beef into thin strips. (Beef is easier to cut if partially frozen, about 1 1/2 hours.) Heat 12-inch skillet or wok over high heat. Add oil; rotate skillet to coat sides. Add beef; stir-fry 2 to 3 minutes or until brown; drain. Stir in salsa, ketchup, brown sugar and mustard. Cook and stir 1 to 2 minutes or until hot. Serve in tortillas with sour cream, shredded lettuce and chopped tomatoes, if desired.
