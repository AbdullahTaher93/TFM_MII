In a 4- to 5-quart pan, combine oil, garlic, onion, carrot, and celery. Cook, stirring often, over high heat until vegetables begin to brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Pour from pan into a bowl and set aside. To pan, add lamb and broth; cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and boil gently for 10 minutes. Uncover, turn heat to high, and stir often until juices evaporate, drippings are very browned, and meat is lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Return browned vegetables to pan. Add tomatoes with their liquid, wine, fennel seed, and sage; stir to free browned bits. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 40 minutes; stir occasionally. Add artichokes and potatoes to lamb mixture. Cover and simmer until potatoes and lamb are very tender when pierced, about 30 minutes; stir occasionally. Sprinkle stew with parsley and season to taste with salt and pepper to serve.
