Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. In a large bowl, beat egg with a fork to blend. Squeeze sausages from casings into bowl with egg, discarding casings. Add beef, bread crumbs, the 3 tablespoons broth, and green onions. Using your hands, mix well. Shape mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls; place slightly apart in a rimmed 10- by 15-inch baking pan. Bake meatballs until no longer pink in the center (about 12 minutes); cut to test. Meanwhile, in a 5- to 6-quart pan, bring 2 1/2 cups of the remaining broth and 2 1/2 cups water to a boil over high heat. Add pasta and cook, stirring often, until tender to bite (about 15 minutes). Add mustard greens, remaining 1 cup broth, and cooked meatballs. Cook, stirring, until greens are wilted and meatballs are hot (2 to 3 minutes). Season to taste with salt. Spoon pasta mixture into deep, wide bowls and sprinkle evenly with cheese.
