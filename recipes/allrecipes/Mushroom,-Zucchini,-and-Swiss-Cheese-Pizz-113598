Heat the oven to 425 degrees F. Oil two 12-inch pizza pans or large baking sheets. Press the dough into a 12-inch round, or 9-by-13-inch rectangle, on each prepared pan. Bake until the dough begins to brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large nonstick frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over moderately high heat. Add the zucchini and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in the same pan. Add the mushrooms, salt, pepper, and thyme and cook, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms are golden, about 5 minutes. Return the zucchini to the pan, add the wine, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and all the wine has evaporated, about 5 minutes more. Spread the vegetable mixture on the partially baked pizza crusts. Sprinkle each with Swiss cheese and Parmesan and bake until the cheese melts, about 10 minutes.
