Heat a small skillet over low heat; spray with cooking spray. Add apple, season with salt, and cook until warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle lemon juice over apples and toss to coat. Stir in raisins, cinnamon, and sweetener. Cook until apples are easily pierced with a fork, adding water if mixture is too dry, 5 to 7 minutes.
