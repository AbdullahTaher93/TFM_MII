Heat olive oil and butter together in a saucepan. Cook and stir garlic, onion, and red bell pepper in hot oil mixture until onion is lightly transparent, about 5 minutes; season with Italian seasoning and continue cooking and stirring another 2 minutes. Sprinkle flour over the onion mixture; stir to incorporate. Whisk white wine into the onion mixture; bring to a simmer and cook until the liquid has reduced by half, 7 to 10 minutes. Pour chicken stock into the saucepan and bring to a boil. Stir half-and-half into the mixture, cook until it just begins to bubble and stir spinach, artichokes, and mozzarella cheese into the mixture; cook and stir until the cheese has fully melted, about 5 minutes.
