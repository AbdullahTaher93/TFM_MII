Cook bacon in olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 8 minutes. Pour butter beans into bacon and drippings; toss lightly. Season with salt and black pepper; cook 3 more minutes to blend flavors. Stir garlic into beans and cook just until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Toss arugula into mixture and cook until wilted; remove from heat. Stir in lemon juice.
