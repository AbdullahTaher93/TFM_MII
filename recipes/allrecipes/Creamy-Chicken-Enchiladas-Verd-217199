Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix sour cream and salsa until well blended. Cook and stir onions and garlic in hot oil in large skillet on medium heat 4 to 5 min. or until vegetables are crisp-tender. Stir in chicken, 1 cup sour cream mixture, chiles and 1/2 cup cheese. Spoon about 1/3 cup chicken mixture down center of each tortilla; roll up. Place, seam-sides down, in 13x9-inch baking dish sprayed with cooking spray. Top with remaining tomatillo sauce and cheese. Cover. Bake 15 to 20 min. or until heated through.
