Dice apples with skin still on. Place in a bowl of water with a little lemon juice to keep them from turning brown. In a large bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, sugar, lemon juice and orange juice. Fold in the whipped cream. Drain the apples and add to the mayonnaise mixture, along with the celery and raisins. Stir until ingredients are evenly coated.
