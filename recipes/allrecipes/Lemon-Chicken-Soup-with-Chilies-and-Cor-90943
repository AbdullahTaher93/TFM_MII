In a 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat, combine broth, onion, potatoes, diced tomatoes and their juice, lemon peel, tarragon, and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender when pierced, about 10 minutes. Add chilies and simmer 5 minutes. Meanwhile, discard skin and fat from chicken and pull meat off bones. Chop meat into bite-size pieces. When potatoes are tender, add chicken meat and corn to soup. Simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Ladle into bowls.
