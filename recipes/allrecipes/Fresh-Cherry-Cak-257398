Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a deep 9x13-inch baking dish. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Place 1 cup sugar and butter in a separate bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in milk and vanilla extract. Add flour mixture to butter mixture; mix until batter is well blended and thick, 2 to 3 minutes. Spread batter in the prepared baking dish; arrange cherries on top. Drizzle cherry juice over the cherries. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup sugar over the surface. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.
