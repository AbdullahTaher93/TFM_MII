Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry chicken wings in small batches in hot oil until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes per batch. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Assure oil reaches 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) between batches. Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Stir hot sauce, ranch dressing mix, and vinegar into the melted butter. Put cooked chicken wings in a large mixing bowl. Ladle sauce over wings and toss to coat.
