Bake, cool and remove the "tops" of the shells according to the package directions. Stir the cream cheese and sugar in a small bowl with a whisk until it's smooth. Fold the whipped topping and vanilla extract into the cream cheese mixture. Spoon about 2 teaspoons of the cream cheese mixture into each shell. Top with the fruit, pie filling and/or chocolate. Refrigerate for 1 hour before serving.
