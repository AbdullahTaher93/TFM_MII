Place raisins, whiskey, and brown sugar into a resealable plastic bag. Place steaks into the bag, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 10 to 30 minutes. Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Transfer steaks and marinade to the hot skillet. Remove raisins from the skillet with a slotted spoon once they have plumped, about 5 minutes; set aside. Cook steaks until they are beginning to firm and are hot and slightly pink in the center, 5 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Serve the steaks with the raisins.
