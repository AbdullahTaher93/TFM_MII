Halve eggs. Scoop out yolks, reserving 6 for another use. Mash the remaining 6 yolks in a small bowl. Mix in breadcrumbs, sour cream, and lemon zest. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon the yolk mixture into the hollows in the egg whites and garnish each egg with a dollop of caviar. Arrange on a platter.
