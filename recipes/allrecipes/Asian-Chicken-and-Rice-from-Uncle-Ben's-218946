Spray a 10-inch skillet with nonstick spray and heat over medium heat until hot. Add the chicken breasts and cook for 2-3 minutes until golden brown on both sides. Add the gingerroot and garlic, cook for 30 seconds. Add the chicken broth, rice and sesame oil. Cover and bring to a boil, reduce heat and cook for 15 minutes. Add assorted vegetables and continue to cook until liquid is absorbed. Just before serving, stir in green onions.
