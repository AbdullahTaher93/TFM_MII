In a medium saucepan cook pancetta over medium-high heat until crisp. Add fennel, onion, and garlic. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender, stirring occasionally. Using a slotted spoon, remove pancetta and vegetables from skillet; set aside. In a medium bowl using a whisk, stir together LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, 1 tablespoon flour, and thyme. Add milk mixture to skillet. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 1 minute more. Set aside; cover to keep warm. Trim fat from meat. Cut meat crosswise into twelve slices. Place each slice between two pieces of plastic wrap. Pound meat lightly with the flat side of a meat mallet to a 1/4-inch thickness. Remove plastic wrap. In a shallow dish combine 1/4 cup flour, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Dip meat slices in flour mixture to coat. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook meat, half at a time, in hot oil for 2 to 3 minutes or until meat is slightly pink in center, turning once. (Add more oil, if necessary.) Transfer the meat to a serving platter. Spoon the vegetables and sauce over the meat.
