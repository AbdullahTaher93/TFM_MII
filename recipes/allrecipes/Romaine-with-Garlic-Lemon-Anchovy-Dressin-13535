Separate romaine leaves. Cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-wide pieces, wash well, and spin dry. With a vegetable peeler, shave 1/3 cup parmesan curls. In a blender puree garlic and anchovies with lemon juice. With motor running add oil in a stream until dressing is emulsified. Season with salt and pepper. In a bowl toss romaine with dressing, 1/4 cup parmesan curls, and salt and pepper to taste. Divide salad between 2 plates and sprinkle with remaining parmesan curls.
