Thaw the pastry sheet at room temperature for 40 minutes or until easy to handle. Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Unfold the pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface and roll into a 14-inch square. Cut the pastry sheet into 36 (about 2 1/4-inch) squares. Press the pastry squares into 36 (1 3/4-inch) mini muffin pan cups. Bake for 10 minutes or until the pastry cups are golden. Stir the cheese, brown sugar, wine, cinnamon and lemon juice in a medium bowl until the mixture is smooth. Add the apples and toss to coat. Divide the apple mixture among the pastry cups. Bake for 10 minutes or until the filling is hot.
