In a saucepan, saute onion and garlic in 2 tablespoons of oil. Add tomatoes, chilies and 1 teaspoon salt. Simmer, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes or until slightly thickened. Meanwhile, in a shallow bowl, combine flour, pepper and remaining salt. Cut steak into serving-size pieces; dredge in flour mixture. In a skillet, brown steak on both sides in remaining oil. Transfer to an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Set aside half of the tomato mixture; pour remaining mixture over steak. Cover and bake at 325 degrees F for 2 hours or until meat is tender. Heat reserved tomato mixture and serve with steak.
