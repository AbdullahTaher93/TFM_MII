Rub sirloin steaks with vegetable oil and season with salt and pepper. Let the steaks warm at room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray. Spread French fries onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake French fries in the preheated oven until slightly browned, about 15 minutes. While the fries bake, cook steaks on preheated grill until beginning to firm and are hot and slightly pink in the center, 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Remove steaks to a cutting board. Mix romaine lettuce, cucumber, and egg together in a salad bowl. Pile French fries atop the salad mixture. Cut steaks into bite-size pieces and arrange atop the French fries. Sprinkle croutons and mozzarella cheese over the entire salad.
