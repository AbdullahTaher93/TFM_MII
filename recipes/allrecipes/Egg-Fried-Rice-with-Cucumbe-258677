Beat eggs with 1 pinch salt in a bowl until frothy. Heat lard in a skillet over medium heat; cook eggs, stirring with a wooden spoon to break into small pieces, until set, about 5 minutes. Add cucumber; cook and stir until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix rice into egg mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring often, until rice is heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with remaining salt and MSG.
