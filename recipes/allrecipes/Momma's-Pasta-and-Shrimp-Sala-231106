Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain. Transfer warm macaroni into a large salad bowl and gently mix in celery, onion, cucumber, tomato, shrimp, and Italian salad dressing; refrigerate at least 1 hour (up to overnight for best flavor). Gently fold mayonnaise into salad and serve.
