Place popcorn in a large baking pan; keep warm in a 200 degrees F oven. In a heavy saucepan, combine sugar, corn syrup, water and salt. Cook over medium heat until a candy thermometer reads 235 degrees F (soft-ball stage). Remove from the heat. Add butter, vanilla and food coloring if desired; stir until butter is melted. Immediately pour over popcorn and stir until evenly coated. When mixture is cool enough to handle, quickly shape into 3-in. balls, dipping hands in cold water to prevent sticking.
