Wash and dry apples. Insert one popsicle stick in the core of each apple. Place unwrapped caramels and evaporated milk in stainless steel melting bowl or another 1-quart microwave safe bowl. Microwave on high, stirring every 30-45 seconds until fully melted and smooth, about 2 minutes. Carefully dip each apple in the melted caramel, using a spoon to cover. The caramel thickens as it cools so it is best to work quickly. If necessary, return the caramel to the microwave for 30 seconds at a time to return it to dipping consistency. Place apples on wax paper-lined cookie sheet. Meanwhile, place dark chocolate into a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave on 80% heat setting, stirring every 30 seconds until melted, about 60 seconds. Repeat with Caramel Milk Chocolate. Be careful not to burn chocolate. Apply chocolate and candies as pictured to finish off Funny Face Caramel Apples!
