Prepare cake batter according to package directions. Pour into three greased and floured 9-in. baking pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to wire racks to cool completely. In a bowl, combine the sour cream, coconut, pecans and sugar. Place one cake on a serving platter; spread with a third of the sour cream mixture. Repeat layers twice. Store in the refrigerator.
