If using wooden skewers, begin soaking them in water. Rinse chicken and pat dry; cut each thigh into quarters. Peel onion and cut in half crosswise, then cut each half into quarters. Combine chicken, onion, and sesame ginger marinade in a heavy plastic food bag. Seal bag, turn to coat, and chill for at least 20 minutes or up to 10 hours. Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for direct heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is directly under the food). Use a vegetable peeler to cut the carrots lengthwise into long ribbons. Drain marinade from bag into a bowl. Add carrot ribbons to marinade and mix to coat. Thread chicken onto metal or soaked wooden skewers, alternating with onion, tomatoes, and carrot strips, folded like ribbon candy; or wrap carrot strips around pieces of chicken before threading (there won't be enough to wrap all pieces). Discard marinade. Lay skewers on grill over a solid bed of medium hot coals or medium high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand just above grill level only 3 to 4 seconds). Keep charcoal grill uncovered; close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning once with tongs, until chicken is no longer pink in center (cut to test), about 10 minutes. Serve immediately.
