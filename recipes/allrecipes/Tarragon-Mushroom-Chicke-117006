Place the chicken in a 5-qt. slow cooker. In a small bowl, combine the soup, mushrooms, sherry or broth, butter, tarragon, Worcestershire sauce and garlic powder; pour over chicken. Cover and cook on low for 4-5 hours or until chicken juices run clear. Remove chicken and keep warm. Place the flour in a small saucepan; gradually whisk in cooking liquid until blended. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Serve over chicken.
