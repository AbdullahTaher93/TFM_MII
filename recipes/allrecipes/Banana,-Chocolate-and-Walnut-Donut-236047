Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C); place rack in middle of oven. Lightly oil two doughnut pans. Combine coconut milk and vinegar in bowl; set aside. (Mixture will appear clumpy like buttermilk.) Stir together the bananas and vanilla in a separate bowl. Sift together the white and wheat flours, baking soda, sea salt, baking powder, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg into a large bowl. Whisk dry ingredients again in the bowl. Pour coconut milk mixture into banana mixture; combine thoroughly. Add coconut oil and mix again. Add wet mixture to dry ingredients. Mix just until combined; do not over mix. Quickly portion batter into doughnut pans; try to keep the surface level. Bake 26 minutes. Let doughnuts cool in the pan for 5 minutes on a wire rack. Then carefully remove them by flipping them out of the pans onto the rack; cool completely before glazing. For glaze, sift confectioners' sugar and cocoa into a small bowl. Stir in milk and vanilla for a thick but easy to drizzle consistency. Hold doughnut over the glaze, and with a spoon drizzle glaze back and forth over the surface. Sprinkle with toppings after each doughnut is glazed so toppings will stick.
