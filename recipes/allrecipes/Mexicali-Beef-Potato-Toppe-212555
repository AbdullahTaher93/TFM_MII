Cook the beef in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat. Reduce the heat to medium. Stir the soup and salsa in the skillet and cook until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Spoon the beef mixture over the potatoes. Top with the sour cream and olives, if desired.
