Place chicken in a large slow cooker. Pour in enough boiling water to completely cover the chicken, and add 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cover, and set slow cooker to HIGH. Cook until the chicken meat turns white. Add the peppers and onions. Simmer until peppers and onions get a little tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce, chili sauce, and ketchup. Cover, set slow cooker to LOW, and cook for about 6 hours.
