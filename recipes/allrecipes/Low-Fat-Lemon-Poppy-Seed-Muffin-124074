In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, poppy seeds and baking powder. Combine eggs, milk, applesauce and lemon extract; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups about three-fourths full. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until muffins test done.
