Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate, then crumble. Toss broccoli, grapes, celery, jicama, and green onions together in a large bowl. Whisk mayonnaise, sugar, vinegar, and curry powder in a bowl until well blended. Pour dressing over vegetables and toss with crumbled bacon and pine nuts.
