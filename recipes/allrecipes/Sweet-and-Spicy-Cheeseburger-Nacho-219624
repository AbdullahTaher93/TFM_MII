In a large saucepan over medium high heat, cook beef and garlic for 6 to 8 minutes, or until cooked through, stirring frequently. Drain fat if needed. Reduce heat to medium, and stir in salsa con queso, jalapeno, red pepper flakes and hot pepper sauce. Cover and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, or until heated through, stirring frequently. Meanwhile, combine Cranberry Sauce and Chili Sauce in a medium saucepan over medium heat, and simmer until smooth, about 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. To serve, arrange tortilla chips on plates. Spoon cheese mixture on top of tortillas and drizzle with cranberry mixture. Sprinkle onions on top and serve immediately.
