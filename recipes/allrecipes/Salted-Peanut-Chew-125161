In a mixing bowl, combine flour, brown sugar and 1/2 cup butter; mix well. Press into an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Sprinkle marshmallows over top and return to the oven for 3 to 5 minutes or until marshmallows begin to melt; set aside. In a large saucepan, cook and stir peanut butter chips, corn syrup, vanilla and remaining butter until chips are melted and smooth. Remove from the heat; stir in cereal and peanuts. Pour over prepared crust, spreading to cover. Cool before cutting into bars.
