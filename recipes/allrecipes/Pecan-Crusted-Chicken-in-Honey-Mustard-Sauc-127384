Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Mix coating mix and pecans in shallow dish or pie plate; set aside. Beat eggs with water in separate shallow dish. Dip chicken in egg mixture, then in pecan mixture, turning to evenly coat both sides. Place on foil-covered baking sheet. Bake 18 to 20 min. or until chicken is cooked through. Meanwhile, mix dressing and mustard. Serve chicken with sauce on the side.
