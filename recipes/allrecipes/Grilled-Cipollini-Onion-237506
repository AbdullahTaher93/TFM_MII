Fill a shallow dish with water; soak wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes. Place onions, basil, oil, and salt in a bowl; toss to coat onions. Refrigerate until flavors blend, 30 to 60 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Thread onions onto prepared skewers, weaving basil between onions. Cook onions on the preheated grill, turning once, until sweet and tender, about 10 minutes.
