Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Heat the oil in a 10-inch ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage and brown slightly. Add the roasted red peppers and garlic, cook for 1 minute. Reduce heat. In a mixing bowl, whisk eggs. Add parsley, pepper, cheese and Tabasco. Stir. Pour egg mixture over sausage and peppers. Cook on low heat for 7-8 minutes until the bottom is set and the top is a little runny. Place the skillet in the oven and cook until the eggs are set and golden brown, about 6-7 minutes. When done, remove and carefully slide Frittata onto a serving platter. Slice and serve.
