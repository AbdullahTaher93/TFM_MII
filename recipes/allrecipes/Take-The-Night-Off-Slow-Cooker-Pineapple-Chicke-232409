Place chicken breasts into the bottom of a slow cooker. Pour pineapple chunks with juice over chicken. Drizzle with honey and soy sauce and sprinkle with brown sugar and ginger. Set cooker on High and cook for 1 hour. Reduce setting to Low and cook until chicken is cooked through, moist, and tender, about 6 more hours.
