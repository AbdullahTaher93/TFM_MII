Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt together in a large bowl. Beat eggs in a separate bowl; stir in buttermilk, molasses, and vegetable oil until smooth. Mix buttermilk mixture into flour mixture until batter is just moistened; fold in pears. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
