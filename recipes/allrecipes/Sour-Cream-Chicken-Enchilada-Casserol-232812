Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Layer tortilla chips in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Mix chicken, cream of chicken soup, sour cream, and green chile peppers in a bowl; spoon onto crushed tortilla chips. Sprinkle Colby-Jack cheese over chicken layer. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and cheese is melted, about 30 minutes.
