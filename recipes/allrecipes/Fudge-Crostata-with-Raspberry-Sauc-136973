Make pie crusts as directed on box for Two-Crust Pie using 10-inch tart pan with removable bottom or 9-inch glass pie pan. Place 1 crust in pan; press in bottom and up side of pan. Trim edge if necessary. Place cookie sheet on middle oven rack in oven to preheat; heat oven to 375 degrees F. In 1-quart saucepan, melt chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons of the butter over low heat, stirring constantly, until smooth. In medium bowl, mix remaining 6 tablespoons butter and 2/3 cup sugar with wire whisk until light and fluffy. Stir in almonds, 1 egg, the egg yolk and melted chocolate until well blended. Spread mixture evenly over bottom of crust-lined pan. Cut second crust into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Arrange strips in lattice design over chocolate mixture. Trim and seal edge. Place tart on preheated cookie sheet in oven; bake 45 to 50 minutes or until crust is golden brown. During last 10 to 15 minutes of baking, cover crust edge with strips of foil to prevent excessive browning. Cool completely, about 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, in blender or food processor, blend raspberries on high speed until smooth. Place strainer over 1-quart saucepan; pour berries into strainer. Press berries with back of spoon through strainer to remove seeds; discard seeds. Stir in 3/4 cup sugar and the lemon juice. Heat mixture to boiling, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to medium-low; boil 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Cool; refrigerate until serving time. Before serving, garnish crostata with whipped cream, chocolate curls and whole raspberries. Serve with raspberry sauce. Store in refrigerator.
