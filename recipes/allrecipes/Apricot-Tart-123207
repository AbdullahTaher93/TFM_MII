In a large mixing bowl, beat butter, cream cheese and flour until well blended. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. For filling, in a saucepan, bring the apricots and water to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl. Add the pecans, sugar, marmalade, cinnamon and cloves; set aside. Shape dough into 24 balls. Press onto the bottom and up the sides of greased miniature muffins cups. Spoon apricot mixture into cups. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until browned. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pans to a wire rack to cool completely. For topping, in a small mixing bowl, combine cream cheese and butter. Stir in vanilla. Beat in confectioners' sugar. Place a dollop onto each tart just before serving.
