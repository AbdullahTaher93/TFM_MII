Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Lightly grease one cookie sheet. Dissolve bouillon cubes in boiling water and allow to cool. Combine the flour, dry milk, egg, oil, beef broth and brown sugar. Mix well and knead dough for 1 minute. On a floured surface roll out dough to about 1/4 inch thickness. Cut out bones and place on cookie sheet. Bake for 30 minutes and allow to cool.
