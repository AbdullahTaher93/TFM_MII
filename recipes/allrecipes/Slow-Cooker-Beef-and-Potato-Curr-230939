In a 5- to 6-1/2-quart (5 to 6.5 L) slow cooker, combine flour and curry powder; add beef and toss to coat. Stir in potatoes, garlic, carrots and ginger. Whisk tomato paste into beef broth and pour over beef mixture. Cover and cook on Low for 8 to 10 hours or on High for 4 to 6 hours or until beef is fork-tender. Stir in green beans and cream, cover and cook on High for 15 minutes or until beans are tender-crisp. Season to taste with salt. Top each serving with a dollop of yogurt and sprinkle with coriander and almonds (if using).
