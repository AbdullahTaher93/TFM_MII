In a skillet, cook sausage until no longer pink. Drain and set aside. Place the pita halves in an ungreased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 300 degrees F for 5 minutes. In a bowl, beat eggs, milk, oregano, salt and pepper. Pour into a lightly greased skillet. Cook and stir gently over medium heat until the eggs are completely set. Stir in sausage. Place a half slice of cheese in each pita half; spoon about 1/3 cup of egg mixture into each. Serve warm.
