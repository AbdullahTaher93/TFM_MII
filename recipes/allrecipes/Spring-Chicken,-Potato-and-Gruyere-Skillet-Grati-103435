Preheat broiler. Melt butter in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in garlic, cook about 10 seconds until sizzling. Add chicken broth, cream, salt and nutmeg. Add potatoes and chicken. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover tightly and simmer for 15 minutes, or until potatoes are tender and sauce has thickened. Do not stir. Remove from heat, wrap skillet handle with foil if not oven safe. Top with cheese. Broil 3 to 5 minutes or until cheese begins to brown. Top with chives.
