Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water for 10-15 minutes or until tender. Drain, rinse in cold water and set aside. Cook the beans in boiling water for 3 minutes or until just tender. Drain, rinse in cold water and set aside. Place the eggs in a small pan, cover with cold water and slowly bring to the boil. Simmer for 6 minutes, drain, rinse in cold water. Shell the eggs and cut into quarters. Place the potatoes, beans and eggs together in a large salad bowl with the remaining ingredients. To make the dressing, place all the ingredients in a small bowl and whisk together with a fork. To serve, drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss to mix.
