Toss together chicken pieces, black pepper, salt, paprika, rosemary, thyme, oregano, sage, white pepper, and cayenne in a large bowl to coat. Stir in buttermilk until chicken is coated. Refrigerate for 6 hours. Combine flour, salt, paprika, cayenne, garlic powder, white pepper, and onion powder in a large shallow dish. Remove chicken from the buttermilk and dredge each piece in the seasoned flour. Shake off any excess and transfer to a plate. Heat peanut oil in a large Dutch oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add all the chicken to the pan and cook for 10 minutes. Turn chicken pieces and cook for another 10-15 minutes. Remove chicken from the oil and transfer to a cooling rack set over a paper towel lined baking sheet. Let sit for 10 minutes before serving.
