Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Combine cookie dough and almonds in medium bowl. Refrigerate 15 minutes for easier handling. Shape dough into 20 1-inch balls; place on ungreased baking sheets. Bake for 16 to 18 minutes or until light golden brown around edges. Cool on baking sheets on wire racks for 2 minutes; remove to wire racks to cool completely. Line baking sheets with wax paper. Microwave morsels in a small, uncovered, microwave-safe bowl on High (100%) power for 1 minute; Stir. The morsels may retain some of their original shape. If necessary, microwave at additional 10 to 15-second intervals, stirring just until smooth. Dip cookies halfway into chocolate; shake off excess. Place on prepared baking sheets; refrigerate for 15 minutes or until coating is set.
