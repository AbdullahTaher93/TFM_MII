Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease an 18 quart roasting pan. Place the ham, with the fattier side up, in the roaster. Use toothpicks to secure pineapple rings on the ham. Pour the beer over the ham. Place lid on roasting pan. Bake 6 to 8 hours, or until cooked through. Remove the pineapple rings and let sit 15 minutes before slicing.
