In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir in sugar; let stand for 5 minutes. Add the wheat germ, oil, honey, sage, salt, rosemary, nutmeg and 1-1/2 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Shape each portion into two oval loaves. Place on a greased baking sheet. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 15 minutes. With a sharp knife, make three shallow slashes across the top of each loaf. Bake at 400 degrees F for 13-17 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to wire racks to cool.
