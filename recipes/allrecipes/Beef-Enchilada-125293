In a skillet, brown the ground beef. Drain. Combine with cottage cheese, olives, parsley, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Place about 1/3 cup filling on each tortilla; roll up. Place tortillas, seam side down, in an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. For sauce, saute the onion and green pepper in oil until tender. Add tomato sauce, green chilies, chili powder, sugar and garlic powder. Pour over tortillas. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes. Sprinkle with cheese and return to the oven for 5 minutes or until cheese melts.
