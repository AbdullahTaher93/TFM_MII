Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and lightly butter a loaf pan. Stir together flour, powdered sugar, pecans, crystallized ginger and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Add in 1/2 cup butter and mix well to form a soft dough. Press into the bottom of prepared pan and bake for 25 minutes. Set aside to cool, then break into a rough crumble, leaving some larger and smaller pieces. Melt remaining butter and cinnamon with brown sugar in a large bowl in the microwave. Toss fruit in butter mixture then grill over high heat for about 1 to 2 minutes on each side to lightly brown. Remove from grill. Place ice cream in bowls and top with warm fruit and sprinkle with crumbled shortbread.
