Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat bottom of a Dutch oven with olive oil and place over high-heat. Sear chicken until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a warm plate. Stir onion, garlic, black pepper, salt, and red pepper flakes into the Dutch oven; cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in chicken broth and return to a simmer. Remove from heat. Return chicken to the Dutch oven. Stir in artichoke hearts, cherry peppers, lemon juice, and thyme. Cover Dutch oven and place in the preheated oven. Cook until chicken is tender, about 1 hour. Remove Dutch oven and transfer chicken to a warm plate. Stir beans into the Dutch oven with broth and artichoke mixture. Serve each chicken leg quarter in a bowl. Pour a ladle-full of artichoke, bean, and broth mixture over each.
