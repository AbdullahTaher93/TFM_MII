Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Whisk kosher salt, black pepper, granulated garlic, onion powder, oregano, cayenne pepper, rosemary, sage, lemon pepper, seasoned salt, and beef bouillon together in a small bowl. Sprinkle spice mixture on all sides of roast and rub spices into meat. Heat a skillet over high heat. Cook roast in hot skillet until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer meat, fat-side facing up, to a roasting pan. Cover the roasting pan with aluminum foil. Roast in the preheated oven until just turning from pink to grey, about 90 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 150 degrees F (65 degrees C). Uncover roast and tent loosely with aluminum foil; let rest for 10 minutes before slicing across the grain.
