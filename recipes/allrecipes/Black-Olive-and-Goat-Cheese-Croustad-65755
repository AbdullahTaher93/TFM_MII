Heat butter in a small saute pan over medium heat. Add leeks and cook for 3-4 minutes until soft. Remove from heat and stir in olives. Set aside. Cut pizza dough into 20 (1/2 ounce) pieces. Shape into 2-inch circles and place on a lightly greased parchment lined baking sheet. Bake in a 400 degree oven for 7-8 minutes. Remove from oven and spread each disk with olive mixture. Top with goat cheese and bake for an additional 5-7 minutes at 400 degrees. Sprinkle with fresh herbs just before serving.
