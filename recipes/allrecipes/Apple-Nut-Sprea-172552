In a 6- to 8-inch frying pan, stir almonds over medium-high heat until golden, about 4 minutes. Pour from pan. In a food processor or blender, whirl applesauce, cottage cheese, orange peel, cinnamon, and nutmeg until smooth; scrape container sides often. Stir in almonds and sugar to taste. Cover and chill at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.
