In a bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, combine the cereal and milk; let stand for 5 minutes. Add the egg, honey and butter to cereal mixture; mix well. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in raisins. Pour into a greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
