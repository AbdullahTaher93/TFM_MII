Cook for 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft. Add the corn and broth. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium. Simmer for 15 minutes. Place the flour in a medium bowl. Gradually add the milk, whisking until smooth. Pour into the Dutch oven. Stir until well blended. Add the basil and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, or until the soup thickens.
