Combine garlic, tapioca flour, fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and white pepper in a bowl; add prawns and toss to coat. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a heavy skillet over high heat. Add 1/2 of the prawns in single layer; fry until golden brown and crispy, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining oil and remaining prawns.
