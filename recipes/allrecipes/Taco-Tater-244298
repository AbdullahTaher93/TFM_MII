Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add corn, salsa, processed cheese, cream cheese, and taco seasoning to ground beef and stir until combined. Spread beef mixture over bottom of 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange potato nuggets over beef mixture, sprinkle black olives, jalapenos, and Cheddar cheese on top. Bake in preheated oven until potato nuggets are crisp and cheese is bubbly, about 25 minutes. Garnish with sour cream.
