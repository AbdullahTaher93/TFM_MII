Set peeled onion upright on a sheet of foil. Make several deep slices in the onion without cutting completely through the onion. Pour butter over the onion. Sprinkle with seasoned salt, salt, pepper, and garlic pepper. Place the onion on a grill directly above a hot campfire, and cook until the onion is soft, about 20 minutes.
