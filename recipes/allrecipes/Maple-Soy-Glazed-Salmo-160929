Soak the cedar plank in water for 2 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. Place the cedar plank across the grate of the grill as it preheats. Season the salmon fillet with salt and pepper, and place onto the hot cedar plank skin-side down. Close the lid on the grill, and whisk together the maple syrup, soy sauce, butter, lime juice, and lime zest. Baste the salmon with the glaze, and continue cooking until the salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes total. Serve the salmon garnished with chopped fresh chives and lemon wedges.
