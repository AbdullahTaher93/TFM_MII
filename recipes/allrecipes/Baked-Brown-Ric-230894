Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Toast rice and butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until rice gives off a nutty fragrance, about 5 minutes. Transfer rice to a Dutch oven or lidded casserole dish. Bring chicken broth, olive oil, salt, black pepper, onion powder, and cayenne pepper to a boil in the same saucepan; pour over rice and stir to combine. Cover and bake in preheated oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes.
