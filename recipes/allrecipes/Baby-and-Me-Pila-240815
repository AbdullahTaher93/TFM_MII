Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine millet, amaranth, quinoa, and brown rice in a bowl and rinse in warm water thoroughly, changing water 2 or 3 times. Stir soy milk, water, and oil together in a baking dish. Stir sea salt, roasted garlic, and dill into the soy milk mixture; add grains mixture and stir gently. Bake in preheated oven until most of the liquid is absorbed, 30 to 45 minutes.
