Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and lightly flour two 8-inch round cake pans. Set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar, salt, baking soda, baking powder and cinnamon. In a large bowl, beat together the eggs, oil and vanilla until smooth. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the egg mixture. The dough will be very thick at this point. Fold in the pineapple and pumpkin until well combined. Fold in the carrots and then the nuts and coconut until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared cake pans and bake for 50-60 minutes until the cakes are browned on top and a toothpick inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in their pans on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Turn them out onto the wire rack and let cool completely before frosting. Frosting: In a large bowl, beat together the butter, cream cheese and lemon juice until smooth. Gradually beat in the powdered sugar until light and fluffy. Fold in the coconut and walnuts. To frost the cake, place one cake layer on a cake stand or serving platter. Use a spatula to cover with a thick layer of frosting. Stack the other cake layer on top of the frosted layer. Cover the top and sides with the remaining frosting. Garnish with additional walnuts, if desired. Keep leftover cake refrigerated.
