Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Stir together the paprika, garlic powder, onion salt, and red pepper in a shallow bowl. Coat the chicken breasts with the seasoning, and set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the corn, grape tomatoes, and green onions until the tomatoes are soft and begin to release their juice, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Grill the seasoned chicken on the preheated grill until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and shows grill marks, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer the grilled chicken breasts to a platter and allow to stand about 5 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil; cook the fettuccini in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain. Combine the fettuccini, Cajun seasoning, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and any juices from the chicken in a large bowl; toss to coat evenly. Slice the chicken diagonally across the grain. Divide the pasta between 4 plates and top each plate with sliced chicken and corn-tomato mixture.
