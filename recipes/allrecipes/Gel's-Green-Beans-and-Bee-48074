In a large skillet over medium heat, mix the ground beef, ginger, garlic, onion powder, and pepper. Cook and stir until the beef is evenly browned. Mix soy sauce and honey into the beef mixture. Stir in the green beans. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 7 to 10 minutes, until beans are tender. In a small bowl, mix the flour and water. Stir into the beef and bean mixture, and continue cooking about 5 minutes, until thickened.
