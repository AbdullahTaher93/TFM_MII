Place chicken into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes. Transfer chicken to a work surface to cool; shred. Heat canola oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, Anaheim pepper, jalapeno pepper, and garlic until slightly softened and fragrant, about 8 minutes. Add shredded chicken, chicken stock, tomatoes, tomato sauce, mango, lime juice, lime zest, cilantro, chili powder, cumin, sea salt, black pepper, sugar, and cinnamon; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until chicken filling is reduced, at least 45 minutes. Fill corn tortillas with chicken filling.
