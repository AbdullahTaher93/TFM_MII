Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Shape beef chuck into 12 patties. Grill patties on preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Place 2 slices mozzarella cheese on each patty about 1 minute before removing from grill. Place patties on hamburger buns. Mix tomato sauce, oregano, minced onion, salt, pepper, and garlic powder in a bowl; cover and heat in the microwave on high until heated through, about 5 minutes. Spread tomato sauce mixture over burgers to serve.
