Heat vegetable oil in a wok over high heat. When the oil is hot, stir in ginger and minced chiles; cook and stir until the ginger is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add baby corn, red pepper, and bok choy stalks; stir fry until the red pepper has begun to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in bok choy leaves and bean sprouts; cook until the leaves have darkened and wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in fish sauce and oyster sauce; sprinkle with green onions, and stir together. Serve sprinkled with chopped cilantro and toasted sesame seeds.
