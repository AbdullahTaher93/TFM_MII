In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut in shortening until crumbly. In a small bowl, combine eggs and milk; stir into crumb mixture just until moistened. Fold in blueberries. Pour the batter into two greased 9-in. round baking pans. Sprinkle with coconut. Bake at 375 degrees for 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Serve warm.
