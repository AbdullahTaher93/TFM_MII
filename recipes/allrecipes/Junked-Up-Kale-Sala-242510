Place kale in a large bowl. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over kale and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Massage oil and salt into kale until evenly coated, adding more oil or salt if needed. Mash garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt together using a mortar and pestle until it forms a paste; add 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil and mix well. Spoon garlic mixture over kale. Crush walnuts using the mortar and pestle until a granular texture forms; add to kale mixture. Pour lemon juice into mortar to loosen any remaining walnut and garlic pieces and pour over kale mixture. Mix kale mixture together using your hands until evenly mixed. Mix wild rice, apples, dried cranberries, Italian cheese blend, sesame seeds, chia seeds, hemp seeds, flax seeds, and bread crumbs into kale mixture using your hands until salad is evenly combined. Transfer salad to serving bowls and top with blue cheese.
