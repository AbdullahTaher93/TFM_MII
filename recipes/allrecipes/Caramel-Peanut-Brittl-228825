Place candies, caramels, butter and water in a heavy bottomed, medium sized saucepan. Over low heat, heat mixture until caramels and candies are completely melted, stirring very often. Add the peanuts and cook 2 minutes more. Stir in the baking soda and vanilla. Immediately spread out thinly onto a cookie sheet to cool. Break into pieces.
