Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking dish. Beat bananas, cream cheese, and oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add cake mix and continue beating for 3 minutes more; spread into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.
