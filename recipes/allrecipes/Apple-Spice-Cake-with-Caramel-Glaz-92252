In the large bowl of an electric mixer, beat butter with sugar on high speed until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating until well blended. In another bowl, mix flour, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt. Add dry ingredients to butter mixture; stir on lowest speed to incorporate, then beat until well blended. With a spoon, stir in the chopped apples. Scrape batter into a greased and floured 10-cup plain or decorated tube pan. Bake in a 325 degree F oven until cake is golden brown and top springs back when lightly pressed, about 1 hour. Cool cake in pan on a rack for 30 minutes. Invert a serving platter onto pan, then hold together and turn over to release cake; lift off pan. When cake is cold, wrap airtight and let stand at room temperature up to 1 day. In a 3- to 4-quart pan, combine brown sugar, Lucerne Sweet Cream Butter, Lucerne Whipping Cream, and ground cinnamon. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; stir often. Reduce heat and boil caramel gently 5 more minutes; stir occasionally. Transfer to an airtight storage container, stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla, then cover and chill up to 1 day. Up to 1 hour before serving time, reheat caramel glaze until liquid enough to drizzle: place in a microwave oven on full power for 30 second intervals, stirring; or stir in a pan over medium heat. Spoon half the glaze over cake, letting it drip down the sides. Offer remaining glaze in a small bowl so guests can add more to taste.
