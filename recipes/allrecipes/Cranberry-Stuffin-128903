Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish. Combine the bread, cranberries, raisins, and walnuts in a large bowl. Whisk together the brown sugar and butter in a separate bowl; season with cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt; stir into the bread cubes until evenly distributed. Spread the mixture into the prepared dish. Bake in the preheated oven until crisp on top, 45 to 60 minutes.
