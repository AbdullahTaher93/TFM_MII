Heat olive oil and butter in a large stockpot over medium heat; cook and stir onions and celery in the hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Add wine; raise heat to medium-high and cook until wine is reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix potatoes, fish stock, thyme, seafood seasoning, bay leaf, salt, and pepper into onion mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover stockpot, and simmer until potatoes are tender but not falling apart, 10 to 15 minutes. Heat cream in a small saucepan over medium heat just until cream is steaming, about 5 minutes. Stir cream and sea bass into potato mixture; cook until sea bass is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Season chowder with sugar, hot sauce, salt, and pepper.
