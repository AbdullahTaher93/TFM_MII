Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil grate. In large bowl, combine ground beef, ground lamb, onion, garlic and bread crumbs. Season with savory, allspice, coriander, salt, pepper and cumin. Knead until mixture is stiff. Shape into 4 very thin patties (1/8 inch to 1/4 inch thick). Cook patties for 5 to 7 minutes on each side, or until cooked through.
