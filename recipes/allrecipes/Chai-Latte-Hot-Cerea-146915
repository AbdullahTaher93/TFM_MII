In medium saucepan, bring 1 cup soy milk, water, and spices to boil over medium-high heat. Stir in cereal. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring frequently, until cereal is tender but still chewy and liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Stir in remaining soy milk and honey. Divide cereal between 2 bowls and top with raspberries.
