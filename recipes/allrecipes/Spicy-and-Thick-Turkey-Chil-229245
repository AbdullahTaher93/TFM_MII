Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onions, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and garlic in hot oil until the onion is translucent, 7 to 10 minutes. Crumble ground turkey into small pieces and add to the pot. Place a cover on the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until turkey is cooked through and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Season turkey with chili powder, oregano, paprika, cumin, seasoned salt, red pepper flakes, ground black pepper, and cocoa powder. Add diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, red chili beans, black beans, tomato paste, light beer, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke, and tomato juice to the pot. Loosely cover the pot and cook mixture at a simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened but still moist, for about 1 hour. Stir reserved liquid from diced tomatoes with green chilies into chili as it simmers to keep it from becoming too dry. Stir hot pepper sauce through the chili. Reduce heat to low and cook another 10 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving.
