Combine the tomatoes, onion, garlic, apple juice, and cayenne pepper in a soup pot. Bring to a boil. Place the bay leaf, cloves, celery seed and peppercorns into a spice bag or wrap in cheesecloth. Add to the pot and continue to boil, stirring frequently until the mixture has reduced by half. Remove the spice bag and stir in the lemon juice. Continue to boil for 10 more minutes, then remove from the heat. Pour into a container with a lid and refrigerate until using. Use or freeze within 1 week.
