Mix cream cheese and egg yolks together in a bowl with an electric mixer. Stir lemon juice and salt together in a separate small bowl. Transfer cream cheese mixture to saucepan over low heat; whisk in lemon juice mixture. Increase heat to medium-low; bring cream cheese mixture to a boil, whisking constantly, about 3 minutes. Whisk milk in gradually until desired consistency is reached. Continue to cook, whisking constantly, until smooth sauce forms, 1 to 2 minutes.
