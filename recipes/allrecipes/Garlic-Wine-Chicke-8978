In a medium skillet, heat oil for frying. Dredge chicken breast in flour and place it in the hot skillet. Add pepper to taste. Cook until golden brown on one side, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn chicken over (presentation side up) and add the garlic, mushrooms, juice from 1/2 lemon and wine. Stir all together. Turn heat up as high as possible and let liquids reduce until about 1/4 cup liquid remains in skillet. Remove chicken from skillet and add the room temperature butter. Swirl it around in the skillet sauce until it is incorporated and the sauce is slightly thickened. Pour sauce over chicken and serve with pasta.
