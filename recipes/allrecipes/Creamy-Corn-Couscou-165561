Place the couscous in a bowl, and stir in the boiling water. Cover, and let stand for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, bring the cream-style corn, butter, and mozzarella cheese to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat. Once the corn is hot, fold it into the couscous, and season to taste with salt and pepper.
