Whisk together the mayonnaise, Dijonnaise, and paprika in a large bowl. Reserve 1/4 cup of the mayonnaise. Add the green onion, parsley, celery and eggs to the remaining mayonnaise and gently fold to combine; season with salt and pepper to taste. Brush the bread on both sides with some of the oil and grill on a grill or grill pan until lightly golden brown or place on a baking sheet and place under the broiler for 45 seconds per side. Spread some of the reserved mayonnaise on each slice of bread. Divide the egg salad among the 8 slices of bread, top with slices of onion and a few parsley leaves.
