In a Dutch oven, brown the roast in oil. Combine salt, pepper and thyme; sprinkle over meat. Add bay leaf and 2 cups of water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 2-1/2 hours. Add potatoes, carrots and onions. Cover and simmer 45 minutes longer or until the meat and vegetables are tender. Remove the roast and vegetables to a serving platter; keep warm. Discard bay leaf. Skim fat from pan juices; add water to measure 2 cups. Mix flour and remaining water until smooth; stir into juices. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly; cook and stir 1 minute longer. Stir in browning sauce if desired. Season with salt and pepper. Slice roast; serve with vegetables and gravy.
