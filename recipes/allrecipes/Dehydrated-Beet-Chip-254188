Peel and slice beets as thinly as possible with a sharp knife or mandoline. Combine sliced beets, water, apple cider vinegar, and olive oil in a large bowl. Let marinate, at least 10 minutes. Arrange beets in a single layer on food dehydrator trays. Sprinkle fleur de sel over beets. Store any beets that don't fit in the refrigerator. Dehydrate according to manufacturer's instructions, 8 to 12 hours.
