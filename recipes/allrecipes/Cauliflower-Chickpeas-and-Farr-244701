Toast the almonds in a 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat until lightly browned. Remove the almonds from the skillet and set aside. Heat the oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, garlic and garam masala and cook for 2 minutes or until the onion is tender-crisp, stirring occasionally. Stir the broth and farro in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 10 minutes. Stir the cauliflower and chickpeas in the skillet. Cover and cook for 5-10 minutes or until the farro is just tender and the cauliflower is tender-crisp. Stir in the orange zest and season to taste. Sprinkle with the toasted almonds and the parsley.
