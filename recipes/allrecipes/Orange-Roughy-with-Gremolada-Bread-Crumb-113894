Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Season the orange-roughy fillets with 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/8 teaspoon of pepper. Put the fish fillets in a glass or stainless-steel baking dish and add the wine and the 1/4 cup oil to the dish. Bake the fish until just done, about 12 minutes for 3/4-inch-thick fillets. Meanwhile, in a small frying pan, toast the bread crumbs over low heat, stirring, until they're light brown and fragrant, about 4 minutes. Stir in the garlic, lemon zest, and parsley and cook 1 minute longer. Remove from the heat and stir in 1/8 teaspoon each salt and pepper and the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Transfer the fish to plates. Sprinkle with the bread crumbs and spoon the pan juices around the fish.
