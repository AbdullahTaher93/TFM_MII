Preheat grill to medium heat. Place ribs on grill over indirect heat. Grill until ribs are done and tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours; turn occasionally. Meanwhile, in small bowl, stir together remaining ingredients. Baste ribs with BBQ sauce during last 20 minutes of grilling time, turning as necessary to coat all surfaces.
