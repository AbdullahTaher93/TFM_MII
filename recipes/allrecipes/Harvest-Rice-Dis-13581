Combine rice and broth in saucepan and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 35-45 minutes, until rice is tender and broth is absorbed. In medium skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add onions and sugar. Saute until butter is absorbed and onions are translucent and soft. Lower heat and cook onions for another 20 minutes, until they are caramelized. Stir in cranberries and mushrooms. Cover skillet and cook for 10 minutes or until berries start to swell. Stir in nuts and orange zest, then fold this mixture into the cooked rice. Add salt and pepper to taste.
