In heavy saucepan, over low heat, melt chocolate with sweetened condensed milk, and vanilla; cook and stir until smooth. Making 1 sandwich at a time, spread 1 tablespoon chocolate mixture on each of 2 whole graham crackers; sprinkle 1 graham cracker with marshmallow and gently press second graham cracker chocolate side down on top. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Carefully break each sandwich in half before serving. Wrap with plastic wrap; store at room temperature.
