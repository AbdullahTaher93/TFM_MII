Blend together butters, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and vanilla in a medium mixing bowl. Blend until butter is softened. Add egg substitute, water and vinegar. Mix briefly. Add flours, salt and baking powder. Mix with electric mixer on low speed (or by hand) until dough is formed. Do not overmix. Remove dough from bowl and place on a floured work surface. Divide dough in half. Pat each half into a circle. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil a baking pan or cookie sheet. Set aside. Remove dough from refrigerator and roll out on a floured work surface to approximately 1/8-inch thickness. Cut with two-inch heart shaped cookie cutter. Cut small heart shapes out of the center of half of the cookies (these will be the tops of the finished cookies). Place cookies on prepared cookie sheet. Bake in preheated 350 degrees F oven 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned on the bottom. Cool on a wire rack. Lightly drizzle melted chocolate over cookies with the heart cutouts. Spread 1 tsp. raspberry jam on the remaining cookies and top with the cutout cookies.
