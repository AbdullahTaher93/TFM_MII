Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons oil, half the chicken pieces and half the garlic. Brown chicken 2 minutes on each side and remove from pan. Repeat with remaining oil, chicken and garlic. Add vinegar to skillet; cook until evaporated. Add margarine, shallots and rosemary to skillet and cook 2 minutes. Add flour and cook 1 minute more. Whisk in wine and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, reducing liquid. Whisk in broth and bring liquid to a slow boil. Return chicken to pan; simmer over medium heat 7 to 8 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink in center. Serve over pasta, if desired.
