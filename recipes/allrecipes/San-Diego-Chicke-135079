Grate the zest of the lemon and lime into a big resealable bag. Squeeze the juice from both into the bag, and throw out the pulp and seeds. Mix in everything else except the chicken and salsa. Then drop in the chicken, seal the bag, and refrigerate for a few hours or overnight. Fire up your grill to medium. Once the flame is ready, take out the chicken and grill it, turning and basting with the marinade a few times, for 10 to 15 minutes or until the center is no longer pink and the juices run clear (about 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer). Serve with the salsa.
