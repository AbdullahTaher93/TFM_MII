Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Slice chicken breasts in half, lengthwise. Combine seasoning and mayonnaise in a shallow dish or bowl and mix together. Place cereal crumbs in a separate shallow dish or bowl. Coat each piece of chicken with mayonnaise mixture, then roll in crumbs. Place coated chicken pieces in a 9x13 inch baking dish and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 1 hour. Remove foil cover and bake for 15 to 20 more minutes (this is optional; it will make the chicken crispier).
