Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir carrots, celery, red bell pepper, onion, and garlic until the vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Gently stir rice, corn, and peas into vegetables to combine. Pour chicken broth, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce into rice mixture. Season with lemon pepper, parsley, thyme, saffron, salt, and black pepper, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let pilaf stand covered until grains are separate, 10 to 15 more minutes.
