In a mixing bowl, cream butter and brown sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. In a large bowl, combine 1/4 cup flour, candied fruit, dates, raisins and nuts; toss until well coated. Set aside. Combine the baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves and remaining flour; gradually add to creamed mixture alternately with orange juice. Stir in fruit and nut mixture; mix well. Spoon into five greased 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. baking pans (pans will be full). Bake at 325 degrees F for 1 hour. Cover with foil; bake 10-15 minutes longer or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. In a bowl, combine glaze ingredients. With a pastry brush, brush glaze over warm loaves. Cool completely.
