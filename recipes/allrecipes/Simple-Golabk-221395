Heat a large pot over medium-high heat; cook and stir ground beef until crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir in cabbage, onion, garlic, and 1/4 cup water; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Pour remaining 1/4 cup water into pot; bring a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until cabbage is tender, 7 to 10 minutes.
