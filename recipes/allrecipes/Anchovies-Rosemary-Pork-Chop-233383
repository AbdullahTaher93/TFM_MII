Whisk anchovies, rosemary, olive oil, vinegar, and garlic together in a large bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Season pork chops with coarse salt and ground black pepper; add to the plastic bag with the marinade, squeeze out as much air from bag as possible, and seal. Turn bag a few times to assure chops are coated in marinade. Marinate chops in refrigerator at least 2 hours. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Prepare a jelly roll pan with cooking spray. Remove pork chops from the marinade and shake off excess moisture. Discard the remaining marinade. Cook under the broiler until no longer pink in the center, 6 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
