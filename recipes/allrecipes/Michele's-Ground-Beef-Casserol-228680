Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 13x9-inch baking dish. Cook and stir ground beef, sausage, onion, and bell pepper together in a large skillet over medium heat until the beef and sausage are completely browned and crumbled, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain grease from skillet and return to heat. Stir flour, salt, oregano, and black pepper into the beef mixture. Pour spaghetti sauce over the mixture. Add mixed vegetables; bring mixture to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Transfer mixture to prepared baking dish. Roll crescent dough into a flat layer atop the beef mixture; sprinkle with Cheddar cheese. Bake in preheated oven until the dough is golden and the cheese is melted, about 30 minutes.
