In a bowl, mix chopped tomatoes, capers, 1 teaspoon of the oregano, 1 tablespoon oil, salt and pepper to taste. Set aside. In a small, shallow bowl, combine flour, remaining oregano, and salt and pepper to taste. Dip chicken in flour to coat. In a 12-inch nonstick frying pan, heat remaining oil over medium-high heat. Add garlic and cook very briefly until pale golden (about 30 seconds). Add chicken and cook, turning once, until browned on both sides and no longer pink in center (cut to test), about 5 minutes total. Transfer chicken to individual plates. Use a slotted spoon to spoon tomato mixture over each portion. Offer feta cheese to sprinkle on top, with more tomato mixture to add to taste.
