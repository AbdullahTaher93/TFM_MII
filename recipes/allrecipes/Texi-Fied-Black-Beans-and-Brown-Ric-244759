Heat olive oil in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion, red bell pepper, 1/2 of the tomato, and garlic until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix black beans, water, salt, chili powder, paprika, and black pepper into onion mixture; simmer until heated through, about 10 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and stir cilantro and remaining tomatoes into bean mixture; serve over brown rice.
