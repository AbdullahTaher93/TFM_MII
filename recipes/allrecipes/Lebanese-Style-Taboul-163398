Bring the water to a boil in a small saucepan over high heat. Remove from the heat, stir in the bulgur, cover, and let stand 20 minutes. Scrape the bulgur into a mixing bowl, and stir in the salt, cinnamon, lemon juice, olive oil, tomatoes, onions, parsley, and mint. Stir, then refrigerate uncovered 1 hour until cold.
