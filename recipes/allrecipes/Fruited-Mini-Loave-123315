In a mixing bowl, combine sugar, butter and egg; mix well. Add pineapple and milk; mix well. Combine dry ingredients; add to butter mixture just until moistened. Stir in pecans, apricots and raisins. Pour into three greased 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45-55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pans to a wire rack to cool completely.
