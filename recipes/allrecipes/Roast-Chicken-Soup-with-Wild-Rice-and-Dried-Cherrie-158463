Heat olive oil in 3-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, carrot and celery and saute for about 4 minutes until soft and translucent. Add thyme and chicken broth and bring mixture to a boil. Add chicken, wild rice, and cherries; when mixture returns to a boil, reduce heat to simmer. Simmer for about 3 minutes or just until all ingredients are heated through. Remove from heat and stir in parsley. Serve hot.
