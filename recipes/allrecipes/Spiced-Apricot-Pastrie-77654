Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Coat baking sheets with cooking spray. Combine SMUCKER'S(R) preserves, nuts, pumpkin pie spice and orange zest; mix well. Set aside. In a separate bowl, beat butter, cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until creamy. Add flour; mix until well blended. Divide dough into thirds. On lightly floured surface, roll out each portion of dough to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut with 3-inch round cookie cutter. Spoon a heaping teaspoon of apricot filling in center of each round. Combine egg and water; brush on edges of each round. Fold opposite sides to center, slightly overlapping edges; pinch to seal. Place on lightly greased baking sheets. Bake for 10 to 14 minutes or until light golden brown. Transfer to wire racks to cool. Sprinkle with powdered sugar.
