PREHEAT oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour two 9-inch-round cake pans. FOR CAKE: COMBINE water and Taster's Choice in medium bowl. Stir in Coffee-mate with wire whisk. Combine 1 2/3 cups flour and baking soda in another medium bowl. Microwave 1 1/3 cups morsels and vegetable oil in large, microwave-safe bowl on MEDIUM-HIGH (70%) power for 1 minute; stir. Morsels may retain some of their shape. If necessary, microwave at additional 10- to 15-second intervals, stirring just until melted. Add coffee mixture, sugar, eggs, evaporated milk, vinegar and vanilla extract to melted morsels; mix with wire whisk. Gradually beat in flour mixture until combined. (Batter will be thin.) Pour 3 1/4 cups batter into medium bowl; stir in remaining 2/3 cup of flour. Pour into prepared pans. BLEND cocoa into remaining batter with wire whisk until blended. Slowly pour even amounts of cocoa batter into the center of each pan. (Cocoa batter will spread evenly outward from center.) BAKE for 40 to 45 minutes or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pans on wire racks for 10 minutes; remove to wire racks to cool completely. Frost cake with frosting between layers and on top and side of cake. FOR FROSTING: MICROWAVE 2/3 cup morsels and butter in large, microwave-safe bowl on MEDIUM-HIGH (70%) power for 1 minute; stir. Morsels may retain some of their shape. If necessary, microwave at additional 10- to 15-second intervals, stirring just until melted. Combine Taster's Choice and water in small bowl. Beat cream cheese and coffee mixture into melted morsels. Gradually beat in powdered sugar until mixture reaches spreading consistency. Makes about 2 1/2 cups.
