Bring up foil sides and double fold top and sides to seal, leaving room for heat circulation inside. Place on grill for 20 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Remove from grill; add cubed ham, stirring slightly to mix. Reseal and return to grill for approximately 10 minutes. Remove from grill and sprinkle cheese & tomatoes over entire mixture.
