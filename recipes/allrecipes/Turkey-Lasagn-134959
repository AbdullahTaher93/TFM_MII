Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Quickly fry the sausage, onions, and oregano. Stir in the tomatoes. Combine the ricotta and half the Parmesan in a bowl. Spread a third of the tomato/meat mixture in a lightly oiled 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Arrange three noodles in the dish and spread half the cheese mixture over them. Repeat these layers. Top with the last layer of noodles and Parmesan cheese. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove foil and bake for 15 minutes more. Let stand 15 to 20 minutes before serving.
