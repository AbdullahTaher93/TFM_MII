Spread mustard over four slices of bread. Top each with a slice of cheese, ham and another cheese slice. Top with remaining bread. Butter the outside of the sandwiches. Cook on a griddle or in a large skillet over medium heat until golden brown on both sides. Remove to a cutting board; cut each sandwich lengthwise into thirds.
