In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in the egg, milk and extract. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or until easy to handle. Divide the dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each portion to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with 2-1/2-in. acorn cookie cutter. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until edges are firm. Remove to wire racks to cool completely. In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the chocolate chips; stir them until smooth. Spread chocolate over the stem and cap of each acorn, leaving about a 1/4-in. border. Sprinkle pecans over chocolate. Pipe remaining chocolate in a criss-cross pattern over each acorn. Let stand until firm.
