Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir turkey, celery, and onion in the hot skillet until turkey is browned and crumbly, about 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir chili beans, tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, chili powder, cayenne pepper, and bay leaf with the turkey mixture; bring to a simmer, cover pot with a lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook for 1 hour.
