Place steak in large resealable plastic bag or glass dish. Add 1/2 cup of the marinade; turn to coat well. Reserve remaining marinade for brushing. Refrigerate 30 minutes or longer for extra flavor. Remove steak from marinade. Discard any remaining marinade. Grill over medium-high heat 6 to 8 minutes per side or until desired doneness, brushing with reserved marinade halfway through cooking time.
