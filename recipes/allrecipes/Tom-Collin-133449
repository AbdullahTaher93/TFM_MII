Fill a cocktail shaker with ice cubes. Add the gin, lemon juice and sugar. Shake well and strain into a tall glass filled with ice cubes. Top with the club soda and stir gently. Add a seasonal twist by muddling 10 fresh blueberries, 10 tarragon leaves or a combination of 1 strawberry and 2 sprigs of basil (trust me) in the shaker before adding the other ingredients.
