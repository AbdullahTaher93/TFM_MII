Stand lime on end and cut thin, half-dollar-size slice (mostly peel) off one side. Repeat with 3 remaining sides. Set slices aside. Into each of four 9-ounce short glasses, squeeze a few drops juice from remaining lime. Add 1/4 teaspoon sugar cane syrup (or 1/2 teaspoon raw sugar) to each glass and stir. Add rhum to taste, about 1 1/2 ounces per glass. Stir, add crushed ice and lime slices, stir again, and serve. As the ice melts, the flavors blossom.
