In a small bowl, beat brown sugar, butter, molasses, ginger, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and cloves with an electric mixer on medium speed until blended. On low speed, beat in flour and baking soda until blended. Stir in chocolate. Press dough equally into bottoms of two 1-cup souffle dishes or two 2 1/2-inch muffin cups. Bake in a 350 degrees F oven until cakes spring back when lightly pressed (about 13 minutes). Cakes baked in souffle dishes can be served in the dishes. If you use a muffin pan, run a knife around edges of cakes to loosen; then invert pan onto a large plate and lift off. With a spatula, lift cakes and set right side up on 2 dessert plates. Serve cakes warm, topped with ice cream and a dusting of cinnamon.
