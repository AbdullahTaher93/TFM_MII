In a small saucepan, combine the water, vinegar and sugar. Cook and stir over medium heat until sugar is dissolved; cool. Sprinkle beef with salt, pepper and nutmeg; place in a large resealable plastic bag. Add onion, parsley, bay leaf and cooled marinade. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate overnight. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup marinade. Discard bay leaf. Place the beef and reserved marinade in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 2 hours or until meat is tender. Stir in raisins. Combine cornstarch and cream; stir into beef mixture. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until slightly thickened. Serve over noodles.
