Cook pasta as directed on package. Meanwhile, heat oil in large skillet on medium heat. Add chicken; cook 5 min. on each side or until browned on both sides. Stir in cream cheese, broth, dressing, onions and basil. Cook and stir until sauce begins to thicken and chicken is cooked through (170 degrees F.) Add snow peas and tomatoes; cook 2 to 4 min. or until snow peas are crisp-tender, stirring occasionally. Serve over the pasta.
