Beat together cream cheese and butter until fluffy with an electric mixer. Add remaining ingredients except red bell pepper; beat well. Place a piece of plastic wrap on a baking sheet. Spoon cheese mixture onto plastic wrap to form a candy cane shape, log or ball. Fold up plastic wrap over cheese to encase. Refrigerate until cheese is firm, about 4 hours or overnight. Unwrap cheese mixture. Place on serving plate. Smooth entire shape with spatula or knife. Decorate with bell pepper. May be covered and refrigerated overnight.
