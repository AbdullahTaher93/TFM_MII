Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes; add onion and garlic to the bacon. Cook and stir the bacon mixture until the onions begin to brown, about 5 minutes more. Stir cream, Thousand Island dressing, pepper juice, ketchup, and steak sauce with the bacon mixture; season with basil and black pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until it thickens, about 5 minutes; add drained pasta and stir to coat.
