In a bowl, cover thyme sprigs with cool water and let stand at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours. Snap off and discard tough stem ends from asparagus. Rinse and drain spears. In a large bowl, mix asparagus with oil. Lift thyme from water, drain, and arrange in a 6- by 18-inch rectangle on a barbecue grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds). Arrange asparagus in a single layer on thyme; close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning spears once, to brown lightly on two sides, 4 to 6 minutes total. Transfer asparagus to a platter; discard thyme. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve warm or cool.
