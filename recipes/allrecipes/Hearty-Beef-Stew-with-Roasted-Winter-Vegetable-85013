Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Toss chopped vegetables and onion with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Place on a large baking sheet; roast 20 minutes or until vegetables are golden in color. Meanwhile, saute beef in 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, 5 minutes or until beef is browned. Add roasted vegetables, chicken broth, 3 bay leaves, thyme, pepper, salt and wine. Simmer 5-10 minutes, or until sauce is slightly thickened. Prepare either fresh or instant mashed potatoes as usual, adding 2 bay leaves to the cooking water. Serve stew over mashed potatoes.
