Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Put frozen peas into a large colander. Drain rotini over the peas. Fill the now-empty pot with cold water. Plunge pasta and peas into the cold water to chill completely; drain. Mix imitation crabmeat, Swiss cheese, and parmesan cheese in a large bowl; add pasta mixture and toss to mix. Pour dressing over the salad and toss to lightly coat.
