Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook for 13 to 15 minutes or until al dente; drain. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, and stir in the tofu. Mix in honey and Dijon mustard. Season with dry mustard, 1 teaspoon Old Bay(R) Seasoning, kosher salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until tofu is thoroughly coated. Mix corn into the saucepan. Season with remaining Old Bay(R) Seasoning and nutritional yeast. Cook until heated through. Allow to cool about 5 minutes before serving over the cooked pasta.
