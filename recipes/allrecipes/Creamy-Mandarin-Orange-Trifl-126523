In large bowl, combine sweetened condensed milk and water. Add pudding mix; mix well. Chill until thickened, about 20 minutes. Fold in whipped cream. Line bottom and sides of a 12-cup round glass bowl with one third of cake cubes. Drain oranges, reserving 1/2 cup juice and 24 orange segments. Spoon one third of reserved juice over cake cubes. Spoon one third of pudding mixture over cake; top with one half of the orange segments and one third of the raspberries. Repeat layering. Just before final pudding layer, arrange reserved orange segments around edge of bowl. Top with remaining pudding and raspberries. Cover; chill 3 to 4 hours. Store leftovers covered in refrigerator.
