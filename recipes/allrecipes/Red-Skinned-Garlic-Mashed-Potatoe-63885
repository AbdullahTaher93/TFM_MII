Place potatoes in a large saucepan. Add water and bouillon. Bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and cook for 20-25 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Drain; reserving the cooking liquid. Mash potatoes with a potato masher or beat with an electric mixer. Add roasted garlic and cream cheese to potatoes. Gradually beat in enough reserved cooking liquid to make potatoes light and fluffy. Stir in parsley and serve immediately.
