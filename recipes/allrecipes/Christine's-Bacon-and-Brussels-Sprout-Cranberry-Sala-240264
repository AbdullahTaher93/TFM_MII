Place bacon in a wok or large skillet; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain excess fat. Mix Brussels sprouts, cranberries, apple, water, and almonds into bacon; cook and stir over medium-high heat until Brussels sprouts are bright green and tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer sprouts mixture to a bowl and top with dressing.
