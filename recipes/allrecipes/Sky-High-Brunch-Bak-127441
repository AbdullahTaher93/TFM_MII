Line bottom and side of greased 9-inch springform pan with 12-inch pastry sheet. Beat eggs in medium bowl with wire whisk. Reserve 1 Tbsp. of the eggs; set aside. Add ricotta cheese, pepper sauce and spinach to remaining eggs; mix until well blended. Layer half each of the bacon, cheese, spinach mixture and red peppers in pastry-lined pan. Repeat layers. Place remaining pastry sheet over mixture; fold and tuck pastry edges in pan. Pinch edges to seal. Brush top with reserved 1 Tbsp. egg. Cut 5 or 6 slits in top crust with tip of sharp knife to allow steam to escape. Bake 45 to 55 min. or until golden brown. Cool 10 min. Run small knife around edge of pan before removing rim.
