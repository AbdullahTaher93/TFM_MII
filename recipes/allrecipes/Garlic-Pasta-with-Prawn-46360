Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain, then return to pot. Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Saute garlic for 5 minutes. Toss in prawns, and cook for 5 minutes on each side. Remove prawns, and set aside. Remove garlic slices, and discard. Pour oil over pasta in pot, and toss to evenly coat. Sprinkle 3/4 of the Parmesan cheese onto pasta, and stir until evenly distributed. Transfer to serving dish. Arrange prawns on top, then sprinkle with remaining Parmesan and parsley.
