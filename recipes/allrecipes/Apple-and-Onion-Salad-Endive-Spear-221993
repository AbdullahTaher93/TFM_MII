Toast walnut pieces in a dry skillet over medium-high heat until aromatic and lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. Combine apples, onion, chives, and parsley in a bowl and toss well. Pour vinegar into a small bowl; drizzle and whisk olive oil into vinegar until emulsified. Pour dressing into apple mixture and toss to coat. Gently fold walnuts and blue cheese into apple mixture just before serving. Spoon filling onto each endive leaf.
