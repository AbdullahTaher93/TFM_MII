Line a 9-in. pie plate with bottom pastry; trim even with edge. Set aside. In a large skillet, cook pork, onion, celery and garlic until meat is no longer pink and vegetables are tender; drain. Add potatoes, water and seasonings; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5 minutes or until slightly thickened. Discard bay leaf. Beat egg and water; brush over bottom pastry. Bake at 400 degrees F for 5 minutes. Increase heat to 450 degrees F. Pour pork mixture into crust. Roll out remaining pastry to fit top of pie. Place over filling; cut slits in top. Trim, seal and flute edges. Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F; bake 10-15 minutes longer or until golden brown.
