Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Coat baking sheet with cooking spray. Put potatoes and onion on a clean towel. Roll up towel and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Transfer mixture to a large bowl. Stir flour, salt, and black pepper into potato mixture; mix well. Stir egg and 2 teaspoons canola oil into potato mixture until combined. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Scoop up potato mixture with a 1/4-cup measuring cup and drop into hot oil. Flatten into patties with a spatula. Cook patties until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Transfer cakes to prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until cakes are browned and crisp, 12 to 15 minutes.
