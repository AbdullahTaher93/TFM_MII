Mix zucchini, celery, onion, and mushrooms in a microwave-safe dish. Cover dish with plastic wrap. Cook on High until vegetables are steamed and slightly tender, about 6 minutes. Pull plastic wrap away from dish, stir vegetables, sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the vegetables, and replace the plastic to seal tightly. Let dish sit until the cheese melts, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir vegetables to coat evenly with melted cheese.
