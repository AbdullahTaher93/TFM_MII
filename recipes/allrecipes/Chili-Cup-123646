In a large skillet, brown beef, green pepper, onion and garlic; drain. Stir in tomato sauce, water and seasonings. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, cut 2-1/2-in circles from bread slices using a biscuit cutter. Press the circles into greased miniature muffin cups. Bake at 400 degrees F for 5-6 minutes or until lightly toasted. Remove from tins and cool on wire racks. Fill each bread cup with about 1 tablespoon chili mixture; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Broil for 2-3 minutes or until cheese is golden brown.
