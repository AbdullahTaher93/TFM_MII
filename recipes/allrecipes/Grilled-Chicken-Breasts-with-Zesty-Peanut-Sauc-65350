Wash, trim and pound the chicken to 1/4-inch thickness. Combine chicken and next 8 ingredients in a plastic bag. Marinate 1 hour or overnight in the refrigerator. Combine the JIF(R), coconut milk, lime juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger, garlic and cayenne in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly for about 15 minutes or until thickened. Whisk in the stock and cream. Cook 1 minute more, whisking; set aside. Preheat grill. Remove chicken from marinade and place on a hot grill. Grill until browned - about 4 to 6 minutes on each side (or until center is no longer pink) - turning only once. Serve hot topped with the peanut sauce. Sprinkle with the cilantro.
