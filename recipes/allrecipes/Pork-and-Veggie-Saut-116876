In a bowl, combine the first five ingredients. Pour 1/2 cup marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add pork and one bay leaf. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Add remaining bay leaf to the remaining marinade; cover and refrigerate. Drain and discard marinade from pork; discard bay leaf. In a nonstick skillet, saute pork in oil for 4-5 minutes or until no longer pink. Remove and keep warm. In the same skillet, saute the mushrooms, red pepper and celery until crisp-tender. Discard bay leaf from reserved marinade. Combine cornstarch, honey and marinade until smooth. Stir into skillet. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until thickened. Return pork to the pan; heat through. Serve over rice if desired.
