Season lobster tails with salt. Heat clarified butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place tails, meat-side down, in hot butter and saute until just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate to cool. Pour sherry into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Cook until sherry is reduced by half, about 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat. Pull meat from shells; discard shells and roughly chop lobster meat. Pour any accumulated juices from the plate into sherry mixture in the skillet. Whisk cream, eggs yolks, nutmeg, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Whisk cream mixture into sherry mixture, return skillet to medium-low heat, and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 3 to 7 minutes. Stir lobster into sauce and cook until heated through. Season with parsley and salt.
