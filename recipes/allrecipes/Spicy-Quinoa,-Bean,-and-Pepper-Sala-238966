Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes; add chopped red pepper and continue to cook and stir until slightly tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir quinoa with the onion mixture. Pour vegetable broth into the saucepan; season with chipotle pepper powder and cayenne pepper. Bring the broth to a boil. Cover the saucepan, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the quinoa is tender, about 20 minutes. Stir black beans and corn into the quinoa mixture; simmer until the beans and corn are heated through, about 5 minutes more.
