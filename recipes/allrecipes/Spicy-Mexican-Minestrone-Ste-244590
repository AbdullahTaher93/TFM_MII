Shape the sausage firmly into 1/2-inch meatballs. Heat the oil in a 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs and cook until well browned on all sides. Remove the meatballs from the saucepan. Pour off any fat. Stir the broth, tomatoes, picante sauce and garlic powder in the saucepan and heat to a boil. Stir in the shells. Return the meatballs to the saucepan. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, stirring often. Stir in the green beans and kidney beans. Cook for 10 minutes or until the meatballs are cooked through and the shells are tender, stirring occasionally. Sprinkle with the cheese before serving, if desired.
