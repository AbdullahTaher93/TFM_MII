Thaw the pastry sheet at room temperature for 40 minutes or until it's easy to handle. Heat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly grease a baking sheet or line with parchment paper. Stir the egg and water with a fork in a small bowl. Unfold the pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface. Roll the sheet into a 13x9-inch rectangle. Brush with the mustard. Cut the pastry into 8 pieces. Place 1 piece kielbasa onto the center of each rectangle. Brush the pastry edges with the egg mixture. Fold the pastry over the kielbasa and press the edges to seal. Place the rolls seam-side down on the prepared baking sheet. Brush with the egg mixture. Bake for 25 minutes or until golden. Remove from the baking sheets and cool for 5 minutes on a wire rack. Serve with additional mustard for dipping, if desired.
