Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 5x9 inch loaf pans and set aside. Blend together the butter, sugar, eggs, evaporated milk and almond extract. Sift together the flour, baking powder and cinnamon. Add to wet ingredients and stir. Add coconut, coarsely mixed dry chopped fruit and raisins. Mix well and pour into prepared loaf tins. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from pans and cool on wire rack.
