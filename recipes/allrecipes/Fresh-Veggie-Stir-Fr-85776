Cook noodles according to package directions, omitting salt, fat or spice packet. Set noodles aside and keep warm. Heat large fry pan or wok over high heat. Add Enova brand oil and heat for 30 seconds. Add ingredients in order, except noodles, stir frying between additions. Continue cooking and stirring until vegetables are tender-crisp, about 3 minutes. Serve over noodles. Garnish with sesame seeds, if desired.
