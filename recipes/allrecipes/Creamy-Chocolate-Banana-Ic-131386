Peel bananas and slice into 1/2 -inch-thick rounds. Arrange slices on a foil-lined tray and freeze for at least 3 hours (if you want to freeze them longer, you can then transfer them to a zip-top freezer bag). When you're ready to make the ice, put the frozen banana slices and cocoa powder in a food processor. Pulse 10 to 20 times until bananas form pebble-size chunks. Turn the food processor on and add soy milk in a steady stream, processing until mixture is smooth, about 30 seconds. Note: You may need to stop the motor once or twice and scrape down the sides of the bowl for even blending. Scoop banana ice into serving bowls and return to the freezer for about 15 minutes to firm up before serving.
