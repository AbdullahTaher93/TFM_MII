Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Blend orange juice, lime juice, lemon juice, aji pepper, sea salt, black pepper, garlic, and cinnamon in a blender until pepper and garlic are very finely chopped, about 30 seconds. Add margarine and blend until smooth, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil; lay banana leaves onto foil. Place ears of corn on banana leaves and spread margarine mixture evenly over corn. Wrap foil and banana leaves over the seasoned ears of corn, using more foil if necessary to tightly seal corn in a bundle. Bake in the preheated oven until corn is tender and flavors have blended, 1 1/2 hours. Unwrap and serve.
