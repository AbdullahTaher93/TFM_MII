In a bowl, toss apricots, sugar, flour and nutmeg. Sprinkle with lemon juice; mix well. Line a 9-in. pie plate with bottom crust; add filling. Roll out remaining pastry to make a lattice crust. Place over filling; seal and flute edges. Brush with milk and sprinkle with sugar. Cover edges of pastry loosely with foil. Bake at 375 degrees F for 45-55 minutes or until golden brown.
