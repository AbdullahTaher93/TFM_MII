Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook beef, stirring often, until well browned, about 15 minutes. Stir garlic and green onions into the beef. Cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Pour beef broth into skillet and scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the skillet. Pour in milk, bring to a simmer, and stir pasta sauce into beef mixture. Simmer until beef pieces are tender, about 40 minutes. If mixture is too thick, add a little water. Season with salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and Italian herbs. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Pour penne into sauce and toss lightly to coat. Transfer into a serving bowl and serve topped with a sprinkle of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
