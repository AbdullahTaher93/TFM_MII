Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Mash avocado in a large bowl with a fork. Mix in bacon, yolks from the hard-boiled eggs, mayonnaise, mustard, and lime juice. Spoon avocado mixture into the egg whites. Garnish eggs with red pepper flakes. Chill until ready to serve.
