Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place it in the oven. Stir cranberry juice, cranberries, and maple syrup together in a skillet; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until cranberries burst, about 10 minutes. Pour cranberry mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Season pureed cranberry sauce with salt and pepper. Stir veal, egg, bread crumbs, and rosemary together in a bowl. Season meat mixture with salt and pepper. Shape meat mixture into balls by pressing the meat around the Cheddar cheese cubes. Place meatballs on prepared baking sheet. Bake meatballs in the preheated oven until meat is cooked through and cheese is melted, 8 to 10 minutes. Serve meatballs with cranberry sauce.
