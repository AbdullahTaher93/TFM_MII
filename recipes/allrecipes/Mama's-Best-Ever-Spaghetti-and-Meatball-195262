Combine ground beef, bread crumbs and egg in medium bowl; shape into 12 meatballs. Bring pasta sauce to a boil over medium-high heat in 3-quart saucepan. Gently stir in uncooked meatballs. Reduce heat to low and simmer covered, stirring occasionally, 20 minutes or until meatballs are done. Serve over hot spaghetti and garnish, if desired, with grated Parmesan cheese.
