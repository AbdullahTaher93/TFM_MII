Prepare Baked Pastry Shells: Heat oven to 450 degrees. Combine flour and salt. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 4 to 5 tablespoons water, 1 tablespoon at a time until mixture leaves side of bowl and forms a ball. Divide in half and roll out on lightly floured surface into two 12 inch circles. Line two 9 inch flan rings, quiche pans or pie plates with pastry; trim and flute edges. Prick pastry on the bottom and sides with fork. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or just until pastry begins to brown. Brown ground beef in a large frying pan; pour off drippings. In another large frying pan, heat butter and oil; add onion and garlic and cook until onion is translucent. Add eggplant, green pepper and zucchini. Stir-fry over medium heat 5 minutes; reduce heat. Stir in mushrooms and tomatoes; stir-fry 3 minutes. Stir in beef, basil, salt and pepper; remove from heat. For each shell, sprinkle 1/2 cup cheese on the bottom of pastry; spread 1/2 beef mixture over cheese. (Filled pastry shells may be refrigerated or frozen at this point.) Bake in 400 degree oven 15 minutes. Garnish with parsley.
