Soak corn in water for 15 minutes. Drain and place each corn on the cob on an individual piece of aluminum foil, large enough to wrap around the corn. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Mix butter, thyme, parsley, rosemary, basil, sugar, and salt together in a bowl until evenly mixed; rub onto each corn on the cob. Wrap foil around the seasoned corn. Grill corn on the preheated grill, turning often, until tender, about 15 minutes.
