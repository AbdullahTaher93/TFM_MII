Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Saute red peppers for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in tuna, and season with salt and pepper. Add vinegar, 2 tablespoons parsley and garlic. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until vinegar has evaporated. Remove from heat, and set aside. Slice the bread in half lengthwise, then crosswise into 4 inch pieces. Toast bread in the oven until warm and crisp, but not brown. Place the bread on a serving platter. Top each piece with red pepper tuna mixture. Garnish with sliced egg and a halved olive. Drizzle with remaining olive oil and sprinkle with remaining parsley.
