Melt butter in 12-inch skillet until sizzling; add chicken, fajita seasoning and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink (5 to 6 minutes). Stir in vegetables. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until chicken is fork tender and peppers are crisply tender (5 to 6 minutes). Stir in cilantro. Serve with warm tortillas and sour cream, if desired.
