Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in onions and garlic, cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent. Pour in tomatoes, garbanzo beans, and water; season with paprika, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Stir in carrots and potatoes, then place chicken thighs skin-side up on top of the vegetables. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium, cover, and simmer until the chicken is tender, about 25 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Remove chicken from the stew and set aside. Stir in the chorizo slices, then pour the stew into a glass baking dish. Place the chicken thighs on top, skin-side up. Bake in preheated oven until the stew has thickened and the chicken skin is crispy, about 15 minutes.
