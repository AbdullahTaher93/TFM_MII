In a large skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Add the tomato sauce, tomatoes, taco seasoning and seasoned salt. Simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Spread 1/2 cup meat sauce in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Top with two tortillas and a third of the sauce, cottage cheese and shredded cheese. Repeat layers twice. Cover; bake at 350 degrees F for 30-40 minutes or until heated through. Let stand for 5 minutes before cutting.
