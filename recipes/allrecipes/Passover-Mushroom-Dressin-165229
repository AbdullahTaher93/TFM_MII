Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Stir together the matzo meal, sugar, salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning in a large mixing bowl; set aside. Bring 2 cups of chicken broth to a boil in a small saucepan with 1/2 cup of canola oil. Stir into the matzo mixture until evenly moistened, then set aside to cool. Heat the remaining canola oil and the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Stir in the chopped onion and green onion, and cook until the onion softens and turns translucent, about 7 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms and celery, and cook until the celery begins to soften, about 10 minutes more. Whisk together the remaining 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock with the eggs, and stir into the cooled matzo mixture. Fold in the cooked vegetables until evenly mixed, then pour the mixture back into the cast-iron skillet. Bake in the preheated oven for 50 minutes until browned. Stir once during this time to ensure even cooking.
