Mix chicken, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, vinegar, 1 tablespoon salt, 1 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper together in a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap; place in the refrigerator. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Pour remaining 1/2 cup vegetable oil into a shallow baking pan; place in the preheating oven for 20 minutes. Mix remaining 1 tablespoon salt, 1 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and flour together in a shallow bowl. Spread out evenly in the bowl. Remove baking pan from the oven. Dredge chicken in the flour mixture, one piece at a time, and gently place into the hot oil. Bake chicken in the preheated oven, turning once halfway through, until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Top chicken with Cheddar cheese and chives.
