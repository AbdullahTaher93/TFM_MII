Cook and drain pasta as directed on package. Meanwhile, cook bacon in large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp. Remove bacon; set aside. Discard all but 2 tablespoons pan drippings. Saute mushrooms and garlic in pan drippings 4 to 6 minutes or until tender. Add peas and cook until just heated through. Remove from heat. Grate 1/2 teaspoon peel from lemon; reserve half of lemon to squeeze over pasta. Toss pasta with bacon, mushrooms, lemon peel, cheese and plenty of ground pepper. Squeeze in juice of half lemon; toss once more.
