Prepare grill for direct cooking and preheat grill to medium temperature range. Grill sausage links over direct heat, turning every minute. Remove from grill. Cool slightly. Cut sausage into 1/4-inch circles. Meanwhile, over medium-high heat, heat oil in a large heavy skillet. Add onions and saute for about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add garlic and cook, just until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Reduce the heat to low and add wine, tomatoes, sausage, oregano and 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper. Cook about 3 minutes. Add cream and cook for one minute. Meanwhile, cook linguine in boiling salted water according to package directions. Cook until al dente. Drain. Portion cooked linguine onto 4 warm plates or pasta bowls. Spoon sausage/sauce over pasta. Sprinkle each with Parmesan and garnish with fresh oregano.
