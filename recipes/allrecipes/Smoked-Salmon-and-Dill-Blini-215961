Combine the buckwheat flour, all-purpose flour, salt, and instant yeast and mix well. Separate one of the eggs, reserving the egg white. Whisk together the egg yolk and the remaining egg. Whisk in the warm milk and 1 tablespoon of melted butter. Pour the egg mixture onto the flour mixture and beat well to form a smooth batter. Cover with plastic wrap and let the batter rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, 1 to 2 hours. In a clean metal or ceramic bowl, beat the reserved egg white until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the egg white into the blini batter. Preheat an oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Preheat a heavy-bottomed skillet or griddle over medium-high heat and brush with the remaining melted butter. Drop tablespoons of batter onto the hot pan, spacing them well apart, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface of the blinis, about 40 seconds. Flip them over and cook for 30 seconds on the other side. Wrap the blinis in foil and transfer them to the oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, buttering the pan before each batch. Combine the creme fraiche and the chopped dill. Remove the blinis from the oven. Top each blini with a slice of salmon and a dollop of cream.
