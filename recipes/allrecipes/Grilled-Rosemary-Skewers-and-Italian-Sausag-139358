Skewer vegetables on to metal skewers. Make sure that your veggies are cut into bite sized pieces. Remove the leaves of the rosemary from the sprigs and chop the leaves finely. Place the rosemary and the juice from the lemon into the garlic olive oil and baste the vegetables with the oil. Place the veggies and the sausage on the grill for 5 to 7 minutes on medium heat on both sides. Only turn the skewers and sausage one time to ensure great grill marks.
