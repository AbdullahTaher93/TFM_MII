Rinse fish and pat dry; spread fish open, season to taste with salt and pepper, then coat lightly with flour, shaking off excess. In a wide nonstick frying pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add fish, boned side down, and cook for 1 minute. Turn fish over and cook until just opaque but still moist in thickest part; cut to test (2 to 3 minutes). Using a slotted spatula, transfer fish to warm plates; tent with foil to keep warm. Reduce heat to medium. To same pan, add shallot and half of the butter; cook, stirring often, until soft (about 1 1/2 minutes). Stir in tomatoes and lime juice. Cook, stirring, until heated through (about 1 minute). Add remaining butter, stirring until melted. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then spoon tomato mixture over fish. Garnish with chives and lime wedges.
