Grill tenderloin over medium heat, turning occasionally, for 12 to 14 minutes or until no longer pink in center, and reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees F. Remove from grill and let sit. In a saucepan, saute onions and garlic in vegetable oil until slightly brown. Add peanut butter, chili powder and liquid from tomatoes; continue to cook over low heat and stir until peanut butter is melted. Sauce should be on the thin side. If sauce is too thick, add a little soy sauce or water. Place carrots and peppers in microwave safe container with 2 Tbsp of water, cover and cook on high for 1 minute to blanch. Prepare pasta according to instructions on package. Toss pasta with sauce, tomatoes, peppers, carrots and fresh cilantro. Transfer tenderloin to carving board; cut each tenderloin lengthwise in half and then cut crosswise into 1/4-inch thick slices. Transfer pasta to serving plates and place turkey on top of pasta.
