Place the lentils, stock, and water in a large pot. Season with salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring often, until the lentils are tender, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the carrots, onion, and celery. Cook, stirring often, until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the curry powder and cook 1 minute. Add the wine, increase the heat to high, and boil until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir the curry mixture into the lentils, season with salt and pepper, and cook over medium heat until the flavors have blended, about 10 minutes. Cover and keep warm. To make the garnish, whisk the sugar, mustard, and curry powder with the sour cream in a small bowl until the mixture is smooth. Ladle the soup into bowls and top each with a dollop of the sour cream garnish.
