Combine the milk, rice, and 5 teaspoons (25 mL) of the sugar in a heavy 4-quart (4-L) saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low; cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the rice is very tender and the mixture is creamy, about 10 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat; cool. Meanwhile, combine the rhubarb, strawberries, water, cornstarch, and the remaining 1/4 cup (50 mL) of sugar in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low; cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the rhubarb is tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat; cool. Into each of 4 parfait glasses or 8-ounce (250-mL) wine goblets, spoon 3 tablespoons (45 mL) of the strawberry-rhubarb mixture. Top with 1/2 cup (125 mL) of the rice pudding mixture, then 2 tablespoons (25 mL) of the strawberry-rhubarb mixture. Garnish with small strawberries or mint sprigs.
