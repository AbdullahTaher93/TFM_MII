Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread corn into the bottom of a baking dish; add chicken breasts. Cover chicken with butter, garlic, black pepper, and salt. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 30 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
