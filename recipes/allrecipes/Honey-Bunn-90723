In the large bowl of an electric mixer, combine 4-1/2 cups flour and the yeast, sugar, lemon peel, and salt. Stir to blend well. With mixer running on low speed, add the milk, whole egg, and 4 of the egg yolks. Then beat in butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until smoothly incorporated. Beat in as much of the remaining 1 cup flour as necessary, a little at a time, to make a pliable dough that is not sticky. To knead dough with a dough hook: Knead dough in the mixing bowl, just until dough is smooth and elastic and comes away from bowl sides, about 2 to 3 minutes (do not over knead). To knead by hand: Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead until dough is smooth and elastic and no longer sticky, about 4 minutes. Return dough to mixing bowl. Let stand, loosely covered, for about 10 minutes. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board. Shape into a ball. With a large knife, divide ball in half. Form one half into a rabbit, following the instructions in Shaping Your Bunny, below. Repeat process to shape second bunny with remaining half of dough. Once bunnies are shaped on baking sheet, press 2 raisins into each head to make eyes. Lightly cover bunnies with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in size, 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on room temperature. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. When dough is doubled, beat together remaining egg yolk with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl until smooth. With a pastry brush, brush yolk mixture evenly over bunnies. If desired, decorate bunny legs with colored sprinkles. If necessary, press raisin eyes back down into dough. Bake breads until they are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped, about 35 minutes. Let stand on baking sheets 10 minutes, then carefully transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
