Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Arrange chicken in a single layer in a baking dish. In a medium bowl combine water, soy sauce, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and wine. Pour over chicken and sprinkle with garlic powder. Bake for 10 minutes in preheated oven until sauce is hot and bubbly. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, until sauce is thick and sticky, basting repeatedly.
