Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack 6 inches from the heat source. Lay slices of rye bread out onto a baking sheet; toast under the broiler until lightly browned and fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Set toasts aside. Beat cream cheese and mustard together with an electric mixer on medium speed in a bowl until well blended. Stir corned beef, Swiss cheese, and green onion into cream cheese mixture until blended. Spread cream cheese mixture evenly onto toasted rye bread slices and place on a baking sheet. Broil in preheated oven until topping is lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.
