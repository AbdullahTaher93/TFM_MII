In a bowl, combine flour and 1/3 cup brown sugar; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press into a lightly greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-17 minutes or until set. In a mixing bowl, beat egg, salt and remaining brown sugar. Stir in nuts, cherries and chocolate chips. Spoon evenly over crust. Bake 20-25 minutes longer or until topping is set. Cool on a wire rack before cutting.
