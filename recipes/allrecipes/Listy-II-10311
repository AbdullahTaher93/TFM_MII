Mix together one egg, three egg yolks, sugar, cream and salt. Gradually stir in flour until dough becomes stiff enough to roll. Roll very thin but cut into small circles (2-3 inches diameter). Cut small slits (about 1/4 to 1/2 inch) at 12:00, 3:00, 6:00, and 9:00 positions. Paste three circles together in center using egg white. Fry cookies in hot oil - sides will curl up like a rose. After draining on paper towels, place a small amount of red jelly in the center of each rose and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
