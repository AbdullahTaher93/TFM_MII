In a skillet, cook beef, onion, salt and pepper over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain and cool. Place two biscuits over-lapping on a floured surface; roll out into a 5-in. oval. Place 3 tablespoons meat mixture on one side. Fold a cheese slice to fit over meat mixture. Fold dough over filling; press edges with a fork to seal. Repeat with remaining biscuits, meat mixture and cheese. Place on a greased baking sheet. Prick tops with a fork. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10 minutes or until golden brown.
