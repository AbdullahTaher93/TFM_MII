Peel and core pears, leaving stems intact. Slice about 1/4 inch from base of each pear so it will sit flat. Combine water and next 7 ingredients (water through clove) in a large saucepan; bring to a boil. Add pears; cover, reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes or until tender. Remove pears and apricots from cooking liquid using a slotted spoon; chill pears and apricots. Bring cooking liquid to a boil; cook until reduced to 1 cup (about 15 minutes). Strain cooking liquid through a sieve over a bowl; discard solids. Chill. Chop apricots. Combine apricots, wafer crumbs, and 1 tablespoon pistachios. Stuff about 2 tablespoons apricot mixture into each pear cavity. Place pears in each of 4 bowls. Spoon 1/4 cup syrup over each pear; sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon pistachios.
