Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Whisk olive oil, mustard, honey, green onions, salt, black pepper, and cayenne in a large bowl to combine. Add potatoes and toss to coat. Spread evenly on the baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are cooked all the way through and browned, 20 to 30 minutes.
