Season cubed pork with salt and pepper to taste. Place meat in a large plastic bag with the cornmeal. Shake well to coat the meat. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Place the coated meat in the skillet and saute for 5 to 10 minutes, or until browned. Reduce heat to medium. Pour in the beer, salsa, peaches and beans with 2 tablespoons reserved liquid. Stir well and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in the cilantro.
