Prepare mashed potatoes following package directions, set aside to cool. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine egg, green onions, red bell pepper, parsley, mustard, and seasonings. Add crab meat and mix well. Blend in cooled potatoes until well distributed. Shape into 2-inch wide patties. Press panko breading onto both sides of each patty. In a large skillet, heat 1 teaspoon each of the butter and oil over medium heat. Add patties and cook for about 4 minutes on each side until golden and heated through. Transfer crab cakes to a baking sheet. Keep warm in oven. Repeat with the remaining butter, oil and patties. To make lemon aioli, combine all ingredients and mix well. Cover and chill. Can be made a day ahead. Serve warm on a bed of watercress with Lemon Aioli.
