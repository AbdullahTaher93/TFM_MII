Pour whole box of pasta into a large skillet (approximately 12 inches in diameter). Pour 3 cups of cold water into the pan, ensuring that the water covers the pasta. Turn the burner to high, then set your timer for 10 minutes (optional: add a bit of salt to taste). Cook on high, stirring occasionally, until half of the liquid has evaporated. Add curry powder and stir to combine; continue to cook on high. With about 1 minute left, add olive oil, season with salt and pepper, stir to combine. When desired pasta texture is reached, remove skillet from heat, fold in cheese and top with tomatoes. Serve immediately.
