Combine meat, onion, breadcrumbs, 1-1/4 cups cheese, egg, salt and pepper. Mix well; shape into 4 oval meatloaves about 4 x 3 inches and 1 inch thick. Place on a foil-lined shallow baking sheet. Combine mustard, brown sugar and dill, if desired. Spread over tops of meatloaves. Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F oven 30 to 35 minutes or until internal temperature of meat reaches 160 degrees F. Sprinkle remaining cheese over meatloaves; continue baking 3 minutes or until cheese is melted.
