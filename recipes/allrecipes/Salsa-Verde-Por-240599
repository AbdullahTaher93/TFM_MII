Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown pork loin in hot oil, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer roast to the crock of a slow cooker. Pour green salsa over the pork. Cook on Low for 5 hours. Shred the pork into strands with two forks; stir with the sauce so the texture is somewhat even. Continue cooking on Low for 1 to 3 hours more.
