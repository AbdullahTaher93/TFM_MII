In a large skillet cook the whole garlic cloves in hot oil until light brown; discard garlic. Add the zucchini, dried mint (if using), salt, and pepper to the oil in the skillet. Cook, uncovered, over medium heat about 5 minutes or until the zucchini is crisp-tender, stirring occasionally. To serve, sprinkle with the cheese and fresh mint (if using).
