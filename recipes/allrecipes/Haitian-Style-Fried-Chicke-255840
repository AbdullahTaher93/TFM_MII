Combine chicken legs, lemon juice, onion, garlic, seasoned salt, paprika, thyme, pepper, and cloves in a large bowl. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan over medium-high heat. Fry chicken in batches until golden brown, about 8 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
