Put flour in a large bowl, and make a hole in the middle. In the hole, place the salt, sugar, egg yolks, and softened butter. Mingle the ingredients in the middle, adding flour little by little, and stopping as soon as you achieve a homogeneous mixture. Shape the dough into a ball and cover it in cellophane wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
