In a shallow bowl, combine the first six ingredients. Add potatoes, a few at a time; toss to coat. Place in a single layer in a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Drizzle with remaining oil mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 450 degrees F for 50-55 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Sprinkle with parsley.
