Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a deep pie dish or 8x8-inch baking pan with cooking spray; set aside. Brown ground beef in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat 10 minutes stirring often to break up any lumps. Stir in beans, corn, onion and a half-cup of KC Masterpiece(R) Hot n Spicy Barbecue Sauce. Set aside. Spread a thin layer of butter on each tortilla. Place one tortilla, buttered side up, in pie dish. Top with 1/2 cup of beef mixture and 1 tablespoon of cheese. Repeat with remaining tortillas, beef mixture and cheese, ending with a tortilla. Pour remaining half-cup of barbecue sauce over top and sprinkle with any remaining cheese. Bake for 30-40 minutes or until bubbling and heated through. Allow to sit 10 minutes before cutting into wedges to serve. Top each serving with a dollop of sour cream, if desired.
