Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix avocados, onions, and garlic salt. Arrange corn tortillas in a single layer on a large baking sheet, and place in the preheated oven 2 to 5 minutes, until heated through. Spread tortillas with the avocado mixture. Garnish with cilantro and sprinkle with jalapeno pepper sauce.
