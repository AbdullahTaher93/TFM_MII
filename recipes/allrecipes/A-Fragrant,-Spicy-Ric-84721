In a pot, bring 2 1/2 cups broth to a boil. Mix in green onions and peas. Season with salt, 1 pinch garam masala, 1 pinch turmeric, and cayenne pepper to taste. Stir the basmati rice into the pot. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes. Melt the butter in a wok over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the mushrooms and garlic in the melted butter until lightly browned. Mix in green bell pepper and red bell pepper. Season with 1 teaspoon garam masala, 1 pinch turmeric, and cayenne pepper to taste. Stir in the lentils and 3/4 cup broth. Reduce heat to low. Cook 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lentils are tender. In a skillet over medium heat, cook the almonds, stirring frequently, until lightly browned. Remove from heat, and set aside. Increase wok heat to medium. Mix the rice into the wok with the vegetables and lentils. Cook and stir until all liquid has evaporated. Garnish with toasted almonds and cilantro sprigs to serve.
