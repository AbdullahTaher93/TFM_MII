Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil grate. In a large, nonporous bowl, combine the oil, ketchup, wine, vinegar, garlic, salt, ground black pepper, mustard powder, celery salt and chili powder and mix well. Pierce the roast with a fork all over the meat. Place the meat in the bowl with the marinade and turn several times to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours, turning occasionally. Grill over medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes per side, or until internal temperature reaches at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C).
