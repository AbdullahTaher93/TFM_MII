Stir together the honey, peppercorns, salt, soy sauce, and sherry in a large bowl; add the chicken and toss to coat. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ginger, garlic, red chile pepper, and green onions; cook and stir until fragrant, no more than 30 seconds. Stir in the chicken and soy sauce mixture; fry another 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low, cover. Simmer until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes. Whisk together the bean sauce, vinegar, and sesame oil in a small bowl; pour over the chicken and stir. Turn heat to high and allow to cook 1 minute. Serve immediately.
