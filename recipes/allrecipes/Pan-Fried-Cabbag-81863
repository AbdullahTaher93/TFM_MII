In a heavy skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the shredded cabbage and stir fry until the cabbage is nicely browned. You will want to cook this fast so that it gets good color but the cabbage still has a bit of crunch to it. Turn off the heat; add the garlic powder and vinegar. Stir well. Serve.
