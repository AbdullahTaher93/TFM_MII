In a stockpot, combine the wine, shallots, thyme, parsley and bay leaf; simmer over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add the mussels, cover the pot and cook for 3 minutes. Stir to coat and cook until the shells open, 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the mussels to a platter (throw away any that haven't opened). Strain the remaining broth, add salt if needed and pour over the mussels. Serve with bread to sop up the sauce.
