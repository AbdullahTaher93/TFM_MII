Coat a 14- or 15-inch round pizza pan with oil. Sprinkle with the cornmeal; set aside. Punch down the dough and place on a lightly floured work surface to sit for 5 minutes. With lightly floured hands or rolling pin, pat or roll into a 15- or 16-inch circle. Transfer to the prepared pan. Fold the edges to make a rounded border. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside for about 15 minutes, or until slightly risen. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place a large saute pan over high heat. Add the oil and heat. Add the onions. Stir. Cover the pan and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until the onions start to brown. Stir. Reduce the heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, or until browned. Add the salt and oregano. Spread the onions over the prepared crust. Sprinkle with the olives. Bake for about 15 minutes or until the crust is golden. Remove to a cooling rack for 5 minutes.
