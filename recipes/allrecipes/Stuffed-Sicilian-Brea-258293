Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove top of bread loaf to create a long boat-shaped loaf. Pull out much of the soft bread to form a shell inside the crust. Reserve chunks of bread and break into evenly sized medium pieces. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir shallots until softened, 3 or 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 more minute. Transfer reserved bread pieces to skillet. Add salt and pepper. Cook and stir until bread has absorbed some of the olive oil, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Place ricotta, mozzarella, 4 ounces Parmesan, and Romano cheeses in a mixing bowl. Add basil and parsley; mix well. Transfer bread mixture to bowl. Stir in burgundy olives, kalamata olives, green olives, artichoke hearts, and red pepper strips. Add a pinch of pepper. Mix well. Place bread shell on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle inside with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Fill with the cheese mixture. Top with 1 tablespoon shredded Parmesan cheese. Bake in preheated oven until loaf begins to get crisp and filling is bubbly, 20 to 30 minutes.
