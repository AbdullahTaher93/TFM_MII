In a large bowl, coat chicken with your favorite hot sauce. Lay tortillas flat; spread 1/4 cup of Red, White & Bleu Coleslaw around the center of each tortilla. Place the coated chicken in a strip across the tortilla just below the center. Fold over the bottom of the tortilla and roll. Allow one hour before slicing. (These can also be made with warm chicken.)
