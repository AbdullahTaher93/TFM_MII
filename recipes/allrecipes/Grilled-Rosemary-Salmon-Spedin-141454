Preheat grill to medium-high. Combine rosemary, oil, garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Add salmon; toss to coat. Alternating the salmon and tomatoes, divide among eight 12-inch skewers. Oil the grill rack (see Tip). Grill the spedini, carefully turning once, until the salmon is cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes total. Serve immediately.
