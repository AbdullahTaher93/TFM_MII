In a bowl, mix the turkey, pineapple, celery, onion, peanuts, and grapes. In a separate bowl, mix the mayonnaise, chutney, lime juice, curry powder, and salt. Gently toss the mayonnaise mixture with the turkey mixture to coat. Refrigerate 20 minutes or until chilled, and serve on plates lined with lettuce.
