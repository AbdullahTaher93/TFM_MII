Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Rub chicken with salt and pepper. In a large oven-friendly skillet, brown chicken in olive oil for 1-2 minutes on each side. Transfer chicken to a covered dish. Add garlic and mushrooms to the skillet. Saute for about 8 minutes, or until ingredients begin to brown. Add chicken broth to deglaze the skillet. Return chicken to the skillet and top with bruschetta. Cover and bake at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes. In the meantime, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta according to package instructions. Once cooked through, remove chicken from the oven. Transfer the chicken to a dish. Stir in cream, slowly. Return chicken to the skillet and cook covered for another 10 minutes to thicken sauce. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve on a bed of whole-wheat gemelli, topped with Parmigiano.
