Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin. Mix teff flour, brown rice flour, arrowroot flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, and salt together in a large bowl. Form a well in the center of the flour mixture. Add water, pecans, olive oil, and eggs to the well. Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until batter is fully combined. Fold raisins, golden raisins, apricots, and cranberries into batter. Pour batter into the prepared muffin tin. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes.
