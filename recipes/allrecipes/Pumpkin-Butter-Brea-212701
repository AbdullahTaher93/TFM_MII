Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 3x7-inch loaf pan. Whisk together the flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in a bowl; set aside. Beat the egg in a bowl. Whisk in the brown sugar, apple juice, melted butter, and half of the pumpkin butter until smooth. Stir in the flour mixture until no lumps remain. Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan and spread the remaining pumpkin butter over top. Pour in the remaining batter. Bake in the preheated oven on the middle rack until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
