Heat the butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until it's tender. Stir in the soup, milk and tomatoes. Heat to a boil. Add the fish to the skillet and reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Serve over linguine.
