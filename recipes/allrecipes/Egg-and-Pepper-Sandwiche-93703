In a large skillet, preferably nonstick, warm the oil over medium-high heat. Add the peppers and onion. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 6 minutes or until golden. Add the oregano, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and black pepper. Place the pepper mixture in a bowl; set aside. Preheat the oven broiler. Set the skillet over medium-high heat. Break the eggs into the pan. With a fork, pierce the yolks, but do not beat. Season with red pepper and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes, or until set. Remove from the heat. Place the rolls, cut side up, on a baking sheet. Broil 6 inches from the heat source for 1 to 2 minutes, or until golden. Place the eggs, peppers, and onions on the rolls.
