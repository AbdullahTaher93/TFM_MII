In a large skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Add the corn and soup. Set aside 1/2 cup cheese for topping; stir remaining cheese into meat mixture until melted. Gently stir in macaroni until coated. Transfer to a greased 8-in. square baking dish. Top with reserved cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until heated through.
