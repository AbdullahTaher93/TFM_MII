Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coarsely chop 8 of the cookies; set aside. Finely crush remaining 26 cookies; mix with butter. Press crumb mixture firmly onto bottom of greased 9-inch square baking pan. Top crust evenly with dollops of marshmallow creme, leaving 1/2-inch border around all sides. Sprinkle with chopped chocolate, walnuts and chopped cookies; press lightly into crust. Bake 15 minutes or until marshmallow creme just begins to brown. Cool completely in pan on wire rack. Cut into 20 bars.
