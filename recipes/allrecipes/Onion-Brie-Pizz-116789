In a large skillet, cook onions in butter over medium-low heat for 25 minutes or until golden brown, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, prepare hot roll mix according to package directions, using the warm water and oil. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes. Roll out dough to a 14-in. circle; transfer to a greased 14-in. pizza pan. Top with onions, Brie and almonds. Bake at 400 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting.
