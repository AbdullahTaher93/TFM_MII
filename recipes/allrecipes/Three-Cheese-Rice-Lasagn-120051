In a small bowl, combine spaghetti sauce and mushrooms; set aside. In another bowl, combine the cottage cheese, mozzarella cheese and egg white; mix well. In a microwave-safe 8-in. square baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray, layer a third of the sauce, half of the rice and half of the cottage cheese mixture; repeat layers. Top with the remaining sauce. Microwave at 50% power for 10-15 minutes or until heated through. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
