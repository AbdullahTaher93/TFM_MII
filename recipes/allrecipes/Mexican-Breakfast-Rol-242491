Prepare rice according to package directions. Let rice cool. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; spray with non-stick spray. Mix cooled rice with 1/2 cup of Mexican cheese blend and 2 eggs. Stir until combined. Spread into a thin rectangle on parchment paper. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Beat remaining 6 eggs. Place non-stick skillet over medium heat and pour eggs into pan. Soft scramble eggs; remove from heat and season with salt and pepper. Spread refried beans over baked crust. Top with scrambled eggs and salsa. Sprinkle with green onions and shredded cheese. Fold the edges over and roll crust over filling. Bake until heated through, 15 to 20 minutes. Slice and serve with your favorite Mexican style toppings: sour cream, tomatoes, avocado, and/or cheese.
