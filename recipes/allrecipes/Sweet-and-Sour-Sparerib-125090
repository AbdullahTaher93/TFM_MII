Place ribs on a rack in a large shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the sugar, brown sugar, cornstarch, ketchup, vinegar and water until smooth. Bring to a boil. Cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until thickened. Remove ribs and rack from pan. Drain and discard fat. Return ribs to roasting pan; drizzle 1-1/2 cups sauce over ribs. Bake 30 minutes longer. Cut ribs into serving-size pieces; brush with remaining sauce.
