Prepare barbecue grill or preheat broiler. Sprinkle chili powder and salt to taste, if desired, over steak. Arrange steak and onion slices on grill grate or broiler pan. Spoon 1/3 cup salsa over steak and onion slices. Grill or broil 4 to 5 inches from heat source 4 to 5 minutes per side or until meat is pink in center and onion slices are tender. Transfer steak to carving board; cut crosswise into thin strips. Place steak in a medium bowl. Separate onion slices into rings; add to bowl. Add 1 cup cheese; toss mixture well. Fill warmed tortillas with steak mixture, lettuce, tomato, remaining cheese and remaining salsa. Garnish as desired.
