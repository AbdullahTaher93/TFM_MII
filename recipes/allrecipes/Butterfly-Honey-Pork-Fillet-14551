In a shallow glass dish or bowl, mix together honey and Worcestershire sauce. Add pork chops and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for no more than 4 hours to marinate. Lightly oil grill and preheat to medium low. Remove pork chops from marinade. Season with pepper to taste and grill for 35 to 40 minutes, turning often.
