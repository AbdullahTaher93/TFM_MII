Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. On a large rimmed baking sheet, toss leeks with oil; season with salt and pepper. Roast, tossing once, until beginning to soften, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove leeks from oven, toss with pan juices to coat, and push to edges of baking sheet. Arrange salmon pieces in center, and season generously with salt and pepper. Return to oven; roast until salmon is just opaque throughout, 10 to 15 minutes (depending on thickness). Serve salmon with leeks and lemon wedges.
