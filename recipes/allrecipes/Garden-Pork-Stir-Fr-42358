In a skillet or wok coated with nonstick cooking spray, stir-fry the pork until no longer pink, about 4 minutes. Add zucchini, mushrooms, onion and green pepper; stir-fry for 3 minutes or until crisp-tender. In a small bowl, combine cornstarch, soy sauce, water and garlic powder until smooth. Add to the skillet. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until thickened and bubbly. Serve over rice.
