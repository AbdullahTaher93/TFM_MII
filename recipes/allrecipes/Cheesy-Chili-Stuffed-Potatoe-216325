In a large skillet, brown ground beef with the onion over medium heat; drain. Add Chili Magic, diced tomatoes, and zucchini; cover and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the zucchini is tender, stirring occasionally. Add cheese, stirring until melted. Split open the baked potatoes and top with the cheesy chili. Optional: Top each serving with sour cream and sliced scallions.
