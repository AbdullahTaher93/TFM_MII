Mix the garlic and olive oil in a small microwave-safe bowl. Cook 15 seconds in the microwave on High, or just until warm. In a large bowl, toss together the garlic and olive oil, garbanzo beans, tomato, onion, and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper, and garnish with lemon slices. Cover and chill until serving.
