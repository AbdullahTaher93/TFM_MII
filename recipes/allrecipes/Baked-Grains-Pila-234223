Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, celery, bell pepper, and corn in the hot oil until softened, about 10 minutes. Mix onion mixture, millet, quinoa, and salt together in an 8x8-inch casserole dish; pour in chicken stock. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until grains are tender and have absorbed all the liquid, about 30 minutes.
