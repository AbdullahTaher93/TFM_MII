Place half the oats, sugar, and bran in each of 2 baking pans, 10 by 15 inches. With your hands, crumble sugar and mix ingredients well. In a 1- to 2-quart pan over medium heat, stir oil, honey, and vanilla until bubbly. Pour half the hot mixture into each baking pan and mix well. Bake, uncovered, in a 350 degrees F oven. After 10 minutes, stir granola mixture. If using 1 oven, switch pan positions. Continue baking until oats are lightly toasted, about 10 minutes more. Stir in dried fruit, cranberries, and crystallized ginger, breaking up any clumps. Bake until oats are crisp, 5 to 10 minutes longer. Stir. Let cool 5 minutes and stir again. When cool, serve or store in an airtight container up to 1 month.
