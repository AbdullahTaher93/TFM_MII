Place 10 wooden skewers (each 12 inches long) in a bowl of water to cover; let stand 30 minutes. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Slice off and discard top 1 inch from artichokes. Trim off stems. Remove and discard small leaves from bottom of artichokes, and trim sharp points off larger leaves. Add artichokes to water and simmer, covered, until bottoms pierce easily, 30 to 35 minutes. Drain well and let stand until cool enough to handle. While artichokes cook, prepare the aillioli sauce. In a blender or food processor, whirl mayonnaise, lemon juice, 3 cloves garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and your choice of herb until blended. Spoon aillioli into a small serving bowl; garnish with herbs, if desired. In a small mixing bowl, blend oil, vinegar, 1 clove garlic, cumin, paprika, and remaining salt. Cut the halibut into 1-inch cubes; add to marinade, stir to coat, and let stand 15 minutes. Thread fish evenly onto wooden skewers (discard marinade). Place skewers on an oiled grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (close lid on grill). Cook skewers, turning once, until fish is barely opaque but still moist-looking in center of thickest part (cut to test), 3 to 6 minutes total. Place bowl of aillioli in the center of a large platter and arrange artichokes and halibut on skewers around the bowl for dipping.
