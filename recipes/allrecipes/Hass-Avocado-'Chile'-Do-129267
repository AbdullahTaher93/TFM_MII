In large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat; add sliced onions to pan. Cook onions, stirring frequently until wilted. Reduce heat to low and caramelize onions, stirring occasionally (about 15 minutes); set aside. Grill hot dogs over medium-hot coals until lightly browned. Open hot dog buns and grill flat. On each hot dog bun, spread mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard; add hot sauce. Place hot dogs on each dressed bun and top with grilled onions, tomato, raw onion and avocado.
