Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray. Puree peppers in a blender until smooth; pour into a bowl. Add turkey and bread crumbs to bowl; mix. Form the turkey mixture into a loaf and place on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 45 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
