Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Add hake, cover, and steam until easily flaked with a fork, about 25 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add red onion, tomato paste, and garlic; cook and stir until dark and thick, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in red wine; cook for 1 minute. Stir in canned tomatoes, oregano, basil, and dill weed. Simmer sauce until thickened, about 5 minutes. Cut hake into 1-inch chunks and stir into the sauce. Season sauce with lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Serve over pasta.
