Set aside 1/2 pound of the nicest chard stems; reserve the rest for another use. Bring 2 inches of water to a boil in a large stockpot. Add the 1/2 pound of chard stems and cook until almost tender, about 4 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the stems to a plate to cool. Add the chard leaves to the boiling water in batches, adding more as each batch wilts. When all the leaves have been added, cook for 1 minute. Drain the chard leaves; let cool, then squeeze dry and coarsely chop. Cut the stems into 1-inch pieces. Melt the butter in a large enameled cast-iron casserole. Add the onion and jalapenos and cook over low heat until softened, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the curry powder and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes longer. Add the cream and simmer over moderately high heat until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Stir in the chard leaves and stems and season with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, cover the rice with the water and bring to a boil. Cover and cook over low heat until the water has been absorbed, about 12 minutes. Fluff the rice. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut the tops off the bell peppers, leaving a 1/2-inch ring of pepper around each stem. Scoop out the seeds and ribs. Stand the peppers in a large baking dish or roasting pan and rub the skins with olive oil. Season the insides of the peppers with salt and pepper and spoon a scant 1/4 cup of rice into each one. Fill the peppers with the creamed chard and replace the tops; oil the tops. Bake for about 1 hour, or until the peppers are tender and the filling is hot.
