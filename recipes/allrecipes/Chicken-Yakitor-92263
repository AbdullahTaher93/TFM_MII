Soak 16 6- to 8-inch bamboo skewers in hot water to cover for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a 1/2-quart pan, combine soy sauce, sherry, and sugar. Bring to a boil over high heat; then reduce heat and simmer for 3 minutes. Pour into a 9- by 13-inch dish and set aside. Trim roots and any wilted tops from onions; then cut onions into 1 1/2-inch lengths. Thread onions and chicken onto skewers, alternating chicken with onion pieces. Place skewered food into soy mixture, turn to coat, and let stand for 15 minutes. Lift skewers from marinade and drain briefly (reserve marinade). Place skewers on a lightly oiled grill 4 to 6 inches above a solid bed of low coals or on a rack in a broiler pan about 4 inches below heat. Cook, turning as needed to brown evenly and basting with marinade, until meat is no longer pink in thickest part; cut to test (about 10 minutes).
