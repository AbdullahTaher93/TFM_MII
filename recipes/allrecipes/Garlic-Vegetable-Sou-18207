Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Saute the carrots, celery and cabbage in the oil for about 8 minutes, stirring well. Raise heat to high and pour in the broth, tomatoes and water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 1 hour. Remove lid, stir in macaroni and heat for 5 minutes, or until macaroni is tender. Remove from heat and stir in the garlic and ground black pepper.
