Place potatoes and water in a 2-qt. microwave-safe dish. Cover and cook on high for 10-15 minutes or until tender, stirring halfway through; drain. In a large bowl, combine the remaining ingredients. Add potatoes; stir gently to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Drain, reserving marinade. Thread potatoes on metal or soaked wooden skewers. Grill, covered, over hot heat for 6-8 minutes or until potatoes are golden brown. Turn and brush occasionally with reserved marinade.
