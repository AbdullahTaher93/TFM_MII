In a small bowl, combine olive oil, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, red pepper and basil. Marinate 4 hours. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain. Toss pasta with marinade until evenly coated. Spread into a baking dish. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Divide onto plates, top with grilled chicken, and sprinkle with goat cheese.
