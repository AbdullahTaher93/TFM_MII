In a bowl, combine roll mix and contents of yeast packet; mix well. Stir in tomato juice, water, egg and 2 tablespoons of butter. Add carrot, celery and onion; stir until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead for 5 minutes. Cover and let rest for 5 minutes. Divide dough in half; roll each portion into a 12-in. circle. Brush with remaining butter. Combine Parmesan cheese and garlic powder; sprinkle over dough. Cut each circle into eight wedges; roll up wedges from the wide end. Place, point side down, 2 in. apart on lightly greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 25 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks to cool.
