In a 10- to 12- inch frying pan, stir together mango nectar, broth, lime juice, ginger, and cinnamon. Add chicken to broth mixture and simmer, covered, over medium heat until meat in the thickest part is no longer pink; cut to test (15 to 20 minutes). Transfer chicken to a platter and keep warm. Bring cooking liquid to a boil over high heat; then boil, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 1/2 cup (2 to 3 minutes). Stir cornstarch into 2 tablespoons of water and pour the mixture into the pan. Return to a boil and stir until the sauce is thickened. Season to taste with salt. Spoon sauce over chicken. Garnish with lime slices, if desired.
