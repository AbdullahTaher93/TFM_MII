Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread pine nuts on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for about 5 minutes or until golden brown. Cool. Grind 1/4 cup of the pine nuts and reserve remaining for garnish. Mix ground pine nuts, cornmeal, flour, salt, cayenne pepper and cumin in a shallow dish or on a piece of wax paper. Dredge catfish fillets in the pine nut mixture. Set aside on a wax paper-lined baking sheet. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry catfish fillets, two at a time, in the hot oil for 4 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Sprinkle fillets with whole pine nuts and serve.
