In a saucepan, combine sugar and cornstarch. Gradually add water. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until thickened and bubbly. Reduce heat to low; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir 1 cup of hot filling into egg yolks. Return all to pan and bring to a gentle boil. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat. Stir in butter. Gently stir in lemon juice, vinegar and extract. Pour hot filling into pastry shell. For meringue, combine water and cornstarch in a saucepan until smooth. Cook and stir until thickened and clear, about 2 minutes. Cool completely. Meanwhile, beat egg whites in a mixing bowl until stiff peaks form. Beat in vanilla and salt. Gradually add cornstarch mixture, beating well on high. Immediately spread over warm filling, sealing edges to pastry. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until the meringue is golden brown. Cool. Store in the refrigerator.
