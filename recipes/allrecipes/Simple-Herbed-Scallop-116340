In a small saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Add the lemon juice, chives, parsley, garlic salt, tarragon and pepper; stir well. Place scallops in a greased 1-qt. baking dish. Pour butter mixture over scallops. Melt remaining butter and toss with bread crumbs; sprinkle over scallops. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until scallops are opaque and topping is lightly browned.
