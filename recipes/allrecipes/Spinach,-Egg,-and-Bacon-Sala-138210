Peel eggs, and chop them coarsely. Set aside. Cook bacon in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until golden brown and crisp, about 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer bacon to a plate lined with a double thickness of paper towels. Reserve 1 teaspoon of bacon fat, and discard the rest. Meanwhile, combine garlic, shallots, lemon juice, and sherry vinegar in a small bowl. Whisk in olive oil, add parsley, and season with salt and pepper. In a large bowl, toss together spinach, cooked bacon, reserved warm bacon fat, vinaigrette, and chopped eggs. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary, and serve immediately.
