Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat, and saute the onions about 5 minutes, until tender. Stir in the garlic, then mix in the cabbage and red bell pepper. Continue to cook just until slightly tender. Stir the cracked wheat into the skillet. Pour in the tomato sauce and water, and bring to a boil. If the liquid does not completely cover everything, add more water and tomato sauce. Season with dried basil, paprika, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes, until all the liquid has been absorbed. Top with Parmesan cheese and fresh basil leaves to serve.
