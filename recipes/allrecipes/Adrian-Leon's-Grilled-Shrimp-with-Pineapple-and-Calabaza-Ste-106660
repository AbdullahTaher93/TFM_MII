Marinade: Saute 2 sliced garlic cloves, 1/3 cup onions and pineapple in olive oil to light golden brown. Add pineapple juice, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and oregano and cook for another 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let the mixture cool. When cooled add roasted skinless jalapeno, vinegar and cilantro. Mix everything together with a blender. Toss the shrimp with the marinade and refrigerate in a covered medium bowl for at least one hour. For the squash: Remove corn kernels from the cob and save the cobs (you should have about 2 cups of kernels). Place corn cobs and 1 quart of water in a 4 quart stockpot. Bring stockpot to a boil and reduce the heat to medium, simmer for 15 more minutes. Strain the corn stock and set aside. Grill the poblanos over an open flame until they are charred. Put them in a plastic bag to sweat, about 4 minutes. When cool enough to handle, peel off the skins and discard (do not wash the chiles with water, this will reduce the flavor). Cut the chilies into 1/4 inch strips (Rajas). Cook 1 2/3 cups onions and margarine until translucent (about 2 minutes) in a 4 quart heavy stockpot (cazuela or deep cast-iron frying pan) over medium heat. Stirring occasionally, add corn kernels, diced squash and 6 cloves of garlic. Continue cooking for another 10 minutes then add epazote (or cilantro) and cook for 5 more minutes. Remove pan from heat and mix in sour cream and season with salt and pepper. Grill shrimp for a minute each side or pan fry similarly. Season with salt and pepper and serve over squash. Serve squash stew on a platter with grilled shrimp on top.
