Coat a shallow baking pan with cooking oil spray. Arrange potatoes, skin side down, in a single layer in pan; coat cut surfaces with cooking spray. Mix cumin and cayenne; sprinkle over potatoes. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven until potatoes are golden brown and tender when pierced (about 1 hour). Season to taste with salt.
