In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water; let stand for 5 minutes. Add milk, butter, sugar, salt, eggs and 2 cups flour; beat on low for 3 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn the dough onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl; turn once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down; divide in half. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; roll out each half into a 12-in. x 8-in. rectangle. Spread with butter. Combine remaining filling ingredients; sprinkle over butter. Roll up from a long side; pinch seam to seal. Cut into 12 slices; place with cut side down in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Cool in pan on a wire rack. Combine the icing ingredients and drizzle over warm rolls.
