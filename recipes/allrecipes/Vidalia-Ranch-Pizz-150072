Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 12x15 inch baking sheet. Spread the pizza dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Spread the ranch dressing over the dough; sprinkle with garlic powder. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the onion in the oil until translucent; season with salt. Bake the crust in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Spread 1 cup of ranch dressing, the cooked onions, tomato slices, Cheddar cheese, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and black pepper over the baked crust. Return to preheated oven and bake until crust is golden brown and cheese is melted, 12 to 15 minutes. Allow pizza to cool for 5 minutes before cutting to serve.
