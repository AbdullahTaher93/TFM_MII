Cut the jalapeno peppers into thin strips. Place a strip or two of jalapeno pepper and cheddar cheese inside each shrimp. Sprinkle the stuffed shrimp with garlic powder and Old Bay Seasoning TM. Wrap each shrimp with a slice of bacon and secure with a toothpick. Thread shrimp onto skewers. Grill over medium high heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until firm.
