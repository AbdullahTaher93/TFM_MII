Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the beef into a 1 quart glass baking dish. Mix in the red onion, green pepper, tomato, and if using, the chile pepper. Blend in the chile paste by hand. Cook, uncovered, for 30 to 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the meat is no longer pink. Serve hot with flatbread, or wrapped in a pita.
