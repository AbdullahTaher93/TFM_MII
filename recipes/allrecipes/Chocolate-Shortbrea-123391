In a mixing bowl, cream the butter. Add vanilla and mix well. Combine flour, sugar and cocoa; add to creamed mixture. Beat until dough holds together, about 3 minutes. Pat into a 9-in. x 4-in. rectangle. Cut into 2-in. x 1-1/2-in. strips. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Prick with a fork. Bake at 300 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until set. Cool for 5 minutes; remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
