Lightly toast pita bread. Break tuna chunks into small pieces in a bowl; stir in pickle, mayonnaise, olive oil, garlic powder, and rosemary until evenly blended. Place Swiss cheese into the pocket of the toasted pita bread and spoon in tuna mixture. Heat pita sandwich in the microwave on a microwave-safe dish until cheese is melted, 15 to 20 seconds.
