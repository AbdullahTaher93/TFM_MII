Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place the chicken breasts in a 9x13 inch baking dish. On top of each breast place a large spoonful of soup and a slice of cheese. Crush the stuffing mix and sprinkle on top of the cheese, then drizzle with the melted butter or margarine. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour (don't overcook the chicken!). Let cool and serve.
