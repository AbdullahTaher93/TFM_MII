In a large skillet, saute the onions, green peppers, celery and garlic in butter until crisp-tender. Place in a very large bowl; stir in the remaining ingredients. Transfer to three greased shallow 3-qt. baking dishes. Cover and bake at 375 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until rice is tender, stirring twice.
