Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring water to boil in a medium saucepan. Place frozen brussels sprouts in the water, and return to boil. Reduce heat, and simmer 6 to 7 minutes, until tender; drain. In a medium bowl, mix brussels sprouts with butter, cream of mushroom soup, eggs, Cheddar cheese, and 1/3 cup bread crumbs. Transfer to a medium baking dish, and top with remaining bread crumbs. Cover, and bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly. Uncover, and continue baking 5 minutes, until lightly browned.
