Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add mushrooms and saute until golden brown. Add shallots, peppercorns, and wine; simmer until almost all of the liquid has evaporated. Using a wire whisk, mix in 7 tablespoons of the butter over low heat. Season with salt to taste. Set sauce aside and keep warm. Place flour in a shallow dish or on a piece of wax paper and season with salt and pepper. Dredge catfish fillets in seasoned flour. Set aside on a wax paper-lined baking sheet. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in large skillet over medium heat. Fry the fillets two at a time in the hot butter for 3 to 4 minutes on each side or until browned and fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Spoon some sauce onto each serving plate and top with a fillet.
