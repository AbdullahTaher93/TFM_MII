Beat yogurt and egg together in a large mixing bowl; add water and flour. Beat the mixture with an electric hand mixer until smooth; transfer to a large pot over medium heat and stir chile peppers into the mixture. Bring the yogurt mixture to a boil. Add celery, Swiss chard, and spinach to the yogurt mixture. Continue cooking until the celery softens, 15 - 20 minutes. Serve hot or chill and serve cold.
