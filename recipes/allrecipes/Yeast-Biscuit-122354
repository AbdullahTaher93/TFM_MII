In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add sugar, butter, milk, eggs, salt and whole wheat flour; beat until smooth. Add enough all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours. Punch dough down; divide into thirds. Let rest for 5 minutes. On a floured surface, roll out each portion to 1/2-in. thickness. Cut with a 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter. Place on lightly greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans and cool on wire racks.
