Combine flour and pepper in a shallow dish. Dredge turkey in the flour mixture. Reserve 2 teaspoons of the flour mixture. Heat oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the turkey and cook until browned on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and cover with foil to keep it warm. Add onion, thyme and water to the pan. Cook, stirring often, until the onions are slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle with the reserved flour mixture; stir to coat. Add broth and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly. Cook until the onion is softened, about 3 minutes. Add capers, lemon juice and parsley to the sauce. Return the turkey to the pan. Cook, turning once, until heated through, about 1 minute.
