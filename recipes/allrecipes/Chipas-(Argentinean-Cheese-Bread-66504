Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Oil a baking sheet with cooking spray and set aside. Stir together egg, milk, cheese, and butter in a large bowl. Sprinkle in tapioca starch and flour; stir in to form a dough. Knead dough for two minutes on a lightly floured surface, then roll into golf ball-sized pieces, and place onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
