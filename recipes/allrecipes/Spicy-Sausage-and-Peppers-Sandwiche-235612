Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook for 5 minutes or until well browned, stirring occasionally. Pour off any fat. Add the green pepper, onion and salt and black pepper to the skillet and cook for 2 minutes or until the vegetables are tender-crisp, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and cook and stir for 30 seconds. Stir in the sauce. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the sausage is cooked through. Divide the sausage mixture among the rolls and sprinkle with the cheese.
