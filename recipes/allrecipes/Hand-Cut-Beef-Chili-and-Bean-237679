Heat enough olive oil in a large pot to cover the bottom of the pot over high heat; sear beef in hot oil in batches until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes per batch. Remove browned beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl between batches. Pour some olive oil into the pot with the browned bits of beef on the bottom; heat until shimmering. Saute onion and garlic in the hot oil until beginning to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour red wine into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until the wine reduces slightly in volume, about 5 minutes. Pour tomato sauce, chili beans with sauce, white beans, black beans, and kidney beans into the pot; stir. Bring the mixture to a simmer and reduce heat to medium-low. Stir sea salt, cumin, black pepper, cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, sugar, garlic powder, coriander, paprika, cinnamon, and nutmeg into the beef mixture. Cook until the beef is very tender, 2 to 3 hours.
