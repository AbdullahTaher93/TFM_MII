Place 3 cups water, lentils, tomato, carrot, onion, garlic, and chicken bouillon in a stockpot over medium heat; cook until vegetables and lentils are softened, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to lukewarm. Blend vegetable and lentil mixture with an immersion blender until smooth. Stir 1 cup water, cumin, sea salt, pepper, and coriander into soup; heat over medium heat until warmed.
