Snap off and discard tough ends of asparagus; rinse spears well. In a deep, wide frying pan, bring about 1 inch water to a boil over high heat; add asparagus and cook, uncovered, until barely tender when pierced (3 to 5 minutes). Drain and immerse in ice water. When cool, drain again; then arrange equally on 4 salad plates (or arrange all asparagus on a platter). In a bowl, mix oil, tomatillos, and tomato; evenly spoon over asparagus. Sprinkle with cheese. Garnish with lemon wedges. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
