Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain. Heat butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; stir flour into the melted butter until well mixed; cook about 3 minutes. Slowly pour milk into flour mixture, stirring constantly until well incorporated. Add garlic; cook and stir until sauce is thickened, about 2 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese and Asiago cheese; stir until cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes. Reduce heat to low and simmer garlic sauce while preparing remaining ingredients. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; add mushrooms and red bell pepper. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Place angel hair pasta in a serving bowl; toss to coat with garlic sauce. Add mushroom mixture and green onion; toss gently. Top with 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese.
