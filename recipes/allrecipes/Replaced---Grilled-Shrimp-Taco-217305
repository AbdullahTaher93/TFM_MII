Heat grill. In a shallow dish combine the lime juice and zest, olive oil and cumin. Add shrimp; toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Thread shrimp onto skewers; discard marinade. Grill just until shrimp are cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Roughly chop shrimp if desired. Combine the Taco Ranch Dressing, sour cream and shredded cheese included in the Dole Southwest Salad Kit. Spread some of the mixture over each warm tortilla, top with shrimp and serve with Dole Southwest Salad, salsa, cheese, sour cream, tomato and olives. Garnish with tortilla strips included in package. Serve with lime wedges.
