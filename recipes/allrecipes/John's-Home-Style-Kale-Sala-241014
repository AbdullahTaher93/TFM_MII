Whisk olive oil and garlic together in a bowl; let rest until flavors blend, at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread bread strips out onto a baking sheet and season with black pepper. Bake bread in the preheated oven until toasted, about 5 minutes. Combine kale leaves, toasted bread, Romano cheese, and tomatoes in a large bowl. Pour olive oil mixture and lemon juice over the top; toss to coat completely.
