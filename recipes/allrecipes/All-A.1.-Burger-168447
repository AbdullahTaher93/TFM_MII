Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Mix meat and 2 tablespoons of the steak sauce; shape into four 1/2-inch-thick patties. Grill 5 minutes on each side or until cooked through (160 degrees F), placing buns, cut-sides down, on grill grate for the last 2 minutes. Place lettuce on bottom halves of buns; top with tomatoes, burgers and remaining 2 tablespoons steak sauce. Cover with tops of buns.
