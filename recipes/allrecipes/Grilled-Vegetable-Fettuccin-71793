Preheat grill or broiler. Cut zucchini and squash lengthwise into quarters. Cut bell peppers lengthwise into quarters; discard stems and seeds. Brush dressing over all surfaces of vegetables. Grill over medium coals 10 to 12 minutes or broil on top rack 10 to 12 minutes or until vegetables are tender, turning occasionally. Meanwhile, in medium saucepan, bring 1-1/4 cups water, milk, margarine, pasta and Special Seasonings to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Gently boil uncovered, 5 to 6 minutes or until pasta is slightly firm, stirring occasionally. Cut grilled vegetables into 1/2-inch chunks; stir into pasta mixture. Let stand 3 minutes. Top pasta with cheese and basil.
