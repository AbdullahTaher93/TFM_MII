In a bowl, whisk together flour, eggs, egg substitute, milk and salt until smooth. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Heat an 8-in. nonstick skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray; pour about 1/4 cup batter into center of skillet. Lift and tilt pan to evenly coat bottom. Cook until top appears dry; turn and cook 15-20 seconds longer. Remove to a wire rack. Repeat with remaining batter, add nonstick cooking spray as needed. When cool, stack crepes with waxed paper to paper towels in between. In a skillet, saute the onion, green pepper and mushrooms in oil until tender. Add zucchini; saute 2-3 minutes longer. Remove from the heat; stir in tomatoes, 1 cup of cheese, salt, oregano and pepper. Spoon onto crepes and roll up. Arrange in a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Spread spaghetti sauce over crepes. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake, uncovered, 5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.
