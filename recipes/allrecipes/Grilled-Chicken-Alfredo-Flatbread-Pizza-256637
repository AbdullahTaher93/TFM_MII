Marinate chicken breast in Italian dressing for 10 minutes. Slice chicken thinly across the grain into pieces the width of thick bacon. Cut bread dough into 2 equal pieces. Roll dough into 9-inch circles. Spread Alfredo sauce evenly over dough. Cover with a little mozzarella cheese. Add chicken, mushrooms, and bacon. Sprinkle remaining mozzarella cheese on top. Place 1 pizza in the Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven and press "Auto Cook." Select the frozen pizza setting, 9-inch size. Allow pizza to cook until timer goes off, about 13 minutes. Repeat with second pizza.
