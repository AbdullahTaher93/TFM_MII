Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Set a foil-covered wire rack over a foil-covered lipped cookie sheet. Use a fork to pierce foil on rack all over. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook onions in oil until tender and golden, about 5 minutes. Break up ground beef in a large bowl. Mix in cooked onions, eggs, milk, cracker crumbs, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and salt and pepper. Divide meat mixture into 2 portions. Place on foiled-lined wire rack, and form into 2 oval loaves. Mix together brown sugar, mustard, and ketchup in a small bowl. Brush mixture over each loaf. Bake until cooked through (160 degrees on a meat thermometer), about 45 to 50 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes to cool, slice, and serve.
