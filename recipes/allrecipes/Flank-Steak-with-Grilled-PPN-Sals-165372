Cut each piece of fruit into 8 slices. Place fruit and jalapenos on a well-oiled grill over medium heat and cook for a few minutes on each side to lightly char. Let cool, then chop and place in a medium bowl with onion, cilantro and lime juice. Stir to combine. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Thoroughly tenderize the meat by pricking both sides with meat tenderizer or fork. Stir together garlic salt, cumin, oregano and chili powder in a small bowl and rub onto both sides of meat. Place on grill over medium heat and cook for 5 to 7 minutes on each side or until meat is cooked to your liking. Let stand for 5 minutes before thinly carving at an angle against the grain. Transfer meat and juices to a platter. Serve with grilled PPN salsa.
