Beat egg and water together in a small bowl. Cut two rounds from each sheet of puff pastry using a 3-inch round cutter, forming 8 circles. Use a 2 1/2-inch round cutter to cut through 4 of the rounds. Place entire cut round on top of an un-cut round. Brush each with egg mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and golden, 20 to 25 minutes.
