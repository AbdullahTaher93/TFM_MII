Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Mix flour and nutmeg; set aside. Beat 3/4 cup butter and granulated sugar in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Gradually stir in flour mixture until well mixed. Stir in nuts. If needed, refrigerate 30 minutes or until dough is easy to handle. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Place about 1 inch apart on baking sheets. Make an indent in center of each ball with thumb. (Refrigerate remainder of dough while baking each batch of cookies.) Bake 10 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Cool on baking sheets 1 minute. Remove to wire racks; cool completely. For the Eggnog Filling, beat 1/4 cup butter in medium bowl until softened. Gradually add confectioners' sugar; beat until fluffy. Beat in milk and rum extract. Pipe or spoon about 1/2 teaspoon into center of each cooled cookie. Sprinkle with additional nutmeg, if desired.
