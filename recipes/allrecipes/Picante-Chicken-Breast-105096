Heat butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Lightly sprinkle salt and pepper over chicken breasts. When oil is hot, add chicken breasts. Cook until golden brown on one side, turn and continue to cook until cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer to 4 individual serving plates before returning the pan to the heat. In a small bowl, mix the salsa, broth, lime and lemon juice. Pour into hot skillet, stirring until the sauce has reduced, about 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in sour cream. Spoon a portion of sauce over each chicken breast and serve immediately.
