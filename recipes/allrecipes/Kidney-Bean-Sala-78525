Place eggs in a saucepan with enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil. Remove saucepan from heat. Cover, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Drain, cool, peel, and chop. In a bowl, mix the hard-cooked eggs, kidney beans, onion, celery, relish, and mayonnaise. Season with salt and pepper. Chill at least 1 hour in the refrigerator before serving.
