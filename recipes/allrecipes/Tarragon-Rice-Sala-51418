Prepare the instant rice according to package directions. Place the eggs in a saucepan with enough cold water to cover. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from water, cool, peel and chop. In a bowl, mix the cooked rice, tarragon, green onions, chives, olive oil, and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Cover, and chill at least 1 hour in the refrigerator. Toss with the chopped eggs to serve.
