Combine stock, orange juice, liqueur, salt, and pepper in a large, shallow, nonreactive saucepan. Bring to a boil, and add endive. Cover endive with cheesecloth to keep it submerged, reduce heat to medium low, and cover; simmer until tender, about 45 minutes. Transfer endive to a plate, and cover with cheesecloth to keep warm. Continue simmering liquid until syrupy and slightly thick, about 20 minutes. Slice heads of endive in half lengthwise; add to syrup. Add orange slices, and toss to coat. Toss again, and serve.
