In a small dry skillet over low heat, stir walnuts until lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool. In a large salad bowl, whisk together chicken broth, vinegar, oil, shallots, mustard, salt and pepper. Add greens and toss thoroughly. Sprinkle with the walnuts and additional black pepper to taste.
