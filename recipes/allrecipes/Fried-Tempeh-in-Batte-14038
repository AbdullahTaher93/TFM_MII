Combine flour, green onion, garlic, egg, coriander, ginger, water, salt and pepper in a mixing bowl, mix until the mixture becomes a thin cake-batter like consistency, adding more water if necessary. Slice the tempeh about 1 inch thick. Dip tempeh into the batter and place them one at a time into a skillet of hot oil. Fry the tempeh until golden brown. Serve while warm.
