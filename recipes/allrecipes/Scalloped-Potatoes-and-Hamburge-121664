In a skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. In a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish, layer half of the potatoes, onion and beef; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Repeat layers. In a bowl, combine the soup, milk and green pepper; mix well. Pour over top. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes. Uncover; bake 15 minutes longer or until potatoes are tender.
