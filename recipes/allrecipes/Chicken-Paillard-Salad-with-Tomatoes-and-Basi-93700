Lay the chicken breasts on a work surface. With a scaloppine pounder or heavy skillet, flatten to 1/2-inch thickness. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the cheese and bread crumbs on both sides, pressing to adhere. Glaze a large saute pan, stove-top griddle, or grill pan with oil. Set over high heat. Sear the breasts for about 4 minutes each side in 2 batches if necessary, or until well browned and no longer pink in the middle. Press down occasionally with a pancake turner. Remove to a tray. Allow to rest for 5 minutes. Cut into thick diagonal slices. In a large bowl, combine 1/4 cup oil, the lemon juice, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Whisk. Add the greens, tomatoes, scallions, basil, and chicken. Toss gently.
