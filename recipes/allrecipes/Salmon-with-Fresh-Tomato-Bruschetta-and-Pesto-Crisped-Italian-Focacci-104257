Place fish in oven proof shallow baking dish. Brush each fillet with olive or vegetable oil. Squeeze fresh lemon juice over fillets. Season with garlic, Morton(R) Kosher Salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. Drain fish fillets of any marinade; discard marinade. In large glass bowl, combine tomatoes, red onion, garlic, basil, Morton(R) Kosher Salt, and pepper, with olive oil and vinegar. Cover and allow flavors to combine until needed. Toast focaccia until crisp; spread evenly with basil pesto mixture. Keep warm for serving. Bake fish at 350 degrees F for 20 to 30 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Serve cooked fish immediately with bruschetta mixture and crisp focaccia bread.
