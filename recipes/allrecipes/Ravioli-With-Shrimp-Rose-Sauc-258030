Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until very tender and lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in 1/2 cup white wine; cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Stir remaining 1/2 cup white wine, crushed tomatoes, and Italian seasoning into onion mixture; cook for 15 minutes. Mix cream, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, and basil into tomato sauce; cook for 5 minutes. Add cooked shrimp; cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in frozen ravioli and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain. Mix ravioli into tomato sauce and top with remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.
