Stir together drained tomatoes, cheese, and basil in a medium bowl; set aside. Place chicken between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness. Top evenly with tomato mixture, pressing onto chicken. Combine tomato sauce and garlic in large skillet; add chicken. Bring sauce to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook 15 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink in center and measures 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Top with croutons just before serving.
