Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a large bowl, stir together the canola oil, melted butter, lemon juice, garlic, dill, salt and pepper. Add potatoes and toss to coat. Spread the potatoes out on a baking sheet and drizzle any remaining liquid from the bowl over them. Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are brown and crispy, about 45 minutes.
