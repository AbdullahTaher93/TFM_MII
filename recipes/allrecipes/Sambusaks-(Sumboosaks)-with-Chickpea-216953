Mix the flour, cornstarch, salt, baking powder, 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil, and water together in a bowl to form a dough; cover and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Divide the dough into 11 portions, and form into balls. Roll each dough ball out on a floured surface to a 5-inch circle. Cook the onion in 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat until browned, about 10 minutes; stir in the garbanzo beans, cilantro, cumin, coriander, salt, and black pepper until thoroughly combined. Heat 2 cups of vegetable oil in a deep-sided skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Break an egg into a greased custard cup, cover with a square of waxed paper, and cook in a microwave oven on High setting for 40 seconds. Place about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the garbanzo bean filling onto a dough circle, place the slightly cooked egg onto the filling, and gently fold the dough into a half-moon shape. Fold the dough edge over and crimp with a fork to seal in the filling. Deep fry the sambusaks, one or two at a time, in the hot oil until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Remove with a wire strainer, and drain on paper towels.
