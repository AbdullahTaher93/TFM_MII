Place turkey in a bowl with 1 tablespoon oyster sauce, 1/2 the ginger, and 1 tablespoon Chinese cooking wine. Marinate 20 minutes. Heat the oil and garlic in a wok over high heat. When garlic begins to brown, discard marinade from bowl and mix turkey into wok. Stir in remaining ginger and wine. Mix in remaining oyster sauce, lychees, chile peppers, and soy sauce. Reduce heat to low, cover, and continue cooking 5 minutes, or until turkey is done. Season with pepper, and garnish with cilantro and green onions to serve.
