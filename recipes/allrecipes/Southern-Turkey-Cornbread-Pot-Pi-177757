Heat the oven to 425 degrees F. Heat the soup, black pepper, turkey and corn in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Pour the turkey mixture into a 9-inch pie plate. Separate the cornbread into 8 pieces along perforations. (Do not unroll dough.) Place over the hot turkey mixture. Bake for 15 minutes or until the bread is golden.
