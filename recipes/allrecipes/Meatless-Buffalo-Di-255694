Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat cream cheese, blue cheese dressing, 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese, and Buffalo wing sauce together in a bowl. Slightly mash cannellini beans in a separate bowl; fold into the cheese mixture. Spread mixture into a pie pan or baking dish and top with remaining Cheddar cheese and chives. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes.
