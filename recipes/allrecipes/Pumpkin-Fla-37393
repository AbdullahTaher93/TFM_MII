SPRINKLE 3/4 cup sugar into a 10-inch round cakepan; place pan over medium heat. Using oven mitts, caramelize sugar by shaking pan occasionally until sugar melts and turns light brown; cool. (Sugar may crack as it cools.) PROCESS condensed milk and next 8 ingredients in a blender or food processor until smooth, stopping to scrape down sides. Pour over caramelized sugar in cakepan. PLACE cakepan in a large shallow pan. Pour hot water into large pan to a depth of 1 inch. BAKE at 350 degrees for 50 minutes or until a knife inserted in center comes out clean. REMOVE cakepan from water; cool on a wire rack 25 minutes. Cover and chill 8 hours. LOOSEN edges of flan with a metal spatula, and invert onto a serving plate. Dip tops of pecan halves in caramel mixture left in pan; arrange, coated side up, around edge of flan.
