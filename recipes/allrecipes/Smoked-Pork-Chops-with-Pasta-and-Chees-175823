In a 10- to 12-in. nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat, brown chops well, turning once (6 to 8 minutes). Remove from pan and keep warm on a warm platter. Meanwhile, in a 4- to 6-quart pan, bring about 3 quarts water to a boil over high heat; stir in pasta and cook, uncovered, until just tender to bite (8 to 10 minutes). Or cook pasta according to package directions. Meanwhile, in same frying pan, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until soft and lightly browned (3 to 5 minutes). Sprinkle in flour and cook, stirring, until bubbly. Remove from heat and gradually stir in milk; add mustard and pepper. Stir peas into pasta and water; drain and set aside. Return sauce to medium-high heat and cook, stirring, until mixture comes to a boil. Add cheese and stir until melted. Remove from heat, add pasta mixture; mix gently but thoroughly.
