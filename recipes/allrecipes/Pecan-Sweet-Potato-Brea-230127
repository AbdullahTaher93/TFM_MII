Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9x5-inch loaf pans. Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until smooth. Stir in sweet potatoes, sweetened condensed milk, eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves until well blended. Place all the baking mix in a large bowl; stir sweet potato mixture into baking mix until batter is just blended. Fold in pecans. Divide the batter evenly between the two loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center of the loaves comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes. Cool loaves in the pans for at least 5 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack, at least 2 hours.
