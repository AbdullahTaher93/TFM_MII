Melt margarine in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute the long grain rice, onion, carrot and raisins for 3 to 5 minutes or until onion is tender. Pour in the broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover pan and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, in a saucepan bring 1 1/2 cups salted water to a boil. Add wild rice, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 45 minutes. Drain and set aside. When the rice/raisin mixture is finished simmering (rice is cooked), stir in cooked wild rice, peas, pimentos and cashews and heat through.
