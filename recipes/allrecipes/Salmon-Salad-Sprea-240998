Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel. Mix salmon, mayonnaise, mustard, relish, raisins, red onion, celery seed, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Chop eggs, add to salmon mixture, and mix. Refrigerate salmon salad until chilled completely, at least 30 minutes.
