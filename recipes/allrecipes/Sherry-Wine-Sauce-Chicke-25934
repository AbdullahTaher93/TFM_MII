Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a 9x13 inch baking dish, combine the cream of chicken soup, cream of mushroom soup, sour cream and sherry. Mix all together. Add the chicken breasts and immerse them in the sauce. Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, for about 45 minutes or until chicken is cooked through (no longer pink inside).
