Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Generously season short ribs with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat vegetable oil over high heat in a heavy pot. Brown short ribs on all sides until they are dark brown, about 6 minutes; transfer to a bowl. Add onions and continue cooking over high heat until onions go from golden to dark brown, about 8 minutes; this will make a richer, darker sauce. Stir flour into the onion mixture; cook for about 1 minute. Pour in broth; add bay leaf, beets, carrots, and celery. Bring pot to a simmer. Place browned short ribs in pot, evenly distributing them among the vegetables. Bake in preheated oven until meat is tender, about 2 hours. Transfer meat and vegetables to a serving platter. Bring sauce to a fast simmer over high heat until it is reduced by half and slightly thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Taste for seasoning and add more salt, if needed. Serve in bowls topped with a dollop of sour cream and chopped fresh chives.
