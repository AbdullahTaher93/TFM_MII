In a large saucepan, heat the oil over moderate heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the canned tomatoes, fresh tomato, salt, and red-pepper flakes and bring to a simmer. Simmer the sauce until thick, about 30 minutes. Add the cod and 2 tablespoons of the parsley to the sauce. Bring back to a simmer and continue simmering until the fish is just done, 1 to 2 minutes. Break the fish into small pieces with a spoon. Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the penne until just done, about 13 minutes. Drain. Toss with the sauce. Top the pasta with the remaining tablespoon parsley.
