Slice steak into strips. Put them into a large re-sealable plastic bag with the 1 cup of marinade. Squish around to be sure that all pieces are coated well. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes but 2 hours is better. Julienne the scallions, bell pepper and celery. Shred the bok choy (about the size used in cole slaw) In a wok or a large skillet, heat the oil over medium high heat. To protect yourself from splatter, use a kitchen mitt or cover your hand loosely with a kitchen towel or dampened paper towel. Using tongs, remove the pieces of steak from the bag and carefully place in the wok. Discard marinade. Stir fry for about 2 minutes. Add the scallions, bell pepper, celery and bok choy and stir fry for another 3-4 minutes. Add 2 Tbsps of fresh marinade sauce. Stir and serve immediately.
