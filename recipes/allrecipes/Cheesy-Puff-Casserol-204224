Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spread butter on the Wonder Bread slices and cut into cubes. Place 1/3 of the cubes in a 2-quart casserole dish and sprinkle with 1/3 of the cheese; repeat twice. In a medium bowl beat eggs, milk, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, salt and paprika. Pour over bread and cheese layers. Cover the dish and chill for 3 hours. Bake uncovered for 1 hour. Let stand for 15 minutes before serving.
