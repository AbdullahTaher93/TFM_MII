Brush bread slices with 1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil and place on a baking sheet. Bake slices in a 375 degrees F oven until they start to turn golden, 6 to 8 minutes. Rub toasts with halved garlic clove; set aside. To a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium heat, add 2 to 3 more tablespoons olive oil. When oil is hot, add minced garlic, red bell pepper, and chile flakes; cook, stirring, until boldly fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add sliced kale and broth. Bring broth to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer, cover and cook 15 minutes. Uncover, and continue cooking kale until tender and broth evaporates, about 30 minutes more. Add salt and pepper to taste. Spoon braised kale over toasts, about 1 rounded tablespoon each.
