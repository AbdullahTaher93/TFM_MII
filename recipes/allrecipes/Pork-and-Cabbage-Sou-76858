Place sausage in a large pot, break apart, and cook until evenly brown. Pour the broth and water into the pot with the sausage. Dissolve the beef bouillon granules in the liquid. Mix in the cabbage, potatoes, onion, and garlic. Season with marjoram, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer 20 minutes.
