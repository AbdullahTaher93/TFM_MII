Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place artichokes stem-side down in a bowl and drizzle with lemon juice. Slightly separate the artichoke leaves with your hands. Insert a knife blade into the center of each artichoke to create a garlic clove-size space. Drizzle each artichoke with olive oil. Press 1 clove of garlic into the center of each artichoke and season with salt. Tightly wrap each artichoke twice with heavy-duty aluminum foil. Place in baking dish and bake in the preheated oven until sizzling, about 1 hour 20 minutes
