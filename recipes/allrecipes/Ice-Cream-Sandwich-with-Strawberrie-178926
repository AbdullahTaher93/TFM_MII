Allow ice cream sandwiches to soften slightly, about 3 minutes. Place almonds in a shallow bowl and roll ice cream sandwiches in almonds, so almonds stick well to the sides. Stack sandwiches onto a dinner plate. Top with any remaining almonds and scatter strawberries on bottom of plate and atop stacked ice cream sandwiches. Drizzle with chocolate sauce.
