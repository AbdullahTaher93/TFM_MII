Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, cloves and salt. Set aside. In a large bowl, combine sugar, eggs, and oil. Beat until smooth. Mix in baby food and nuts. Beat in flour mixture alternately with applesauce. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
