Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a bowl, add the Italian dressing and the oregano and rosemary. Stir with a fork or whisk. Remove the stem from the bell peppers. Wash out the seeds. Cut into 1 inch square pieces. Cut away the white membranes if you like. Slice the zucchini into 1/2 inch thick rounds. Cut the onion into 1 inch square pieces. Put the vegetables into a roasting pan or large casserole dish. Pour about 1/3 of the dressing over the veggies and toss to coat. Rinse the hens well. With kitchen shears, cut out the back bone by cutting along each side. Open up the hens so that they lay flat, breaking the wishbone helps. Dredge the hens in the dressing mixture then place on top of the vegetables. Pour the excess dressing over the hens and vegetables. Place roasting pan in the oven and reduce heat to 350 degrees F. Roast for 35-45 minutes or until you can easily twist a drumstick bone out of the socket. Let rest for 5-10 minutes. Cut each hen in half. Serve 1/2 hen per person with the vegetables evenly divided. The extra portion of hen is for those with a further appetite.
