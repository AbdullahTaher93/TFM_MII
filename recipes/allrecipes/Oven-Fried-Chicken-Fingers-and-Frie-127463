Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Cut potatoes into 1/2-inch-thick strips; place in large bowl. Add dressing and cheese; toss to coat. Place in single layer on large greased baking sheet. Bake 12 min. Meanwhile, coat chicken strips with coating mix as directed on package. Turn potatoes over with large spatula; push to one side of baking sheet. Place chicken strips on other side of baking sheet. Bake an additional 15 min. or until potatoes are tender and chicken is cooked through. Mix mustard and honey; serve for dipping.
