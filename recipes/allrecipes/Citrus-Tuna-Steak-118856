Peel and section grapefruit over a bowl, reserving juice. Refrigerate half of the grapefruit sections. Add remaining grapefruit to the reserved grapefruit juice. Add the lemon juice, lime juice, honey, dill, red pepper flakes and ginger. Remove 1/4 cup for basting; cover and refrigerate. Pour remaining marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add the tuna steaks. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 30 minutes, turning once. Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill. Drain and discard marinade from tuna. Grill tuna, uncovered, over medium heat for 6-7 minutes on each side, basting frequently with reserved marinade. Top tuna steaks with reserved grapefruit sections. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
