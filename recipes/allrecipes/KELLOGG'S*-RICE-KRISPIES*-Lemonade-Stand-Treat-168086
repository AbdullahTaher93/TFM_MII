Lightly crush cereal to 500 ml (2 cups). Combine with brown sugar and butter, mixing well. Reserve 50 ml (1/4 cup) cereal crumbs. Press remainder evenly into parchment paper-lined 2 L (7X11-inch) baking pan. Bake at 180 degrees C (350 degrees F) 7 to 8 minutes. Cool. Prepare lemon pie filling according to package directions. Pour all but 250ml (1 cup) filling onto crust. Cool 250ml (1 cup) filling. Whisk or beat 30 to 60 seconds until smooth; gently fold in whipped topping. Spread over first layer; sprinkle with reserved crumbs. Chill about 3 to 4 hours. Refrigerate leftovers.
