Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a large bowl combine bread crumbs, onion, pepper, nutmeg and milk. Stir in burger-style crumbles until well blended. Form into 1 1/2 balls. In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the 'meat' balls in butter. Remove with a slotted spoon and place in a 2 quart casserole dish. Whisk flour into drippings in skillet; cook until bubbly, stirring constantly. Stir in broth and cream and continue cooking, stirring, until sauce thickens and boils, about 1 minute. Pour over 'meat' balls . Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
