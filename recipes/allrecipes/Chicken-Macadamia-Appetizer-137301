Heat oven to 400 degrees F. In small bowl, mix chicken spread, cream cheese, onions and nuts. Remove pie crusts from pouches; place flat onto work surface. With 2 1/4-inch round cutter, cut 16 rounds from each crust (rounds must be cut close together). Spoon about 1 tablespoon chicken mixture onto center of each of 16 rounds. Brush edges with water. Press remaining rounds slightly larger; fit each over chicken mixture. With fork, press edge of each to seal. Brush top and bottom of each with water; coat generously with bread crumbs. Place on ungreased cookie sheet. Prick top of each with fork. Bake 18 to 23 minutes or until golden brown. Cool 5 minutes. Arrange appetizers on serving platter; garnish with cilantro and grapes.
