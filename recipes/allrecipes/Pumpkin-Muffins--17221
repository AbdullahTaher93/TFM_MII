Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. Sift the flour, salt, nutmeg, and pumpkin pie spice into a medium size mixing bowl. Stir in the brown sugar and the sultana raisins. In another bowl, stir together the egg, oil, pumpkin and milk, add to the dry ingredients and mix until just blended. Fill prepared muffin cups 3/4 full. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 18 to 20 minutes or until a toothpick stuck into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
