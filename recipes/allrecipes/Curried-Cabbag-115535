Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add curry powder and cook just until fragrant, 30 seconds. Stir in onion and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add cabbage and cook, stirring occasionally, until wilted and soft to the bite, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in lemon (or lime) juice and yogurt. Season with salt.
