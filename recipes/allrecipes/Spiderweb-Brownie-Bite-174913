Arrange brownies on a serving platter in concentric circles, making a round shape with edges touching. Push brownies together slightly to frost as pictured, spreading frosting over brownies to make a smooth round top. Starting in the center, pipe orange decorator frosting in a spiral all the way to the edge of the chocolate frosting. Pull a toothpick or the point of a small knife through the icing from center to edge to make web as pictured. For the spider, place truffle on web adding legs and eyes with black decorator frosting.
