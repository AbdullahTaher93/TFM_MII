Place artichokes in a food processor, slice thinly and set aside. It works well when using a 3 millimeter slicing disk. Using a extra-large stock pot saute onions, garlic and shallots in olive oil and set on low. Cook for 15 minutes. Sprinkle flour over onions and cook for 1 minute. Stir in vinegar and cook for approximately 3 minutes, in order for vinegar to evaporate.

Add dried mushrooms along with the water they soaked in, fresh mushrooms and carrots. Let cook for 15 minutes. Stir in capers and parsley, season with salt and serve.
