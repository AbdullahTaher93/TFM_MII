CRUSH basil leaves slightly with the back of a spoon; place in a 1-quart jar. BRING vinegar to a boil, and pour over basil leaves. Cover and let stand at room temperature 1 to 2 weeks. POUR mixture through a wire-mesh strainer into a 4-cup liquid measuring cup, discarding basil; pour into a decorative bottle. Add a fresh basil sprig, if desired, and seal. Store vinegar in a cool, dark place up to 6 months.
