Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion until translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in carrots, ginger, and vegetable broth, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until carrots are tender. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Transfer to a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Return to soup pot, add half and half, and heat until warmed through. Season with salt and pepper, and serve.
