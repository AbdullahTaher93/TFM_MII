Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place walnut pieces in a shallow ovenproof pan. Place pan in oven and toast walnuts until lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Set aside to cool. In a serving bowl, combine salad mix, nectarines, strawberries, goat cheese, and toasted walnuts. In a separate bowl, combine vinegar, salt, sugar, and pepper. Whisk to dissolve seasonings. Slowly add olive oil in a steady stream while continuing to whisk. Add the chopped mint and stir. Add dressing to salad and toss. Serve immediately.
