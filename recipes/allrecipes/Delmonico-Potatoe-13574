Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place frozen potatoes in a 13 x 9 inch baking dish. In a saucepan on the stovetop or in microwave on low, melt together cheese and butter or margarine. When melted, blend in the cream. Pour mixture over frozen potatoes, and cover pan with foil. Bake for 1 hour. Remove foil, and bake 15 minutes more.
