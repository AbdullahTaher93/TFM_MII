In a medium bowl, toss the turkey with the Southwest marinade seasoning to coat, and allow to stand for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare a strawberry salsa by stirring together the diced strawberries, red onion, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, and lime juice in a bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper; set aside. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add turkey, and cook until firm and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Once done, microwave the tortillas for 30 seconds. To assemble, evenly divide the cooked turkey onto each tortilla. Top with spinach, blue cheese and strawberry salsa, and roll into a wrap.
