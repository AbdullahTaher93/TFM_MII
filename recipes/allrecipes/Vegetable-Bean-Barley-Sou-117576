In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, saute the onion, garlic, basil and dill in oil until onion is tender. Add the broth, water, carrots and barley. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Add the pork and beans, zucchini, salt and pepper. Cover and simmer 10-15 minutes longer or until vegetables and barley are tender. Just before serving, stir in tomatoes and vinegar; heat through.
