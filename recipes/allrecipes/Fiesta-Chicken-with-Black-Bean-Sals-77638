In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together marinade ingredients. Transfer to a self-sealing plastic bag. Add chicken breasts; marinate 30 minutes in refrigerator. While chicken is marinating, combine salsa, black beans and corn in a small saucepan. Cook and stir over medium heat, until corn is tender, about 5 minutes. Remove chicken from marinade; discard marinade. Grill or broil chicken breasts, turning once, about 7 minutes per side or until no longer pink in center. Place each chicken breast on a plate; top with salsa mixture and garnish with sour cream, cheese, and avocado. Serve immediately.
