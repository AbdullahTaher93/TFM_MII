Whisk together mango nectar, lemon juice, honey, soy sauce, oil, garlic, ginger, chili sauce, and cayenne in a bowl. Add shrimp, turning to coat, and marinate, covered with plastic wrap, 30 minutes at room temperature or chilled up to 4 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, 375 to 450 degrees F (200 to 230 degrees C ). Lightly oil the grate. Lift shrimp from marinade, shaking off excess. Grill shrimp until just cooked through, about 1 minute per side.
