Rinse and pat dry chop. Combine cumin and cayenne powder and rub mixture onto both sides of chop. Heat oil in a nonstick skillet to medium high and brown chops 2-3 minutes per side. Slice onions thinly and add to skillet with chop; lower heat to medium low and cook 8 to 10 more minutes until pork is cooked and no longer pink and onions are translucent. Serve.
