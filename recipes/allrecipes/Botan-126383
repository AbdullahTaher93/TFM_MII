Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, cumin, and oregano and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes, or until fragrant. Stir in the drained beans and the beans with their liquid and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat. Mash the beans with a potato masher to a coarse-textured puree. Return to medium heat and stir in the tomatoes and 1/4 cup of the water. Bring to a boil, stirring. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes, or until the beans are heated through and the flavors are blended. Stir in up to 1/4 cup additional water if the mixture is too thick. Place in a serving bowl and sprinkle with the cheese. Serve with the chips or tortillas and vegetables.
