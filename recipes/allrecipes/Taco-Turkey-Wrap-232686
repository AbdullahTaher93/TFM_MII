Mix sour cream, pico de gallo, and taco seasoning in a bowl; spread onto each flour tortilla. Sprinkle Mexican cheese blend over sour cream mixture layer. Top each with turkey. Roll each tortilla around the filling. Wrap each with aluminum foil and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight. Remove aluminum foil and slice each wrap cross-wise into 3/8-inch slices. Arrange slices on a plate.
