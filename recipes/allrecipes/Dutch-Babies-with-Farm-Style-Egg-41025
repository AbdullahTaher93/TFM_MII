Lightly coat four 4-1/2-inch foil tart pans with cooking spray. Beat the 1/2 cup egg product, milk, flour, oil, and thyme until smooth. Divide batter evenly among pans. Bake in a 400 degree F oven for 25 minutes or until brown and puffy. Turn off oven; let stand in oven for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, lightly coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Cook the frozen hash brown potatoes over medium heat for 7 to 8 minutes or until tender; stir often. Add ham; heat through. Beat together the 1-1/4 cups egg product, salt, oregano, and pepper. Add to potatoes. Cook, without stirring, until mixture begins to set on bottom. Use a spatula to lift and fold partially cooked eggs so uncooked portion flows underneath. Cook 2 to 3 minutes more or until eggs are cooked. Spoon into center of puffs. Serve immediately.
