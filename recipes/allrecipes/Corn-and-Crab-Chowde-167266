Prepare stock. Cut the corn kernels off of the cobs and set aside in a bowl. Reserve the cobs. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the carrot, celery, onion, garlic, thyme, and peppercorns. Cook until the vegetables are softened. Add the water and reserved corncobs and bring to a boil over high heat, skimming off any foam that rises to the surface. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer until reduced by half to about 4 cups (about 1 to 1 hours). Strain stock through a fine mesh strainer. Discard the solids. Set aside until ready to use. Refrigerate if preparing a day in advance. Prepare chowder. Heat a stockpot or large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook until golden brown. Remove the bacon using a slotted spoon and set on paper towels to drain. Drain bacon fat out of the pan. Return pan to heat. Add butter and melt. Add onion, celery, garlic, cayenne pepper, thyme sprig and salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are softened. Sprinkle flour into pan while stirring to form a paste. Cook 2 to 3 minutes or until the flour starts to look cooked. Pour in the reserved stock. Stir frequently with a wire whisk to avoid creating any lumps. Add corn kernels and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes. Add bacon, LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, parsley and crab. Simmer over medium-low heat 8 to 10 minutes. To Serve: Ladle into serving bowls and garnish with croutons and chopped chives.
