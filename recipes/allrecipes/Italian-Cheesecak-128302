Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch (23-cm) springform pan with nonstick spray. In a medium bowl, mix the crumbs, margarine, and 2 tablespoons (25 mL) of the granulated sugar. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom of the pan. In a large bowl, use an electric mixer set at medium speed to beat the two types of ricotta cheese, the remaining 1/2 cup (125 mL) of granulated sugar, the vanilla or orange extract, and the orange peel until smooth. Fold in the egg whites, raisins, and the candied fruit, if desired. Pour the batter into the pan. Place the pan in a larger one filled with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. Bake the cake until its edges are lightly browned and the center is nearly set, 60 to 70 minutes. Cool the cake on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Dust the top with the powdered sugar, if desired. Serve warm or chilled.
