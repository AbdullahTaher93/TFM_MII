Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook pasta 8 to 10 minutes or according to package directions. Meanwhile, cook lamb (or beef), garlic and fennel seed in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, breaking up the meat with the back of a spoon, until the lamb (or beef) is browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Add eggplant and oil; cook, stirring occasionally, until the eggplant browns, about 4 minutes. Add tomato sauce and wine; cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens, about 3 minutes. Stir in oregano, salt and pepper. Drain the pasta; serve topped with the sauce and sprinkled with pine nuts and feta, if using.
