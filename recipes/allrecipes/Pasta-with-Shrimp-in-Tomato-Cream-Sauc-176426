Drain tomatoes, reserving 2 tablespoons of the oil. Cut tomatoes into thin slices and set aside. Heat the reserved tomato oil in a wide frying pan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and onions; stir to coat with hot oil. Then add chopped basil, slivered tomatoes, pepper, broth, vermouth, and cream to pan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 1 1/2 cups (10 to 12 minutes). While you are preparing sauce, bring about 3 quarts water to a boil in a 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat; stir in pasta and cook, uncovered, until just tender to bite (about 10 minutes). Drain well. Add shrimp to sauce and stir just until heated through. Pour pasta onto a platter or individual plates; spoon sauce over pasta. Garnish with basil sprigs, if desired. Offer cheese to add to taste.
