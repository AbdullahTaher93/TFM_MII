Place potatoes and salt in a large saucepan with water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until just tender, 15 minutes. Drain and set aside. In a medium skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Cook celery, carrots and onion in butter until onion is translucent. Combine potatoes, vegetable mixture, cream of potato soup and milk in a large pot over low heat. Simmer 15 minutes, adjusting milk to desired thickness. Serve.
