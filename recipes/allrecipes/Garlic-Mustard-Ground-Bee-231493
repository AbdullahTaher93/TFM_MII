Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Stir mustard, balsamic vinegar, garlic, soy sauce, honey, paprika, and black pepper into the ground beef; bring to a simmer and cook until hot, about 3 minutes.
