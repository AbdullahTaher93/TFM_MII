Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken breasts in a glass baking dish. Pour the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce over them. Cover with a lid or aluminum foil. Bake for 50 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the juices run clear. If using frozen chicken breasts, bake for 1 hour.
