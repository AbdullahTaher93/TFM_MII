Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Combine meatballs, pasta sauce, tomatoes, carrots and green beans in a 13x9-inch baking dish; sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and top with Tater Tots(R). Bake until sauce is bubbly and Tater Tots(R) are golden brown, about 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven; sprinkle Tater Tots(R) with Parmesan cheese and garnish with basil, if desired.
