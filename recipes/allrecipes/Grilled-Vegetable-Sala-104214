Preheat grill to medium-high. In a large bowl, toss the vegetables together. Season the vegetables with Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM), 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 2 tablespoons of vinegar and garlic. Toss gently to coat. Place vegetables in a barbecue-grilling basket.* Grill vegetables for 10 to 12 minutes per side until lightly charred and tender. Remove vegetables from the basket and place in a large bowl. Toss with remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and season to taste with Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM). Add fresh parsley and toss. For an extra twist add 1/2 cup of crumbled goat's cheese.
