Peel and quarter potatoes. Place with garlic in a 6- to 8-quart pan; cover with broth. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat, cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender when pierced, about 20 minutes. Drain potatoes and garlic; return to pan. Mash with milk until smooth. Stir in yogurt, chives, dill, and salt; add pepper to taste. Spoon mixture into a 2- to 3-quart shallow baking dish; sprinkle top with cheese. If making ahead, cover with plastic wrap and chill up to 1 day. Bake in a 375 degrees F oven until warm in center and melted cheese is lightly browned, about 30 minutes (about 1 hour if chilled). Garnish with chives or dill sprigs.
