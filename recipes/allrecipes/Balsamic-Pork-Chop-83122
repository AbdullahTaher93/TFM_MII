Place chops in large, resealable bag; pour vinaigrette dressing over. Seal bag and refrigerate for 2 to 24 hours. Prepare medium-hot grill. Remove chops from marinade and pat dry. Discard remaining marinade. Grill chops directly over heat for about 8 to 10 minutes, turning once. Serve desired number of chops for dinner; wrap and refrigerate remaining chops for up to three days.
