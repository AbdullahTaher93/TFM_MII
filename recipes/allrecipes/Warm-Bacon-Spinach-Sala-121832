In a skillet, cook bacon until crisp. Remove bacon to paper towels. Drain, reserving 1 tablespoon drippings. Stir flour into drippings until smooth. In a large bowl, beat egg; add water, vinegar, sugar, salt and pepper. Slowly pour into skillet. Bring to a boil; boil for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Place spinach in a bowl. Remove dressing from the heat; stir in reserved bacon. Immediately spoon desired amount over spinach; add croutons and toss to coat. Serve warm. Store leftover dressing in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Before serving, reheat over low heat just until heated through.
