In a saucepan, combine the first seven ingredients; bring to a boil. Cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened; set aside. In a large bowl, combine the first six meat loaf ingredients; add 2/3 cup of the reserved sauce and mix well. Crumble beef and pork over mixture and mix well. Pat into two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Pour the remaining sauce over loaves. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 50 minutes or until meat is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees (72 degrees C). Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
