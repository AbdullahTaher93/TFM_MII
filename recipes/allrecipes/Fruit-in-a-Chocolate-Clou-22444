YOGURT CHEESE: Line non-rusting colander or sieve with large piece of double thickness cheesecloth or large coffee filter; place colander over deep bowl. Spoon two 8-oz. containers vanilla lowfat yogurt, no gelatin added, into prepared colander; cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until liquid no longer drains from yogurt, about 24 hours. Remove yogurt from cheesecloth and place in separate bowl; discard liquid. Reserve 3 strawberries for garnish; set aside. Remove hulls of remaining strawberries; cut strawberries in half vertically; set aside. Stir together sugar, cocoa and water in small bowl until smooth and well blended. Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla. Gradually stir in Yogurt Cheese and orange peel, if desired; blend thoroughly. Prepare whipped topping mix in large bowl as directed on package using 1 cup milk and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla; fold into chocolate mixture. Carefully spoon one-half of chocolate mixture into 1-1/2-quart glass serving dish; place one-half of strawberry halves, cut sides out, around inside of entire bowl. Layer banana slices over chocolate mixture. Cut remaining strawberry halves into smaller pieces; layer over banana slices. Carefully spread remaining chocolate mixture over fruit. Cover; refrigerate several hours before serving. Garnish with reserved strawberries. Cover; refrigerate leftover dessert.
