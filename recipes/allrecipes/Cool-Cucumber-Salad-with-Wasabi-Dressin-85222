Combine wasabi with 2 tablespoons water. Let stand 5 minutes. Meanwhile, seed and slice cucumbers lengthwise into quarters, then cut into 1/4-inch slices. Cut onion into thin slices. Stir rice vinegar, brown sugar, and cilantro into wasabi. Just before serving, toss together cucumbers, onion, and peanuts. Whisk dressing and pour over salad; toss. Serve on lettuce leaves, if desired.
