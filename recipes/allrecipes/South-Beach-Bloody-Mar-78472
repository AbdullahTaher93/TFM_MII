In a large pitcher, combine the vegetable cocktail, celery seed, pepper, citrus juices, 1 tablespoon of the horseradish, the Worcestershire sauce, and Tabasco and stir well to combine. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Fill 2 glasses with ice. Add 2 ounces of vodka to each and fill three-quarters full with the vegetable cocktail mixture. Sprinkle with the remaining horseradish, place 1 celery stalk in each glass, and squeeze a lime wedge into each glass.
