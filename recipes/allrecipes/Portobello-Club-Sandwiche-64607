Sprinkle mushrooms with beef granules. Heat the oil in a large pan and saute the mushrooms for 2 minutes, turning once. Place warm mushrooms on 4 slices of toasted bread and top with cheese. Then top with another slice of bread and a tomato and 2 slices of bacon. Combine the chipotle pepper and mayonnaise. Spread this mixture on the remaining piece of toast and place on top of each sandwich. Place toothpicks to secure and cut into quarters.
