In a large salad bowl, combine the mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, bell pepper, celery, endive and arugula. Whisk together the lemon juice and olive oil; pour over the salad. Toss until all the ingredients are thoroughly coated with the dressing. Transfer salad to individual serving plates, if desired. Sprinkle the basil over the salad, season with salt and pepper, and serve immediately.
