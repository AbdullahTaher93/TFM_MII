Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Heat beans in a medium sauce pot. Set aside. Heat a nonstick large pan over medium heat. Add olive oil and eggs. Using a spatula, cook and stir until eggs are scrambled. Season with salt and pepper. Spread the pinto beans in the lower section of the tortilla; top with cheese and eggs. Place salsa and avocadoes on top. Garnish with sliced green onions. Fold the outer 1/2-inch left and right sides of the tortilla in. This will help keep the filling inside once you roll your tortilla into a burrito. Warm completed burritos in the oven for 5-10 minutes.
