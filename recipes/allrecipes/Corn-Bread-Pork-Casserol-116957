In a large skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, brown pork chops on both sides; set aside. In the same skillet, saute mushrooms until tender. Transfer mushrooms to a 1-1/2-qt. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. In a small bowl, combine flour and broth until smooth. Stir in the sour cream, Parmesan cheese, garlic and pepper; pour over mushrooms. Top with pork chops. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes. Sprinkle with stuffing. Bake 10 minutes longer or until meat juices run clear.
