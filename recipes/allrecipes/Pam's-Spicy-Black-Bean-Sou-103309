In a food processor or blender, combine the beans, vegetable broth, salsa and cumin. Puree until smooth. Pour into a large saucepan and set over medium heat. Cook just until heated through. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Ladle into four bowls and garnish each serving with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of green onion.
