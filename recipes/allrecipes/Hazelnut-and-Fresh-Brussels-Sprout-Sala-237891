Remove about 1/4 the Brussels sprouts and thinly cut cross-wise with a knife; add back to the remaining shredded Brussels sprouts. Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, lime juice, chives, thyme, and salt together in a bowl until dressing is smooth; set aside for flavors to blend, about 5 minutes. Toss Brussels sprouts and hazelnuts together in a large bowl. Drizzle dressing over Brussels sprouts mixture; lightly toss to coat. Add blue cheese; toss to coat.
