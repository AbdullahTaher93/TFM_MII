Mince chicken. Mix together with sherry, salt, and egg whites in a large mixing bowl. Add cream style corn, and mix well to blend. Preheat a wok or large frying pan to medium high. Add chicken broth and soy sauce, and bring to a boil. Add chicken mixture, and return to boil. Reduce heat. Simmer for 3 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent burning. In a cup, mix together water and cornstarch until well blended. Add cornstarch mixture to simmering soup, stirring constantly. Cook for an additional 2 minutes; soup will thicken slightly. Crumble cooked bacon over individual servings.
