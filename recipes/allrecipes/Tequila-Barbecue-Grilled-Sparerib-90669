Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Rinse ribs and pat dry. Arrange in a single layer in an 11- by 17-inch pan. Add 3/4 cup water; cover tightly with foil. Bake until meat is tender when pierced, 40 to 45 minutes. Lift ribs out. Skim and discard fat and save juices for another use, or discard. Preheat barbecue grill. Place ribs over a solid bed of medium coals or medium heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 4 to 5 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning as needed, until ribs are browned on both sides, about 10 minutes total. Set aside 1/4 cup barbecue sauce. Baste tops of ribs with about half the remaining sauce; turn over and brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Baste other sides of ribs with remaining sauce; turn over and brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a board; cut between ribs and serve with reserved 1/4 cup sauce to add to taste. Add salt to taste.
