In an ungreased 2-1/2-qt. microwave-safe dish, combine the flour, sugar, 2 tablespoons cocoa, baking powder and salt. Stir in milk, oil and vanilla until combined. Fold in nuts. Combine brown sugar and remaining cocoa; sprinkle over batter. Pour boiling water over batter (do not stir). Microwave, uncovered, on high for 9-10 minutes, rotating a quarter turn every 3 minutes, or until top of cake springs back when lightly touched. Serve with whipped topping.
