Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Combine first five ingredients in a large bowl. Set aside. Combine remaining ingredients in a small bowl; mix well. Pour mixture over pretzel mixture; toss to coat. Place on ungreased 15x10-inch shallow baking pan. Bake 25 minutes or until peanuts are golden brown, stirring halfway through cook time. Cool completely. Mixture becomes crisp as it cools.
