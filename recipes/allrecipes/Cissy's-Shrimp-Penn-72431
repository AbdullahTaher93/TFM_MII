Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir in penne pasta, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook the shallot and garlic until tender. Pour in the fish stock, white wine, and vermouth, and simmer 15 minutes, or until reduced to a thick golden glaze. Place the shrimp and butter into the skillet. Cover, and cook 5 minutes over low heat, until shrimp are opaque. Mix the cooked penne pasta into the skillet, and gently toss with the shrimp and glaze. Top with parsley, Parmesan cheese, and pepper to serve.
