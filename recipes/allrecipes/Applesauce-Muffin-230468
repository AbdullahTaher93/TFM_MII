Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners. Mix flour, baking soda, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and salt together in a bowl. Beat shortening with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl until smooth; add honey and mix for 2 minutes. Stir flour mixture into shortening mixture, alternating with applesauce, until batter is smooth. Fold in raisins and walnuts. Spoon about 2 1/2 tablespoons batter into each muffin cup. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
