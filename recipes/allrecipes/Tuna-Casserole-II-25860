Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9-inch glass pie dish. In a mixing bowl, combine soup, tuna, and 1/4 of the potato chips. Mix thoroughly. Pour into the prepared pie dish. Cover the top with remaining potato chips. Bake in the preheated oven until potato chips on top start to brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool before serving.
