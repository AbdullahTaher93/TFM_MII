Prepare corn muffin mix according to package directions. Cool and crumble. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and set aside. In a large skillet over medium heat, slowly cook and stir the mushrooms, celery, onion and garlic until soft. In a large bowl, mix the crumbled prepared corn muffin mix, sausage, mushroom mixture, apple, bread, salt and pepper. Transfer the mixture to a medium baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven 45 minutes, or until lightly browned.
