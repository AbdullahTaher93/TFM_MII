In a medium saucepan, combine the raisins, golden raisins, currants, brown sugar, butter and water. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until boiling. Boil for 20 minutes, then remove from heat and set aside to cool. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees). Grease an 8x4 inch loaf pan. In a medium bowl, stir together the whole wheat flour, all purpose flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Add the boiled ingredients along with the cooking sherry, mix until well blended. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, then reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and bake 15 more minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
