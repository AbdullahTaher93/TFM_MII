Stir pineapple chunks with juice, 3/4 cup water, rice vinegar, ketchup, brown sugar, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce together in a saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer until the pineapple is tender, about 20 minutes. Pour pineapple mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Return mixture to saucepan and bring to a simmer. Whisk cornstarch and 2 tablespoons water together in a bowl until smooth; stir into the sauce. Increase heat to medium. Cook and stir sauce until thick, 2 to 3 minutes.
