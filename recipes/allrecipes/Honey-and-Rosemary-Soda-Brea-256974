Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, rosemary, and salt together in a large bowl. Add buttermilk and honey; mix until a soft dough forms. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth. Shape into a round loaf approximately 8 inches in diameter. Score top of the dough with 2 shallow crosses, marking 8 wedges. Transfer to a lightly floured baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Tap the bottom of the loaf; it will sound hollow when done. Let bread rest for 10 minutes before slicing.
