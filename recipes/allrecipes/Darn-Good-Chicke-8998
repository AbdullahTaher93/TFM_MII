In a small bowl combine the warm honey, mustard and nutmeg and mix until well blended. Smear onto the chicken pieces, coating well. Refrigerated and let sit for 1/2 hour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until done and chicken juices run clear. You can also grill or broil for 30 minutes, turning chicken pieces after 15 minutes of cooking.
