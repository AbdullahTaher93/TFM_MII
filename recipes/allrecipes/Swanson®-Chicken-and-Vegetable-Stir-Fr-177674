Stir the cornstarch, broth and soy in a small bowl until the mixture is smooth. Spray a 12-inch nonstick skillet with the cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Add the chicken and stir-fry until it's well browned. Remove the chicken from the skillet. Add the vegetables, ginger and garlic powder to the skillet. Stir-fry until the vegetables are tender-crisp. Stir the cornstarch mixture in the skillet. Cook and stir until the mixture boils and thickens. Return the chicken to the skillet and cook until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Serve over the rice.
