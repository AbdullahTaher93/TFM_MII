In a bowl, combine the first six ingredients. Combine eggs, mincemeat, applesauce, juice and butter; stir into dry ingredients. Pour into a greased 8-cup fluted tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until cake tests done. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pan to a wire rack to cool completely. For sauce, combine sugar and cornstarch in a saucepan. Stir in water until smooth. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in butter until melted. Add lemon peel and juice. Serve warm with the cake.
