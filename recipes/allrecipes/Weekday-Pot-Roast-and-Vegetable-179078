Season the beef with the garlic powder. Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook until it's well browned on all sides. Place the potatoes, carrots and onion in a 3 1/2-quart slow cooker. Sprinkle with the basil. Add the beef. Pour the gravy over the beef and vegetables. Cover and cook on LOW for 10 to 11 hours* or until the beef is fork-tender. Remove the beef from the cooker and let it stand for 10 minutes. Serve the beef with the vegetables and gravy.
