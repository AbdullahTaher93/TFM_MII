Preheat oven to 400 degree F. Lightly coat large baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Spread tortilla strips on baking sheet; bake 8 to 10 minutes or until crisp and golden, stirring after 5 minutes. Set aside. Meanwhile, in large saucepan, heat oil. Add onion; cook 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in ancho pepper, garlic, cumin and bay leaves; cook and stir 2 to 3 minutes. Add broth and tomatoes. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes. Discard bay leaves. Thicken soup, if desired. Place a few tortilla strips and a small amount of chicken in each serving bowl; add soup. Top with avocado, cheese, additional tortilla strips and cilantro, if desired. To thicken soup: Allow soup to cool slightly. Add to blender or food processor and puree until smooth. Return soup to saucepan and heat just before serving.
