Cool slightly. Using 1/4-cup measuring cup, portion cereal mixture. Using buttered hands, shape into 3-inch balls. Use frosting to attach two balls together to form bunny body and head. Then use frosting to attach the paper bunny ears and licorice whiskers. Make eyes, mouth and tail with frosting. Best if served same day.
