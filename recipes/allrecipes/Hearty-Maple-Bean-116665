In a large skillet, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp. Using a slotted spoon, remove to paper towels. Drain, reserving 1 tablespoon drippings. In the drippings, cook the sausage and onion over medium-heat until sausage is lightly browned. Stir in the bacon and remaining ingredients. Transfer to an ungreased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until bubbly.
