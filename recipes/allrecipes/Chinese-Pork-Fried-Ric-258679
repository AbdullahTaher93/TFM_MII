Mix rice wine, soy sauce, and cornstarch together in a bowl. Add pork; toss until evenly mixed. Preheat a wok or deep saucepan over medium-high heat. Pour in peanut oil. Cook pork in the hot oil in batches until evenly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Transfer to a plate using a slotted spoon. Cook onion in the remaining oil until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix curry powder and water in a bowl to form a paste. Stir curry paste, spring onion, and salt into the wok. Add rice, stirring to break up any lumps. Stir in peas. Return pork to the wok; cook and stir until rice and pork are heated through, 4 to 5 minutes.
