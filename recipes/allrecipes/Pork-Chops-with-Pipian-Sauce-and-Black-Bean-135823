In a blender, process 1/4 cup broth, the salsa, onion and half the garlic and cilantro at high speed until smooth. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pat the chops dry, season lightly with salt and pepper and sear in the pan, turning once, about 3 minutes on each side. Transfer the chops to a foil-lined baking sheet and bake until cooked through, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in the skillet over medium-low heat. Add the reserved green sauce and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 6 minutes (the mixture will darken slightly). In the blender, grind the pumpkin seeds in the remaining 1 1/3 cups chicken broth. Gradually stir the pumpkin-seed mixture into the sauce and simmer gently until thick, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat. Add the remaining garlic and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the beans and cook, mashing with a wooden spoon, until heated through. Stir in up to 1/2 cup water for a creamy consistency. Season with salt and pepper. Chop the remaining cilantro and stir into the beans. Place a chop on each plate, spoon a generous amount of sauce on top and serve the beans alongside.
