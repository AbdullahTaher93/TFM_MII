Combine 2 tablespoons olive oil, water, pineapple juice, red wine vinegar, muscovado sugar, onion flakes, 1/4 teaspoon salt, garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, cumin, paprika, coriander, and ginger in a bowl. Add pork chops; flip to coat completely. Marinate pork chops in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Make zucchini ribbons by passing a vegetable peeler lengthwise over the side of each zucchini. When you approach seeds, turn zucchini and begin slicing another side. Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add zucchini ribbons and season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; cook and stir just until ribbons are tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat and brush with 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil. Cook pork chops until browned and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Serve pork chops alongside zucchini ribbons.
