Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Mix cheese and rosemary. Place 1 Tbsp. cheese mixture on lightly greased baking sheet; spread slightly to flatten. Repeat with remaining cheese mixture, making 16 crisps total, allowing 1-inch between each flattened crisp. Bake 5 min. Turn crisps over; bake an additional 1 min. or until golden brown. Cool on wire rack. Place 1 cup greens on each of 8 plates. Top with 1 Tbsp. grape halves and 1 Tbsp. walnuts. Drizzle with 1 Tbsp. dressing. Serve each salad with 2 crisps.
