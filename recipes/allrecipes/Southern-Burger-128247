Prepare barbecue grill. To Make Coleslaw: In medium bowl, toss cabbage, carrots, scallions, dressing, sugar, and vinegar until well coated. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. To Make Burgers: In large bowl, gently mix beef, 2 tablespoons (25 ml) barbecue sauce, and onion. Shape into 4 burgers. Grill burgers over medium-hot coals until no longer pink in the center, turning once, and brushing with remaining barbecue sauce, about 8 to 10 minutes. Place burgers in rolls and top each burger with coleslaw.
