In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the lemon juice, oil, parsley, onion, garlic, lemon peel, thyme, salt and pepper; add chicken. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate overnight, turning occasionally. Drain and discard marinade. Grill chicken, covered, over medium heat for 35-40 minutes or until juices run clear, turning every 15 minutes.
