Place the beef and sausage in a skillet over medium heat, and cook until evenly brown; drain grease. Mix in onion and garlic, and cook until tender. Stir in baked beans, butter beans, ketchup, barbeque sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne pepper. Cover, reduce heat to low, and continue cooking 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
