Mix together oats, flour, nuts, and baking powder. In a saucepan, heat butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until butter has melted and mixture is smooth. Remove from heat. Stir half of oat mixture into butter mixture. Stir in egg, mixing well, then stir in remaining oat mixture. Cool for 20 minutes. Stir in chocolate. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Shape dough into 1 1/2-inch balls. Place balls, 2 inches apart, on ungreased baking sheets. Flatten each ball slightly. Bake cookies until lightly browned, 10-12 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
