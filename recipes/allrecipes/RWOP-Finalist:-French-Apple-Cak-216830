Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. To prepare the caramel, heat 3/4 cup granulated sugar with 4 tsp. water. When the sugar becomes light brown, add the juice of 1/2 lemon and remove from heat. Coat the bottom and sides of a springform pan with the caramel. Peel, core and thinly slice the apples and arrange in an attractive circular overlapping pattern on the caramel. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs with remaining 3/4 cup granulated sugar. Add the flour, butter, PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese (4 oz.) and continue beating until you have a creamy batter. Pour over apples and caramel and bake for 35 minutes. Let cool slightly prior to turning over onto a decorative cake plate.
