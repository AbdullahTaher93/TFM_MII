Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 16x20-inch baking pan or casserole dish. Bring 1 cup butter, 3 tablespoons cocoa powder, and 1 cup cola-flavored carbonated beverage to a boil in a saucepan; stir until smooth. Combine white sugar and flour in a bowl. Pour the hot butter mixture over the sugar and flour; stir until well blended. Mix buttermilk, eggs, baking soda, and vanilla extract into the mixture; fold in 1 cup pecans. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan. Bake in the preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 minutes. Melt 1/2 cup butter, 3 tablespoons cocoa powder, and 6 tablespoons cola-flavored carbonated beverage together in a saucepan over low heat until smooth; remove from heat. Pour confectioners' sugar into a bowl. Stir butter mixture into confectioners' sugar until frosting is smooth; fold in 1/2 cup pecans. Spread frosting over the warm cake.
