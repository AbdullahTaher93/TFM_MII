Cut across grain of turkey slices to make strips 1/2 inch wide and 2 1/2 inch long. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt margarine. Cook and stir turkey until no longer pink, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle flour over turkey; cook and stir 2 minutes. Stir in milk and cook until thickened, about 3 minutes. Stir in peas, pimiento, poultry seasoning and salt and pepper to taste. Serve over split baked potatoes.
