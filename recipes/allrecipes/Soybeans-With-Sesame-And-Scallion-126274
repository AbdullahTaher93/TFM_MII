In a medium saucepan over high heat, bring the soybeans, soy sauce, and water to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 12 minutes, or until tender. If any liquid remains, cook, stirring occasionally, over medium-high heat until the liquid has evaporated. Remove from the heat. Stir in the oil, hot-pepper sauce (if using), scallions, and black pepper.
