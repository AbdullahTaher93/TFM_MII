Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 7x11-inch dish. Mix oats, oat bran, wheat germ, flax seeds, protein powder, almonds, raisins, cranberries, and sunflower seeds together in a bowl. Add honey and peanut butter and mix well. Press mixture into the prepared dish. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 30 to 35 minutes.
