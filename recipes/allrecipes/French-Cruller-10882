Put 4 tablespoons sugar, salt, shortening and orange rind in saucepan with 1 cup hot water. Bring to a boil. Mix in 1 cup of flour. Cook until thick, stirring constantly. Remove from heat, and cool slightly. Beat in one egg at a time, beating each one in thoroughly before adding another. Using a rose tip, press dough through pastry bag, in desired shape, onto a well-greased square of heavy paper. Turn paper upside down and let crullers drop into deep, hot fat (375 degrees F - 190 degrees C). Fry until well puffed up and golden brown in color, about 6 to 7 minutes. Drain on unglazed paper. Ice with confectioners' frosting. To Make Frosting: Cream 1 1/2 tablespoons shortening and continue creaming while slowly adding sugar. Add cream, salt, and vanilla and mix smooth.
