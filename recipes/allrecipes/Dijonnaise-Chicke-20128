Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a medium bowl, mix the mustard-mayonnaise blend, olive oil, lemon juice, lemon pepper, salt, and bouillon. Pour the mixture over the chicken. Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
