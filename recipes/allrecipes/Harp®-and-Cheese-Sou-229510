Combine vegetable stock and lager in a stock pot; season with salt and black pepper; bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Cook potatoes in the simmering stock mixture until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Stir cream, leek, garlic, and thyme into the stock mixture; bring to a boil, return heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer another 10 minutes. Sprinkle cayenne pepper into the soup. Melt cheese into the soup 1 cup at a time while blending with an immersion blender until smooth.
