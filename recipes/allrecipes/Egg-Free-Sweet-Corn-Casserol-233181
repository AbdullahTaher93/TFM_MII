Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir whole kernel corn, cream-style corn, and corn bread mix together in a large bowl. Pour melted margarine into the bowl; mix. Fold sour cream into the corn mixture until smooth. Pour into an 8-inch square baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges have browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes before serving.
