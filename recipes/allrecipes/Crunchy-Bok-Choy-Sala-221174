Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a small frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir almonds in the hot oil until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer almonds to a large salad bowl. Toss bok choy, green onions, and ramen noodles with the almonds. Whisk 1/2 cup canola oil, sugar, balsamic vinaigrette dressing, and soy sauce in a separate bowl until combined. Pour dressing over vegetables and toss to mix.
