Place the pinto beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand overnight to soak. Drain and rinse the following day, then place beans into a slow cooker along with 4 cups of water, the jalapenos, tomatoes, salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, liquid smoke, and barbeque sauce; stir well. Set the slow cooker to High and cook for 4 hours. Stir the beans again, and turn the slow cooker to Low, and continue cooking until the sauce has thickened and the beans are tender, about 3 hours more.
