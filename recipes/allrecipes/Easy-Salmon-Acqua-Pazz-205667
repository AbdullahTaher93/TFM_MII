Place the salmon fillets in an 8x8-inch microwave-safe baking dish, and place the onion and tomato on the fillets. Sprinkle with garlic powder and onion powder, drizzle with white wine and olive oil, and wrap the dish with plastic wrap. Microwave on High power setting until the salmon is opaque, about 6 minutes. Carefully peel off the plastic wrap to avoid steam, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
