Blend cucumber, zucchini, avocado, and garlic in a food processor or blender until very finely chopped, about 30 seconds. Whisk together water, lemon juice, olive oil, and salt in a bowl. Turn on the food processor and pour water mixture slowly through food processor's feed tube while processing cucumber mixture. Process until smooth, about 1 minute.
