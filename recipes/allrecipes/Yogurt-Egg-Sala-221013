Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel. Mash eggs in a bowl. Stir avocado, onion, and parsley into the eggs. Mix relish, yogurt, and mustard into egg mixture. Season with salt and black pepper.
