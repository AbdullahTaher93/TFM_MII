Put the capon wings, neck and carcass bones in a large pot. Add the leek, onion, carrot, celery, parsley, thyme, bay leaf and 1 tablespoon of salt. Add the water and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer over low heat for 15 minutes. Carefully add the capon legs followed by the breast pieces to the hot liquid in the pot and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the capon breast pieces are just cooked through, about 20 minutes; transfer the breast pieces to a large rimmed baking sheet with tongs, being careful not to break the skin. Continue poaching the capon legs until cooked through, about 35 minutes longer; transfer to the baking sheet. Let the capon pieces cool to room temperature, then rub them all over with vegetable oil. Strain and reserve the poaching broth for another use. Light a grill. Season the capon pieces with salt and pepper and grill, skin side down, over moderately high heat for about 5 minutes, or until the skin is crisp and lightly charred. Turn the capon pieces and grill for 5 minutes longer, or until theyre browned and heated through; let cool slightly. Thickly slice the breast and thigh meat. Arrange the capon on a platter and serve with the Salsa Verde.
