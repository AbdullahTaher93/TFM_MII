Preheat grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Place corn on the grill; cover and cook until husks are blackened, 15 to 20 minutes. Let sit until easily handled, about 5 minutes. Discard husk and silks; cut kernels off the cob. Combine corn kernels, cherry tomatoes, Gouda cheese, olive oil, basil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix gently to blend.
