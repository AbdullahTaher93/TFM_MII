Combine flour, salt, and black pepper in a shallow bowl. Press each fish fillet in the flour mixture and shake off any excess. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil and heat until it is shimmering. Working in batches, fry fish fillets in hot oil until the bottom is browned, 3 to 4 minutes; flip and cook until other side is browned and the flesh flakes easily with a fork, about 2 minutes.
