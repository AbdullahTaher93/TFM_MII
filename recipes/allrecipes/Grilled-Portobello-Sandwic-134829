Drop the mushroom in a resealable plastic bag. Add the dressing, seal the bag, and let the mushroom marinate in the fridge for a couple of hours. Next, plop it on a grill or in a nonstick skillet, along with the pepper, and cook for 4 to 5 minutes per side. While the mushroom cooks, stir the garlic and mayonnaise together and spread the mixture on the sandwich-roll halves. Add the mushroom, bell pepper and cheese.
