Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray both sides of tortillas with cooking spray. Place each tortilla into four custard cups, gently folding and shaping each tortilla to create a bowl shape. In saucepan, heat chili; stir in potatoes. Cook until thoroughly heated. Divide chili mixture evenly among the tortillas. With back of spoon, make an indentation in each tortilla; break an egg into each indentation. Place custard cups on baking pan. Bake 10 minutes. Cover loosely with foil. Bake 5 to 8 minutes longer or until yolks are cooked to desired degree of doneness. Gently lift casseroles out of pans to serving plates. Spoon salsa over top. Sprinkle with cheese.
