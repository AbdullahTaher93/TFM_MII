Cream together shortening and sugar. Mix in molasses and egg. Stir in sifted flour, salt, soda, cinnamon, clove, and ginger. Dough will be soft and a little sticky. Mold into walnut-sized balls, and roll in sugar. Place on greased cookie sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 7 to 8 minutes. Baking them longer will make them less soft, but still chewy.
