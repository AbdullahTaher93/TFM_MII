Preheat grill for high heat. Thread the chicken, green bell pepper, onion, and red bell pepper pieces onto skewers alternately. Lightly oil the grill grate. Place kabobs on the prepared grill, and brush with barbeque sauce. Cook, turning and brushing with barbeque sauce frequently, for 15 minutes, or until chicken juices run clear.
