Cook the rice according to package directions. While the rice is cooking, pour the olive oil into a large nonstick skillet and heat on medium-high. Add the chicken and cook until no longer pink, about 3 minutes. Stir in the vinegar, sugar, tomato sauce, and orange juice. Cook 2 minutes more. Add the remaining ingredients and stir-fry until slightly tender, about 7 minutes. Serve over rice.
