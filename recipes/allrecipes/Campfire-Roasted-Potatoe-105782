Toss together the potato, onion, garlic, butter, pepper, oregano, salt, and Parmesan cheese in a large bowl, or a resealable bag. Remove from bag, and wrap in several layers of aluminum foil, sealing the edges well. Cook on a wire rack over the hot coals of a fire, flipping over midway through cooking, until the potatoes are tender; about 30 to 40 minutes. Alternatively, the potato packet may be baked on a cookie sheet in a 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven.
