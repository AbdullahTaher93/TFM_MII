Slice mango on either side of its large seed. Cut into strips. Then with a thin knife, slice off the skin by placing each strip skin side down on a cutting board and running the knife horizontally as close to the skin as you can. Be sure to cut off as much of the flesh around the edge of the seed too. Dice into cubes about the size of a grape. Set aside 2/3 cups (save the rest for some other recipe). Saute scallions in butter for 1-2 minutes. Meanwhile; in a bowl, mix together the water, soy, vinegar, grated ginger and lemon pepper. Mix well. Add guar gum, stir enough to dissolve and immediately add to the scallions and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, add the mangos. Let simmer for 3-5 minutes.
