In a large microwave-safe bowl, combine the marshmallows, peanut butter, chocolate chips and butter. Cover and microwave on high for 2-1/2 minutes. Stir until well blended (the mixture will be lumpy). Add cereal and peanuts; stir until well coated. Spread into a greased 13-in.x 9-in. x 2-in. pan. For the frosting, combine chocolate chips, butter and milk in another microwave-safe bowl. Cover and microwave on high for 1-1/2 sugar and vanilla. With an electric mixer, beat frosting until smooth. Spread over the cereal mixture. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until firm. Cut into squares.
