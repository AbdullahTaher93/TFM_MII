Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray. Combine garlic, soy sauce, Dijon mustard, and honey in a bowl. Place salmon, skin-side down, onto the prepared baking sheet. Prick salmon several times with a fork. Spread garlic mixture over salmon; top with sesame seeds. Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 20 minutes.
