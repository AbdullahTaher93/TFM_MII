Place milk in freezer for 1 hour. Remove and pour into a tall cylindrical container. Using an immersion blender, start at the bottom and slowly draw the blender up at a tilt. Gradually add confectioners' sugar while continuing to move blender up and down to build volume. When milk begins to form soft peaks, mix in vanilla extract. Serve immediately.
