Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Spread spinach-artichoke dip evenly over tortillas. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and onion over dip. Arrange tortillas on prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 10 minutes. Top pizzas with tomato before slicing and serving.
