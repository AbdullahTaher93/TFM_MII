Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Heat dressing in small ovenproof nonstick skillet on medium-high heat. Add onions and asparagus; cook 3 min., stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, beat eggs lightly in medium bowl. Stir in tomatoes, ham and 1/4 cup of the cheese. Pour into skillet; cook, without stirring, 3 to 4 min. or until edges begin to set. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese. Bake in skillet, uncovered, 20 min. until center is set. Let stand 5 min.; cut into wedges to serve. Sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley, if desired.
