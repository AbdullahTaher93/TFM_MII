Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over low heat. Add wild mushrooms, yellow onion, portobello mushrooms, thyme, rosemary, and sea salt; cover and cook until mushrooms soften, about 3 minutes. Uncover saucepan and pour in white wine; cook and stir until most of the wine evaporates, about 5 minutes. Pour in chicken broth; simmer soup until flavors combine, about 15 minutes. Whisk heavy cream, 1/4 cup parsley, and flour together in a small bowl. Pour into the soup; cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season soup with salt and pepper; top with remaining 1/4 cup parsley.
