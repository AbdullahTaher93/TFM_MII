Cut meat crosswise into steaks about 1 1/2 inches thick. Then apply tenderizer according to package directions. Cut meat into 1 1/2-inch cubes and place in a large bowl. To prepare pineapple-wine marinade, in a large bowl stir together pineapple juice, wine, onion, Worcestershire, thyme, mustard, sugar, pepper, and garlic. Pour marinade over meat; stir to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or until next day, stirring occasionally. In a small bowl, stir together butter, oil, and 1/3 cup of the marinade drained from meat; set aside. Discard remaining marinade. Preheat barbecue grill. On long, sturdy metal skewers, thread meat alternately with corn, bell peppers, onions, and pineapple. Brush all over with butter mixture. Lightly oil grill and place skewers over a solid bed of hot coals or gas grill on high heat (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds). Close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning and basting frequently with butter mixture, until meat is done to your liking; cut to test (about 15 minutes for medium-rare).
