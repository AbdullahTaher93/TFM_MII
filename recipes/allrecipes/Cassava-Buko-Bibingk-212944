Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking dish with banana leaves. Mix sweetened condensed milk, coconut milk, eggs, and butter together in a bowl; add 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese and mix well. Stir cassava and buko into the milk mixture; pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Spread the remaining Cheddar cheese over the top; bake until cheese melts, about 10 minutes.
