Place pork on a greased rack in a foil-lined shallow roasting pan. Combine the brown sugar, mustard and ginger; spread over pork. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let stand for 5-10 minutes before slicing. In a bowl, combine the salsa ingredients. Serve with pork.
