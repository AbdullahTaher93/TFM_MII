Place the tofu, bananas, and 1 tablespoon of chocolate chips in the bowl of a food processor; blend on low to combine ingredients. Mix together the pancake mix and the remaining 1 tablespoon of chocolate chips in a bowl. Stir in the banana mixture and blend until smooth. Spoon the batter into the bottom of a microwave-safe baking dish, spreading to 1 1/2 inch thickness. Cover and cook in the microwave at full power for 3 minutes. Remove and invert onto a microwave-safe plate. If the cake is too moist, cook in the microwave 1 to 3 minutes more.
