Cut meat or tofu into strips. Heat oil in a 10- to 12-inch nonstick pan over high heat. Add meat and stir-fry until cooked. Remove from pan and place in a large bowl; keep warm. Bring 4 cups water to boil in a 2- to 3-quart pan. Meanwhile, add vegetables and coleslaw to the same pan you just used; stir-fry until crisp-tender, about 7 minutes. Remove from pan, add to meat, keep warm. Break noodles into boiling water; add 3 seasoning packets (save fourth for another use). Boil noodles 3 minutes or until soft. Add noodles to meat and vegetable mixture. Stir in teriyaki and soy sauce. Cook until thoroughly heated. Spoon noodles into individual bowls and serve immediately.
