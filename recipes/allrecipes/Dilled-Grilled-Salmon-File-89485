Brush salmon filets with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Grill filets starting skin-side down over medium heat, turning once. (About eight minutes total per inch of thickness to be fully cooked.) Mix thin slices of cucumber with the yogurt, lemon juice, dill and garlic. Place a dollop of dill sauce on each plate, place filets on top, and cover with remaining sauce. If you like, garnish with a sprig of fresh dill.
