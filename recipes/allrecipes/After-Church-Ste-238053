Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Spread beef cubes into a 3-quart casserole dish; season with salt, basil, and black pepper. Arrange carrots, onions, and celery atop the beef cubes. Pour soup and water over the beef and vegetable mixture. Cover the dish with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 3 hours. Arrange potatoes over the stew; continue baking until potatoes are tender, about 45 minutes more.
