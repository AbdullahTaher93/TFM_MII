Prepare a slow cooker crock with cooking spray. Spread celery, carrots, onion, and garlic in the bottom of the crock. Season short ribs with salt and pepper; place atop the vegetables. Pour beef consomme and water into the crock. Cook on High until the ribs are fork-tender, 5 to 7 hours. Remove the ribs from the slow cooker to a platter. Strain the broth and discard the vegetables. Strip meat from the bones of the ribs. Discard bones and transfer meat to a bowl. Shred meat with 2 forks and serve with strained broth.
