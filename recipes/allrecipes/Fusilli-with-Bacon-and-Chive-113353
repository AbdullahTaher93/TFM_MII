In a large frying pan, cook the pieces of bacon until they are golden brown and crisp. Using a slotted spoon, remove the bacon from the pan and drain it on paper towels. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the fusilli until done, about 13 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water and drain the pasta. Toss the pasta with the Parmesan until thoroughly combined. Stir in 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta-cooking water, the bacon, butter, chives, salt, and pepper. Stir in more of the reserved pasta-cooking water if needed to make the dish moist. Serve topped with additional Parmesan.
