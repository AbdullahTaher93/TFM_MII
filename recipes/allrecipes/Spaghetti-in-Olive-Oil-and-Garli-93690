Set a covered large pot of water over high heat. Place the oil and garlic in a microwaveable dish. Cover with waxed paper. Microwave on high for about 2 minutes, or until sizzling. Remove and set aside. When the water boils, add the salt and spaghetti. Stir, cover the pot, and return to the boil. Uncover and boil, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes, or until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water. Drain the spaghetti and return to the pot. Drizzle with the garlic oil. Toss to coat. Add the parsley and some of the cooking water to moisten. Toss. Serve with crushed red pepper for seasoning at the table.
