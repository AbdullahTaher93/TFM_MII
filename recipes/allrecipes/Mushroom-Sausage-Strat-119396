In a skillet, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Place bread cubes in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with the sausage, mushrooms and cheeses. In a bowl, combine the remaining ingredients; pour over the top. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 35-45 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
