Peel and core pears* from the bottom, leaving stems intact. Cut a thin slice off the bottom of each pear to provide a flat, even bottom. Set aside. In a medium saucepan, add remaining ingredients. Bring mixture to a boil. Add pears and arrange standing with stems pointing up. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, 20-30 minutes or until pears are tender. Remove pears from saucepan. Continue to cook liquid until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 15 minutes. Serve pears drizzled with sauce.
