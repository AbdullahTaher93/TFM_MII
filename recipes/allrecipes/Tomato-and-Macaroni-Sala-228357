Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water until pasta is chilled. Mix elbow macaroni, hard-cooked eggs, light mayonnaise, creamy salad dressing, spicy brown mustard, dry mustard, and marjoram in a large salad bowl until thoroughly combined. Stir in tomatoes. Be sure to include the juice from your cutting board. Season with salt and black pepper.
