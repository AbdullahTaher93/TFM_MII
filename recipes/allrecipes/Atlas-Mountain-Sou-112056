Soak the apricots in water for 2 hours or more until soft; drain. Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic, cinnamon, cumin, and paprika; cook and stir for 1 minute. Raise the heat to medium-high, crumble in the ground lamb, stirring and breaking it up with a wooden spoon for a few minutes until browned. Stir in the drained apricots, celery, green pepper, and tomato. Using a vegetable peeler, shave 5 - 6 strips of rind off the lemon and add to the soup with the juice of the lemon. Stir in the water and sugar. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer gently for half an hour. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
