Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease 2 (6-3/4 x 3-1/2-inch) loaf pans with olive oil. In medium bowl, combine flour, salt and baking powder. In large bowl, place olive oil. Slowly beat in sugar, orange juice and vanilla with electric mixer at medium speed until blended. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add milk; beat 2 minutes. Gradually beat flour mixture into olive oil mixture until well blended. Pour batter equally into prepared pans. Bake 50 to 55 minutes or until golden brown and toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean. Cool on wire racks 15 minutes. Remove from pans; cool completely on wire racks.
