Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Heat the oil in an ovenproof Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the garlic and onion and cook, stirring frequently, for 4 minutes, or until softened. Add the rice and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes, or until it starts to brown. Stir in the chicken, tomatoes, broth, thyme, and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover the pot and place in the oven. Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed.
