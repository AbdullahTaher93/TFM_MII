Season beef cubes with kosher salt, black pepper, and garlic powder in a large bowl. Dust beef with 1/3 cup flour and toss lightly to coat. Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot oil until evenly browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove beef with slotted spoon; transfer to a bowl. Stir bell pepper, onion, celery, and garlic into the oil left in the pot; cook and stir until vegetables are lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove vegetables with a slotted spoon and add to the bowl of beef. Drain oil, reserving about 3 tablespoons in the pot. Reduce heat to low. Gradually whisk 1/4 cup flour into the reserved oil until you achieve a dark golden-brown roux, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir constantly and watch carefully; roux burns easily. Slowly pour beef broth into the roux while stirring; bring to a simmer, and cook until thickened, stirring constantly, about 3 minutes. Return the beef and vegetables to the pot. Add bay leaves, thyme, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, basil, tomatoes with green chiles, and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until beef is tender, about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Remove bay leaves and stir in chopped parsley to serve.
