Place mushrooms in a nonstick skillet over medium heat; add water. Cook, stirring occasionally, until water is evaporated, about 5 minutes. Whisk cream and flour into mushrooms until flour is incorporated. Add Asiago cheese, shallot, salt, and black pepper to mushroom mixture, stirring constantly. Cook and stir until sauce thickens, about 7 minutes.
