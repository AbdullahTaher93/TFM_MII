Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl stir together oats, coconut, almonds, peanuts, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. In a small saucepan melt butter and honey over low heat, stirring occasionally. Pour butter mixture over oat mixture and toss to combine well. Spread granola evenly in 2 large, rimmed baking sheets and bake in upper and lower thirds of oven, stirring frequently and switching position of pans halfway through baking, until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. In a large bowl combine granola with dried fruits and cool, stirring occasionally.
