To make the dressing, put the sour cream, ketchup, cilantro, Cajun seasoning, 2 dashes of Tabasco sauce, and salt and pepper to taste in a large bowl. Whisk together, then taste and add more Tabasco sauce, if liked. Add the beans, corn, celery, red onion, green bell pepper, and ham to the bowl, and stir until everything is well mixed. Garnish with sprigs of cilantro and serve at once.
