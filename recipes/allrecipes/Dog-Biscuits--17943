Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, stir together the whole wheat flour, powdered milk, garlic powder, wheat germ and beef bouillon granules. Stir in the bacon grease and egg. Add ice water 1 tablespoon at a time until dough is wet enough to stick together. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/2 inch thickness and cut with cookie cutters. Place biscuits 1 inch apart onto an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until firm. Cool before serving.
