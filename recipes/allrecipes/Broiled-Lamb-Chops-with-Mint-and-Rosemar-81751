Mince the mint and rosemary leaves. In a small microwave proof bowl, add the butter, mint and rosemary. Zap for about 30 seconds. Let sit a couple of minutes and zap for 30 seconds again. Drizzle about 1/4 of the butter over the chops and brush to spread it around. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Turn the chops over and repeat. This will leave about 1/2 of the butter mixture to drizzle over the chops after they have cooked. Place a broiler pan so that it is about 6 inches below the broiler. Let the pan heat up for a minute or two. Carefully add the lamb chops. Broil for about 10 minute per inch of thickness for medium-well done. Turn the chops after half the cooking time. Remove from oven and drizzle the remaining butter over the chops. Let rest 5 minutes before serving, lightly covered with aluminum foil.
