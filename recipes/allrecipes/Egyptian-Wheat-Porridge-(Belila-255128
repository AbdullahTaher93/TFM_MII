Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a saucepan. Add wheat berries. Cover and remove from heat. Let soak, 6 hours to overnight. Drain. Combine soaked wheat berries with remaining 4 cups water; bring to a boil. Simmer over medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat; let stand until berries pop open, 10 to 15 minutes more. Divide wheat berries among serving bowls. Add a few spoonfuls of hot milk, a handful of almonds, and a sprinkle of cinnamon to each bowl before serving.
