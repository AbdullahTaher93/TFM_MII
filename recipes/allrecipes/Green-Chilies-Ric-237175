Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a shallow 1 1/2-quart baking dish. Mix celery soup, sour cream, green chiles, and Cheddar cheese together in a large bowl; add rice and stir to coat. Transfer mixture to prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.
