Bring 2 quarts water to boil; stir in 1tablespoon salt. Plunge Mann's Stringless Sugar Snap Peas into boiling water; cook 45 seconds from the moment peas were added. Do not overcook even briefly or peas will become too soft. Drain; immediately plunge into ice water or 2 minutes. Drain thoroughly; reserve. To make dressing: mix zest, lemon juice, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt, crushed red peppers and black pepper, whisk in oil. Toss dressing with reserved sugar snap peas, green onion and sliced almonds. Arrange salad on serving platter. Garnish with lemon slices.
