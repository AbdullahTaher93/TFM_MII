Cook bacon in a large saucepan over medium heat until crisp, stirring occasionally. Use a slotted spoon to transfer bacon to a paper towel; set aside. Cook onion in drippings in same saucepan 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add broth, milk, potato, salt and pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer 15 minutes or until potato is tender. Turn off heat; add 1-1/2 cups cheese, stirring until melted. Ladle into shallow bowls; top with remaining 1/4 cup cheese and reserved bacon. Garnish with chives, if desired.
