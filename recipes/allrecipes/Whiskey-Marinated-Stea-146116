Whisk together the water, whiskey, pineapple juice, brown sugar, diced onion, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, liquid smoke, and minced garlic in a bowl. Lie the steaks in the bottom of a baking dish. Pour the marinade over the steaks; refrigerate overnight. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate. Grill steaks to desired doneness, 3 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Allow steaks to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
