In a saucepan over medium heat, warm the salsa for 1 minute before adding tortilla strips and 1/4 cup cilantro. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Set aside. Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in 1/2 the onions, garlic, and oregano; cook until onions are softened, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with Southwest seasoning. Pour in egg substitute and mix until scrambled. Remove from heat, and mix in warmed salsa and tortilla strips. Serve with remaining onions and cilantro.
