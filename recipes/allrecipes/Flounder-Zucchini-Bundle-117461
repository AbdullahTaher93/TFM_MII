For each bundle, place two fillets on a double thickness of heavy-duty foil (18 in. x 15 in.); sprinkle with lemon-pepper. Top with lemon slices, zucchini and tomatoes. Sprinkle with dill and basil. Fold foil around fish and seal tightly. Place on a baking sheet. Bake at 425 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
