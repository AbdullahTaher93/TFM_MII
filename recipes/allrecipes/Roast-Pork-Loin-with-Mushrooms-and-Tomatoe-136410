Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. In a 9-by-13-inch baking pan, combine tomatoes, mushrooms, garlic, and oil; season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat, and move mixture to sides of pan (leaving center free). Sprinkle pork with 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, cumin, coriander, and oregano, rubbing mixture in. Place pork in center of pan. Roast until meat registers 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer and mushrooms are tender, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove from oven. Cut off a third (10 ounces) of the pork loin, and set aside for making pressed pork sandwiches. Slice remaining pork, and serve with tomatoes, mushrooms, and any pan juices.
