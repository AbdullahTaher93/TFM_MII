In a bowl, combine flour, cornmeal, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, beat egg; add milk, syrup and oil. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Pour into a greased 9-in. square baking pan. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-22 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes; cut into squares. Serve warm.
