In a saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch and cocoa. Stir in the milk until smooth. Cook and stir over low heat just until boiling. Remove from the heat; stir a small amount into egg substitute. Return all to pan; cook for 1 minute or until thickened. Refrigerate. Meanwhile, for crust, combine cocoa, sugar, flour and baking powder in a bowl. Combine applesauce, egg substitute, oil and vanilla; add to the dry ingredients and mix just until blended. Pour into a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. In a mixing bowl, beat the chilled chocolate mixture until light. Fold in whipped topping; carefully spread over crust. Refrigerate for 2 hours.
