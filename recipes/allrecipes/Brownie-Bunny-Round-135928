Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease bottoms of muffin pans. Mix brownies according to package directions. Spread evenly into the bottom of 24 muffin cups (about 1 heaping tablespoon per cup). Bake 14 to 16 minutes or until toothpick in center comes out almost clean. Cool completely. Remove from pans. Place about 1/2 teaspoon icing in center of each brownie round. Cut each marshmallow in half. Place 1 marshmallow half, cut-side down, on frosting, pressing down slightly. Cut the remaining marshmallow piece in half lengthwise. Place the 2 small long pieces next to the rounds creating bunny ears; repeat with remaining marshmallows. Decorate faces using icing.
