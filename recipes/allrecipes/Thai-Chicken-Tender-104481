Heat oil in large skillet and cook chicken until it is no longer pink, about 2-3 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add ginger, Hoisin sauce, Peter Pan peanut butter and McCormick cayenne pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until sauce is bubbly and warm, 1-2 minutes. Remove from heat and sprinkle with scallions. Serve immediately.
