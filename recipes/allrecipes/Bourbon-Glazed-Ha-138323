Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Trim all but 1/4 inch fat from the ham, and score remaining fat in 3/4-inch diamonds, just deep enough to reach the meat without cutting into it. Place ham, fat side up, on a rack in a roasting pan. In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar, mustard, and bourbon. Brush 1/4 of the glaze over the ham. Bake the ham, brushing with remaining glaze every 30 minutes, until heated through (140 degrees F on a meat thermometer), about 2 hours. Let ham stand about 15 minutes before carving. Using a knife with a long blade, carve downward to the bone. Run the knife horizontally through the ham, along the top of the bone, to release the slices.
