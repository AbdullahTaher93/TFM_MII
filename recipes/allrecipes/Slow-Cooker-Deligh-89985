Place ground beef in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain excess fat. In a slow cooker, combine beef, potatoes, corn, peas, and barley. Stir in tomato sauce, green onions, and chives. Season with black pepper. Cover and cook on low setting for 4 hours. Stir occasionally, and add water if necessary.
