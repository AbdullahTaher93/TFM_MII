Melt coconut oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add cinnamon stick, peppercorns, cloves, and cardamom; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add garlic and ginger; cook and stir until browned, about 1 minute. Stir onion and bay leaf into the pot; cook, stirring constantly, until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add potato, carrot, green chile peppers, green beans, and salt. Stir in ground black peppers and turmeric. Cook, covered, for 3 minutes. Stir chicken into the pot until evenly mixed, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in enough water to cover the chicken. Reduce heat to low; cover and cook until chicken is tender, about 30 minutes. Stir coconut milk and green peas gently into the pot. Cook until heated through but not boiling, about 5 minutes.
