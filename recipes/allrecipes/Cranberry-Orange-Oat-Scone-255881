Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly spray cookie sheet with cooking spray. In large bowl, combine flour, oats, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt; mix well. Cut in margarine with pastry blender or two knives until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in dried fruit and orange zest. Add combined buttermilk and egg substitute to flour mixture all at once; stir with fork just until dry ingredients are moistened. (Do not overmix.) Drop dough by 1/4 cup portions 2 inches apart onto cookie sheet. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until very light golden brown. Serve warm.
