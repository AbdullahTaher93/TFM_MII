Place potato flakes, wheat crackers, flour, butter-flavored granules, salt, and pepper into a food processor. Pulse until the crackers are finely crushed, then transfer mixture to a bowl. Melt the butter flavored shortening in a skillet over medium-high heat. Dip the tomato slices one at a time into the eggs, then the cracker mixture. Pan fry the tomatoes in the shortening until golden brown on both sides, 7 to 10 minutes. Mix the ranch dressing, sour cream, and hot pepper sauce in a bowl. Serve the fried tomatoes with topped with the sauce.
