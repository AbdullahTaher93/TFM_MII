Cut brie into 36 equal pieces, each about 3/4 inch square. Set aside. On a well-floured board, unfold puff pastry sheet, then roll it out into a 12-inch square. Use a ruler as a guide and trim off edges with a sharp knife to make straight sides. Again using the ruler as a guide, cut the dough lengthwise into 2-inch-wide strips (you should have 6 strips). Cut each strip crosswise at 2-inch intervals. Place the 36 2-inch squares onto 2 ungreased baking sheets. In a small bowl, beat egg yolk together with 1 tablespoon water. With a pastry brush, lightly brush tops of pastry squares with egg mixture; you will not use all the egg mixture. Spread about 1/2 teaspoon of the chutney over each square, then top each with 1 piece of the brie. Bake in a 425 degree oven until pizzettes are golden brown and cheese and chutney are bubbling, 12 to 14 minutes; switch pans on racks halfway through baking to ensure even browning. Transfer pizzettes to a serving platter and serve warm.
