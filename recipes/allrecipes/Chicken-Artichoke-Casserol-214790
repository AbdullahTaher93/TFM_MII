Bring a large pot of water to a boil; cook the chicken breasts in the boiling water until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). While the chicken boils, stir the mayonnaise, cream of chicken soup, lemon juice, curry powder, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; set aside. Cut the cooked chicken meat into bite-size pieces and arrange in the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Cut the artichoke hearts into bite-size pieces and scatter over the chicken. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the reserved liquid from the artichoke jars over the chicken and artichoke mixture. Pour the soup mixture over the chicken and artichokes. Scatter the Cheddar cheese atop the soup. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the bread cubes in the melted butter until browned. Sprinkle the croutons over the entire casserole. Bake the casserole in the preheated oven until the top is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
