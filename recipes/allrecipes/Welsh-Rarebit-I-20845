In a saucepan over low heat, stir the cheese and milk 10 minutes, or until smooth. Stir in the mustard, soy sauce and white pepper. In a small bowl, mix the egg and 3/4 cup of the hot mixture. Combine the egg mixture with the remaining hot mixture. Continue cooking over low heat, stirring constantly, for approximately 10 minutes, until the mixture thickens and boils.
