In a saucepan, combine cranberry sauce, chili sauce and lemon juice. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir until smooth. Set aside. In a bowl, combine the next nine ingredients; add beef and mix well. Shape into 1-in. balls. Place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Pour sauce over meatballs. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 40-50 minutes or until the meatballs are no longer pink and sauce is bubbly.
