Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until tender. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Stir in the broth, tomato puree, sherry, and salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the lobster and simmer, covered, for 6 minutes, or until the lobster is opaque. Stir in the milk, hot-pepper sauce, and paprika. Cook over medium heat for 3 minutes, or until heated through. Stir in the plum tomatoes and parsley.
