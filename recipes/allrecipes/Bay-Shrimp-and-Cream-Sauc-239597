Heat sherry in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir shallot and garlic in hot sherry until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir heavy cream into the sherry mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook liquid at a simmer until it begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Stir tomatoes and shrimp into the liquid in the skillet; bring to a simmer until the tomatoes have softened and the liquid thickens, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
