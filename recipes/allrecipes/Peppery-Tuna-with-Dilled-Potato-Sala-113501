In a medium saucepan, cover the potatoes with water and bring to a boil. Cook over moderately high heat until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and let cool. In a spice grinder, grind the coriander seeds and fennel seeds to a powder. Transfer to a small bowl and stir in the crushed red pepper, 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper. Sprinkle the tuna steaks on both sides with the spice mixture and let stand for 15 minutes. In a small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of the olive oil with the balsamic vinegar, mustard and dill and season with salt and pepper. Slice the potatoes 1/2 inch thick and toss with 2 tablespoons of the dressing. Mound the potato salad on plates. In a large skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil until shimmering. Add the tuna steaks and cook over high heat until browned on the outside and rare within, about 1 minute per side. Set the tuna steaks over the potato salad and scatter the greens on top. Drizzle with the remaining dressing and serve.
