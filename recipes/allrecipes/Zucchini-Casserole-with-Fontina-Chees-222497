Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8-inch baking dish. Arrange zucchini slices in the bottom of the baking dish; spread with mushroom soup. Top with fontina cheese and sprinkle with fried onions. Bake in preheated oven until mushroom soup is bubbly and cheese is melted, about 30 minutes.
