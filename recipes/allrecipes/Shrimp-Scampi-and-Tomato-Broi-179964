Preheat the oven's broiler, and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Heat the oil in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium heat; add the garlic, and cook until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Stir in the shrimp and the tomatoes. Cook just until the shrimp turn pink, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in wine; simmer for 2 additional minutes. Top shrimp with mozzarella cheese, and broil until the cheese is melted and golden. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and dried parsley before serving.
