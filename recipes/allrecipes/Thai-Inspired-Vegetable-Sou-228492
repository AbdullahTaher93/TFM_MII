Melt butter in a large pot over medium-low heat; add tomatoes, zucchini, onion, red bell pepper, garlic, cilantro, basil, lime juice, and salt. Cover and cook until vegetables are slightly tender, about 25 minutes. Transfer vegetable mixture to a blender or food processor; blend until smooth. Place milk, coconut butter, curry powder, turmeric, ginger, cumin, and bay leaf in the same large pot; cook and stir over medium-low heat until coconut butter is completely melted, 5 to 10 minutes. Add pureed vegetables to the milk mixture; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Garnish each serving with about 1 tablespoon heavy cream.
