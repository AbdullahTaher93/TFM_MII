In a large saucepan, heat the oil over moderately low heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the wine and simmer 1 minute longer. Stir in the tomatoes and salt and bring to a simmer. Add the squid, cover, and simmer gently until the squid is just tender, about 30 minutes. Do not allow to boil. Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the spaghetti until almost done, about 10 minutes. Drain the pasta. Add the basil and the spaghetti to the sauce and simmer until the pasta is done and has absorbed some of the sauce, about 2 minutes.
