In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites and vanilla until soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar, about 2 tablespoons at a time, beating until stiff peaks form. Gently fold in cocoa. Place in a pastry bag with a large open star tip (#8b). Line baking sheets with ungreased parchment paper. Pipe stars, about 1-1/4-in. diameter, onto foil, or drop by rounded teaspoonfuls. Bake at 300 degrees for 30-35 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from foil; cool on wire racks. In a microwave or double boiler, melt chocolate and shortening; stir until smooth. Dip the cookies halfway into glaze; place on waxed paper to harden.
