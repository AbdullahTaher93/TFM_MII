Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and red pepper; cook and stir until soft, about 3 minutes. Stir corn, zucchini, and chicken into the onion mixture; cook and stir until all vegetables are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. Sprinkle parsley and about half the cheese over the vegetable mixture and toss to mix; season with salt and pepper. Transfer the vegetables to a serving dish and top with remaining cheese.
