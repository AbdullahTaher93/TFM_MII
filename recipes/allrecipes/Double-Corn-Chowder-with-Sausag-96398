Crumble bratwurst into a large saucepan; discard casings. Add onion; cook over medium heat 8 minutes, breaking up bratwurst into chunks. Add creamed corn, half-and-half, corn kernels, bell pepper, black pepper and hot pepper sauce. Simmer uncovered 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Ladle into soup bowls; top with croutons and chives, if desired.
