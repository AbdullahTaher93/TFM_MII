Dissolve yeast in lukewarm water in a large bowl. Set aside for 5 minutes. Stir flour, eggs, warm milk, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup melted butter, and salt into the yeast and water until the mixture is a moist and sticky dough. Put dough in a greased bowl and cover with a wet towel. Set aside in a warm place until dough doubles in size and holes poked into dough with a finger stay indented, about 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours. Stir brown sugar, 1/2 cup butter, honey, and corn syrup together in a saucepan over medium heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves. Pour the topping mixture into the bottom of 2 9x13-inch non-stick baking dishes. Sprinkle 1 cup raisins and walnuts evenly onto the topping mixture. Punch down dough and roll into a rectangle shape 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick. Brush 1/4 cup melted butter over the dough rectangle. Stir 3/4 cup white sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl; sprinkle over the butter. Sprinkle 1 cup raisins evenly over the dough. Roll dough around the filling into a cylinder; cut into 3/4-inch slices and arrange into the baking dishes. Set aside to rest for 20 minutes or up to overnight in the refrigerator. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake rolls in preheated oven until no longer doughy in the middle, about 25 minutes. Immediately flip onto a serving platter, transferring topping onto rolls, and serve warm.
