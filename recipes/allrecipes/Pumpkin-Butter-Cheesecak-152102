Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. To make the cake, stir the cake mix together with 1 egg and 1/2 cup butter in a mixing bowl until well blended. Pat the mixture evenly onto the bottom of the prepared baking dish. To make the filling, beat the cream cheese and pumpkin together in a mixing bowl until smooth. Beat in the eggs, vanilla, and 1/2 cup butter until creamy and smooth. Gradually stir in the confectioners' sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg until evenly blended. Spread the pumpkin mixture over the cake layer. Bake in preheated oven until top is set, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool, and cut into squares to serve.
