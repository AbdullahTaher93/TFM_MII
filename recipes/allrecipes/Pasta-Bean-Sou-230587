Heat olive oil in a stock pot over medium-high heat; cook and stir sausage and garlic in the hot oil until sausage is crumbly and evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Mix tomatoes, navy beans, beef stock, chicken stock, basil, oregano, and red pepper flakes into sausage mixture; bring to a boil. Add spinach and ditalini pasta and simmer until pasta is tender but firm to the bite, about 10 minutes.
