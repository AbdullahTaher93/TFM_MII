Preheat oven to 375 degree F. Cut bread crosswise in half or into quarters. Cut each piece lengthwise in half, then into 1/4- to 1/2-inch strips. (It is helpful to cut bread so there is crust on each strip.) Line a 15x10x1-inch baking pan with foil; lightly coat with cooking spray. Arrange half of the breadsticks in a single layer; drizzle with half of the oil. Using a spatula or tongs, carefully turn breadsticks to coat with oil. Sprinkle with half of the Parmesan cheese. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until browned and crisp. Repeat with remaining breadsticks, oil, and cheese. Transfer to a large serving bowl or platter. Serve with Classico(R) Four Cheese pasta sauce. To store leftover breadsticks: Place in a covered container and store at room temperature for 2 days or in the freezer up to 1 month.
