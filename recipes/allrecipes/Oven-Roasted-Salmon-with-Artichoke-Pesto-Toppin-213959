Combine together the Artichoke Dip, Basil Pesto and lemon juice. Place salmon skin side down, season with salt and pepper. Spread the artichoke-pesto mixture onto the salmon filet. Place fish onto a lightly oiled baking pan and bake in preheated 450 degree oven for 10-11 minutes or until fish is cooked and firm and the topping lightly browned. Serve immediately.
