Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine the currants and coffee liqueur in a small saucepan; bring to a simmer over medium heat and remove from heat immediately. Pour water into a saucepan until about 1 inch deep and place over low heat. Place a stainless steel bowl over the saucepan to form a double boiler. Combine the bittersweet chocolate, unsweetened chocolate, and butter in the bowl heat and stir just until the chocolate melts; set aside. Stir together the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a bowl; set aside. Whisk the eggs and sugar together in a separate large mixing bowl until light and fluffy and pale yellow in color, about 5 minutes. Add the vanilla extract; stir. Beat the melted chocolate into the egg mixture until well combined. Pour the currants and chocolate chips into the mixture; then fold in the flour mixture and stir until evenly combined. Scoop 2-tablespoon portions onto the prepared baking sheets with enough space between so they do not run together. Bake in the preheated oven until barely set, about 12 minutes. Allow to cool on the sheets until they set slightly, about 5 minutes, before transferring to a rack to cool completely.
