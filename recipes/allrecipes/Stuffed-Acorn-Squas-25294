Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place squash, face up, in a shallow baking dish. In each half place 2 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 1 cup stuffing mix, 3/4 cup chicken broth, salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. Wrap each half tightly with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until squash is very tender.
