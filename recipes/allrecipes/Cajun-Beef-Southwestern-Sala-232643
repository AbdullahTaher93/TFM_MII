Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Press 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning evenly onto beef steaks. Cover and refrigerate. Place figs, cut side up, on rimmed metal baking sheet. Bake in 350 degrees F oven 25 to 35 minutes or until very soft and starting to caramelize. Set aside. Meanwhile grate peel and squeeze juice from 1 orange. Combine 1/4 cup orange juice, orange peel, oil and 1-1/2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning in small bowl. Set aside. Peel and cut segments from remaining 2 oranges. Set aside. Place steaks on grid over medium, ash-covered coals. Grill, covered, 7 to 10 minutes (over medium heat on preheated gas grill, times remain the same) for medium rare (145 degrees F) to medium (160 degrees F) doneness, turning occasionally. Carve steaks into slices. Assemble salad by layering spinach, beans, onion, figs, orange segments and steak slices. Top with nuts and cheese. Drizzle with orange dressing.
