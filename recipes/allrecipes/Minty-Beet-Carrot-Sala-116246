Line a baking sheet with foil. Place beets on foil; sprinkle lightly with water. Wrap tightly in foil. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until tender; cool. Peel and cut beets into thin slices. Place carrots in a steamer basket; place in a saucepan over 1 in. of water. Bring to a boil; cover and steam for 6-8 minutes or until crisp-tender. On salad plates, arrange the beet and carrot slices, overlapping the slices. Sprinkle with cheese and shallot.
