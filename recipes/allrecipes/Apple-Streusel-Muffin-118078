In a mixing bowl, combine cake mix, flour, eggs, water and oil. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds. Beat on medium for 2 minutes. Fill paper-lined muffin cups one-third full. Combine the filling ingredients; place 2 tablespoonfuls in the center of each muffin cup. Top with remaining batter. Combine the topping ingredients until crumbly; sprinkle over batter. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-22 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely.
