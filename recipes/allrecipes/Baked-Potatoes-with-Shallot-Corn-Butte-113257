Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Using a fork, poke the potatoes all over. Cook the potatoes in a microwave oven at high power for 10 minutes. Transfer the potatoes to the preheated oven and bake for 15 minutes longer. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan of boiling water, cook the corn kernels until barely tender, about 3 minutes. Drain and let cool completely. In a food processor, combine the butter, shallots, lime juice and 1 cup of the corn kernels and puree. Scrape the butter into a bowl, fold in the chives and the remaining 1/2 cup of corn kernels and season with salt and pepper. Split the baked potatoes, fill with a dollop of the corn butter and serve.
