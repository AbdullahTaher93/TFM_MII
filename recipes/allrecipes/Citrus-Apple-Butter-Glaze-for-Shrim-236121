Mix the apple butter, concentrate and lime juice in a medium bowl. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lay shrimp on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Let shrimp cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until slightly opaque. Flip, brush liberally with glaze, and cook until opaque throughout, another 3 to 5 minutes. Brush with more glaze before serving.
