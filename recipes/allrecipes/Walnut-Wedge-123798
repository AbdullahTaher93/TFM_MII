Roll out bottom crust to a 10-1/2-in. circle; place on an ungreased baking sheet. Combine nuts, sugar, honey, cinnamon and lemon juice; spread over crust. Roll out remaining pastry and place over nuts. With fork tines, seal edges together and pierce holes in top. Brush with milk. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool for 10 minutes. Cut into 16-20 wedges. Cool completely. In a saucepan, melt chocolate chips and shortening over low heat; drizzle over wedges.
