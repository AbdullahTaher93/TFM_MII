Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Mix butter, Italian seasoning and garlic powder until well blended; set aside. Unroll dough onto ungreased baking sheet. Press into 15x10-inch rectangle; brush with half of the butter mixture. Sprinkle with cheese and onions; top evenly with turkey. Starting at one of the short ends, roll up dough to form log. Pinch seams and ends together to seal. Position log lengthwise, seam-side down, in center of baking sheet. Brush with remaining butter mixture. Bake 15 min. or until lightly browned. Let stand 5 min. Cut crosswise into 12 slices. Serve with the marinara sauce.
