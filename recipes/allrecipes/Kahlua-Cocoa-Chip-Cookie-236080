Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line ungreased baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. Combine the butter and sugars in large bowl with a hand mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs and Kahlua and continue mixing well; set aside. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the flour, hot cocoa mix, salt, baking soda and baking powder. Gradually add dry mixture to wet ingredients. Mix well to combine. Stir in chocolate chips and marshmallow bits until well incorporated. Using a tablespoon or cookie scoop, drop dough onto prepared baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for five minutes before transferring onto a wire rack to cool completely.
