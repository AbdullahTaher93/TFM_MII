In a small skillet, saute the carrot, celery and onion in butter until tender. Remove from the heat; stir in ham and set aside. In a large bowl, combine the biscuit mix and sugar. Whisk the egg and milk; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in cheese. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups three-fourths full. Make an indentation in the center of each muffin; fill with 1 tablespoon ham mixture. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-17 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in muffin comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm.
