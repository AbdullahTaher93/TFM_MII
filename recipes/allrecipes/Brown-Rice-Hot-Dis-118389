In a nonstick skillet, saute rice in half of the butter until golden brown; transfer to a large bowl. In the same skillet, saute the mushrooms, celery and onion in remaining butter until tender; add to rice. Stir in the water, pecans, salt, marjoram, pepper, sage and thyme. Transfer to a 1-1/2-qt. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed. Fluff with a fork before serving.
