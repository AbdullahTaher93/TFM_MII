Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice tops off apples with a sharp knife. Core apples with an apple corer, leaving the bottoms intact. Splash vanilla extract into the cored apples; spoon 1 1/2 tablespoons of peanut butter into each one. Place apples in a baking pan; sprinkle with cardamom and cloves. Bake in the preheated oven until apples are softened and fragrant, about 30 minutes.
