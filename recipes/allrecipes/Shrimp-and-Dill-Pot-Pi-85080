Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and onion; saute 2 minutes. Add shrimp and sugar snap peas, saute until shrimp begin to turn pink, about 3-4 minutes. Whisk together half and half, wine, flour, herbs and salt; add to skillet. Bring just to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly; simmer 2 minutes or until sauce thickens. Pour into a 2-quart baking dish about 2 inches deep. Separate biscuits into 3 layers. Place biscuit layers on top of filling, overlapping layers in a shingle fashion to cover the top of the filling. Bake 11-13 minutes or until biscuit topping is golden brown.
