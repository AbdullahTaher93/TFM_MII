Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onions; cook and stir until just starting to turn golden, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in tomato puree, water, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Bring tomato sauce to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer until flavors blend, about 30 minutes.
