Heat the corn oil in a large cooking pot over medium-high heat. Add the Smithfield Fresh Ground Pork and ground beef. Cook and stir, crumbling the meat, until browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Cook on high until all the meat is brown. Reduce heat to medium. Add salt, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, cumin, black pepper, bay leaf, paprika, tomato sauce, dry wine, and red pepper. Stir every 10 minutes until liquid has evaporated, 30 to 40 minutes. Stir in olives and raisins and cook for an additional 10 minutes. Serve with white rice.
