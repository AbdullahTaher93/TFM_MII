Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the Brussels sprouts and cook for 8 minutes or until lightly browned, stirring often. Stir the broth, cornstarch, hoisin, lime juice and honey in a medium bowl. Add the broth mixture to the skillet and cook and stir for 4 minutes or until the broth mixture boils and thickens. Drizzle with the sriracha before serving, if desired.
