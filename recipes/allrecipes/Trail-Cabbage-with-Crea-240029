Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and bacon in hot butter until bacon is browned and crisped, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir cabbage into bacon mixture and season with salt and black pepper. Pour cream over cabbage mixture and stir; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, cover the skillet with a lid, and cook until cabbage is tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
