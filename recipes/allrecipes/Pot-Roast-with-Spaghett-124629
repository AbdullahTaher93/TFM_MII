Heat oil and butter in a Dutch oven; brown roast evenly on all sides. Remove and set aside. Add garlic, onion and seasonings. Cook slowly for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in water and tomato paste; blend well. Return roast to Dutch oven and spoon sauce over it. Cover and simmer for 2-1/2 to 3 hours or until the meat is tender. Remove roast; cut into slices. Serve with spaghetti and sauce. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese if desired.
