Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until beginning to soften, about 10 minutes; drain. Heat bacon drippings in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir potatoes in the hot drippings until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Stir ramps and bacon with the potatoes; season with salt and black pepper. Continue cooking until the ramps are soft, about 5 minutes.
