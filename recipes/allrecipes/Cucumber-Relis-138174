Heat a small skillet over medium heat. Add cumin seeds; toast, stirring, until they are lightly browned. Transfer to a small bowl; let cool. Peel and seed the cucumbers, and cut into 1/4-inch dice. Place in a large bowl, and add celery, scallions, poblano chiles, cilantro, lemon juice, and toasted cumin seeds. Season with salt, and serve immediately.
