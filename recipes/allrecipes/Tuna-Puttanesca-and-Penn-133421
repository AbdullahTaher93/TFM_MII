Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Salt the water, add the pasta and cook until al dente. While the pasta is working, heat a deep skillet over medium heat with the EVOO, 1 turn of the pan. Add the tuna, flaking it with a wooden spoon. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the capers and olives and heat until warmed through, 1 minute. Stir in the tomatoes and parsley, lower the heat a little and simmer for 5 minutes. Add a ladle of the pasta cooking liquid to the sauce. Drain the pasta, add it to the sauce and toss.
