Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat an 8x8-inch (20x20-cm) baking dish with nonstick spray. In a large bowl, combine the plums, blueberries, 1/2 cup (125 mL) sugar, and 2 tablespoons (25 mL) of the flour. Pour into the prepared baking dish. In a medium bowl, combine 3 teaspoons (15 mL) of the remaining sugar, the baking powder, salt, and the remaining 1 cup (250 mL) of flour. In a small bowl, combine the buttermilk, egg white, and oil. Pour the wet ingredients into the medium bowl with the flour mixture; stir until a thick batter forms. Drop the batter in tablespoonfuls on top of the fruit. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 teaspoon sugar. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden and bubbly. Remove to a rack to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature.
