Heat oven to 425 degrees F (220C). Cut potatoes lengthwise and drizzle each with 1/4 teaspoon (1 mL) oil. Top with garlic, onion, green peppers, and tomatoes. Sprinkle on olives, seasoning, and red pepper flakes. Top with mozzarella. Bake until cheese is melted and vegetables are heated through, about 10 minutes.
