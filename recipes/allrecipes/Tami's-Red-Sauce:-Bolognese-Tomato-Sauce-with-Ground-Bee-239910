Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned completely, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir tomato sauce, basil, oregano, onion powder, garlic powder, sugar, salt, and pepper into the beef; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook sauce at a simmer, stirring occasionally, until thick and rich, about 1 hour.
