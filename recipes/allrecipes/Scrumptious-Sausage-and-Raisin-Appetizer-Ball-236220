Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix sausage, raisins, and basil together in a bowl; roll into walnut-size balls. Arrange balls on a baking sheet or jelly roll pan with sides; sprinkle with paprika. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove sheet from oven, drain fat, re-roll balls if needed, and sprinkle with more paprika. Continue baking until cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Drain.
