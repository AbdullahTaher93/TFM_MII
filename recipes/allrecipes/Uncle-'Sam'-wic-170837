Roll out sugar cookie dough, cut into 16 rectangles and bake as directed on package (or in recipe for homemade cookie dough). Decorate half the cookies with red, white and blue icing to look like American flags. Place a scoop of ice cream on undecorated cookies, spread with a small spatula and top with a decorated cookie. Freeze until ready to serve.
