Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir chicken, corn, and red pepper in hot oil until heated through and pepper is slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon rice into 2 bowls, divide chicken mixture between the two bowls, and top each with salsa and Monterey Jack cheese.
