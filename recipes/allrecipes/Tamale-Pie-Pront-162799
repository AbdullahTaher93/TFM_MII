Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan. Brown the ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drain fat. Stir in the tomatoes, corn, tomato sauce, chili beans, ketchup, onion, and chili powder. Mix well. Line the prepared pan with the biscuits, covering the bottom and the sides. Brush biscuits with vegetable oil; sprinkle evenly with cornmeal. Spoon the ground beef mixture into the biscuit-lined dish. Sprinkle with the shredded cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are golden and the cheese is melted, about 25 minutes.
