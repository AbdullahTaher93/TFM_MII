Pre-heat broiler. In a small bowl, combine 1/2 cup of the blackberries and 1 tablespoon of the sugar. Set aside. In another bowl, combine 2 tablespoons sugar, yogurt, and lemon peel. Gently mix in remaining berries. Spoon yogurt-berry mixture into 4 ovenproof ramekins, each 1-1/2 to 2 inches deep and 4 to 5 inches wide. In a deep bowl, whip egg whites with a mixer at high speed until foamy. Continue to beat and gradually add remaining 6 tablespoons sugar (about 1 tablespoon every 15 seconds) until whites hold stiff peaks when beaters are lifted. Swirl meringue equally over yogurt-berry mixture. Set dishes on a 10- by 15-inch baking sheet. Broil about 4 inches from heat until meringue is browned, 30 to 60 seconds. Spoon reserved sugared berries and their juice over meringues. Garnish with mint sprigs.
