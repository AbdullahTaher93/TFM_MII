Preheat an oven to 175 degrees C (350 degrees F). In a small bowl, combine the walnuts and 2 teaspoons of flour. Generously butter 6 ramekins. Sprinkle some of the nut mixture into each ramekin, tipping so that the nuts stick to the bottom and sides. Discard any excess. In a small saucepan, melt the butter and add the remaining flour. Cook 3 minutes over medium heat then add the milk. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, cook 2 minutes, remove from heat and let cool in the pan. Add the Paillot de chevre cheese, egg yolks, salt and pepper and stir well. Set aside on the counter. In a bowl, beat the egg whites until almost stiff. Delicately fold one third at a time into the cheese mixture. Divide the mixture among the 6 ramekins. Cook in a bain-marie (hot water bath) in the middle of the oven for about 25 minutes. Carefully remove the whole pan from the oven and leave the ramekins in the bain-marie for 15 minutes. Run a sharp knife around the edge of each souffle and gently unmold upside-down onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate.* Before serving, preheat the oven to 210 degrees C (425 degrees F). Place the souffles in the middle of the oven and heat until they puff up, about 10 minutes. Serve on a bed of gourmet lettuce that has been tossed with the vinaigrette of your choice.
