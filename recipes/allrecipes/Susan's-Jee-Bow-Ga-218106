Whisk together the sugar, black bean sauce, parsley, green onions, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sherry, sesame oil, vegetable oil, ginger, garlic, and five-spice powder in a bowl, and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator overnight, up to 2 days, turning occasionally. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the chicken from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Weave the chicken tenders onto skewers. Cook the skewered chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
