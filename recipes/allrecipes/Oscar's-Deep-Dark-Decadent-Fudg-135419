In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with paddle attachment, add the flour, sugar, cornstarch and salt. Add the butter and blend until the dough comes together. Line a 9 inch by 12 inch baking sheet with parchment and spray with pan coating. Press the dough into the sheet tray, even and flat. Prick with a fork. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place the baking sheet in the center of the oven and bake 10 minutes. Turn the sheet and bake another 10 to 12 minutes until golden brown. Remove from oven and let cool. Place the pre-baked cookie sheet on a work surface. Melt chocolate in a microwave at 50% for 1 minute. Stir. Continue melting in microwave until the chocolate is completely smooth. Pour into the bowl of a food processor and reserve. In a medium heat proof bowl, add the egg yolks and whip until broken up. In a small saucepan, bring the sugar and water to a boil. While whipping constantly, slowly stream in the hot sugar syrup into the egg yolks, and continue to whip for 30 seconds. With the food processor running, add the yolk mixture to the chocolate, scrape down. Add the sugar, water, milk, Jack Daniels and heavy cream and mix well. Pour over pre-baked shortbread and spread evenly. Refrigerate for 2 hours. Cut into Oscar shapes or 3 x 1-inch rectangles.
