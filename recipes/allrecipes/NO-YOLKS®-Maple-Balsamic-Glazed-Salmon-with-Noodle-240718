Prepare the noodles according to package directions. Add the green beans 4 minutes before draining. Whisk the vinegar with the syrup, mustard, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon (2 mL) each salt and pepper until combined. Whisk in the olive oil until well combined. Measure out and reserve 2 tablespoon (30 mL) of the dressing. Toss the hot cooked noodles and beans with the onion, red pepper, basil and remaining dressing. Meanwhile, lightly coat a nonstick pan with cooking spray and set over medium heat. Season the salmon with the remaining salt and pepper. Add the salmon and cook for 3 to 4 minutes per side or until just a hint of coral remains. Brush salmon with reserved dressing. Serve the noodle mixture topped with a piece of salmon.
