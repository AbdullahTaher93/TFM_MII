Place the ingredients into the pan of a bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Set the pan in the machine and close the lid. Select the Dough cycle, and press start. When the cycle is complete, remove the dough to a lightly floured surface, and press out all of the air. Roll dough up into a tight loaf, and pinch the seam. Place into a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Let rise for about 40 minutes, or until your finger leaves an impression when you poke the bread gently. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake the loaf for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until nicely browned. When done, the loaf should sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.
