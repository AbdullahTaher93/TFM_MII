Preheat oven to 450 degree F. In a large bowl, beat egg with a fork to blend. Add beef, bread crumbs, pine nuts, cumin, cinnamon, pepper, broth, and green onions. Mix well with your hands. Shape mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls. Set meatballs slightly apart in a rimmed 10- by 15-inch baking pan. Bake until no longer pink in center; cut to test (about 12 minutes). While meatballs are baking, cut pocket breads in half crosswise. Wrap in foil and add to oven to warm during last 5 minutes. Fill warm pocket bread halves with hot meatballs. Add yogurt and lettuce to taste.
