Crumble the sausage into a large microwave-safe bowl. Cover; microwave on high for 4-6 minutes or until meat is no longer pink, stirring once; drain. Stir in the spaghetti sauce, onion, green pepper, water, olives and salt. In a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. microwave-safe dish, layer 1-1/3 cups meat sauce, three noodles, 1/2 cup ricotta cheese and 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers. Top with remaining meat sauce. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Cover and microwave at 70% power for 28-32 minutes or until noodles are tender. Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 1-2 minutes or until cheese is melted. Let stand for 5 minutes before cutting.
