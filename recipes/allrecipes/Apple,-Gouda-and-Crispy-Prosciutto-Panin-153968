Heat large nonstick skillet over medium heat and cook prosciutto 8 minutes, turning occasionally, until crispy. Remove from pan and set aside on paper towel. Spread mustard on 4 slices of the bread. Lay a quarter of the apples (about 10 slices) atop the mustard on each bread slice. Top each with a quarter of the prosciutto and Gouda and 1 slice of the remaining bread. Lightly coat both sides of sandwiches with cooking spray. Heat same skillet over medium heat and toast sandwiches 4 to 5 minutes per side, pressing down with spatula often, until golden brown on both sides and cheese is melted.
