Toast the sesame seeds in a skillet over medium-low heat until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Spread onto a baking sheet to cool. Heat 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil in the skillet, again over medium-low heat. Fry the red chile peppers in the hot oil until they begin to change color, about 5 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet. Use a mortar and pestle to grind the sesame seeds, chile peppers, and salt into a powder. Nuvvu podi will keep for a few months on the shelf.
