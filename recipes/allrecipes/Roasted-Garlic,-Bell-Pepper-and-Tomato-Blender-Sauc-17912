Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place whole unpeeled head of garlic in an oven-safe dish with 1/4 cup water and drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil on garlic. Roast in preheated oven for about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, put tomatoes in a blender and blend until pureed. Add bell peppers and blend until pureed. Break roasted cloves of garlic and squeeze 5 cloves into blender; blend in garlic. Add 4 tablespoons olive oil and blend briefly. Add salt and pepper to taste, dried red pepper flakes and basil; blend. The sauce is ready, but can either be refrigerated for a couple of days to blend the flavors or can be frozen. Sauce can be served cold or heated up until just warm.
