Melt butter in a 4-cup measuring cup or a medium bowl in the microwave. Stir in flour, salt and pepper. Whisk in milk, then cheese, until combined. Cook in microwave for 2 minutes on High; stir. Cook for another 1-1/2 to 2 minutes until mixture becomes a smooth, thickened sauce. Whisk egg yolks until blended. Add a little of the sauce to the yolks; stir thoroughly. Stir yolk mixture back into the sauce. Beat egg whites until stiff. Fold egg yolk/sauce mixture gently into beaten egg whites just until combined. (Mixture does not have to be completely blended.) Spoon or pour into four lightly greased 1-cup straight-sided ramekins or souffle dishes. Bake in a preheated 325 degrees F (160 degrees C) oven until puffed and golden brown, about 20 minutes. Serve immediately.
