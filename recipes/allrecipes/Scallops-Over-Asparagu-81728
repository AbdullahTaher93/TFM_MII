Steam asparagus for about 3 minutes. Remove from heat but leave covered until the scallops are done. Meanwhile, in a non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat, add the oil and quick fry the scallops about 30-60 seconds per side. Transfer to a plate. Add the garlic and scallions and saute for about 1 minute. Add the sherry and stir, let the alcohol cook off (about 30 seconds) then add the cream, lemon extract and salt and pepper and cook for about 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat, add the scallops and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Place the asparagus on individual plates. Spoon the scallops over the asparagus with plenty of the sauce. Serve at once garnished with lemon zest curls and chives.
