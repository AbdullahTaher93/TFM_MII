Wash potatoes and pierce potato skin several times with a knife. Place potatoes on paper towels and microwave on high power for 10 minutes or until soft.* Cut 8, 12-inch squares of heavy duty aluminum foil. Slice potatoes in half and scoop out small portion of potato to make a narrow boat, reserving the scooped out potato. Place one potato half on each foil square. Mix baked beans, peaches, onion, bacon and reserved sweet potato into a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Place mixture in potatoes. Bring up top and bottom edges of foil, leaving a little space for steam expansion during cooking. Seal potatoes in foil and place on the grill. Cook 20 minutes over indirect heat, or until warmed throughout.
