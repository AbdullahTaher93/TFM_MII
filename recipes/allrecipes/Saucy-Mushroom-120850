In a nonstick skillet, stir-fry mushrooms in oil for 2 minutes. Combine 1/4 cup water, soy sauce and sugar; pour over mushrooms and toss to coat. Cook and stir for 1-2 minutes. Combine cornstarch and remaining water until smooth; gradually stir into mushrooms. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened.
