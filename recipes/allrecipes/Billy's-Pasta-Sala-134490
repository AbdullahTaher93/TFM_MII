Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain, and rinse with cold water to cool. Stir together chicken, celery, onion, and mayonnaise; fold in cold pasts, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Place in refrigerator, and let rest for at least an hour before serving.
