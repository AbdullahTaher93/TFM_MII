WASH and dry apples. Remove stems, and insert wooden craft sticks into stem ends of apples. Set aside. COOK caramels and 1/3 cup water in a large saucepan over low to medium heat until smooth, stirring frequently. Remove from heat. DIP apples into hot caramel, spooning caramel mixture over apples to coat completely. Scrape excess caramel from bottom of each apple; roll coated apples in crushed pretzels, and place on greased wax paper-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate at least 15 minutes or until caramel is set. SPOON chocolate frosting into a small heavy-duty, zip-top plastic bag; seal bag. Submerge bag in a small saucepan of hot water until frosting is thin enough to pipe. SNIP a tiny hole in 1 corner of bag, using scissors. Drizzle warm chocolate in a webbed design over each apple. Repeat heating and drizzling procedure with vanilla frosting. CHILL apples until firm. Wrap apples in cellophane wrap, and tie with heavy string.
