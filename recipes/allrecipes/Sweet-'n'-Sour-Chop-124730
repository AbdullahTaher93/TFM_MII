In a saucepan over medium heat, combine butter, sugar, cornstarch and salt. Add pineapple juice, vinegar, soy sauce, Worcestershire and liquid smoke; mix well. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Cook for 2 minutes or until thickened. Pour the soda into a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. glass baking dish. Add 1/2 cup of the sauce; mix well. Add chops and turn to coat; cover and refrigerate overnight. Cover and refrigerate remaining sauce. Remove chops, discarding marinade. Grill chops, covered, over hot coals for 10-15 minutes per side or until juices run clear or the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Heat reserved sauce and serve over chops.
