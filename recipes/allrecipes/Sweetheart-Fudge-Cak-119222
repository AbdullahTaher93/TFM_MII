Grease and flour two 9-in. heart-shaped or round baking pans. Prepare cake mix according to package directions; stir in vanilla. Pour into prepared pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 15 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. While cakes are still warm, poke several holes in cakes with a wooden skewer to within 1/4 in. of bottom. Brush jelly over top and sides of cakes. In a small saucepan, combine cream and chocolate; cook and stir over low heat until chocolate is melted. Brush over top and sides of cakes several times, allowing mixture to absorb between brushings. Cool completely. In a mixing bowl, beat frosting until fluffy; fold in whipped topping. Place one cake on a serving plate; spread with frosting. Top with second cake; spread remaining frosting over top and sides. Garnish with raspberries. Refrigerate for 2 hours before cutting.
