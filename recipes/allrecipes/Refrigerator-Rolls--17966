Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat. Mix in the shortening and sugar; stir until melted. Let cool until lukewarm. In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. In a large bowl, combine the cooled milk mixture and the yeast mixture. Stir in eggs and flour; beat well. Cover bowl with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled; about 1 hour. Stir batter to deflate. Cover bowl and refrigerate several hours or overnight. Pour batter onto a lightly floured surface and roll out to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut rolls into desired shape and place on lightly greased baking sheet. Brush with melted butter and let rise until doubled; about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown.
