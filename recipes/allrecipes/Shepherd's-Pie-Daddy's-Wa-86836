Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place the potatoes into a large saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until tender. Drain, and mash. While the potatoes are cooking, crumble the ground beef into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until evenly browned. Drain off the grease, then stir in the golden mushroom soup. Transfer to an 8 inch square baking dish, and place the slices of cheese over the meat. Spread the mashed potatoes evenly over the top. Dot with butter. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top is golden brown.
