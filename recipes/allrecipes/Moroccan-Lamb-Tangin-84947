Season lamb with salt and pepper, one-half the cumin and one-half the coriander. Meanwhile, heat large skillet with olive oil until smoking. Carefully add lamb and sear evenly until golden; drain and reserve. To the pan, add garlic, onions, carrots, remaining cumin, coriander and curry. Cook until fragrant. Then add tomatoes, paste, brown sugar, bay leaves, cinnamon, chicken and lamb stock. Transfer everything into a large pot and bring to a simmer. While simmering adjust the salt, pepper and brown sugar to taste. Add the lamb, cover tightly and place in preheated 300 degrees F oven. Cook slowly until lamb is tender, about 2 hours. Serve hot with steamed couscous and California raisins.
