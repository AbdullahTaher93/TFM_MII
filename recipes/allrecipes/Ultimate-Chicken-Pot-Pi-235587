Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line the bottom of a 9-inch pie plate with 1 pie crust. Trim any excess. Stir the soup, milk, chicken and vegetables in a medium bowl. Spoon the chicken mixture into the pie plate. Sprinkle with 3/4 cup cheese. Place the remaining pie crust over the filling. Trim any excess. Crimp the edges of the top and bottom crusts together. Using a sharp knife, cut several slits in the top crust. Bake for 35 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Sprinkle the crust with the remaining cheese.
