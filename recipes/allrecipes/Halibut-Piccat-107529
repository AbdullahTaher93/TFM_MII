Heat the oil and 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season pieces of halibut with salt and pepper and dredge in flour. Fry the halibut until golden brown on both sides and fish flakes easily with a fork, about 6 to 7 minutes total. Remove pan from heat; transfer fish to 4 dinner plates and keep warm. Return pan to heat; pour the wine into the hot empty skillet and use a spatula to scrape any browned bits from the bottom. Let the wine reduce by half, then stir in the garlic, remaining butter and capers. Let sauce simmer for a minute to blend the flavors. Pour sauce over fish and serve.
