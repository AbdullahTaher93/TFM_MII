To make brownies, in a large microwave-safe bowl, heat chocolate and butter in the microwave on high (100%) for 11/2 to 3 minutes or until melted. Cool slightly. Stir in brown and granulated sugars. Add eggs and stir well until incorporated. Stir in vanilla, flour, salt, and chocolate chips. Line an 8-inch square baking pan with heavy-duty foil, letting the ends extend at least an inch over the edge. Spray or grease the foil. Pour batter into the pan. Drizzle 1/2 cup caramel sauce over the batter and swirl with a knife. Sprinkle nuts over top. In a 350 degrees F oven, bake 30 to 35 minutes or until edges pull away from sides of pan and middle jiggles slightly. The center will appear soft, but will firm up as it cools. Cool to room temperature. Lift foil with brownies to flat surface. Cut into 9 squares (about 21/2 in. each). To assemble, place a brownie in center of dessert plate. Top with a scoop of ice cream. Drizzle with caramel sauce and fudge sauce, if desired.
