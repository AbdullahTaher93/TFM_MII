Heat the oven to 450 degrees F. In a large frying pan, cook the sausage over moderate heat, breaking it up with a fork or wooden spoon, until cooked through and just beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Brush the sun-dried-tomato oil over the pizza shells. Spread the sausage over the pizza shells. Scatter the sun-dried tomatoes over the sausage, put the fontina on top, and sprinkle the Parmesan over all. Bake the pizzas, directly on the oven rack (for a crisper crust) or on two baking sheets, until the cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.
