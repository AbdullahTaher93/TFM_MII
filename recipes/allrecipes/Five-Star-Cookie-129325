Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Mix the chopped hazelnuts, sunflower seeds, apricots, and dates together in a bowl. Add the sugar, barley flakes, flour, and baking soda, and stir to combine. Mix together the canola oil and apple juice, and pour over the dry mixture. Stir until the dry ingredients are just moistened. Drop the batter by rounded teaspoonfuls onto a baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Using the back of a fork dipped in flour, gently flatten each ball and neaten the edges with your fingers. Bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and cool. These can be kept in an airtight container for up to 4 days.
