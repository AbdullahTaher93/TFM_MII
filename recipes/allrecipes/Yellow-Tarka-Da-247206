Place split peas in a container. Cover with water. Let soak, at least 2 hours. Drain. Combine split peas and red lentils in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Pour in enough water to cover by 2 inches. Season with turmeric, sea salt, and asafoetida. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, until dal is the consistency of porridge. Heat ghee and oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and cumin; cook until starting to pop, about 30 seconds. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring constantly, until tarka is very dark brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve tarka over dal.
