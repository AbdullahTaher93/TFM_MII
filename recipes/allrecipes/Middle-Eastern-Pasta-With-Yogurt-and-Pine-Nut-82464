Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Meanwhile, heat the corn oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the beef and cook until well browned, stirring frequently to break apart, about 7 minutes. Add the pine nuts, and cook for another minute until dark brown. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then remove from the heat, and drain off excess fat. In a large bowl, crush the garlic into a smooth paste. Whisk the yogurt with the garlic until creamy and smooth. Once the pasta has been cooked and drained, place into a serving dish, and pour the yogurt over it. Top with the cooked meat and nuts while it is still hot.
