Whisk mayonnaise, Marsala wine, basil, paprika, garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, celery salt, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add pork chops, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight. Preheat grill to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and lightly oil the grates. Remove the pork chops from marinade and shake to remove excess moisture. Cook pork chops on the preheated grill, basting with marinade every 15 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 30 to 40 minutes.
