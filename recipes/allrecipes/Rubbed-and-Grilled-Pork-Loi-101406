Place boneless pork loin on large cutting board or platter; brush oil over all sides. Set aside. Meanwhile, stir together dry rub seasoning. Rub over pork to cover. Prepare charcoal grill to cook over direct and indirect heat. Place pork loin over medium-hot coals (direct heat) or on medium-hot (about 400 degrees F.) gas grill. Cook for 10 minutes on each side to brown. Move pork to area on grill over indirect heat. Cook, covered for 70-90 minutes or until internal temperature on a thermometer reads 145 degrees F.

Cook, covered for 70-90 minutes or until internal temperature on a thermometer reads 145 degrees F. Remove roast from heat; let rest about 10 minutes. Serve with your favorite sauce.
