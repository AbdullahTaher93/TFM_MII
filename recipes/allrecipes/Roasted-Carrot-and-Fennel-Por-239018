Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Rub pork loin with honey mustard and thyme. Combine carrots, fennel, and onion in a 9x13-inch baking dish; season with salt and pepper. Roast vegetables in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Nestle the pork loin in the center of the vegetables and cook until pork is cooked through, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Thinly slice the pork loin to serve.
