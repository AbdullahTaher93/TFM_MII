Rinse eggplant; trim off and discard stems. Cut eggplant into 1/2-in. cubes. In a 5- to 6-qt. pan over high heat, combine eggplant, garlic, onion, 1 cup of the broth, and 4 tbsp. of the basil. Cover and bring to a boil. Boil, stirring often, until eggplant mashes easily when pressed, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, in a 4- to 5-qt. pan over medium-high heat, bring pasta sauce and remaining broth to boiling, stirring often. Add tortellini and stir often until pasta is barely tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in jack cheese and 6 tbsp. parmesan cheese. Butter sides and bottom of a 9-in. cheesecake pan with removable rim. Dust pan with bread crumbs. Spoon 1/2 of the tortellini mixture into pan and spread level. Top tortellini with eggplant, spread level, then add remaining tortellini and spread level. If making ahead, cover and chill up to one day. Bake, covered with foil, in a 350 degrees F oven for 20 minutes (50 minutes if chilled). Uncover and bake until hot in center (about 130 degrees F on a thermometer), 10 to 15 minutes longer. Let stand 10 minutes. Run a knife between pan rim and pasta; remove pan rim. Sprinkle pie with remaining parmesan cheese and basil. Cut into wedges.
