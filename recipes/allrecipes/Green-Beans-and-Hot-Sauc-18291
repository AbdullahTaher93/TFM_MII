Place green beans, onions, tomatoes, banana peppers, bell pepper, and water in a large pot. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low. Cover pot and simmer approximately 10 minutes, until green beans are tender. While green beans are steaming, arrange bacon slices in a medium skillet. Fry over medium heat until crispy, approximately 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Crumble and set aside. Spoon green bean mixture and juice into a serving dish. Sprinkle crumbled bacon over top and serve immediately.
