In a bowl, combine flour and sugar; cut in butter until crumbly. Set aside 1/2 cup for topping. Add baking soda, cinnamon and cloves to the remaining crumb mixture. Stir in buttermilk and egg just until moistened. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Sprinkle with reserved topping. Bake at 375 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool. Serve warm.
