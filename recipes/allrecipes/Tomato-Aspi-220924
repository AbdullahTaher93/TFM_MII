Fully dissolve gelatin in boiling water in a mixing bowl. Combine vegetable juice, worcestershire sauce, bay leaf, and cloves in a saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer 10 minutes. Remove and discard the bay leaf and cloves. Stir onion and celery into vegetable juice. Pour vegetable juice mixture over dissolved gelatin; stir gently to blend. Refrigerate until set completely, about 1 hour.
