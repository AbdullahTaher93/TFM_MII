In a bowl with a mixer on medium speed, beat cream cheese, 1 cup butter, 1/4 cup of the brown sugar, salt, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon to blend well. Add 2 cups flour, mix in at lowest speed, then beat on medium speed to blend well. Scrape dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide into quarters. Set each dough quarter on a sheet of plastic wrap, pat to make a 3/4-inch-thick round, wrap airtight, and chill 2 hours. Remove dough and let stand at room temperature 10 minutes before using. Meanwhile, in bowl, mix remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon with raisins and walnuts, if using; if making ahead, cover airtight until ready to use. Using 1 quarter of dough at a time, unwrap and roll on a lightly floured board into a 9-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick. With the back of a spoon, spread each round evenly with 1 tablespoon raspberry jam, then sprinkle evenly with 1/4 of the raisin mixture. With a flour-dusted sharp knife, cut each round into 12 equal wedges. Starting at the wide end of each wedge, roll up snugly to the tip. Place each rolled rugelach, tip side down; bend each roll slightly to make a crescent. Place cookies about 1 inch apart on buttered or cooking parchment-lined 12-by 15-inch baking sheets. Brush cookies lightly with milk and sprinkle equally with sugar. Bake cookies in a 375 degrees F oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes; if baking two sheets at once in one oven, switch their positions halfway through. Let cookies cool on sheets for 5 minutes, then use a spatula to transfer to racks to cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature up to 3 days.
