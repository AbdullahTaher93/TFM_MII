Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9 x13-inch (33 x 23 cm) lasagna pan lightly with oil. Saute onions and garlic in oil over medium heat. Set aside to cool. In a bowl mix ricotta cheese or tofu with salt, pepper, oregano, flour, spinach and sauteed onions. In another bowl mix Veggie Ground Round with 3 cups tomato sauce. Layering: Spread 1/2 cup of the reserved tomato sauce on the bottom of pan and set 3 lasagna noodles in the sauce. Cover noodles with half of the Veggie Ground Round mixture and 1 cup of shredded cheese. Arrange 3 noodles on top followed by the spinach mixture. Spread on remaining Veggie Ground Round mixture followed by 1 cup of shredded cheese. Place the last 3 lasagna noodles on top and cover with the rest of the tomato sauce. Top lasagna with remaining shredded cheese. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes or until the noodles are tender.
