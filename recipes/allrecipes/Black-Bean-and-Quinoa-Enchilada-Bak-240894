Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, yellow bell pepper, orange bell pepper, jalapeno pepper, and garlic in the hot oil until softened, about 10 minutes. Mix black beans, pepper mixture, quinoa, cilantro, chili powder, lime juice, cumin, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; transfer to a casserole dish. Pour enchilada sauce over quinoa mixture, spreading sauce evenly over the top. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over sauce. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until cheese is bubbling, 10 to 15 minutes.
