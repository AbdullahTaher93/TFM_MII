In a small saucepan, combine water, dates, prunes and raisins. Cook over medium heat until fruit is softened, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat; add margarine and stir until melted. Cool. Stir in egg substitute and vanilla; mix well. Combine dry ingredients in a large bowl; stir in fruit mixture. Spread into an 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking pan that has been coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
