In a jar with a tight fitting lid, combine the oil, vinegar, garlic, basil, oregano, rosemary, dry mustard, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper. Shake well and refrigerate for 24 hours. Halve squash lengthwise and scoop out seeds. Place halves cut side down in a large saucepan; add water to a depth of two inches; cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer squash 20 minutes. Drain off water; cool squash and shred into strands. In a large bowl, combine the squash, mushrooms, green bell peppers, red bell peppers, olives and avocados. Pour vinaigrette over, toss gently to coat and serve.
