Place marinade, peanuts, soy sauce and crushed red pepper in blender container; cover. Blend until smooth. Pour into large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken breasts; seal bag. Turn bag over several times to evenly coat chicken with marinade mixture. Refrigerate at least 4 hours to marinate. Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Remove chicken from marinade; discard marinade. Grill chicken 5 minutes on each side or until cooked through. Shred chicken, using 2 forks. Mix cucumbers, onions and cilantro until well blended. Spoon about 1/2 cup of the chicken onto each tortilla; top with 1 tablespoon of the cucumber mixture. Roll up.
