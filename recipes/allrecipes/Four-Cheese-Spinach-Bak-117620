In a large bowl, combine the eggs, cottage cheese, ricotta cheese, flour and salt if desired. Add the remaining ingredients; mix well. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting.
