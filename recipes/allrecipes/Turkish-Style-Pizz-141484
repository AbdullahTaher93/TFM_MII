Place a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet on the lowest oven rack; preheat oven to 500 degrees F or highest setting. Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray and dust with cornmeal. Prepare Whole-Wheat Pizza Dough, if using. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 15-by-10-inch oval. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Turn edges under to make a slight rim. Brush the rim with 1 teaspoon oil. Sprinkle cheese over the crust, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Top with tomatoes, onion, jalapeno and pastrami, if using. Season with pepper. Drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Place the baking sheet on the heated pizza stone (or baking sheet) and bake the pizza until the bottom is crisp and golden, 10 to 14 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately.
