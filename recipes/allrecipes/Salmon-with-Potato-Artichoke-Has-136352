Preheat oven to 475 degrees F. In an 11-by-15- by-2 3/4-inch roasting pan, toss together potatoes, artichokes, thyme, 1/2 teaspoon oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Arrange vegetables around sides of pan. Place salmon pieces in center of pan, and press them together to form one long piece (see note). Coat with remaining 1/2 teaspoon oil, and sprinkle all over with salt and pepper. Roast, turning the vegetables once, until lightly browned and tender and salmon is just cooked through, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make sauce: Stir together 1/2 teaspoon salt, a pinch pepper, parsley, mustard, vinegar, and 1 tablespoon water. Gently separate salmon pieces, top with parsley sauce. Serve with vegetables.
