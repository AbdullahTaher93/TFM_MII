Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Core apples to within 1/2 inch (1 cm) of the bottoms. In a cup, mix walnuts and raisins. Fill the cored apples with the mixture and place in a 9 x 13-inch (3.5-L) baking dish. In a small saucepan, combine the water, honey, and cinnamon. Place over medium heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice. Remove cinnamon and pour syrup over apples. Bake, uncovered, until apples are tender, about 45 minutes, basting occasionally with the pan juices.
