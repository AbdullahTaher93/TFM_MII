Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place sweet potatoes cut-side down on a baking sheet. Coat with 1 teaspoon oil and 1 pinch salt. Roast potatoes in the preheated oven until tender, turning halfway through, about 25 minutes. Heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil in a heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, garlic, red curry paste, ginger, and lemon zest. Cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Stir chickpeas into the pot. Increase heat to high; cook until chickpeas start to turn golden and are coated with the onion mixture. Pour in lemon juice, coconut milk, and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer; reduce heat and cook until flavors combine, about 10 minutes. Stir in kale, 1 handful at a time, until wilted, about 5 minutes. Serve chickpea mixture over roasted sweet potatoes.
