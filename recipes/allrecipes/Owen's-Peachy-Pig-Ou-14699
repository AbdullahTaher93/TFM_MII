Rub chili peppers into pork chops; cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. In a microwave safe casserole dish, arrange chops in a single layer. Microwave on High for 5 minutes. In a measuring cup, mix together peach juice, brown sugar, salt, and soy sauce; pour over chops. Microwave on Medium for 4 minutes. Transfer chops to another dish, and cover. Add sliced onions, peaches, and spring onions to the drippings left in the casserole dish. Stir in flour until smooth. Microwave on High for 30 seconds, and then stir well. Continue cooking in 30 second intervals for 2 minutes total cooking time, or until gravy has the desired consistency. Pour over chops, and serve. I
