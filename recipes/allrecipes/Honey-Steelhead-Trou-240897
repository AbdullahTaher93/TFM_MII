Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place trout, skin-side down, onto the prepared baking sheet. Cover trout with honey and sprinkle mesquite seasoning, black pepper, and seasoned salt over honey. Press honey and seasonings into trout using a fork. Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes.
