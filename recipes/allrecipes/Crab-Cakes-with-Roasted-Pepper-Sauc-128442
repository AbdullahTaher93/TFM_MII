To make the sauce: Puree the red peppers in a food processor or blender. Add the mayonnaise and black pepper. Process briefly to combine. Transfer to a small bowl. To make the crab cakes: Warm the oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions and celery. Cook for 5 minutes, or until soft. Transfer to a large bowl. Stir in the egg white, crackers, parsley, mayonnaise, lemon juice, crab boil seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, celery seeds, and paprika. Blend with a fork. Stir in the crabmeat and hot-pepper sauce. Mix thoroughly. Form into 8 patties. Roll in the bread crumbs to coat completely. Place a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Coat with nonstick spray. Add the crab cakes and cook for 2 minutes; cover and cook for 1 minute, or until browned on the bottom. Coat the tops with nonstick spray and turn over. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, uncovered, or until golden brown. Serve with the sauce.
