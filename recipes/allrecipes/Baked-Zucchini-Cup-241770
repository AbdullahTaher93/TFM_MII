Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Mix shredded zucchini with the Ragu(R) Old World Style(R) Traditional Sauce until coated. Add salt and pepper as desired. Portion into individual 1 1/2-cup Mason jars or small ramekins. Add 1/4 cup of the shredded cheese on top of each. Top with a basil leaf spritzed with olive oil, if desired. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until cheese is lightly browned. Let cool until individual containers have cooled enough to handle. Serve!
