Melt butter in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the celery, bell pepper, green onion, carrot, and garlic. Continue to cook and stir until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes more. Season with 1 tablespoon parsley flakes, 2 teaspoons Creole seasoning, basil, pepper, dill weed, oregano, and thyme. Cook and stir until fragrant, 5 minutes more. Transfer cooked vegetables to a large bowl; allow to cool for about 10 minutes. Set skillet aside for later use. Stir the beaten eggs into the vegetables. Mix in the crabmeat and cracker crumbs with your hands, making sure not to break up the chunks of crab too much. Shape the crab mixture into 12 small cakes. Heat vegetable oil in the skillet over medium high heat. Pan-fry the crab cakes in batches until golden brown on each side, about 3 minutes. To make dipping sauce: Whisk together the mayonnaise, chile-garlic sauce, 2 teaspoon Creole seasoning, 2 teaspoon parsley flakes, and paprika.
