In a 3 1/2- to 4-quart pan, bring about 2 quarts water to boil over high heat. Meanwhile, in a 2-to3-quart pan, combine chicken broth, wine, and lemon peel; cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and keep broth mixture warm. Stir pasta into the 2 quarts boiling water and cook, uncovered, until just tender to bite (8 to 10 minutes), or cook pasta according to package directions. Stir peas into pasta, cook for 1 more minute, then drain pasta and peas well. Add pasta and peas to broth mixture along with artichokes, shrimp, and all but 2 tablespoons of the cheese; mix lightly. Spoon pasta into a serving bowl or individual plates, then sprinkle with remaining cheese.
