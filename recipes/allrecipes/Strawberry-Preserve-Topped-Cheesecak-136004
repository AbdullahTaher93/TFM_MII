Preheat oven to 325 degrees F if using a silver 9-inch springform pan (or to 300 degrees F if using a dark nonstick 9-inch springform pan). Mix crumbs, 3 Tbsp. sugar and butter; press firmly onto bottom of pan. Bake 10 minutes. Beat cream cheese and 3/4 cup sugar in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Add eggs, 1 at a time, mixing on low speed after each addition just until blended. Add vanilla; mix well. Pour over crust. Bake 50 to 55 minutes or until center is almost set. (Bake 45 to 50 minutes or until center is almost set if using a dark nonstick springform pan.) Run knife or metal spatula around rim of pan to loosen cake; cool before removing rim of pan. Refrigerate 4 hours or overnight. Top with preserves just before serving. Store leftover cheesecake in refrigerator.
