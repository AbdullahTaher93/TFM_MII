Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add spaghetti sauce and garlic powder. Mix rice, eggs, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Mix 2 cups mozzarella cheese, cottage cheese, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese in another bowl. Spread half the rice mixture in a 3-quart baking dish, followed by half the cheese mixture and half the meat sauce. Repeat layers. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese over the final layer of meat sauce. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes.
