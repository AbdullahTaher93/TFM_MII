In a blender, combine the oil, juice of 6 lemons, onion, chopped oregano, 6 garlic cloves and pepper. Blend until smooth and season with salt, if desired. Place baste in a squeeze bottle or small mixing bowl and set aside. Prepare outdoor grill for cooking by the indirect heat method. Remove giblets and neck from neck and body cavities, rinse and juices and dry turkey with paper towels. Turn wings back to hold neck skin in place. Untuck legs. Loosen skin over breast and legs of turkey by gently sliding hand under skin. Slice one lemon and 2 garlic cloves. Place under turkey skin with half of oregano. Return legs to the tucked position. Cut remaining lemon into quarters. Place the quartered lemon, garlic and oregano in the cavity of the turkey. Squeeze or spoon a portion of the baste onto the turkey and place turkey, breast up, on cook grate over drip pan. Cover grill. Throughout grilling, apply baste once every hour. Cook turkey to an internal thigh temperature of 180 degrees F and a breast temperature of 170 degrees F on a meat thermometer, approximately 2-1/2 to 3-1/4 hours. Remove from grill and let turkey stand 15 to 20 minutes before carving.
