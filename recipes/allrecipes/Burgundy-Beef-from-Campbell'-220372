Heat the butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook until well browned, stirring often. Pour off any fat. Stir the gravy, carrots, onions, tomato paste, wine and garlic powder in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the beef is cooked through. Serve the beef mixture over the noodles. Sprinkle with the parsley.
