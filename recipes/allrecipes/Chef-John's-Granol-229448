Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone liner. Combine brown sugar, maple syrup, oil, and salt in a bowl. Add oats, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and coconut. Mix well, making sure all ingredients are coated evenly. Pour onto prepared baking sheet and distribute in an even layer. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour, stirring every 10 to 15 minutes lightly with the tines of a fork so mixture toasts evenly and granola is golden brown. Pour into a bowl and, while mixture is still hot, mix in currants. Cool. Store in an airtight container until ready to use.
