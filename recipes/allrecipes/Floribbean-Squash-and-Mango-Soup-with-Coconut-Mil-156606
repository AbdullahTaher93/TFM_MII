Soup may be prepared in slow cooker, microwave, or on stovetop. Combine squash, coconut milk and mango nectar in cooking container of your choice. Heat until serving temperature, stirring occasionally. Begin seasoning with 3 to 4 teaspoons of the Chesapeake type seasoning of your choice. Initially, soup may taste somewhat sweet, but this will change with additional seasoning. Add Quatre Epice if available (mixture of pepper and warm spices) or pumpkin pie seasoning, if desired. Continue adding Chesapeake type seasoning to reach the spicy level of your choice. At this point, salt to taste if needed (may not be required). Combine yogurt and ginger to dollop on each serving. Garnish with snipped chives or other herb.
