Mince together the 1/4 cup mint, orange peel, and lemon peel; set aside. In a small bowl, stir together orange juice concentrate and lemon juice. Rinse fish and pat dry. In a wide frying pan with an ovenproof handle, melt butter over medium-high heat. When butter sizzles, add fish, skin side down. Cook until skin is well browned and crisp (about 7 minutes). Gently slide a spatula under skin of each fillet to release it from pan, but leave fish in pan. Brush fish with about a fourth of the orange juice mixture. Leaving fish in pan, broil it about 4 inches below heat until just opaque but still moist in thickest part; cut to test (3 to 4 minutes). With a wide spatula, transfer fish to individual plates or a platter. Keep warm. Add remaining orange juice mixture to frying pan and stir to blend with pan drippings. Then return pan to broiler just until sauce is bubbly (about 4 minutes). Pour sauce over fish; sprinkle with mint mixture. Garnish with mint sprigs, if desired.
