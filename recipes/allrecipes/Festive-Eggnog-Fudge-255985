Line a 9-inch square baking pan with aluminum foil, leaving an overhang on both sides. Grease aluminum foil with 1 teaspoon butter. Combine sugar, eggnog, and 1/2 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Boil for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Add vanilla candy pieces and marshmallow cream; mix until smooth. Stir in rum extract. Pour sugar mixture into the prepared baking pan. Sprinkle nutmeg lightly on top. Cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Score fudge into 36 pieces. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Lift up the ends of aluminum foil to remove fudge from the pan. Cut through scored lines with a large knife.
