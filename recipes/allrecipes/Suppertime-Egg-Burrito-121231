In a nonstick skillet, saute mushrooms, onion and green pepper in oil until tender. Remove and keep warm. In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs, egg substitute, cream cheese, salt and pepper. Pour into the same skillet; cook and stir over medium heat until the eggs are completely set. Stir in sauteed vegetables. Spoon about 1/2 cup down the center of each tortilla; top with cheddar cheese and salsa. Fold ends and sides over filling. Serve immediately.
