In a 2-quart glass measuring cup, combine evaporated milk, granulated and brown sugars, and butter. Cook the mixture, uncovered, in a microwave oven on full power (100%), stirring once or twice after mixture is hot enough to dissolve sugars, about 2 minutes; then cook until mixture boils and bubbles vigorously, 2 or 3 minutes. Continue to boil for 4 minutes. Using a pot holder to protect hands, lift cup from oven and quickly add chocolate and stir until melted. As soon as chocolate melts, quickly add marshmallow creme, peanut butter, and vanilla and stir until well mixed; scrape into a buttered 8-inch-square pan. Let fudge stand until pan is cool enough to touch, then cover fudge with foil and put in the refrigerator until firm, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cut into 1-inch squares.
