Microwave bacon slice per package directions. Heat oil in small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add egg substitute and heat until edges begin to set, about 1 minute. Lift edges to allow any liquid egg to flow underneath, about 1 minute longer. When almost set, gently fold omelet in half and in half again. Transfer to bottom half of muffin and top with bacon. Return pan to heat, add spinach, and cook, stirring until wilted, about 1 minute. Place spinach on top of bacon, season with freshly ground black pepper, add cheese, and top with other muffin half.
