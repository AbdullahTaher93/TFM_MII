Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat, cook the onion until translucent. Stir in the garlic and chili flakes; cook until the garlic has begun to soften, about 1 minute. Add the carrots, tomatoes, artichokes, garbanzo beans, and chicken broth. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to low and simmer until the carrots are tender. Season with sage, lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes more to meld the flavors.
