Sprinkle chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. In 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat. Cook chicken in butter about 8 minutes, until browned, turning once. Add cooking sauce to skillet; heat to boiling. Reduce heat; simmer uncovered 5 minutes; stirring occasionally or until until juice of chicken is no longer pink when centers of thickest parts are cut (at least 165 degrees F). Stir in 1/2 cup of the cheese until melted. Arrange ham slices on top of chicken; sprinkle with remaining cheese. Cover. Remove from heat; let stand 2 to 5 minutes or until cheese is melted. Serve with pasta. Sprinkle with parsley.
