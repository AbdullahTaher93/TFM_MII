Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. Place the flour in a small bowl and the cornflakes in a medium bowl. In a separate small bowl, mix the honey and milk. Dredge chicken in the flour, dip in the honey mixture, and thoroughly coat with the cornflakes. Arrange chicken in the prepared baking dish. Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until no longer pink and juices run clear.
