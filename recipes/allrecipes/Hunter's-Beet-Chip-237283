Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Spread beets out in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Brush beets on both sides with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Turn beets and continue cooking until crisp, another 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer chips to a wire rack to cool.
