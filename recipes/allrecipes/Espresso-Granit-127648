Mix all ingredients except whipped cream in 3x9-inch metal baking pan; stir until sugar melts. Place on level shelf in freezer for 30 minutes. (Mixture should only come about 1/4 inch up the side of pan). Remove from freezer and use a dinner fork to scrape any ice crystals that have formed on the side or bottom of the pan. Return to freezer and repeat scraping every 20 to 30 minutes for 3 to 4 hours. Once mixture is thoroughly frozen, fluff with fork. When served, the granita should look like a fluffy pile of dry brown crystals. Scoop into serving dishes; top with whipped cream.
