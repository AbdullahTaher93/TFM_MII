Heat a 5-quart soup pot over medium-low heat; add olive oil and heat for 1 minute. Add onions and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add apple, squash, thyme, bay leaf, nutmeg and enough water to cover ingredients. Turn heat to medium high and cook for 15-18 minutes, stirring occasionally, until squash is tender. Stir in Pure Almond and heat through. Remove from heat, remove thyme stems and bay leaf and allow mixture to cool for 5 minutes. In two to three separate batches, puree soup in a blender or food processor until smooth and creamy. Return to saucepan and reheat. Add nutmeg and lemon juice and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve in warm bowls garnished with toasted sliced almonds.
