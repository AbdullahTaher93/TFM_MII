Toss strawberries with sugar; let stand 10 min. or until sugar is dissolved. Meanwhile, cut each slice of pound cake in half horizontally. Place 1 cake piece on each of 12 dessert plates. Spoon about 1/4 cup of the strawberries over each cake piece; top with 2 Tbsp. of the whipped topping. Repeat layers.
