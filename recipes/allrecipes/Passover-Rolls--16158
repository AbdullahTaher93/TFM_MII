Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a cookie sheet. In a large mixing bowl, combine matzo meal, salt, and sugar. Mix well. Bring water and oil to a boil. Pour the boiling water over the matzo meal mixture, and stir until blended. Beat one egg at a time into the mixture. Let stand 15 minutes. Shape the dough into rolls with oiled hands. Arrange rolls on the prepared cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 50 minutes.
