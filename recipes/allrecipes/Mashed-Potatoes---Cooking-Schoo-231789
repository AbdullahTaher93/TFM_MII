Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with 2 to 3 inches of cold water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer the potatoes until tender, 15 to 25 minutes. A paring knife should insert easily into a potato. Heat milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until warm, about 5 minutes. Drain potatoes and return them to the saucepan. Place the saucepan over high heat and cook until any excess moisture evaporates, about 30 seconds. Mash the potatoes with a hand masher until mostly smooth. Pour warm milk into the mashed potatoes and stir until combined. Add butter and stir until melted. Season with salt to taste.
