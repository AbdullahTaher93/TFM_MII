In a saucepan, melt the butter and blue cheese over low heat. Unroll dough and cut each breadstick into six pieces; place in a foil-lined 11-in. x 7- in. x 2-in. baking pan. Pour cheese mixture over dough. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes or until butter is absorbed and rolls are lightly browned. Carefully lift foil out of pan; place on a serving dish. Serve hot.
