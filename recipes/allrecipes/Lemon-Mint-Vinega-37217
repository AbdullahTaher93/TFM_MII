CUT a continuous spiral of rind from lemon, and place in a large glass container, reserving remaining lemon for other uses. Add chopped mint. BRING vinegar to a boil, and pour over mint and lemon rind. Cover and let stand at room temperature 2 weeks. POUR mixture through a wire-mesh strainer into decorative bottles, discarding solids. Add fresh mint sprigs and lemon rind strips, if desired, and seal. Store in a cool, dry place up to 6 months.
