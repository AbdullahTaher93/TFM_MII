In medium bowl, mix together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside. In large mixing bowl, mix together cereal and milk. Let stand for 5 minutes or until cereal is softened. Stir in egg whites and oil; beat well. Stir in bananas. Add flour mixture, stirring only until combined. (Mixture will be thick.) Spoon batter into 12 large muffin tins, coated with non-stick cooking spray or lined with muffin papers. Bake at 200 degrees C (400 degrees F) for about 20 minutes or until browned and firm to the touch. Serve warm. May be frozen.
