In a large mixing bowl, combine the cake mix, water, oil and eggs. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Divide batter into three equal portions. Pour one portion into a greased 10-in. fluted tube pan. Stir red food coloring into another portion; carefully spoon into pan. Stir chocolate syrup and cocoa into remaining batter; carefully spoon into pan. Do no swirl. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from the pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar if desired.
