Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Saute chicken until all sides are well browned, then stir in the celery, onions, mushrooms with liquid and soy sauce. Cover skillet and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer for about 15 minutes or until celery is tender and chicken is cooked through.
