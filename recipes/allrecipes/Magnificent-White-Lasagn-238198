Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Mix chicken, artichokes, shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, and sun-dried tomatoes together in a large bowl. Beat cream cheese, milk, 1 tablespoon basil, and garlic powder together in a bowl until smooth. Mix 2/3 of the cream cheese mixture with the chicken mixture. Spread remaining cream cheese mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Spread a single layer of lasagna noodles over the cream cheese mixture, top with 1/3 of the chicken mixture, and a layer of mozzarella cheese slices. Repeat layering with noodles, chicken mixture, and mozzarella slices 2 times. Top with remaining Parmesan cheese and basil. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbling, about 25 minutes.
