In a medium bowl, combine the melted chocolate, sugar, eggs, oil, and vanilla. Mix well. Stir in the flour and baking powder. Cover and chill for at least 2 hours. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Unwrap the candy kisses. Roll cookie dough into walnut sized balls and roll each ball in the confectioners' sugar. Place cookies 2 inches apart on an unprepared cookie sheet. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Tops should be crackled and the edges should be golden brown. While the cookies are still hot, press a candy kiss into the center of each one. Remove to cool on racks.
