To make the syrup: In heavy medium saucepan over medium heat, stir together water and sugar until sugar dissolves. Simmer 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and add lemon verbena. Let steep 30 minutes, then strain and let cool. Cover and refrigerate syrup until cold, about 1 hour. Makes about 1 cup. To make the drink: In cocktail shaker filled with ice, add vodka, lemon verbena syrup, and cranberry juice. Shake vigorously for about 6 seconds, then strain into 6-ounce cocktail glass. Garnish with orange peel and rosemary sprig, if using.
