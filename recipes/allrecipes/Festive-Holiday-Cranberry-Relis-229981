Stir cranberries, sugar, orange juice, water, lime juice, 1 teaspoon orange zest, and lime zest together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; cook at a simmer until cranberries pop, about 20 minutes. Set aside to cool to room temperature. Transfer cooled sauce to serving bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour. Garnish with a pinch of orange zest to serve.
