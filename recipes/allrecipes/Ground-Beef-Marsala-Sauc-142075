Cook the ground beef with the garlic and mushrooms in a large skillet over high heat until no pink remains, about 10 minutes; do not drain. Add the flour and continue to cook for five minutes. Pour in the Marsala wine, sherry, and water. Stir and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer covered for 10 minutes. Serve over the pasta of your choice.
