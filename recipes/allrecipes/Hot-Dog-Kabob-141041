Heat grill. Soak four 8-inch wooden skewers in water for 10 minutes. Place 4 hot dog pieces and 4 apple wedges alternately on skewers. Stir together ketchup and honey. Remove 2 tablespoons of ketchup mixture and brush over the hot dogs and apples; reserve remaining for dipping sauce. Place kabobs on grill over medium heat. Cover and cook 5 to 6 minutes, turning once, until hot. Serve with reserved dipping sauce.
