Season the chicken with the thyme and black pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until well browned and cooked through, stirring often. Remove the chicken from the skillet. Heat the remaining oil in the skillet. Add the onion, red pepper and garlic and cook for 3 minutes or until the vegetables are tender-crisp, stirring often. Add the rice and cook and stir for 2 minutes or until the rice is lightly browned. Stir in 1 cup stock. Stir in the remaining stock and the soup and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 25 minutes or until the rice is tender, stirring occasionally. Return the chicken to the skillet and cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is hot, stirring often. Sprinkle with the cheese and parsley.
