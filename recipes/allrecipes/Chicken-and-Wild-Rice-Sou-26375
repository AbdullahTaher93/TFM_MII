Prepare rice mix according to package directions. In a large pot, combine 1 1/2 cups prepared rice mix, cooked chicken, broth, onions, mushrooms, celery, parsley, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes. For a thicker soup, stir in half-and-half and cook 5 minutes more.
