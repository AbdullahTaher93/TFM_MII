Whisk together the honey, olive oil, basil, strawberry jam, red pepper flakes, garlic, red wine vinegar, lemon juice and white sugar in a small bowl. Place the apples and shrimp into a large resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade over the shrimp and apples, seal the bag, and shake to coat; refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Thread the shrimp and apples alternately on 4 metal or soaked wooden skewers. Discard the remaining marinade. Cook the skewers on the preheated grill until the shrimp are opaque, about 5 minutes per side.
