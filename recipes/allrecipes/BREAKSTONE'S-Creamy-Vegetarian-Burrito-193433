Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix crumbles, salsa and 1/2 cup sour cream. Spread beans down centers of tortillas; top with crumbles mixture and 1 cup cheese. Fold bottom and top of each tortilla about 1 inch over filling; roll up, starting at 1 side. Place, seam-sides down, in greased 13x9-inch dish; cover with foil. Bake 25 minutes; sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake, uncovered, 5 minutes or until cheese is melted. Serve topped with remaining sour cream.
