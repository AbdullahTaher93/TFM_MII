Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. To make dressing, stir vinegar and sugar until sugar dissolves. Mix in soy sauce, ground ginger, garlic, sesame oil, and cayenne. Gradually add vinegar mixture to mayonnaise, stirring until blended. If made ahead, cover and chill for up to 24 hours. To make salad, toast almonds in the oven in a 9 inch square pan until golden, 6 to 8 minutes; set aside. In a 4 to 6 quart serving bowl, combine radishes, green onions, cilantro, snow peas, and coleslaw mix. If made ahead, cover and chill for up to 24 hours. To serve, pour dressing over salad mixture. Add almonds and mix gently.
