In bread machine pan, place the milk, egg, 1 tablespoon butter, sugar, salt, caraway seeds, poppy seeds, onion, sage, nutmeg, flours and yeast in the order suggested by manufacturer. Select dough setting (check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water or flour if needed). When the cycle is completed, turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Punch down; shape into a loaf. Place in a 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to wire rack. Melt remaining butter; brush over loaf.
