Heat oil in 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of the turkey; cook 3 minutes or until browned on both sides. Remove; set aside. Repeat with remaining turkey. Pour off fat. In same skillet, combine soup, asparagus, milk and black pepper. Heat to boiling. Return turkey to skillet. Reduce heat to low. Cover; cook 5 minutes or until turkey is no longer pink and asparagus is tender, stirring occasionally. Serve with rice. Garnish with onion curls and orange slices, if desired.
