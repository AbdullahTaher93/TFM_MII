In a bowl, combine the crab, cheese, zucchini and onions. Press onto the bottom and up the sides of a 9-in. deep-dish pie plate coated with nonstick cooking spray. In another bowl, combine the egg substitute, milk, mustard, salt and lemon-pepper; mix well. Pour into crust. Sprinkle with paprika. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting.
