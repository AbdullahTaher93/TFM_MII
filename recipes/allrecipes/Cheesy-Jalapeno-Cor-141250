Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt the butter and cream cheese in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the flour, milk, and jalapenos. Cook until the mixture reaches a pudding-like consistency. Pour the corn into a 2-quart casserole dish. Pour the cheese mixture over the corn. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven 30 to 45 minutes.
