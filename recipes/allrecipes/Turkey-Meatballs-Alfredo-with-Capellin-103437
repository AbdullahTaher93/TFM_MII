Stir together egg, milk and bread crumbs in large bowl until moistened. Mix in ground turkey and sun-dried tomatoes just until combined. Shape into 16 meatballs. Spray large nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Heat over medium heat until hot. Add meatballs and cook 8 to 10 minutes, turning occasionally until browned on all sides and no longer pink inside. Meanwhile, cook pasta as directed on package. Heat sauce as directed. Pile pasta onto large serving platter, top with meatballs and drizzle with sauce. Garnish with freshly ground pepper and grated Parmesan cheese, if you like.
