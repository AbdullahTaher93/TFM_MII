Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs. Add the cream, whey, almond meal and almond extract. Beat well. Butter 4 large ramekins. Divide the batter evenly between the ramekins. Place on a cookie sheet and bake for 25 minutes or until the tops are puffed up and beginning to brown. Remove and let cool for at least 10 minutes. In a small bowl mix together the Splenda, cloves and the guar gum. Set aside Meanwhile, make the boysenberry sauce. You may want to set aside a few of the most perfect berries as a garnish. In a sauce pan over medium-high heat, cook the boysenberries until they have completely broken up. You can strain the sauce at this point to remove the seeds if you wish, but you will be removing a source of nutrients. Gradually add the Splenda mixture, whisking constantly so that the guar gum doesn't lump. Carefully taste test (careful, it is VERY hot) to see if it needs more Splenda. Add more as needed. Pour sauce over the cakes and serve. I like to serve this in the ramekin. You can try to remove the cake from the ramekin, but I've not had much luck with that. If you want the cakes to be free standing, then I suggest lining the ramekins with parchment to facilitate removing the cakes.
