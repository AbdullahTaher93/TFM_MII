Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add angel hair pasta, cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until al dente; drain and toss with 1 tablespoon of olive oil to prevent stickiness., Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the garlic for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the asparagus and tomatoes, stirring to coat. Pour in the broth, and continue cooking uncovered 10 minutes, or until the asparagus is tender, but still bright green.

In a separate bowl, mix the avocados, lime juice, and garlic powder together until blended. Serve pasta with a dollop of the avocado mixture, and top with shredded cheese.
