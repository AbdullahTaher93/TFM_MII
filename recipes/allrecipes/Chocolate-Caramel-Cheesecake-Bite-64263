Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Generously coat the inside of 36 mini muffin cups with margarine. Divide wheat germ among muffin cups; rotate cups to completely cover insides with wheat germ. Set aside. Beat cream cheese on medium speed of electric mixer until smooth. Blend in sugar, cocoa powder and vanilla. Beat in egg whites, one at a time, until well blended. Pour into prepared muffin cups, dividing evenly. Bake just until set, about 12 to 15 minutes. Let stand in pan 10 minutes. To remove from pan, run small narrow spatula between crust and edge of each cup to loosen; lift out cheesecake. Cool 30 minutes on wire rack; cover and chill. To serve, top each cheesecake with small pecan half, if desired. Microwave caramel topping on HIGH about 10 seconds until spoonable. Spoon 1/2 teaspoon topping in center of each cheesecake. Refrigerate leftovers promptly.
