Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Transfer spaghetti to a large bowl; add flaked tuna, feta cheese, red onion, dill, red pepper flakes, lemon zest, and lemon juice to the bowl and toss.
