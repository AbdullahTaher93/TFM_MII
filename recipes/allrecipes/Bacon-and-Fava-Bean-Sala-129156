Heat the broiler, if not using a toaster for the bread. Make the dressing by mixing together the mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, and sugar. Add enough milk to make a drizzling consistency. Season with salt and pepper to taste; set aside. Heat the sunflower oil in a large saucepan. Add the bacon, red bell pepper, and onions and saute over high heat, stirring, until the onions are soft, about 4 minutes. Meanwhile, toast the bread in a toaster or under the broiler. Cut it into cubes; set aside. Stir the fava beans into the bacon mixture and add 1 tablespoon water. Heat until sizzling, then cover the pan and leave to cook 4 minutes. Arrange the radicchio wedges on top of the bean-and-bacon mixture. Cover again and cook until the radicchio wilts, but still holds its shape, about 3 minutes. Spoon the salad into shallow bowls and drizzle the dressing on top. Scatter the toasted bread cubes over the top and sprinkle with chopped flat-leaf parsley.
