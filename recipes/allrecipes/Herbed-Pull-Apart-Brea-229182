Thaw dough in covered container or plastic bag; cut each roll in half. Combine butter, parmesan cheese, thyme, dill, basil and rosemary in a shallow bowl. Dip each portion of roll dough in herb mixture and place in greased fluted tube pan. Cover pan loosely with towel or greased plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until almost double in size, about 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown. Invert on serving platter; serve warm.
