Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the whole-wheat rotini at a boil until just beginning to become tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in asparagus and snap peas and cook until vegetables are bright green and pasta is tender, about 3 more minutes. Drain pasta and vegetables, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking water. Transfer rotini, asparagus, peas, and the cooking water to a large serving bowl and keep warm. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until barely golden, 10 to 12 minutes; stir in lemon juice and lemon zest and cook until lemon zest is fragrant, about 2 minutes. Toss onion mixture, Pecorino Romano cheese, and basil into the pasta and vegetables; season with salt and black pepper.
