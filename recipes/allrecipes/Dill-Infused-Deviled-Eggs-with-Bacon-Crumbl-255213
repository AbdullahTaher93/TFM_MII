Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add eggs; cook for 10 minutes. Place in a bowl under cold running water until cool enough to handle. Peel eggs in the bowl of water. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels; crumble into small pieces. Cut eggs in half lengthwise and scoop yolks into a bowl. Mash yolks with a fork. Add mayonnaise, dill, honey mustard, white vinegar, salt, and pepper; whisk until smooth. Spoon or pipe yolk mixture into the egg whites. Garnish with bacon crumbles and paprika.
