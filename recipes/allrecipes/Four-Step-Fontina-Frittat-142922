Preheat broiler. Position rack second from top. Beat eggs in large bowl. Fold in squash and cheese. Heat oil 2 to 3 minutes in medium nonstick, broiler-safe skillet over medium heat, turning pan to coat. Add egg mixture and cook 3 minutes to set bottom. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook 3 to 5 minutes, lifting edges occasionally and tilting pan so uncooked egg mixture flows to bottom. Broil 3 to 4 minutes or until frittata is browned and set. Serve warm or at room temperature.
