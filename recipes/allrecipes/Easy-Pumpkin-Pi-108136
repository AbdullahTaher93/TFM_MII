Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large mixing bowl, stir together SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, molasses, salt, and cinnamon. When these ingredients are well mixed, stir in the egg whites followed by the pumpkin and evaporated milk. Pour into the pie crust. Bake for 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the pie comes out clean. Cool then top with whipped topping before serving.
