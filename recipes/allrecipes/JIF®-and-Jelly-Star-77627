In large bowl, mix JIF(R) Creamy Peanut Butter, sugar, CRISCO(R) Butter Flavor All-Vegetable Stick and egg. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, salt and baking powder. Add to the peanut butter mixture and mix well. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions. Wrap each portion in plastic wrap or waxed paper and refrigerate 2 hours or overnight. Remove portions from refrigerator and place each portion between 2 sheets of plastic wrap or waxed paper. Roll each portion into a 'sheet' about 1/8-inch thick. (Refrigerate dough again if it becomes too soft to handle). Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Using large star cutter cut all of the dough into stars. Using mini star cutter cut out center of half of the cookies to create 'window' tops. Transfer cookies to a non-stick baking sheet, leaving a 1/2-inch between them. Bake all cookies 5-6 minutes or until they're just starting to brown. Using a spatula, transfer the cookies to a cooling rack. When cookies have cooled, spread the SMUCKER'S(R) Jelly on the plain cookies and top with the 'window' cookies.
