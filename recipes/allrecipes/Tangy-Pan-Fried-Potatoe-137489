Peel potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Place in a large bowl; toss with onion, garlic, chiles, cumin, coriander and salt. Melt butter in a large skillet. (Use two pans, if needed, dividing butter and potatoes between pans.) Cook potatoes over medium-high heat 10 to 12 minutes, stirring frequently and scraping browned bits from pan. Add rice vinegar and water. Continue to cook until all liquid is evaporated and potatoes are tender, 6 to 8 minutes.
