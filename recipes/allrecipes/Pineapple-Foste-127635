Scoop ice cream into 8 individual serving dishes. Place in refrigerator for up to 30 minutes. Heat brown sugar, nuts and butter in large skillet over low heat, stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves. Add pineapple pieces, stirring gently, until pineapple begins to soften and brown. Remove from heat. Stir in rum. Heat until rum is hot. Carefully ignite rum with long match or long-handled lighter. When flames subside, spoon pineapple over ice cream and serve immediately.
