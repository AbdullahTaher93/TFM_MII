Set oven control to broil. On cookie sheet, broil chiles with tops 2 inches from heat about 10 minutes, turning frequently with tongs, until all sides are blackened and blistered. Place chiles in paper bag; seal bag. Let chiles steam 15 minutes. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly spray 8-inch square (2-quart) glass baking dish with CRISCO(R) Original No-Stick Cooking Spray. In medium bowl, mix Chihuahua cheese and Mexican cheese blend; reserve 3/4 cup for topping. In another medium bowl, mix ricotta cheese, garlic, cumin and spinach. Stir in remaining shredded cheeses. Set aside. Wearing food-safe plastic gloves, peel blackened skin from chiles. Cut open chiles; remove stems, seeds and membranes. Cut each chile in half lengthwise into 2 pieces; pat dry. Separate dough into 10 biscuits. Separate each biscuit into 2 thin layers; flatten slightly. Pour half of the enchilada sauce over bottom of baking dish. Place 10 biscuit layers on sauce, cutting biscuits if necessary to fit into dish. Top with 5 chile halves; spread spinach mixture over chiles. Top with remaining 5 chiles halves and remaining 10 biscuit layers. Pour remaining enchilada sauce over biscuits. Spray sheet of foil with cooking spray. Cover baking dish with foil, sprayed side down. Bake 55 to 60 minutes or until thoroughly heated and bubbly around edges. Sprinkle with reserved 3/4 cup shredded cheeses. Bake uncovered 5 to 8 minutes longer or until cheese is melted. Cool 10 minutes before cutting. Top each serving with tomatoes, guacamole and sour cream.
