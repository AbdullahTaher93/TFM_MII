In a bowl with a mixer, beat butter with sugar until smooth. Then beat in milk. In another bowl, combine flour, baking powder, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, and ground almonds. Stir flour mixture into butter mixture and beat until blended. If mixture is crumbly, squeeze into a smooth, compact ball. Divide dough in half. Flatten each portion with your hands to make a 1-inch-thick round. With a floured rolling pin on a board lightly coated with all-purpose flour, roll dough, a portion at a time, until the dough is 1/8 inch thick. With floured cookie cutters, cut dough into desired shapes. If dough is too soft to handle, freeze briefly until firm. With a wide spatula or your fingers, transfer cut dough to 12- by 15-inch baking sheets, spacing about 1 inch apart. Gather scraps, pat into a ball, and repeat rolling and cutting. Bake in a 300 degree F oven until slightly darker brown, about 15 minutes; if using more than 1 pan in 1 oven, switch pan positions halfway through baking. With a spatula, transfer cookies to racks to cool. If hot cookies start to break, slide a thin spatula under them to release, let stand on pan to firm, about 5 minutes, then transfer to racks. Serve cookies, store airtight up to 1 week, or freeze to store longer.
