Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook for 3 minutes, or until al dente; drain. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute garlic until tender. Stir in cream, and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add imitation crab, shrimp, Parmesan cheese, and salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until heated through. Transfer cooked linguine to a serving platter, and top with seafood sauce. Garnish with parsley.
