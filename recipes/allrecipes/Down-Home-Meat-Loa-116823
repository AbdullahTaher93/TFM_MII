In a bowl, combine the first eight ingredients. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Press into a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour. Spread with ketchup; bake 15-20 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F and meat is no longer pink. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing. Meat loaf may be frozen for up to 3 months.
