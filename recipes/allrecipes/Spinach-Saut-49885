Bring the water to a boil in a skillet over medium heat. Add spinach all at once, and reduce heat slightly. Cover, and let cook for about 3 minutes, or until spinach is not quite tender. Stir in the cream cheese and lemon juice, and season with salt. Cook, stirring, until the cream cheese is melted and well blended. Serve immediately.
