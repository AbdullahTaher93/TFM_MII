Season ribs with salt and pepper. Pour water into slow cooker. Layer the ribs into the slow cooker. Top the ribs with onion and garlic. Cook on High for 4 hours (or Low for 8 hours). Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Transfer ribs to a baking sheet. Discard onion and garlic. Coat ribs with barbeque sauce. Bake in preheated oven until the sauce caramelizes and sticks to the meat, 10 to 15 minutes.
