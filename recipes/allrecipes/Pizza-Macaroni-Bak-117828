In a skillet, cook sausage, green pepper and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the macaroni, tomato sauce, 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, water, oregano and pepper. Transfer to a lightly greased 1-qt. baking dish; sprinkle with remaining cheese. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until liquid is absorbed and casserole is heated through.
