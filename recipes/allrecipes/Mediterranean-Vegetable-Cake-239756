Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Add spinach to onion mixture; cook and stir until wilted, about 5 minutes. Transfer onion-spinach mixture to a large bowl and cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix parsnip, artichoke hearts, olives, almond flour, tomatoes, eggs, walnuts, salt, and pepper into onion-spinach mixture; form into 6 cakes. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet. Cook cakes in the hot oil until browned and crispy, about 5 minutes per side.
