Rinse rice; drain. In a medium saucepan, combine rice, oil, and water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large pot, cook onion, celery, and carrots in butter until vegetables are almost tender. Blend in flour, cook and stir for 2 minutes. Add broth and undrained rice, bring to a boil. Cook and stir until slightly thickened. Stir in cream, rosemary, and salt. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, about 20 minutes or until rice is tender.
