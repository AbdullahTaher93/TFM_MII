Mix ketchup, apple juice, olive oil, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, chili powder, hot sauce, and kosher salt together in a bowl; pour marinade into a resealable plastic bag. Add pork chops to the marinade and seal bag. Marinate for at least 30 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove pork chops from marinade and place on the hot grill; discard used marinade. Cook until pork chops are no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C).
