Sprinkle gelatin over water and set aside for 5 minutes to soften. Combine milk, salt, and 4 tablespoons sugar (reserve remaining sugar). Stir until dissolved. Whisk in beaten egg yolks, and heat custard in a double boiler until thickened, stirring constantly. Add gelatin and stir until dissolved. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature. Stir in vanilla and toffee chunks. In a clean bowl, whip egg whites until stiff peaks form, adding the remainder of the sugar. Fold into custard. Pour filling into pie shell. Chill in refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight. Sprinkle top with toffee bits before serving.
