In a small saucepan, combine all of the ingredients. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cook and stir over medium heat until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Cool. Pour into a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. dish; cover and freeze for 45 minutes or until edges begin to firm. Stir and return to the freezer. Repeat every 20 minutes or until slushy, about 1 hour.
