In a large deep skillet, heat the extra-virgin olive oil until shimmering. Add the shiitake mushrooms and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the scallions and chile and cook for 2 minutes, until just softened. Add the clams and wine and cook uncovered, stirring, until half of the clams are opened, about 4 minutes. Add the shrimp and cook, stirring, until all of the clams are open and the shrimp are pink and cooked through, about 4 minutes longer. Serve in deep bowls with crusty bread to sop up the sauce.
