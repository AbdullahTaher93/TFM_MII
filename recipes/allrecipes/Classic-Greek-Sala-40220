Blend together Greek seasoning, lemon juice, vinegar and oil in a small bowl. Gently stir in cheese. Refrigerate 15 minutes or longer. Meanwhile, wash, dry and tear lettuce or salad greens into bite-size pieces. Place lettuce and vegetables in a large bowl. Just before serving, stir dressing; pour over salad. Toss to coat. Garnish with onion slices and extra feta cheese, if desired.
