Freeze the can of fruit overnight or longer until frozen solid. Run the frozen can under hot, running water for 3 to 4 minutes until the edges are thawed. (The contents will move when you shake the can.) Open the can and coarsely cut up the fruit in the can with a small knife; scoop into the blender. Add the remaining ingredients, cover blender and puree. Serve in chilled glasses.
