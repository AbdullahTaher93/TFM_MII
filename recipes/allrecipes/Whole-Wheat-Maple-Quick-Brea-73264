Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 5x9 inch loaf pan. In a bowl, mix the milk, yogurt, egg, maple syrup, and lemon juice. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Gradually stir the flour mixture into the milk mixture until moistened. Pour into the prepared loaf pan. Bake 50 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
