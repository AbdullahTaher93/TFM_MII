Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place spaghetti squash halves, cut sides down, on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until flesh is tender and easily shreds when punctured with a fork, 20 to 30 minutes. Carefully shred flesh with a fork until it resembles spaghetti. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir bell peppers, onion, and garlic in the hot oil until slightly tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add ground turkey to vegetable mixture; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Mix black beans, sun-dried tomatoes, tomato sauce, chicken bouillon, chili powder, garlic powder, seasoned salt, cumin, and red pepper flakes into ground turkey mixture; cook until heated through and flavors have blended, about 10 minutes. Spoon spaghetti squash onto each plate; top with ground turkey mixture.
