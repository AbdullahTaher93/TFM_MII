COMBINE cream cheese and two tablespoons of pesto in small bowl; stir well. Spread evenly over each tortilla. Place turkey slices, lettuce, tomato and red onion or alfalfa sprouts over bottom third of tortillas, making sure ingredients don 't touch edges. FOLD the bottom edge of tortilla toward the center and gently roll until tortilla is completely wrapped around the filling. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 15 minutes. Cut in half.
