In a bowl, toss together the pineapple, strawberries, kiwifruit, mango, tomatoes, cilantro, and balsamic vinegar. Spray a skillet with cooking spray, and heat over medium-high heat. Sprinkle tilapia fillets with seasoned pepper blend, and pan-fry until fish turns white and opaque, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve fish topped with salsa.
