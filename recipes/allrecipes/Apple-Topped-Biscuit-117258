In a large saucepan, combine the apples, sugar, tapioca, lemon juice, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg. Let stand for 15 minutes. Cook over medium heat for 8-10 minutes or until apples are tender. Transfer apple mixture to a greased 9-in. pie plate. Place biscuits over apples. Bake at 375 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until biscuits are browned. Immediately invert onto a serving plate.
