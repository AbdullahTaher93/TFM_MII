Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Remove bacon, and set aside. Cook onion in the hot bacon grease until tender. Add cabbage, and stir in water, sugar, salt, and pepper. Cook until cabbage wilts, about 15 minutes. Stir in bacon. Splash with vinegar before serving.
