Spread the rice in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Sprinkle both sides of chicken with garlic salt and pepper; place over rice. In a bowl, combine the broth, picante sauce, tomato sauce, onion and green pepper; pour over the chicken. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 55 minutes or until rice is tender and chicken juices run clear. Sprinkle with cheeses. Bake, uncovered, 5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.
