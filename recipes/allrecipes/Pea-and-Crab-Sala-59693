Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown and crisp. Drain, crumble and set aside. In a large bowl, mix together the imitation crab, bacon and peas. Stir onion powder into mayonnaise, and then stir into the crab mixture until well blended. Cover and refrigerate. Top with diced tomatoes before serving.
