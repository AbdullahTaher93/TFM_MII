Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together the butter, flour, eggs and sugar until well blended. Stir in the crushed pineapple. Transfer to a small casserole dish, and sprinkle cinnamon over the top. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, uncovered. Serve warm.
