Lightly toast cumin seeds in a large skillet over medium heat, shaking pan frequently, about 3 minutes. Set aside. Cook bacon in same skillet over medium-high heat until crisp. Remove to paper towels to drain. Crumble when cool. Discard drippings. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Melt butter in same skillet over medium heat; add asparagus and cook 2-3 minutes. Add mushrooms and garlic salt; cook until asparagus is crisp-tender, about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Place tortillas on large baking sheet. Top with vegetable mixture; sprinkle with green onions, cheese, bacon and cumin. Bake 10 minutes or until cheese is melted and tortillas are lightly toasted. Cut into wedges and serve immediately.
