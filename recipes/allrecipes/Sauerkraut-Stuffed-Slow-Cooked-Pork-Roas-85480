Place pork roast on a cutting board. With a sharp knife, cut a 5-inch slit into the top of the roast, being careful not to cut clear through to the bottom of the roast. Spoon the sauerkraut into the pork roast, pressing it into the slit with the bottom of the spoon. Place the roast in the slow cooker, and cook on Low for 8 to 9 hours.
