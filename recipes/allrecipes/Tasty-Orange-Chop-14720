In a mixing bowl, mix together vinegar, soy sauce, orange juice, onion, rosemary, sage, salt, garlic, and barbecue sauce. Place chops in a large resealable plastic bag. Pour in the marinade, and seal. Refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours, or overnight. Preheat grill for high heat. Transfer marinade to a small saucepan, bring to a boil, and cook for several minutes. Lightly oil preheated grill. Grill chops for 6 to 8 minutes, turning once, or to desired doneness. Brush cooked marinade over chops during the final minutes of cooking.
