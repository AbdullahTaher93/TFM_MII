Preheat barbecue grill. Combine seasoning ingredients. Mix 1 teaspoon with dressing. Press remaining seasoning onto beef roast. Alternately thread vegetables onto 12-inch metal skewers; brush with dressing. Place roast on grid over medium, ash-covered coals. Grill, uncovered, 35 to 45 minutes for medium rare to medium doneness, turning occasionally. Grill vegetables 20 to 25 minutes or until tender, turning occasionally. Remove roast when instant-read thermometer registers 140 degrees F for medium rare; 155 degrees F for medium. Tent loosely with aluminum foil; let stand 10 minutes. (Temperature will continue to rise to 145 degrees F for medium rare; 160 degrees F for medium.) Carve across the grain into thin slices. Serve with vegetables.
