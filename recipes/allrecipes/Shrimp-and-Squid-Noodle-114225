In a small bowl, combine the broth, red-pepper flakes, oyster sauce, wine, and soy sauce. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the linguine until just done, about 12 minutes. Drain the linguine. In a large frying pan or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over high heat. Sprinkle the shrimp with 1/8 teaspoon of the salt. Add the shrimp to the pan; cook until just done, about 3 minutes. Remove the shrimp. Heat another tablespoon oil over high heat. Sprinkle the squid with the remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt. Add the squid to the pan and cook for 30 seconds. Remove. Heat 1/2 tablespoon of oil and add the eggs to the pan. Cook, stirring, until set, about 20 seconds. Remove and cut into strips. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over high heat. Add the linguine, bean sprouts, and the sauce mixture. Cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. Add the shrimp, squid, and eggs. Cook until heated through, about 1 minute longer. Toss with the chives and serve immediately.
