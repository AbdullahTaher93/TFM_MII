In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the orzo until almost done, about 10 minutes. Add the shrimp to the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until both the shrimp and orzo are done, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Drain thoroughly. In a large glass or stainless-steel bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, vinegar, salt, pepper, and oregano; add the oil slowly, whisking. Add the orzo and shrimp, the scallions, olives, and feta to the dressing and toss. Serve warm or at room temperature.
