Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Toss venison cubes with flour to coat. Heat 2 tablespoons of canola oil to smoking in a large skillet. Add venison, and cook until well browned, then remove and set aside. Pour in remaining 1 tablespoon of canola oil; when hot, add mushrooms and cook until softened then stir in onion and cook until softened. Stir in the reserved venison, then add tomato sauce, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce. Pour into a casserole dish, cover, and bake in preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Stir in sour cream and continue cooking until venison is tender, about 30 minutes longer.
