Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 10 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. In a large bowl, combine cracker crumbs, sugar and baking powder. Stir in milk, egg and honey; mixing just until moistened. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 18 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Let stand for 5 minutes, then move to a wire rack to cool completely.
