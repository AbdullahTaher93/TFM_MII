Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly spray a baking sheet with vegetable cooking spray. Combine apples, SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend for Baking, and apple cider in a heavy saucepan; cook on medium high heat until apples are slightly translucent (about 8 minutes). Remove from heat; add flour, stirring until thoroughly blended. Stir in mint. Set aside. Unfold phyllo, and cover remaining sheets with a damp towel to prevent it drying out. Place 1 phyllo sheet on waxed paper; brush with melted butter and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend for Baking. Repeat process 4 times. Spoon apple filling along 1 long side of phyllo leaving a 1-inch border on 1 long edge and 2 short edges. Fold over short edges of phyllo to cover 1 inch of apple filling on each end. Roll up, starting at long edge with 1-inch border. Do not roll tightly or strudel may split. Place seam side down on prepared baking sheet. Cut 1/4-inch deep slits, 1-inch apart, across top. Brush strudel with butter and sprinkle with remaining SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend for Baking. Bake for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool 10 minutes.
