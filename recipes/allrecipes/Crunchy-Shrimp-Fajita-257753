Mix refried beans and chili powder together in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high until heated through, about 2 minutes. Cover to keep beans hot. Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add shrimp, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and onion. Stir in soy sauce, fajita seasoning, and lemon pepper. Cook and stir until shrimp is evenly coated and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Bring shrimp mixture to the table in the hot skillet. Spread refried beans over tostada shells; pile shrimp mixture on top.
