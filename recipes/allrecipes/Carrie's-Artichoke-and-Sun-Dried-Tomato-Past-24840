Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring it to a rolling boil. While the water is heating, melt the butter over medium heat in a large saucepan. Add the onions, mushrooms, and garlic; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the sun-dried tomatoes, olives, artichoke hearts, wine, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil; reduce the heat and simmer until liquid is reduced by a third, about 4 minutes. Cook the fresh pasta in boiling water until done, about 2 minutes. Drain. Toss pasta with sauce. Top with fresh tomatoes and cheese, add pepper to taste, and serve.
