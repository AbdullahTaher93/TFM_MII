In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, cloves, salt, and baking soda. Place butter and brown sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; mix on medium speed until pale and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add egg and molasses; mix until combined. Reduce speed to low. Add flour mixture; mix until just combined. Halve dough; shape into disks. Wrap each disk in plastic; refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 325 degrees;. Working with 1 disk at a time, roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/4-inch thick. (If dough becomes too soft at any time, freeze until firm.) Cut dough into 12 circles using a 3 1/2-inch round cutter; space 1 inch apart on baking sheets lined with a nonstick baking mat or parchment paper. Refrigerate until firm, about 20 minutes. Bake, rotating sheets halfway through, until firm, 11 to 13 minutes. Cool on sheets on wire racks. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Holding a sugar cone upright in your hand, fill with Kit Kat bar pieces. Using a small brush, paint a thick layer of melted chocolate around the rim of the cone. Hold 1 cookie, bottom side up, over the cone, centering it, and press to adhere to the cone. Turn upright and place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat process with remaining cookies and cones. Chill for 10 minutes to set. Remove from refrigerator and paint entire surface of hats (cones and cookies) with chocolate. Chill until set, about 20 minutes, then tie candy belts around the base of each hat.
