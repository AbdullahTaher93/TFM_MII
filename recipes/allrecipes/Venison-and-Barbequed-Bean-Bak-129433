Place venison roast, ginger ale, chicken broth, 1 teaspoon cumin, pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes into a slow cooker. Cover and cook on Low until the venison is tender enough to be pulled apart with a fork, about 10 hours. Drain meat, and shred. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place shredded pork into a large mixing bowl and mix with pork and beans, black beans, kidney beans, baked beans, tomatoes, green pepper, and onion. Pour in barbeque sauce, brown sugar, and molasses. Season with 1 teaspoon cumin, 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes, chili powder, hot pepper sauce, salt and pepper. Mix until well combined, then pour into a deep 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Place bacon strips in a single layer over top. Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes until bacon has cooked and begins to crisp.
