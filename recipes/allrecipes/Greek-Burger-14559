In a small bowl, mix together mayonnaise and minced garlic. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Preheat grill for high heat. Mix together lamb, breadcrumbs, fennel, shallot, oregano, and salt. Form into 3/4-inch-thick patties, and sprinkle black pepper over each. Brush grate with olive oil, and place burgers on grill. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes per side, turning once, or until done. Serve on buns with garlic mayonnaise.
