Place pancake mix in a bowl. In another bowl, whisk egg, eggnog, vanilla and nutmeg; stir into pancake mix just until moistened. Pour batter by 1/3 cupfuls onto a lightly greased hot griddle; turn when bubbles form on top of pancakes. Cook until second side is golden brown. Serve with cranberry sauce.
