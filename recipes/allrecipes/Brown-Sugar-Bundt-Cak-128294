Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Generously grease a 12-cup (3-L) Bundt pan. Dust the pan with flour, tapping out the excess. Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a medium bowl. Place the brown sugar, margarine, oil, and egg substitute into a large mixer bowl. Beat with an electric mixer at medium speed until very light and well blended, about 4 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and beat in half the flour mixture until just incorporated. Beat in the yogurt, water, milk, and vanilla. Then beat in the remaining flour mixture just until incorporated. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan. Spread it evenly with a rubber spatula. Bake on the center oven rack until a toothpick inserted in cake comes out clean and the top springs back when lightly pressed, 50 to 60 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let stand until the cake is completely cooled. Loosen the cake from the pan and invert it onto a serving plate. Cut into slices.
