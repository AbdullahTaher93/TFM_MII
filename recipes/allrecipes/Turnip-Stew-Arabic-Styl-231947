Bring 6 cups water to a boil in a large pot; cook stew meat in the boiling water until cooked through and water has completely evaporated, 30 to 45 minutes, skimming off any accumulated fat from top as needed. Stir tomato paste into the cooked stew meat until coated, 1 to 2 minutes. Add 4 cups water, turnips, salt, and black pepper; bring to a boil. Mix lemon juice, maple syrup, and sugar into stew meat mixture; reduce heat to medium and simmer until reduced, 30 to 40 minutes. Serve over cooked rice.
