Preheat grill for medium heat. In a large pot, bring the water to a boil. Season boiling water with 2 tablespoons garlic, 4 tablespoons Cajun-style seasoning, and 4 tablespoons seasoned salt. Boil ribs in seasoned water for 15 to 20 minutes. In a mixing bowl, mix together barbeque sauce, 2 tablespoons garlic, 2 tablespoons Cajun-style seasoning, 2 tablespoons seasoned salt, and Worcestershire sauce. Place ribs in large baking dishes, and apply a generous amount of the barbeque sauce mixture to the ribs. Set aside for 10 to 15 minutes to marinate. Grill the ribs for 7 to 12 minutes per side, until nicely browned.
