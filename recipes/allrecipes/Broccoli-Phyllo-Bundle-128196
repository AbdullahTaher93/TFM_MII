Saute broccoli, peppers, and scallions in hot oil until vegetables are crisp-tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in beans, orzo, mustard, and lemon juice. Brush 2 sheets of phyllo with a little margarine. Top with 2 sheets of phyllo, and brush with margarine. Using a sharp knife, cut phyllo stack into 4 squares. Place 1/4 cup (50 mL) of broccoli filling in each square. Bring corners of phyllo up and together; pinch and twist slightly. Place bundles in muffin cups. Repeat, assembling bundles with remaining phyllo, filling and margarine. Brush tops with remaining margarine. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) until golden, 6 to 8 minutes.
