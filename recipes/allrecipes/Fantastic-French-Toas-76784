Combine eggs, milk, vanilla and salt. Beat slightly with a fork until blended. In a medium sized skillet, melt butter or margarine. Dip bread slices into egg mixture, coating both sides of each. Fry bread until golden brown on one side; turn and fry second side. Top each toast slice with some chopped peanuts. In a small saucepan, blend maple syrup and JIF(R). Heat and stir until warm and pour over the French toast.
