In a mixing bowl, mix together potato flakes, water and salt. Allow the mixture to cool for 10 minutes. Stir in the eggs and flour. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough until no longer sticky. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Separate the dough into approximately 6 dumplings. Carefully drop the dumplings into water and boil approximately 20 minutes until they rise to the top. Remove from water and drain.
