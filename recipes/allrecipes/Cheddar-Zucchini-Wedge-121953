In a skillet, saute onion in butter until tender. In a bowl, combine the biscuit mix, parsley, basil, thyme and onion mixture. Stir in eggs and milk just until combined. Fold in the zucchini, cheese and almonds. Transfer to a greased 9-in. round baking pan. Bake at 400 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cut into wedges.
