In a large saucepan cook pasta according to package directions, adding the frozen green beans (if using), the last 4 to 5 minutes of cooking. Drain pasta and beans in a colander. Set pasta mixture aside. (If using fresh green beans, cook in a covered saucepan in a small amount of boiling salted water for 10 to 15 minutes or until crisp-tender. Drain.) For sauce, in the same large saucepan cook mushrooms in hot butter until tender. In a separate bowl, whisk LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, green onion, flour, salt, and pepper. Add milk mixture to saucepan with mushrooms. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir 1 minute more. Stir in pasta, green beans, and pancetta or ham. Heat through.
