Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 8-inch square, glass baking dish. Place spinach on the bottom, and around the sides of the prepared baking dish. Stir together the mayonnaise and flour in a sauce pan. Stir in the milk, and season with salt, paprika, rosemary, and thyme. Add the onion and mushrooms; bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook until thickened, stirring constantly. Stir in the eggs, then pour into the baking dish. Sprinkle with crab meat and cheese. Bake in preheated oven until cheese has melted, about 20 minutes.
