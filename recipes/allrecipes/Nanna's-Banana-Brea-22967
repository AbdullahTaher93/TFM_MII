Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. In a blender, combine milk, eggs, oil, sugar and banana pieces. Process until smooth. In a large bowl, sift together all the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add banana mixture to dry ingredients. Mix well. Stir in nuts. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 55 to 60 minutes until golden brown, an a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean.
