In a 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat, bring 3 quarts of water to a boil. While water heats, place bacon in a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring often, until bacon begins to brown, about 7 minutes. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until onion is limp and tastes sweet, about 5 minutes more. Add scallops and garlic, and stir constantly until scallops are just barely opaque in the center (cut to test), 2 to 3 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer bacon, onion, and scallop mixture to a bowl and set aside. When water boils, add linguine and cook until tender to bite, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain, rinse with hot water, then drain well. Meanwhile, to frying pan add broth, wine, and thyme. Stir to scrape free any browned bits on pan bottom. Bring to a boil over high heat. Whisk in sour cream until smooth. Bring to a simmer, then whisk in cornstarch mixture until thickened. Immediately add scallop mixture to sauce and stir until heated through. Transfer linguine to a large bowl and top with scallops and sauce. Mix thoroughly and serve immediately.
