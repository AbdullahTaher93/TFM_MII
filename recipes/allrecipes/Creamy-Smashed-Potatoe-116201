Place potatoes in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and cook for 15-20 minutes or until tender. Drain and place in a large bowl; mash the potatoes. Add the remaining ingredients; mix well. Transfer to a greased 8-in. square baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until lightly browned.
