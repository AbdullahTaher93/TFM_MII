Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place tart shells on a baking sheet. Stir brown sugar, melted butter, balsamic vinegar, and cinnamon together in a bowl; stir in pears and chopped almonds until completely coated. Spoon pear mixture into tart shells. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 45 minutes.
