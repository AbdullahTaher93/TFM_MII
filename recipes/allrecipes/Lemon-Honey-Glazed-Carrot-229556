Bring carrots and enough water to cover to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat to medium-high and continue to simmer until carrots are tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. Melt butter in a large skillet over low heat; stir in honey. Add lemon juice and ginger. Increase heat to medium and stir in carrots until well coated. Continue cooking until thickened, about 5 minutes more.
