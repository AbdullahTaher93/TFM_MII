In a bowl, beat the egg. Add milk, cracker crumbs, onion, salt, sage and pepper. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Shape into two loaves; place in a shallow baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Combine the ketchup, brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce; spoon over meat loaves. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until meat is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F; drain.
