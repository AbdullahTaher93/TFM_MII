Bring the soy sauce, mirin, sake, sugar, and ginger puree to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium low. For a marinade, remove from heat and allow to cool. For a thicker sauce, mix cornstarch and water to form a smooth paste and stir into the mixture; allow to simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes.
