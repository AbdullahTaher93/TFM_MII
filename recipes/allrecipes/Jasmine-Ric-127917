Put rice in small heavy-bottom pot with 4 cups water. Stir to level rice, bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and cook until water has been absorbed (tiny holes will appear on the surface of the rice), about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low, cover with a tight fitting lid, and cook for 10 minutes more. Turn off heat, fluff rice with a fork, and allow to rest covered for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
