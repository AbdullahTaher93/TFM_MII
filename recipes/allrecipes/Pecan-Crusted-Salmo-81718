Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly grease a baking dish large enough for the fillets without them being crowded. Coarsely grind the pecans in a food processor. Pour onto a plate. Melt the butter with the thyme in the microwave for a few seconds. Generously brush the fillets with the butter on both sides. Press each fillet onto the ground nuts on both sides. Place in the baking dish and bake for 10 minutes per inch of thickness. The nuts should be a golden brown but do not let them burn. Serve immediately.
