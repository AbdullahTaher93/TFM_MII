Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Pulse chickpeas in a food processor until finely ground. Add onion and garlic, bread crumbs, egg, parsley, seasoning blend, salt, and black pepper; process until mixture holds together like a dough. Scoop out 2 tablespoons of the mixture and roll into a ball; set on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until bottom is golden brown, about 15 minutes. Turn each meatball over and continue baking until golden brown on top, about 10 minutes more.
