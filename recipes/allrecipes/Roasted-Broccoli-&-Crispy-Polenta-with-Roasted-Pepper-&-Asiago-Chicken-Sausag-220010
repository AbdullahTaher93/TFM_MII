Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Steam broccoli stalks for 10 minutes in a covered medium size sauce pan. Transfer to an oven proof dish, drizzle olive oil and lemon juice and season with the black pepper. Top with the strips of the roasted red pepper and the shredded Asiago cheese. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare a medium saute pan with pan spray, saute the Roasted Pepper & Asiago Chicken Sausages over medium-high heat 7 - 9 minutes, turning over half way. Slice on the diagonal 1/4 inch thick. Using a non-stick pan (prepared with pan spray), over medium high heat, brown the polenta slices (2 -3 minutes per side). Should be nicely browned and crispy on both sides. To serve, transfer the sliced polenta to a serving platter and top with the roasted broccoli and the sliced sausage pieces.
