Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add potatoes and carrots; cook and stir until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir cactus, chili powder, garlic, fenugreek seeds, coriander, and cumin into the potato mixture. Cook, stirring frequently, until cactus is softened, about 5 minutes. Add pinto beans; cook, stirring gently, until just heated through, about 3 minutes.
