Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large saucepan, bring the water with salt to a boil, and cook the potatoes until tender, about 20 minutes; stir the turkey and mixed vegetables into the boiling water, and bring the mixture back to a boil over medium heat. Mix cornstarch and 2 cups of milk together in a bowl until thoroughly combined, and stir the milk mixture into the saucepan with the turkey and vegetables. Bring to a simmer, stirring constantly, and cook until the mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. Pour the turkey mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place the corn bread mix into a bowl, and beat eggs and 1 cup of milk into the mix. Spread the batter over the turkey and gravy mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until the corn bread topping is golden brown, about 30 minutes.
