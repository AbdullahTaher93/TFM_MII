Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put the tortillas on a large sheet of heavy-duty foil and coat them with cooking spray. Bake 10 minutes, turning once. Dump the chicken, beans, and salsa in a microwavable bowl, stir, and nuke on high power for 2 to 3 minutes. Slop the chicken mixture onto the baked tortillas and top with the lettuce, scallions, and cheese.
