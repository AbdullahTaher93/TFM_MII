Salsa: In a non-metallic bowl mix together the bell peppers, minced cilantro and the minced scallions (both white and green portions). Add 2 Tbsp of lime juice (not all 4 Tbsps) and toss. Cover and chill while you prepare the fish. You can kick up the flavor by adding a few dashes of Tabasco or a 1/2 tsp of chili powder. A minced jalapeno pepper is also an option. Grilled Snapper: Rinse and pat dry the fish. I prefer to leave the skin on to make turning the fillets easier. Mix together the oil and 2 Tbsps of the lime juice. Baste both sides of the fish with the oil/lime mixture. A pinch of salt and pepper is optional. To grill, place the snapper fillets skin side up on a hot oiled grill. Grill for about 4 minutes. Carefully turn over with a large spatula. Generously baste with the oil/lime mixture. Turn heat down to medium and grill for another 5-6 minutes, just until it flakes easily and most (if not all) of the translucence is gone from the center. Remove from heat immediately.
