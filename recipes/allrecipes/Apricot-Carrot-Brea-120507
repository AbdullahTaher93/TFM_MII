Stir in apricots. Spoon into an 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Combine confectioners' sugar and water; drizzle over bread.
