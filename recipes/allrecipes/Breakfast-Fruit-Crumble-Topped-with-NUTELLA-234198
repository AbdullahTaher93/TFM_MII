Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine peaches, strawberries, raspberries, granulated sugar, cornstarch and vanilla. Spoon into six 1-cup (250 mL) ramekins. In another bowl, combine oats, flour, brown sugar, butter and cinnamon. Divide crumble mixture over the fruit. Place ramekins on a baking sheet. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until fruit is soft and bubbling. Cool completely. Serve with a tablespoon (15 mL) of NUTELLA(R) on top.
