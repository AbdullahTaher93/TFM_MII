Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Whisk milk and eggs together in a bowl. Stir biscuit mix, Parmesan cheese, salt, and black pepper together in a separate bowl. Dip asparagus into milk mixture. Roll and coat asparagus in dry ingredient mixture. Repeat with a second layer for each asparagus. Carefully place coated asparagus in the hot oil; fry until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes.
