Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 6 cups in a muffin pan. Cream together butter and sugar in a mixing bowl. Mix in eggs. Add flour, cocoa powder, and baking soda and blend thoroughly. Spoon batter into muffin cups. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool and decorate.
