Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, carrot, and celery until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, bay leaves, parsley, thyme, rosemary, and dill weed; cook until garlic is fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour water into onion mixture and bring to a boil. Stir chicken base into the boiling water until dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Add tomatoes with green chiles, potatoes, and green beans; bring soup to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Add browned mushrooms to the soup. Stir heavy cream and kale into soup; cook until kale is tender and soup is heated through, about 5 minutes.
