Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Let the pie crust stand at room temperature for 15 minutes or until it's easy to handle. Put the potatoes, vegetables and beef in a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate or 1 1/2-quart baking dish. Stir the soup, water, Worcestershire and thyme in a medium bowl. Pour the soup mixture over the beef mixture. Gently put the pie crust over the beef mixture. Crimp or roll the edges to seal it to the dish. Cut slits in the crust with a knife. Bake for 35 minutes or until hot and the crust is golden brown.
