Sift the flour and salt into a medium bowl. Beat the eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed for 3 minutes. Gradually add the granulated sugar, beating until the batter falls off the beater in ribbons. Use a large rubber spatula to fold in the dry ingredients, followed by the butter, orange-flower water, and lemon zest. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Let rest at room temperature for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter two madeleine pans (for 20 to 24 madeleines). Spoon the batter into the prepared pans. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown and springy to the touch, rotating the pans halfway through for even baking. Cool in the pans for 15 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar just before serving.
