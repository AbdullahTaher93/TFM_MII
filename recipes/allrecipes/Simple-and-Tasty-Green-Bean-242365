Place green beans, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper into a resealable plastic bag; marinate for 10 minutes. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Spread green beans into a shallow baking pan; place under the broiler and cook until barely tender, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
