Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Arrange tortilla strips on a baking sheet and lightly with cooking spray. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. Heat peanut oil in a stockpot over medium-high heat; saute onion, red bell pepper, and garlic until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add tomatoes with juice, zucchini, corn, and mushrooms; saute until zucchini is slightly softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Mix vegetable broth, chili powder, hot sauce, salt, and pepper into vegetable mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer soup until vegetables are tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir cilantro into soup and remove stockpot from heat. Ladle soup into serving bowls; top with tortilla strips, avocado slices, and Monterey Jack cheese.
