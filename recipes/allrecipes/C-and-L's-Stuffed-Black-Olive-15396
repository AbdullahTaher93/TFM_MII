In a large skillet over medium high heat, cook ground beef and ground pork until evenly browned. Drain meats. Mix in Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion, parsley flakes, Parmesan cheese, and salt and pepper. Continue cooking over medium high heat 1 to 2 minutes, until thoroughly blended. Beat eggs in a small bowl. Place Italian-style dried bread crumbs in a small bowl. Stuff the olives with the meat mixture. Dip the stuffed olives into the eggs, then into the bread crumb mixture. Place coated olives on a flat surface and let them sit for 10 minutes. Heat vegetable oil in the deep fryer or large, heavy saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Repeat the process of dipping each olive into the egg and bread mixture. In small batches, fry the olives 1 to 2 minutes, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
