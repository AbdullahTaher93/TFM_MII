Heat barbecue to medium heat. Place cream cheese spread on 8-inch square sheet of heavy-duty foil; top with pesto, tomatoes and shredded cheese. Place on barbecue grate. Grill 8 to 10 min. or until shredded cheese is melted and cream cheese is softened, but still holding its shape. Serve with crackers.
