Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover the saucepan, and steam until broccoli is tender, 2 to 4 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Puree parsley, walnuts, and olive oil together in a blender or food processor until sauce is smooth. Stir quinoa, broccoli, tomato, cucumber, and leeks together in a large bowl. Pour parsley sauce over quinoa mixture and toss to coat completely. Sprinkle blue cheese over the top and season with sea salt.
