In a 5- to 6-quart pan over medium-high heat, melt butter. Add onions and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are soft but not brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in thyme, bay leaf, and broth. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, cut potatoes into 1/2-inch cubes. Add potatoes to boiling broth; reduce heat, cover, and boil gently until potatoes are tender when pierced, about 10 minutes. Stir in corn kernels and simmer until they are tender to bite, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in milk and cream. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, just until steaming; do not boil. Remove and discard bay leaf. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls and offer cheese to add to taste.
