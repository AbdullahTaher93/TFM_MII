In a 12-inch nonstick ovenproof frying pan or cast-iron pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over moderate heat. Add the potato and salt and saute until the potato cubes are brown and just done, about 5 minutes. Remove from the pan and let cool. In a large bowl, beat the eggs with the pepper and Parmesan. Stir in the salami and the potato. Add the butter and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pan. Melt the butter over moderate heat. Pour the egg mixture in the pan and reduce the heat to low. Sprinkle the goat cheese over the top. Cook until the eggs are nearly set, 6 to 7 minutes. Heat the broiler. Broil the frittata 6 inches from the heat, if possible, until the eggs are set, about 2 minutes. Loosen the frittata with a spatula and slide the frittata onto a plate. Cut into wedges and serve.
