Mix cornstarch, broth, soy, sherry, marmalade and pepper flakes. Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. When wisps of smoke start to rise from the pan, stir-fry steak in 2 batches, cooking until well-browned, about 3 minutes per batch. Return steak to skillet; add orange zest, garlic and ginger; stir-fry until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour broth mixture over beef and stir constantly to blend. Bring to a boil and cook until sauce thickens and flavors blend, about 2 minutes. Stir in green onions and serve hot.
