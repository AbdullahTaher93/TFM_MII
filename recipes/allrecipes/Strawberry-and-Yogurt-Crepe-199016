Combine flour, 2 tablespoons of SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, and salt in large bowl. Place eggs, milk, trans-free margarine, and 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract in blender. Add flour mixture to egg mixture and blend until it reaches the consistency of cream. Allow batter to stand at room temperature 15 minutes. Whisk yogurt, SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract in small bowl. Set aside. Sprinkle berries with remaining 1 tablespoon SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener. Set aside. Coat 10-inch nonstick skillet (with an 8-inch cooking diameter) with cooking spray and heat over medium-low heat. Pour a scant 1/4 cup of batter into center of heated pan and swirl. When just set, about 40 to 60 seconds, flip with spatula and cook 20 to 30 seconds longer. Remove to plate and repeat to create 16 crepes. Spread each crepe with 1 tablespoon of yogurt mixture (leaving 1/2 inch border) and sprinkle several sliced strawberries down center of each. Roll from bottom up. Place 2 crepes on each plate and serve.
