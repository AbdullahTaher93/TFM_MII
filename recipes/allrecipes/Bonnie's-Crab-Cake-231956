Mix crabmeat, bread crumbs, seafood seasoning, parsley, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Beat egg with mayonnaise, and mustard in a separate bowl. Stir egg mixture into crabmeat mixture; shape into 6 patties. Lightly grease a baking sheet. Arrange patties onto baking sheet; refrigerate 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake patties in preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.
