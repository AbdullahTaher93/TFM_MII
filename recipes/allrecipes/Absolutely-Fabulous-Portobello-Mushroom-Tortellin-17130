Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Meanwhile, prepare mushrooms by rinsing and thinly slicing the mushroom caps; discard the stems. In a medium skillet over low heat, combine wine, parsley, garlic and mushrooms; stirring frequently, saute for approximately 5 minutes or until mushrooms are cooked through. Remove skillet from heat and slowly add Alfredo sauce, stirring to blend; season with salt and pepper to taste. Separate hot pasta into four portions and spoon sauce over pasta. Garnish with cheese and serve immediately.
