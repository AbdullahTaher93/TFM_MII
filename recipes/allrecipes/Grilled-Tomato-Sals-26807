Preheat the broiler. Arrange tomatoes on a medium baking sheet. Checking frequently and turning occasionally, broil tomatoes until darkened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and place in a small, sealed container to cool, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove and discard tomato skins. Chop tomatoes and place in a medium bowl. Mix in red onion, garlic, red chile peppers, cilantro, olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Cover and allow to stand about 1 hour before serving.
