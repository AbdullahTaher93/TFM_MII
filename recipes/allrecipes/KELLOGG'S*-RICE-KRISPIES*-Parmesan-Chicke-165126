In large plate or shallow pan, combine crushed cereal, Parmesan cheese and herbs. Stir in melted margarine. In medium bowl, beat egg and milk slightly. Stir in flour and salt; mix until smooth. Dip chicken in batter, then coat with cereal mixture. Place in single layer on foil-lined baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray. Bake at 180 degrees C (350 degrees F) about 35 minutes or until no longer pink in centre. (Do not cover or turn chicken while cooking.)
