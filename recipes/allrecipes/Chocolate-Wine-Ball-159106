In a large bowl, combine the vanilla wafers, confectioners' sugar, cocoa powder, corn syrup and red wine. Mix with a sturdy spoon or your hands until it becomes a uniform dough. Shape into 1 inch balls and roll in red decorator sugar. Store in a covered container in the refrigerator. Allow to come to room temperature before serving.
