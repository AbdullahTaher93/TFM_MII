Microwave Ghirardelli(R) 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Chips and butter in a large bowl microwave-safe bowl at medium (50%)power.

Spread brownie batter into prepared pan and bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove pan to cooling rack to cool completely. Once brownies are completely cooled, remove them from the pan and cut into 12 squares. For a circular presentation, use a 1 1/2 inch biscuit cutter to cut out 12 brownie bites.

Spoon melted Ghirardelli Dark Melting Wafers over the top of the brownie bite, making sure the top and all sides are completely covered and smooth. Allow any excess to drip off, and carefully use a knife or fork to slide the candy-coated brownie onto the prepared baking pan. If desired, top each brownie bite with a piece of candied orange peel and allow candy coating to set before serving.
