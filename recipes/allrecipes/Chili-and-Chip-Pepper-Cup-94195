Heat grill. Cut peppers lengthwise in half; leaving stem ends intact. Remove seeds from peppers. In large bowl, combine chili, cheese, chips, salsa and cilantro. Evenly divide chili mixture among each pepper half. Place peppers directly on grate of grill. Grill over medium-high heat for 15-20 minutes or until peppers are roasted and filling is hot and bubbly. If desired, garnish with fresh, chopped cilantro.
