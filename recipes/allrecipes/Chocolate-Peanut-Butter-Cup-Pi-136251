Place peanut butter in large bowl. Gradually add milk, stirring with wire whisk until well blended. Add dry pudding mix. Beat 2 min. or until well blended. (Mixture will be thick.) Stir in half of the whipped topping. Spoon into crust; top evenly with the remaining whipped topping. Refrigerate 3 hours or until set. When ready to serve, microwave fudge topping as directed on package; drizzle over pie. Store leftover pie in refrigerator.
