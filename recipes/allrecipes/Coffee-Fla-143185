Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Melt 1/2 cup of sugar slowly in a heavy saucepan, until the sugar has caramelized and turns a golden brown color. Pour into a 9 X 13 pan or a 1 1/2 quart souffle dish, and swirl so that it completely covers the bottom of the pan. Beat the eggs slightly with the remaining 1/3 cup of sugar. Add the LACTAID(R) Fat Free Milk slowly, while stirring. Add the vanilla, the instant coffee dissolved in water, and the cinnamon. Strain and slowly pour the strained mixture carefully into the prepared pan. Place the dish in a pan of lukewarm water. The water should come to 2/3 of the dish and should never boil during the baking. Bake until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Immediately remove from oven and let cool in refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or overnight, before serving. To serve, run a knife around the edge of the flan; place a serving platter with a rim upside down on top of the dish and invert. The flan will easily slide out and the caramel sauce will run onto the platter. To serve, cut into wedges; spoon on sauce.
