Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain. Whisk flour and lemon-pepper seasoning together in a shallow bowl; dredge chicken through mixture until evenly coated, shaking excess back into bowl. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook chicken until light golden brown and no longer pink in the center, 6 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to a plate, retaining oil mixture in the skillet. Mix white wine, lemon juice, water, and chicken bouillon granules into oil mixture in the skillet. Bring liquid to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon until sauce is slightly reduced, 2 to 4 minutes. Stir capers into sauce. Divide pasta among serving plates; top with chicken. Spoon sauce over chicken and garnish with lemon wedges and parsley.
