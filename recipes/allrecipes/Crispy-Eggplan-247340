Spread eggplant slices on paper towels. Sprinkle generously with coarse salt. Let excess moisture drain from eggplant, about 30 minutes. Rinse and pat dry. Combine sesame seeds, hazelnuts, coriander seeds, turmeric, and ginger in a small skillet over low heat. Toast until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and stir in bread crumbs. Press eggplant slices into bread crumb mixture to coat both sides. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry eggplants in batches until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Sprinkle fresh cilantro, Espelette pepper, and sea salt over eggplants. Serve with mango chutney.
