Fill a 5- to 6-quart pan with about two inches of water; cover and put on the stove over high heat. When water boils, arrange green beans on a steamer insert and place in pan. Steam beans 5 minutes or until just tender to the bite. (If you don't have a steamer, boil beans by adding them to a pan one-third filled with boiling water and cook until tender.) Drain beans and arrange on serving platter. Meanwhile, in another pan, melt butter with lemon juice, marjoram, and pistachios until sizzling; pour over green beans and serve.
