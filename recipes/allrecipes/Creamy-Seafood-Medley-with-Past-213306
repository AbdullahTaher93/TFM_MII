Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the broccoli, celery, onion, mushrooms and garlic and cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir the scallops and shrimp in the skillet and cook for 3 minutes. Stir in the soup, parsley and black pepper and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes or until the scallops are cooked through. Serve the seafood mixture over the spaghetti.
