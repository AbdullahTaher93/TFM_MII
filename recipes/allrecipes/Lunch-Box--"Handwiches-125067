Allow dough to rise according to package directions. Punch down; divide into 10 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 5-in. circle. Place about 1/4 cup ham and 2 tablespoons cheese on each circle; press filling to flatten. Mix egg yolk and water; brush on edges of circles. Fold into semicircles and pinch edges to seal. Brush tops with egg yolk mixture. Place on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm or cold. If desired, cool and freeze.
