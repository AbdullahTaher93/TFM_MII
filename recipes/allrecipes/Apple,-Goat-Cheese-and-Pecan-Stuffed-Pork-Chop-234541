Slice the pork loin into 1-inch thick chops. In a medium pot, bring 4 cups water, lemon juice, honey and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a boil for 2 minutes. Remove from heat, add 2 cups cold water. Pour the brine into a plastic container large enough for the chops. Add the chops, brine overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place pecans on a baking sheet and bake for 5 minutes or until golden brown. For the stuffing: In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the apple slices, brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Saute until tender. Remove from heat and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Add the chopped pecans and goat cheese. Remove the chops from the brine. Slit each chop horizontally to create a large hole for the stuffing. Spoon the stuffing into the chops. Season each chop with salt and pepper to taste. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, sear each chop in extra virgin olive oil. Place chops on a baking pan and bake for 20-30 minutes until internal temperature is 155-160 degrees F.
