Heat oil in a wide-bottomed saucepan or deep skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and bell pepper in the hot oil until onion is translucent and bell pepper is tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Combine garlic, curry powder, paprika, black pepper, ginger, and cayenne pepper in a bowl; stir in water until paste-like. Add curry paste to onion mixture. Mix chicken into onion mixture until chicken is coated in curry paste; cook and stir until chicken is lightly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Stir mango nectar, tomato paste, and vinegar into chicken mixture. Reduce heat and simmer until sauce is thickened and chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes.
