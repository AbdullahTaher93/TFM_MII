Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly flour an oven bag. In a small bowl, blend brown sugar, applesauce, and ginger. Place pork roast in the prepared oven bag. Pour the brown sugar mixture over the roast. Seal bag, and cut several small slits in the top. Cook the roast 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until the internal temperature has reached 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
