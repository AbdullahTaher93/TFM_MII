Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (215 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin pan. In a small bowl, combine 1 cup of the oats and the buttermilk. Let soak for 30 minutes. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. In a large bowl, stir together the oil, egg, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until well-blended. Stir in the oat mixture. Stir in the flour mixture until just combined. Do not overmix. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups, filling them about two-thirds full. Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons oats over the muffins. Bake for 11 to 15 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Cool on a rack for 5 minutes. Remove to the rack to cool completely.
