Season roast with salt and pepper. In a large frying pan over high heat, heat oil. Add beef and cook, turning, until well browned on all sides, about 15 minutes. Transfer meat to a slow cooker. Reduce heat beneath pan to medium. Pour in wine and broth and, using a wooden spoon, scrape up any browned bits stuck to pan. Add prunes, olives, and garlic, bring to a boil, then pour mixture over beef in slow cooker. Turn slow cooker to HIGH setting, cover, and let cook until meat is tender when pierced, 3 to 3 1/2 hours. Lift out roast from slow cooker (it may come out in pieces). Coarsely shred with two forks. Return meat to liquid. Stir in parsley. Serve over mashed potatoes or buttered noodles.
