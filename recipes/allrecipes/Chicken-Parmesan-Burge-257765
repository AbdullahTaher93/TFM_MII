Combine chicken, egg, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon tomato paste, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Form mixture into 4 patties. Press gently to flatten. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet. Cook patties until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a large plate. Cook and stir onion in the drippings left in the skillet until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in remaining 2 tablespoons tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, and chicken stock. Cook until thickened and reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Return patties to the skillet; cover with tomato sauce. Place 1 slice of provolone cheese over each patty. Cover skillet and cook until cheese melts slightly, about 1 minute. Place patties on buns; spoon tomato sauce on top.
