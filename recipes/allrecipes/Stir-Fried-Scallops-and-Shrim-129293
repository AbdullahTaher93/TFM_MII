Mix together the lemon or lime juice, honey, and 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce. Pour this marinade over the scallops and shrimp and set aside to marinate about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, place the wakame in a bowl, cover with 1 1/4 cups cold water; leave to rehydrate, 8 to 10 minutes. Place the noodles in a large mixing bowl and pour in enough boiling water to cover them generously. Leave to soak until tender, about 4 minutes, or according to package directions. Drain when they are ready. Drain the scallops and shrimp, reserving the marinade, and pat dry with paper towels. Heat a wok or heavy-bottomed skillet until very hot. Add the oil and swirl to coat the wok or pan. Add the scallops and shrimp and stir-fry until the shrimp turn pink and the scallops are opaque, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the scallops and shrimp from the wok; set aside. Add the bean sprouts, bok choy, reserved marinade, remaining 1 tablespoon soy sauce and the pickled ginger to the wok and stir-fry 1 to 2 minutes. Return the scallops and shrimp to the wok with the well-drained wakame and stir-fry until just heated through, about 1 minute. Serve the stir-fry with the egg noodles.
