Bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add ramen noodles, reserving seasoning packet for later use. Cook noodles at a boil for 2 minutes; drain and set aside. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir chicken in skillet until completely browned, about 5 minutes. Remove chicken from skillet with a slotted spoon to a bowl, reserving drippings in the skillet. Place a plate over the bowl to keep chicken warm. Increase heat under the skillet to high. Cook and stir broccoli, onion, and garlic in the skillet until slightly tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Mix drained noodles, reserved seasoning from the ramen noodle package, bean sprouts, water, water chestnuts, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and chile-garlic sauce into the broccoli mixture; cook and stir until hot, 3 to 5 minutes. Add tomato wedges; cook until tomatoes are warm, 2 to 3 minutes.
