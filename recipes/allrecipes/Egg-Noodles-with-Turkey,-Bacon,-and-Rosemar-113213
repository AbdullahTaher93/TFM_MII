In a large frying pan, cook the bacon, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and just crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the pan. Heat the remaining bacon fat over moderately high heat. Sprinkle the turkey with 1/4 teaspoon each of the salt and pepper. Add the turkey to the pan, in two batches if necessary, and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown and just cooked through, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Remove any tough stems from the spinach. Add the broth, rosemary, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt to the pan and bring to a simmer, stirring to dislodge any brown bits that cling to the bottom of the pan. Add the spinach and cook, stirring, just until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the noodles until just done, about 3 minutes. Drain. Add the noodles, butter, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper to the frying pan and stir until the butter melts. Stir in the turkey with any accumulated juices and the bacon.
