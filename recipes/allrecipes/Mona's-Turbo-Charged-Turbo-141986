Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Rinse fillets and pat dry. Place the fillets in a single layer in a 13x9x2 inch baking dish. In a bowl, whisk together lime juice, oil, lime peel, garlic, thyme, and pepper. Pour evenly over the fish, turning once to coat. Sprinkle with almonds. Bake, uncovered, 8 to 10 minutes, or until the fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork. Add parsley, if desired.
