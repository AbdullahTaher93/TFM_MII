Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir bison in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Arrange bell peppers, cut-side up, in a baking dish. Slice bottoms of peppers if needed so they stand upright. Mix rice, bison, tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, oregano, all-purpose seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Spoon rice-bison mixture into each bell pepper. Mix diced tomatoes and Italian seasoning together in a bowl; pour over stuffed peppers. Bake in the preheated oven, basting with diced tomatoes mixture every 15 minutes, until peppers are tender, about 1 hour.
