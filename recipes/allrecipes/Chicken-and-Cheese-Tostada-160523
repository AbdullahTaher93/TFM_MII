Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place tortillas in single layer on large baking sheet. Spray tortillas with cooking spray; sprinkle with 1 tsp. of the seasoning mix. Bake 7 to 8 min. or until crisp and golden brown. Meanwhile, mix chicken, remaining seasoning mix and the water in large skillet. Bring to boil on medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer 5 min. or until chicken is cooked through, stirring occasionally. Add 1-1/2 cups of the tomatoes. Cook until heated through, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat; stir in 1-1/2 cups of the cheese. Spoon chicken mixture evenly over tortillas. Top with the remaining 1/2 cup cheese, remaining 1/2 cup tomatoes, the sour cream and cilantro.
