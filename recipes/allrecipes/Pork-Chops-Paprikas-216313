Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork and cook until well browned on both sides. Remove the pork from the skillet. Reduce the heat to medium. Stir the onions and paprika in the skillet and cook until the onions are tender, stirring occasionally. Stir the soup, water, black pepper and sour cream in the skillet and heat to a boil. Return the pork to the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Cook until the pork is cooked through. Serve the pork and sauce with the noodles.
