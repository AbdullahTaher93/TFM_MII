To a 1- to 1 1/2-quart pan, add 1/2 cup broth; bring to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat and stir in saffron powder. Set aside. In a heavy-bottomed, 5- to 6-quart nonstick pan, saute leek over low heat in 1/2 cup broth to soften. Add garlic and saute another 3 minutes. Add tomatoes, thyme, fennel seed, saffron-infused broth, and remaining 8 cups broth to pan. Simmer, partially covered, for 30 minutes. Stir in spinach and serve immediately. May also be served at room temperature.
