Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add salt and green beans. Simmer 1 minute. Add spaghetti and continue cooking over medium to medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, 8 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; add spiralized zucchini. Stir gently and continue simmering until spaghetti is tender yet firm to the bite, 2 or 3 minutes. Reserve about 1/2 cup cooking water. Drain the spaghetti and vegetables. Heat pesto in a pot over medium-low heat; add a few tablespoons of cooking water to thin slightly; stir. Transfer drained spaghetti and vegetables to pot; mix gently to coat with the sauce. Transfer spaghetti to a warmed serving bowl. Drizzle with olive oil; top with grated cheese, red pepper flakes, and pine nuts.
