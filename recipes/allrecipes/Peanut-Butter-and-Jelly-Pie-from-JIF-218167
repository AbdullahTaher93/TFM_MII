Whisk together pudding mix and milk in medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on HIGH 5 minutes or until pudding comes to a boil, stirring every 2 minutes. Add 3/4 cup peanut butter, whisking until well blended. Pour into pie crust. Cover and chill at least 2 hours. Stir preserves in a small bowl. Spoon onto pie, along inside edge of crust, creating a 1-inch wide border. Place remaining 1/4 cup peanut butter in small resealable plastic bag. Microwave on HIGH 10 seconds to warm. Knead peanut butter. Cut a very small hole in bottom corner of plastic bag. Drizzle peanut butter across pie. Chill until serving.
