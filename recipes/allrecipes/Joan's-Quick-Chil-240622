Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and garlic in hot oil until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir kidney beans, onion, and bell pepper with the beef mixture. Pour tomato sauce over the beef mixture; season with chili powder and salt. Stir the mixture so the sauce coats everything, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chili thickens, about 45 minutes.
