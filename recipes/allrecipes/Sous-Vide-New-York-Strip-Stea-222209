Fill a large Dutch oven about 2/3 full with water. Bring water to 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) over medium heat. Attach a candy/oil thermometer to the side of the Dutch oven in order to monitor and maintain the water temperature. Generously season steaks with salt and black pepper. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat. Place steaks in skillet and cook until just browned, 1 minute per side. Transfer steaks to a resealable plastic bag, squeeze out all air, and seal. Place plastic bag containing steaks in the Dutch oven, adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain the temperature at 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Cook for 2 1/2 hours, moving the bag around occasionally and maintaining the temperature. While the steaks are cooking, heat 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet over medium-low heat. Add mushrooms; cook, stirring, until mushrooms are soft, 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside. Remove steaks from plastic bag (reserving any accumulated juices) and pat dry. Generously season with salt and pepper. Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in the skillet over high heat. Place steaks in skillet and cook to form a crust, 2 minutes per side. Transfer steaks to a plate. Stir garlic and reserved mushrooms into skillet, reduce heat to medium, and cook until mushrooms are reheated, 2 minutes. Stir in reserved juices, water, and balsamic vinegar. Remove from heat. Stir in 1 tablespoon cold butter until completely melted and incorporated. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon sauce over steaks and serve.
