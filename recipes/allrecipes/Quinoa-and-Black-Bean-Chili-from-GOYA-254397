In a medium pot, bring quinoa, 1 1/2 cups water and 1/2 of olive oil to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and let simmer for 20 minutes, until water is absorbed and quinoa is tender. Set aside. Meanwhile, in a large pot, heat remaining olive oil on medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic, and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chili powder, cumin and oregano, and stir for about 1 minute. Stir in tomato sauce, black beans, green and red peppers, chipotle peppers and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil; then reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, stir in reserved quinoa and corn. Cook for another 5 minutes. Serve and top with fresh cilantro sprigs.
