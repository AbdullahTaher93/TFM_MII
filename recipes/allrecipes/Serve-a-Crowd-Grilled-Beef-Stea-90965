Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Place 28- x 18-inch piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil in roasting pan. Combine chili powder, brown sugar, pepper sauce, and garlic; spread on beef steaks. Place steaks in center of foil; top with onions and chili sauce. Bring shorter ends of foil together above steaks; fold down to seal. Fold in sides of foil to seal. Bake 1 3/4 hours or until steaks are fork-tender. Carefully open foil. Remove steaks; keep warm. Transfer onions and cooking liquid to medium saucepan; bring to a boil. Cook and stir 3 minutes or until slightly thickened. Carve steaks; top with onion mixture. Serve with rolls and toppings.
