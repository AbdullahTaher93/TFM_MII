Place corn into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and cool corn. Cut kernels from cob. Mix corn kernels, black beans, avocados, cilantro, tomatoes, onion, and jalapeno pepper together in a bowl. Whisk olive oil, lime zest, and lime juice together in a bowl; pour over corn mixture and toss to coat. Refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.
