In a soup pot, heat the EVOO, 3 turns of the pan, over medium-high heat. Add the potatoes, celery, carrots, onions and bay leaf and cook until softened, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the broth tomato sauce, chickpeas and kidney beans, cover and bring to a boil. Add the green beans and cook until just tender, 5 minutes. Season liberally with salt and pepper (the stoup is thick--you can add a little water if you prefer it a little soupier). Stir in the relish and parsley and turn off the heat. Discard the bay leaf. Top the stoup with the dill sprigs and serve with the bread.
