Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Hold an egg in one hand, tapered end up. Place an egg topper over the top, and squeeze, using a scissor motion. Discard top of egg shell. Pour egg into a medium bowl. Repeat with remaining eggs. Boil shells for 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a wire rack. Let dry, cut sides down. Whisk together eggs and cream. Season with salt and pepper. Melt butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add eggs. Using a rubber spatula, stir to create curds and slide eggs from edges to center. Cook until set, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer eggs to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain round tip. Pipe eggs into shells. Transfer shells to egg cups. Top with creme fraiche and caviar.
