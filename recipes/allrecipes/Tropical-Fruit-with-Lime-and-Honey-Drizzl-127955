Peel the kiwis and cut into quarters. Cut the quarters into 1/4 inch-thick slices. Trim and peel the pineapple. Dice half the pineapple into 1/4-inch pieces. (Reserve the remaining half for another use.) Cut the papaya in two, reserving half for another use. Use a small spoon to remove the seeds from the remaining half. Cut into large dice. Combine the kiwis, pineapple, and papaya in a large bowl and add 1 tablespoon of the lime juice. Gently stir. Whisk the remaining tablespoon of lime juice, honey, and zest in a small bowl until blended. Just before serving, spoon the fruit into four chilled bowls or plates. Drizzle each with a spoonful of the honey mixture and sprinkle with pomegranate seeds.
