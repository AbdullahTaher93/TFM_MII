Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg in a large bowl. Pour milk and margarine into the egg. Slowly stream the soup into the egg mixture while stirring to prevent lumps. Stir rice, zucchini, and Cheddar cheese into the mixture; pour into an 8-inch baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until set, about 30 minutes.
