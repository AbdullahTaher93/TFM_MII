Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spread almonds in a shallow baking pan. Bake until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Pour from pan and set aside. While almonds bake, rinse chicken and pat dry. Cut chicken crosswise into 1/2-inch strips; set aside. Cut each papaya half lengthwise into quarters, then cut each piece in half crosswise. Place papaya pieces in a bowl, add lime juice, and gently mix to coat fruit. In another bowl, combine chutney, broth, cornstarch, and ginger; mix well. Place a wok or a 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. When pan is hot, add butter and oil. When butter is melted and sizzling, add chicken and stir-fry until chicken is just barely pink in center of thickest part (cut to test), about 5 minutes. Add chutney mixture to pan. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Add papaya and cook, stirring gently, just until fruit is heated through, about 1 minute. Remove from heat, season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve.
