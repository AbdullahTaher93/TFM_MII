Steam asparagus to desired doneness. The amount of time depends on the freshness and thickness of the asparagus and how much crunch that you like. I prefer asparagus that is 'pencil size' which I steam for about 2 minutes in the microwave (with 1 Tbsp of water and tightly covered). For conventional steaming, it generally takes 3-4 minutes. Careful not to over-cook. Melt the butter in a small sauce pan or zap it in the microwave. Add the lemon pepper and the lemon zest. Stir. Pour over the asparagus and serve.
