Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine chopped pepperoni, ground beef, tomato sauce, cracker crumbs, Parmesan cheese, eggs, minced onion, French-fried onions, garlic powder, oregano, and tarragon in a large bowl; form into a loaf in a loaf pan. Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Place a layer of sliced pepperoni on the top of meatloaf and bake for 5 minutes more.
