Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Meanwhile, place ground beef in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and combine with spaghetti sauce. In a large bowl toss pasta with Parmesan cheese and eggs. Press into a 9-inch pie plate and spread sauce mixture over pasta. Top with American cheese and sprinkle with mozzarella. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before cutting into wedges.
