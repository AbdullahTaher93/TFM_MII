Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry. Combine cream of tartar, baking powder, vanilla, cinnamon, oats, and mashed bananas. In a separate bowl combine the flour, confectioner's sugar, and salt. Fold the banana mixture into the egg whites. Then fold the flour mixture into the egg white/banana mixture. Pour batter into one 9 or 10 inch round cake pan, coated with a non-stick cooking spray. Bake at 325 degrees (165 degrees C) for 1 hour, until cake is firm and lightly golden. Cool for five minutes then slip out of pan onto a serving dish. Garnish with a light dusting of confectioner's sugar.
