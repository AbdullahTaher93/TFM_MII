In a bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add egg substitute, milk and oil; stir just until moistened. Fill miniature muffin cups coated with nonstick cooking spray three-fourths full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
