In a saucepan, cook the beef and onion until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in ketchup, pickles, salt, pepper, garlic powder and hot pepper sauce; heat through. Stir in cheese. Place about 1/3 cupful on six buns; serve immediately. Cover and refrigerate remaining meat mixture until cool. Fill the remaining buns; wrap individually in heavy-duty foil and seal tightly. Freeze for up to 3 months. To use frozen sandwiches: Bake in foil at 400 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until heated through.
