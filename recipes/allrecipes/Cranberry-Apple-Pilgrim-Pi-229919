Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Unroll pie crust onto parchment-covered baking sheet; roll to 12-inch circle. Mix dry pudding mix and cinnamon in large bowl. Add fruit and nuts and 2 Tbsp. water; toss to evenly coat. Spoon onto center of crust; fold edge of pastry over fruit mixture. (Fruit in center will remain uncovered.) Beat egg and remaining water with fork until blended; brush onto crust. (Discard any remaining egg wash.) Sprinkle crust with sugar. Bake 30 to 35 min. or until fruit is tender and crust is golden brown. Cool completely.
