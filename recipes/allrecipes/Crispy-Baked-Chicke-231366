Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place bread into a food processor and blend until crumbled. Transfer bread crumbs to a shallow bowl. Add 1 cup Parmesan cheese, oregano, basil, and garlic; stir to combine. Press chicken breast halves into bread crumb mixture until coated; arrange on a large baking dish. Drizzle chicken with vegetable oil and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
