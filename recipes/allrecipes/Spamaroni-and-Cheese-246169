Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain. Place macaroni, cheese, cubed luncheon meat, and milk in a large bowl; mix well to combine. Turn out into casserole dish. Sprinkle bread crumbs on top. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 15 minutes.
