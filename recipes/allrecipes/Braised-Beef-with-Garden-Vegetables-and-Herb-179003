Season the beef with the black pepper. Spray a 6-quart saucepot with the cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Add the beef and cook until it's well browned, stirring often. Add the onion and garlic and cook until the onion is tender-crisp. Stir the soup in the saucepot and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 45 minutes. Add the potato and carrots to the saucepot. Cover and cook for 30 minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Garnish with parsley, if desired.
