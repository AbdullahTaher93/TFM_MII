Sprinkle beef strips with fajita seasoning. Saute beef in oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat 3 to 4 minutes. Add peppers and onion and saute 2 to 3 minutes longer or until vegetables are tender-crisp. Divide lettuce on 2 large plates. Spoon beef mixture over lettuce and arrange tomatoes, beans, olives and cheese over each. Serve with Southwest Fiesta Dressing, to taste. Refrigerate leftovers.
