In a mixing bowl, combine 2 cups all-purpose flour, rye flour, milk powder, yeast, sugar, salt and seasonings. In a saucepan, heat water and shortening to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Shape into two balls. Place on two greased baking sheets. Cover and let rest in a warm place until doubled, about 35 minutes. With a sharp knife, make several shallow slashes across the top of each loaf. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
