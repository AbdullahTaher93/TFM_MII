Make Butterscotch Sauce: In a medium saucepan combine brown sugar, corn syrup, 1/4 cup LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, and butter. Bring just to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes. Make Waffles: In a large mixing bowl stir together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt. In a medium bowl combine the egg yolks, LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, and oil; stir into flour mixture all at once, stirring just until combined but still slightly lumpy. Stir peanuts into batter. Set aside. In a small bowl beat egg whites until stiff peaks form (tips stand straight). Gently fold egg whites into batter, leaving a few fluffs of egg white. Do not overmix. Pour 1 to 1 1/4 cups of batter onto grids of a preheated, lightly greased waffle baker. Close lid quickly; do not open during baking. Bake according to manufacturer's directions. When done, use a fork to lift waffle off grid. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve hot with warm Butterscotch Sauce and, if desired, fresh berries.
