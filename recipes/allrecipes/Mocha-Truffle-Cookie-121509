In a saucepan over low heat, melt butter and 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Remove from the heat; stir until smooth. Stir in coffee granules; cool for 5 minutes. Stir in eggs, sugars and vanilla. Combine flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt; fold into the chocolate mixture. Add the remaining chocolate chips. Drop by round teaspoonfuls 2 in. apart onto greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 9-11 minutes or until tops appear slightly dry and cracked. Cool for 1 minute before removing to wire racks.
