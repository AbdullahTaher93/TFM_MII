Place each turkey cutlet between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. Working from the center to the edges, lightly pound with the flat side of a meat mallet or the back of a large, heavy spoon to 1/4-inch (5-mm) thickness. Remove the turkey from the plastic and sprinkle with the thyme, black pepper, and salt (if using). Melt the margarine or butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook the turkey for 2 minutes per side, or until tender and cooked through. (Do not overcook.) Cover and set aside. In a 4-cup (1-L) glass measure, mix the oil, onions, green peppers, and garlic. Cover with a piece of wax paper. Microwave on high power for a total of 3 to 4 minutes, or until the vegetables are almost tender; stop and stir after 2 minutes. Stir in the ketchup, water, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, mustard, and cloves. Cover and microwave for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Pour the sauce over the turkey in the skillet. Stir until the turkey is coated. Spoon the turkey mixture over the English muffin halves.
