Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble bacon. Whisk red wine vinegar, seasoned rice vinegar, anchovies, and white pepper together in a bowl until dressing is evenly mixed. Heat olive oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat; saute onion and garlic until onion is transparent, 5 to 10 minutes. Lower heat to medium. Add spinach, working in batches, to onion mixture, tossing and mixing until spinach wilts, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer spinach mixture to a serving bowl; top with egg slices and bacon. Pour dressing into the wok; bring to just under a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Pour dressing over spinach mixture; sprinkle with green onions and Asiago cheese.
