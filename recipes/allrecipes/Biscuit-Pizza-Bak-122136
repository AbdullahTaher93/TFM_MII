In a skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink. Meanwhile, quarter the biscuits; place in a greased shallow 3-qt. baking dish. Top with pizza sauce. Drain beef; sprinkle over biscuits and sauce. Layer with green pepper, onion, mushrooms, pepperoni and cheeses. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until cheese is melted. Let stand for 5-10 minutes before serving.
