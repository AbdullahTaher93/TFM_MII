Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook the onion and celery until tender, stirring frequently. Stir in the broth, corn, chilies, parsley, poultry seasoning and oregano; mix well. Add the cornbread crumbs and nuts; gently toss until just moistened. Spoon into a 13-inch by 9-inch baking pan, cover and bake 30 minutes or until heated through.
