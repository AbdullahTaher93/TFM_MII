Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In bowl, combine bread crumbs, butter, egg, and corn. Mix until it is a stiff stuffing. Cut parallel into each chop to create a pocket. Stuff each pork chop with stuffing mix. Place chops in a cooking dish and then pour mushroom soup over top. Bake for about 45 minutes or until chops are cooked all the way through.
