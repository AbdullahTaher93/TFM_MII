In a blender or food processor, combine eggs, mayonnaise, sour cream, Worcestershire sauce, and mustard. Season with dill, rosemary, and lemon zest, salt, and pepper. Blend until smooth, then spoon into a medium bowl. Stir in tuna. Serve tuna salad topped with slices of red onion and a generous amount of arugula between slices of bread.
