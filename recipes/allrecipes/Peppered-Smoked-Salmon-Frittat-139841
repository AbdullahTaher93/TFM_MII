Melt butter in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium low heat. Add green onions; cook until beginning to soften, about 1 minute. Whisk eggs with milk and salt until well blended. Pour over onions in skillet. Cook, pushing down on sides and occasionally cutting into center with spatula until partially set, about 5 minutes. Scatter cream cheese and salmon over eggs; press gently into eggs with spatula. Cover and cook on low heat 5 minutes. Remove from heat; let stand until eggs are just set, about 5 minutes.
