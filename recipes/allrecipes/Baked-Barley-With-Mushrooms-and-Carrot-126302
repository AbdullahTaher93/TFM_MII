Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Melt the butter in an ovenproof Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the carrots, onion, and 1 tablespoon of the broth. Cook, stirring frequently, for 8 minutes, or until tender, adding another 1 tablespoon broth halfway through cooking. Add the mushrooms and 2 tablespoons of the remaining broth and cook, stirring frequently, for 4 minutes, or until tender. Stir in the remaining 1 cup broth, the water, barley, thyme, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover the pot and place in the oven. Bake for 45 minutes, or until the barley is tender and the liquid is absorbed.
