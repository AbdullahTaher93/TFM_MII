Preheat oven to 400 degrees (205 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine the sweet potatoes, honey, ginger, oil, cardamom and pepper. Transfer to a large cast iron frying pan. Bake for 20 minutes. Turn the mixture over to expose the pieces from the bottom of the pan. Bake for another 20 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are tender and caramelized on the outside.
