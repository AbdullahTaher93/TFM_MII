Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Microwave chocolate and butter in large microwaveable bowl on HIGH 2 min. or until butter is melted. Stir until chocolate is completely melted. Add sugar; mix well. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing until well blended after each addition. Add combined flour and baking powder; mix well. (Dough will be very soft.) Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours. Roll heaping teaspoonfuls of dough into 1-inch balls. Place, 2 inches apart, on greased baking sheets. Bake 10 to 12 min. or until tops are set. (Do not overbake.) Immediately sprinkle with crushed candy canes. Cool 1 min. on baking sheets. Remove to wire racks; cool completely.
