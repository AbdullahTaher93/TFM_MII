Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. In a stockpot over medium-high heat, heat oil and saute carrots, onion and celery. Add tomatoes, potatoes, kidney beans and chicken broth. Bring to a boil and stir in cayenne pepper and tomato paste. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Add sausage and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot.
