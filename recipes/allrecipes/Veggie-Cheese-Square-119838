In a skillet, saute the broccoli, red pepper and garlic in oil. Spoon into a greased 9-in. square baking dish. In a bowl, combine eggs, milk, 3/4 cup cheese, thyme and salt; mix well. Pour over the broccoli mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake 5 minutes longer or until the cheese is melted. Let stand for 5 minutes before cutting.
