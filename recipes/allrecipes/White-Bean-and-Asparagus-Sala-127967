Place the potatoes in a 3-quart saucepan. Add cold water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook for 10 minutes. Add the asparagus; cook for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Drain and rinse gently with cold water. Transfer to a large bowl. Add the beans, onions, scallions and tarragon. Mix lightly. In a small bowl, whisk together the juice, oil, mustard, lemon peel, vinegar and pepper. Pour over the vegetables; toss to mix well.
