Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush an 8-inch square baking dish with 1 tablespoon butter and set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, cottage cheese, cheddar cheese, chiles, flour, baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt and the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Pour into the prepared dish and bake until set, about 35 minutes.
