Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the walnuts in a pie plate and bake for 8 minutes, until toasted. Transfer to a plate and cool. Meanwhile, on a work surface, sprinkle the garlic with a pinch of salt and mash to a paste with the side of a large, heavy knife. Transfer the garlic paste to a bowl and whisk in the goat cheese, then the vinegar and water. Add the olive and walnut oils, thyme and pepper and whisk until blended. In a large bowl, toss the endive, frisee, arugula and apple slices with the walnuts and dressing. Serve at once.
