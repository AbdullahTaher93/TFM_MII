To make sauce, stir together cornstarch and vinegar in a small bowl until blended. Then stir in 3/4 cup water, sugar, catsup, soy sauce, and chili oil. Set aside. In a medium bowl, beat egg white to blend well. Place cornstarch in another medium bowl. Dip pork chunks, a portion at a time, in egg white; then coat lightly with cornstarch and shake off excess. Heat oil in a wide nonstick frying pan or wok over medium-high heat. When oil is hot, add meat and stir-fry gently until golden brown on the outside and no longer pink in center; cut to test (about 8 minutes). Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if pan appears dry. Remove meat from pan with a slotted spoon; keep warm. Add onion, bell pepper, garlic, and 1 tablespoon water to pan; stir-fry for 1 minute. Add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if pan appears dry. Stir sauce well and pour into pan. Cook, stirring, until sauce boils and thickens slightly (2 to 3 minutes). Add tomato, pineapple, and pork to pan. Cook, stirring gently, just until heated through (1 to 2 minutes). Divide mixture between four plates and serve.
