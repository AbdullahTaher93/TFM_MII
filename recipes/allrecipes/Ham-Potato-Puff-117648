Press each biscuit onto the bottom and up the sides of a greased muffin cup. In a bowl, combine the ham, potatoes, 1/2 cup cheese, parsley and garlic powder. Spoon 1/4 cup into each prepared cup. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until lightly browned. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.
