In a medium skillet, fry the Italian sausage and onions until sausage is no longer pink. Drain and set aside. In a small saucepan, cook wild rice with 2 cups of water until tender; set aside. In a stockpot, combine the cooked sausage and onions, rice, potato and chicken soups, milk, and evaporated milk. Cook over low heat until warm. Stir in the processed cheese and heat, stirring occasionally until cheese is melted.
