Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Combine ground beef and green bell pepper in a large skillet; cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes. Drain excess grease. Add red kidney beans, pizza sauce, mushrooms, onion soup mix, and garlic powder; cook and stir until hot and bubbly, about 5 minutes. Pour beef mixture into a 9x12-inch baking dish. Separate biscuit dough into 10 pieces. Place 1 cube Cheddar cheese in the center of each piece; fold up dough to cover cheese completely. Arrange dough pieces over beef mixture in the baking dish. Brush each piece of dough with butter; sprinkle sesame seeds on top. Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.
