In a 3- to 4-quart pan, combine cranberries, raisins, apple juice concentrate, honey, and vinegar with 1/4 cup water. Cook, uncovered, over medium heat until berries begin to pop, about 10 minutes. Stir in ginger, allspice, cloves, cinnamon, cayenne, onion, celery, and apple; simmer, uncovered, until apple is very soft and most of liquid has cooked away, about 40 minutes; stir often. Cool, then discard cinnamon. Serve, or cover and chill as long as 2 weeks (freeze for longer storage).
