Bring 3 quarts water and potatoes to a boil. Cook until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and cool. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat and cook the smoked sausage until browned, about 6-9 minutes. Remove and set aside. Arrange greens on a platter and top with smoked sausage, peppers, tomatoes and sliced potatoes once cool. Drizzle with vinaigrette and serve.
