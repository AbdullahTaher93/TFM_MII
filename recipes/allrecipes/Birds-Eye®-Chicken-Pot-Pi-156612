Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place vegetables in a two quart baking dish. Spread chicken (or turkey) evenly over vegetables. In small saucepan melt butter over medium heat, add flour, beat until smooth. Whisk in chicken broth, cook until thickened and sauce comes to boil. Add cream, cook another minute. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Pour sauce over chicken and vegetables. Separate the biscuits and place over the sauce. Sprinkle parsley over biscuits. Bake 18 to 20 minutes until biscuits are brown and sauce is bubbling.
