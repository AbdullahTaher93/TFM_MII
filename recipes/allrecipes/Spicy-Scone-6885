Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease one baking sheet. Combine the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, white sugar, baking powder, ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg and salt in a bowl and mix well. Cut in the butter until crumbly and stir in the raisins. Make a well in the center. In a small bowl beat the egg until frothy. Mix in the milk and pour into the well made in the dry ingredients. Stir to make a soft dough. Turn dough out on to a lightly floured surface. Knead gently 8 to 10 times. Pat dough into two 6 inch circles and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Brush tops with milk and sprinkle with sugar. Score each top into 6 pie shaped wedges. Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 15 minutes or until well risen and browned. Serve hot with butter. Maple butter goes very well with these scones.
