Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Toss beef tips with canola oil in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Grill steak tips until they are beginning to firm but still slightly pink in the center, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Mix parsley, olive oil, red wine vinegar, red onion, garlic, chipotle peppers, paprika, and oregano together in a bowl; toss with grilled steak tips.
