Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add sausage and onion and saute until onions are translucent. Add bell pepper, garlic, parsley, paprika, cayenne pepper and ground black pepper. Saute all together, stirring occasionally, until bell pepper is a little tender (about 10 minutes). Drain and rinse kidney beans. Add all kidney beans, tomatoes and chile peppers. Stir to mix together, reduce heat to medium and let simmer for 25 to 30 minutes. Add salt to taste while simmering. Serve hot.
