In a large bowl stir together flour, buttermilk powder or milk powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. With a pastry cutter, cut in shortening and pesto until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center; add water all at once. Stir just until dough clings together. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead gently for 10 to 12 strokes. Roll or pat to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut with a 2-1/2-inch biscuit cutter, dipping cutter into flour between cuts. Place biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake in a 450 degree F oven for 8 to 10 minutes or until golden.
