Bring broth and oil to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Remove from heat and stir in couscous. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, cook peas in a medium saucepan of lightly salted water just until tender, about 2 minutes. Drain. Add peas, parsley, mint, basil, lemon zest and pepper to the couscous; toss lightly with a fork. Serve hot.
