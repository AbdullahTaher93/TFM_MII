Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or paper-line muffin pans. In a small bowl soak oats in orange juice and water for 15 minutes. In a large bowl cream together butter or margarine and sugars. Beat in eggs and oat mixture. In a separate bowl, blend flour, baking powder, soda, salt, and nutmeg. Stir into batter. Stir in vanilla and raisins. Spoon batter into prepared muffin pans, filling 2/3 full. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
