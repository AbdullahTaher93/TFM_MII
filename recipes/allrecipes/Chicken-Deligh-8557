Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry. Place them in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. In a bowl, mix together sour cream, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, garlic powder, and white pepper. Spread mixture over chicken, then sprinkle all with cracker crumbs. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour.
