Blend the black beans, red onion, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon chile sauce, curry paste, coconut milk, 1 teaspoon brown sugar, cayenne pepper, and egg in a food processor until smooth. Scrape the mixture into a large bowl. Fold the bread crumbs and burger crumbles into the mixture. Form the mixture into 6 patties and place on waxed paper. Put in freezer for up to 30 minutes for patties to set. Prepare a grill pan or skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Cook the patties until browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Meanwhile, combine the peanut butter, 1 teaspoon chile sauce, 1 teaspoon brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, turmeric, soy sauce, and canola oil in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until the peanut butter is melted. Reduce heat to low and simmer until hot, 3 to 5 minutes. Arrange patties on bottoms of hamburger buns. Drizzle sauce over each patty; top with carrot, cucumber, green onion, mint, and cilantro. Top with remaining bun halves and serve immediately.
