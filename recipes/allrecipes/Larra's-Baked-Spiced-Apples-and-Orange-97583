Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a large bowl, toss together the apples, oranges, brown sugar, Cheddar cheese, and walnuts. Spread evenly in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle crushed crackers evenly over the fruit. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat and whisk in flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and baking powder. Drizzle over the crackers, then drizzle the creamer over the casserole. Cover with a lid or aluminum foil. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven. Remove from the oven and uncover. Stir gently to fold in the crust.
