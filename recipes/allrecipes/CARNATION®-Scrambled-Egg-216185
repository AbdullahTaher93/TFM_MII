Whisk together eggs and evaporated milk in medium bowl. Spray large skillet with nonstick cooking spray; heat over medium-low heat. Pour egg mixture into skillet. Cook, without stirring, until egg mixture begins to set on bottom and around edges. With a spatula or spoon, lift cooked egg mixture so uncooked egg mixture flows underneath. Continue cooking, stirring gently, until egg mixture is cooked through and still moist. Remove from heat. Season with salt and pepper.
