In a large, deep skillet, melt 5 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add the apples, three quarters of the onions, the zucchini, celery and bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper and cook until softened, 10 minutes. Preheat the broiler. Crumble the muffins into the skillet. Add the pumpkin seeds and poultry seasoning, and salt and pepper to taste. Pour in up to 2 cups broth (depending on how moist you like it). Spoon the stuffing into a heatproof dish and broil until crisp, 5 minutes. In a medium saucepan, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add the remaining onion and sweat it to make it nice and sweet, about 5 minutes. Whisk in the flour for 1 minute. Stir in the chipotle and adobo sauce, then whisk in the remaining 4 cups broth. Simmer until the gravy is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 7 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and serve with the stuffing.
