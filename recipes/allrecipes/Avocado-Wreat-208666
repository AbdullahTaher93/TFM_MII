Cut avocados in half, remove the pits and peel. Put flesh into a large zip top plastic bag. Squeeze to press air out and seal bag. Mash bag with hands until avocados are smooth but with a few chunks. With scissors, snip just the corner off of one end of the bag. Pipe avocado mixture into wreath shape on large serving plate. Garnish with chopped red pepper. Serve with crackers.
