Place wheat berries in a pot and cover with water; soak for 3 to 6 hours. Drain wheat berries and add 4 cups water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until wheat berries are tender yet firm to the bite and water is absorbed, 1 to 2 hours. Remove pot from heat and cool. Mix carrots, celery, onion, and parsley into wheat berries. Whisk lemon juice, soy sauce, tahini, olive oil, honey, and salt together in a bowl until smooth; stir into wheat berries mixture.
