Rinse fennel and trim off bulb base and any other discolored or bruised portions. Cut off coarse stalks, reserving feathery green leaves. Thinly slice fennel bulb. Chop enough of the leaves to make 2 to 3 tablespoons; reserve remaining leaves. Pour oil into a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add ham and brown on both sides, about 5 minutes total. Transfer to a small platter, cover, and keep warm. To pan, add sliced fennel, wine, and pepper. Stir often, uncovered, on medium-high heat, until fennel is tender to bite and only 1 or 2 tablespoons of liquid remain, about 5 minutes. Stir chopped leaves into fennel, then pour fennel and juice around ham. Garnish with reserved fennel leaves.
