Brown the beef and onion in a large skillet, then add the tomatoes and spaghetti sauce. While the sauce thickens, cook the noodles according to the package directions and stir together the mozzarella, Cheddar, and ricotta in a medium bowl. In a 9 inch x 13 inch baking dish that's been coated with nonstick spray, make a layer of half of the meat sauce, followed by half of the noodles and half of the cheese mixture. Pour on half of the remaining meat sauce, followed by the remaining noodles and cheese. Pour the last of the sauce over the top of the lasagna. Bake the whole thing for 30 minutes at 375 degrees F. When the lasagna has cooled, top it with the Parmesan cheese.
