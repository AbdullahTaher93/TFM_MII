Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Dip chicken in egg, then bread crumbs combined with paprika, coating well. Arrange chicken in 13 x 9-inch baking dish. Bake uncovered 20 minutes. Pour 1 cup Classic Alfredo Sauce over chicken; top with cheese, then tomato. Bake an additional 10 minutes or until chicken is thoroughly cooked. Serve with remaining Sauce, heated, and sprinkle, if desired, with grated Parmesan cheese.
