Place chicken in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with basil, salt and pepper. Top with onion. Cover and bake at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes. Drain pan juices and reserve 1/2 cup (add water to make 1/2 cup if necessary). Add jam; pour over chicken. Bake, uncovered, basting occasionally, for 25 minutes or until chicken juices run clear.
