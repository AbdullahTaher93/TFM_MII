Whisk orange juice, lime juice, olive oil, garlic, dried onion, oregano, cilantro, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until marinade is smooth. Measure out 1/4 cup of the marinade and set aside. Pour remaining marinade into a resealable plastic bag, place chicken in the bag, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate chicken in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade. Cook and stir chicken in a large skillet over medium-high heat until lightly browned and cooked through, 3 to 7 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate. Cook and stir pepper and onion in the same skillet with reserved 1/4 cup of marinade until vegetables are tender and liquid is reduced, about 5 minutes. Return chicken to skillet; cook and stir until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Spoon chicken mixture into tortillas.
