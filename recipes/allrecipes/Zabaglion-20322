In top of a double boiler over simmering water, mix together egg yolks and sugar until sugar has dissolved. Stir in Marsala. Whisk mixture until it is thick and foamy; continue cooking, whisking constantly, until mixture is thick and very hot to the touch. Remove from heat and serve immediately over fresh berries in dessert bowls or wine glasses.
