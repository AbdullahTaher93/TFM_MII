In a bowl, beat eggs, milk, vanilla and baking powder until smooth. Pour into a large shallow baking dish. Add bread slices, turning once to coat. Cover and chill for 8 hours or overnight. Combine blueberries, sugar, melted butter, cornstarch and cinnamon. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Cover and chill 8 hours or overnight. Remove both pans from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Place prepared bread on top of blueberry mixture. Spread softened butter on top. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until toast is golden brown and blueberries are bubbly.
