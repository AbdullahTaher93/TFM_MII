In a heavy skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter and add the olive oil. Add the steaks and sear them without moving them for 2 minute. Check for dark brown color (they may need more time if they were quite crowded in the skillet). Turn and repeat. Remove steaks from skillet and cover with foil to keep them warm (or put them in a 200 degrees F oven). Add to the skillet the garlic and saute for about 30 seconds. Add the mushrooms and continue to saute for another minute or two, until the mushrooms have softened and given up some of their liquid. Add the wine and scrape up any bits stuck to the pan. Add the parsley and stir well. Cook until the majority of the liquid has evaporated (but do not cook dry). Return the steaks to the skillet and add any juices that may have accumulate on the platter. Cook for 1 full minute. Serve at once.
