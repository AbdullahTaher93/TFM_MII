Bring the rice and water to boil in a pot. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes. Place green beans in a pot fitted with a steamer basket over boiling water, and steam 10 minutes, or until tender but crisp. Heat the oil in a skillet, and cook the chicken 5 minutes on each side, or until juices run clear. Mix the chicken broth, peanut butter, honey, soy sauce, chile paste, lemon juice in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir 5 minutes, until slightly thickened. Mix in the green beans. Serve over rice. Garnish with green onions and peanuts.
