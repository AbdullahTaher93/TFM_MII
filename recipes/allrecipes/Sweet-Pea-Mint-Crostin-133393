Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange the bread slices on a baking sheet and rub with the cut sides of the garlic, then brush with olive oil. Bake until the edges of the bread turn golden, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add the peas and cook for 2 minutes. Drain in a colander, run cold water over the peas, then drain well. In a food processor or blender, puree the cooked peas, the 1/4 cup of olive oil, the lemon juice and mint until a coarse paste forms. Season to taste with salt and pepper; add more olive oil if the mixture is too thick. Spread the puree over the toasts and top with parmesan shavings.
