Preheat broiler. Pat lamb chops dry. Make small punctures into the lamb with a paring knife and insert slivers of garlic into each one, poking in the garlic. Brush the tops lightly with half of the olive oil, then pat on half of the cracked peppercorns. Repeat with the other side of the lamb, using remaining oil and peppercorns. Broil the chops until the lamb is browned but pink inside, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
