Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and slice. Meanwhile, bring a pot of water to a boil. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink inside, approximately 20 minutes. Drain, cool and chop. In a large bowl, mix together the chicken, sliced eggs, apple, onions, relish, mayonnaise, celery, pineapple (with just a little juice for flavor), cilantro, pecans and fajita seasoning. Divide chicken salad equally onto 12 slices of bread. Top with sliced cucumber, and remaining bread slices.
