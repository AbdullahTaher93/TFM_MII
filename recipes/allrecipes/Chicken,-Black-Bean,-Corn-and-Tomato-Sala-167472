Shred chicken and combine with black beans, tomatoes and corn in a salad bowl. Heat oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and saute; until just beginning to color, about 30 seconds. Add oregano and cumin; stir until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Remove from the heat; add vinegar and salt. Pour over the salad. Add scallions and parsley; gently toss to combine.
