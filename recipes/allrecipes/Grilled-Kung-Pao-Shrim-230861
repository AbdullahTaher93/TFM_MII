Whisk soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, cayenne pepper, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl. Add shrimp to bowl; gently stir to coat shrimp completely. Set aside to marinate at least 5 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove shrimp from marinade and shake off any excess. Discard remaining marinade. Grill shrimp until bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
