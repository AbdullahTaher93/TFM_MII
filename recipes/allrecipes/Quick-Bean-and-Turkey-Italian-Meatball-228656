Mash butter beans in a large mixing bowl. Add ground turkey, egg white, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper; stir until evenly mixed. Fold bread crumbs into mixture evenly. Form the mixture into 1-inch meatballs. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook meatballs in hot oil until browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Cover the skillet and continue cooking until meatballs are no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
