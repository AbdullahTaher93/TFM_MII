Pound chicken to 3/8-inch thickness. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Beat eggs in pie plate. Put potato flakes on waxed paper. Dip chicken in egg, allowing excess to drip off. Coat with potato flakes, pressing them on lightly. Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken, in batches, 8 minutes, or until deep golden and juices run clear when thickest part of chicken is pierced. Drain on paper towels. Serve with barbecue sauce. (Refrigerate leftovers.)
