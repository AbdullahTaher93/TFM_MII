In a large saucepan, combine water and bouillon cube; heat until cube dissolves. Add broccoli, cauliflower, and mushrooms. Cover and cook until broccoli is tender-crisp, about five minutes. Drain. In small saucepan, combine remaining ingredients. Cook and stir until sauce is heated to serving temperature. Pour over vegetables.
