In a bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. Pour 2/3 cup marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add beef. Pour 1/3 cup marinade into another plastic bag; add chicken. Seal bags and turn to coat; refrigerate for up to 2 hours. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade. Drain and discard marinade from beef and chicken. In a large skillet or wok, heat 1-1/2 teaspoons oil; stir-fry beef until no longer pink. Remove and keep warm. In the same pan, stir-fry chicken in 1-1/2 teaspoons oil until juices run clear. Remove and keep warm. Stir-fry carrots and broccoli in remaining oil for 5 minutes. Add the green pepper, onion and mushrooms; stir-fry for 5-6 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender. Stir in cilantro and reserved marinade. Toss salad greens and oranges; place on a large serving plate. Top with the stir-fried beef, chicken and vegetables.
