In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the flour, salt and pepper; add pork chops and shake to coat. In a skillet, cook the chops in butter until juices run clear. Remove and keep warm. Add the rhubarb, honey and cinnamon to the skillet; cook until rhubarb is tender. Serve over pork chops. Sprinkle with parsley.
