Mix flour and salt together in a bowl. Slowly mix water, a few tablespoons at a time, into flour mixture until dough is smooth and easy to handle. Knead dough for 10 minutes and let rest for 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Form dough into desired shapes and arrange on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until dry and hard, about 2 hours. Allow to cool completely.
