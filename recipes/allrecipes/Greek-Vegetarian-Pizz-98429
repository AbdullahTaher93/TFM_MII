Adjust oven rack to center position and heat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place crust on baking sheet and spread pesto on pizza. Top pizza in the following order: tomatoes, spinach, red onion, feta, and oregano. Bake until spinach wilts and cheese starts to brown, about 15 minutes. Remove pizza from oven and drizzle with oil, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, slice and serve.
