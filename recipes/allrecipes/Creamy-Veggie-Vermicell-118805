In a large skillet, saute the broccoli and asparagus in butter for 8-10 minutes or until crisp-tender. Meanwhile, cook vermicelli according to package directions. In a saucepan, cook and stir the cream cheese and milk over medium heat until smooth and blended. Add Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper; cook 2 minutes longer or until blended. Remove from the heat. Stir lemon peel into the vegetables. Drain vermicelli; place in a serving bowl. Add vegetables and cheese sauce; toss to coat. Serve immediately.
