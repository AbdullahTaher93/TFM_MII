Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Melt chocolate and butter in a double boiler over barely simmering water or in the microwave. Whisk flour, cocoa and salt in a medium bowl. Beat egg whites, eggs and sugar in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer or whisk until smooth. Add applesauce, oil and vanilla; beat until blended. Add the chocolate-butter mixture; beat until blended. Add the flour mixture and mix at low speed just until moistened. Stir in chocolate chips. Scrape the batter into the prepared baking dish, spreading evenly. Sprinkle with nuts, if desired. Bake the brownies until the top springs back when touched lightly, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. Cut into bars.
