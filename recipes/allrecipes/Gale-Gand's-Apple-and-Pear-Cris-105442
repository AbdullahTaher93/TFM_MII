Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly butter a deep 2 to 2 1/2 quart baking dish. Set aside. To prepare topping: Pour flour, brown sugar, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, cinnamon and nutmeg into a medium mixing bowl. Stir well. Add butter and mix with an electric mixer, using the paddle attachment, until the topping is crumbly or sandy in texture. Set aside. To prepare filling: Peel, core and thickly slice the apples and pears. Place them in the buttered baking dish. The fruit should be at least 2 1/2 inches deep in the pan. Add more fruit, if necessary. Add SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and apple juice concentrate. Toss until coated. Cover with the topping. Bake in the preheated 400 degrees F oven 40-50 minutes or until fruit is tender and the topping has browned.
