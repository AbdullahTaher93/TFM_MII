Place bacon in a large pot over medium-high heat; cook until starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add onion; reduce heat to medium and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Increase heat to medium-high and add ground beef to the pot; cook and stir until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Stir in chili powder, smoked paprika, salt, and cayenne pepper; cook for 1 minute. Pour diced tomatoes, apple cider, tomato sauce, and Worcestershire sauce into the pot. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, until flavors combine, about 30 minutes. Stir pinto beans into the pot. Simmer, uncovered, until beans are heated through, about 10 minutes.
