Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. In a small bowl, toss together cheese, green onions, and bacon with 1 tablespoon flour. Set aside. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt. Use a pastry cutter or two forks to cut in butter. Add milk and stir just enough to bring the ingredients together. This should make a soft dough. Gently fold in the cheese mixture. Turn dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 1 minute. Pat or roll out dough to 1/2 or 3/4 inch thickness. Cut into rounds with a 2 1/2 inch round biscuit cutter. Place biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown on top.
