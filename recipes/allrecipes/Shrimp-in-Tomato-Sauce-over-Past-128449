Warm oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add scallions and garlic. Cook 10 minutes, or just until scallions begin to turn golden. Add tomatoes, wine, sugar, and 1/2 cup (120 mL) parsley or basil. Heat to boiling. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 20 to 25 minutes, or until sauce is slightly thickened. Add shrimp and return to a simmer. Cook 4 to 5 minutes, or until shrimp are opaque. Meanwhile, cook spaghetti according to package directions. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Add sauce and toss to mix. Sprinkle with Parmesan and remaining 1/4 cup (60 mL) parsley or basil.
