Mix cookie mix, flour, poppy seeds, butter, cream cheese, 1 teaspoon of the almond extract and egg in bowl until soft dough forms. Roll dough into 1 1/4-inch balls; place 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Press balls slightly to flatten. If desired, top each flattened ball with 5 sliced almonds arranged to form a star. Bake at 350 degrees F for 9 to 11 minutes. Cool 3 minutes; remove from cookie sheet to wire rack. Blend powdered sugar, remaining 1 teaspoon almond extract and enough water in a bowl, to spreading consistency. Spread glaze over warm cookies. Store tightly covered at room temperature.
