Dissolve 1 tablespoon sugar and yeast in 1/2 cup warm water. Set aside until creamy. In a large bowl, mix together oil, 2-1/3 cups water, salt, and 4 tablespoons sugar. Add yeast, and gradually mix in flour. Place dough in a buttered bowl, and turn to coat. Cover with a damp tea towel, and place in a warm place to rise for 1-1/2 hours. Form dough into balls about the size of eggs, then roll flat to make ovals about 1/4 inch thick. Heat oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a deep fryer, pot, or electric frying pan. Fry doughnuts one at a time, until light brown on both sides. Place on paper towels to drain. Sprinkle with white sugar, cinnamon, and lemon juice while still hot.
