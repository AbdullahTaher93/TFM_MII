Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray both sides of tortillas with cooking spray; place in single layer on baking sheet. Bake 10 min. or until crisp and lightly browned. Meanwhile, heat large nonstick skillet on medium heat. Spray with cooking spray. Add fish; cook 5 min. on each side or until fish flakes easily with fork. Remove from heat. Use a fork to break up the fish into smaller pieces. Stir in half of the dressing. Add remaining dressing to coleslaw blend; toss lightly. Spoon evenly onto tortillas; top with fish mixture, peppers and onion.
