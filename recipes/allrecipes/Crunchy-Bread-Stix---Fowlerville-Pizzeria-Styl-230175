Combine flour, water, yeast, dry milk powder, 3 tablespoons olive oil, and salt in the mixing bowl of a large stand mixer; knead into a soft, smooth dough, about 7 minutes. Place into a warm area and let rise until doubled, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Transfer dough to an oiled work surface; roll with a rolling pin into a 10x20-inch rectangle. Brush dough with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Roll dough again lightly to press seeds into surface. Use a pizza wheel or sharp knife to cut dough along the shorter edge into 1/4- to 1/2-inch wide strips. Hold each breadstick by both ends and twist once. Grease baking sheets or line with parchment paper. Transfer bread sticks to prepared baking sheets; cover with a kitchen towel and set aside for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bake bread sticks in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes.
