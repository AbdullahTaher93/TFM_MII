In a saucepan, combine chicken, broth, peas, carrots, soup, salt and pepper; bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, combine biscuit mix, milk, garlic powder and celery seed (mixture will be thin). Pour hot chicken mixture into eight greased ovenproof 10-oz. custard cups or casseroles. Immediately spoon 1/4 cup of biscuit mixture evenly on top of each. Sprinkle with paprika. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until topping is golden brown.
