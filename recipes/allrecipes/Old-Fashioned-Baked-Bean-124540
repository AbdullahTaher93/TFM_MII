Place beans in a Dutch oven or kettle; add enough water to cover by 2 in. Bring to a boil; boil for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat; cover and let stand for 1 hour. Drain and rinse beans, discarding liquid. Return beans to pan. Add water and salt; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 1 to 1-1/4 hours or until beans are tender. Drain, reserving 2 cups cooking liquid. In a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish, combine the beans, onion, mustard, brown sugar, molasses, bacon and 1 cup reserved cooking liquid. Cover and bake at 400 degrees F for 45 minutes or until beans have reached desired thickness, stirring occasionally (add additional reserved cooking liquid if needed).
