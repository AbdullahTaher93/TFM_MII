Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Press dough over bottom and up sides of an unoiled 10- by 15-inch rimmed pan or a 14-inch-diameter pizza pan. Pierce dough with a fork at 2-inch intervals. Bake on the bottom rack of oven until light golden, about 10 minutes. Mix chicken with barbecue sauce. Spread mixture evenly in baked crust. Arrange pepper slices over sauce, then cover evenly with cheese. Bake on the bottom rack of oven until cheese bubbles, about 15 minutes. Garnish with cilantro. Cut into rectangles or wedges.
