Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork strips, and fry until almost browned. Add red, yellow, and green bell peppers, carrot, and Brussels sprouts, and toss to coat with oil. Pour in enough water to coat the bottom of the pan, and cook stirring constantly, until the peppers begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium, and stir in garlic, onion, parsley, and celery. Simmer for 5 to 7 minutes, add ginger, simmer for a few more minutes, then stir in water chestnuts and mint. Simmer for 2 to 3 more minutes to blend flavors. When done, serve and enjoy. Your tastebuds will love you for this treat!
