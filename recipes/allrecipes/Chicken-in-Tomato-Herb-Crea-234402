Whisk flour, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a shallow bowl. Gently press chicken pieces into flour mixture to coat and shake off any excess flour. Heat butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chicken and shallot in melted butter until shallot is softened and chicken is cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour white wine into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir tomatoes and lemon juice into chicken mixture; simmer for 2 minutes, pour in cream. Bring mixture to a boil and cook to reduce liquid to a thicker consistency, 5 to 10 minutes more. Remove skillet from heat and stir in tarragon.
