In a large skillet, cover the sausages with water, add 1 tablespoon EVOO and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until the liquid evaporates and the sausages brown and crisp up on all sides, about 15 minutes. In a large pot, bring 1 inch of water to a boil, salt it and add the cauliflower. Cover and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat, whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Whisk in the milk, bring just to a boil and cook, stirring often, until it thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Using a wooden spoon and stirring in a figure-eight pattern, mix in the cheese. Remove the sauce from the heat, season with salt, pepper and the nutmeg and cover to keep warm. In a medium skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons EVOO, 2 turns of the pan, over medium to medium-high heat until hot. Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the beans and heat through. In a small bowl, combine the tomato sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce and grill seasoning. Stir the mixture into the beans and simmer for 5 minutes. Drain the cauliflower and stir into the cheese sauce until coated. Serve 2 links of sausage with some beans and Cheddar Cauliflower alongside.
