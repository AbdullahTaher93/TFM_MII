In a large saucepan, bring 8 cups water to a boil. Add broccoli and salt; cover and boil for 5 minutes. Drain and pat dry. In a blender, combine the cottage cheese, egg whites, Parmesan cheese, flour and Italian seasoning; cover and process until smooth. Place half of the broccoli in an 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray; top with half of the cottage cheese mixture. Repeat layers. Spoon spaghetti sauce over the top; sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until bubbly. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
