Mix vegetarian beef crumbles, napa cabbage, soy sauce, green onion, chili garlic sauce, sesame oil, salt, and pepper together in a bowl to make filling. Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of each pot sticker wrapper. Brush edges of each wrapper with water; fold over to enclose filling. Squeeze edges and crimp together to seal. Heat peanut oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place potstickers flat-side down in the skillet; cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip potstickers. Pour in 1/4 cup water; cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the lid and continue cooking until water evaporates, about 5 minutes.
