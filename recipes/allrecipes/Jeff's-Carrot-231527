Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a casserole dish with cooking spray. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add carrots, cover, and steam until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Place carrots to a large bowl and mash. Stir melted butter, eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, allspice, nutmeg, ginger, salt, and black pepper into carrots. Transfer carrots into prepared casserole dish. Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 40 minutes.
