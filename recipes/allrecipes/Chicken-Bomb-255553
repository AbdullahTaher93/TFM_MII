Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Set a wire rack on top of a baking sheet. Mix cream cheese, green onion, jalapeno pepper, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Pound chicken tenders into a rectangular shape with the flat side of a meat tenderizer. Place 3 tablespoons of the cream cheese mixture in the middle of each tender; fold into a pouch. Wrap a slice of bacon around each pouch and secure with a toothpick. Top with some pepper jelly. Arrange on the wire rack. Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crisp and chicken juices run clear, about 35 minutes.
