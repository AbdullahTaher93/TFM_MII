Use a knife to cut the kernels from the corn cobs. Using dull side of knife, scrape the remaining milk and pulp off of the cobs and into a bowl. Add the cut corn, egg yolk, flour, sugar, salt and pepper, and stir together. In a separate bowl, beat the egg white to stiff peaks and fold into corn mixture. Heat a lightly oiled skillet or frying pan, over medium heat. Drop large spoonfuls of corn batter onto the skillet a few inches apart. Cook until golden on bottom, about 2 minutes. Turn over and cook opposite side until golden. Briefly drain on paper towels and serve immediately.
