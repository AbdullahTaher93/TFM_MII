Place black-eyed peas into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain and rinse. In a large pot, cover black-eyed peas with fresh water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low; cover and simmer until peas are tender, 40 to 60 minutes. Drain. Heat soy margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Add turnip and collard greens; cook for 2 minutes. Stir black-eyed peas, garlic, and tomatoes into collard mixture; cook and stir until collards are tender, about 5 minutes. Season with balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil.
