Prepare dry bread stuffing mix according to package directions. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Using fingers, separate the skin and meat of the Cornish game hens, and rub 1 tablespoon seasoning salt into the meat of each hen. Rub remaining seasoning salt into the cavities of the hens. Stuff each cavity with about 1 1/2 cups prepared stuffing. Place hens and green beans in an oven bag. Bake 80 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the meat is no longer pink and the juices run clear. Drain hen drippings into a medium saucepan. Over medium heat, stir in flour until bubbly. Gradually mix in chicken broth. Stirring occasionally, cook until a thick gravy has formed.
