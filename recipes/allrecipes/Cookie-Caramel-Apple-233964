Spray a cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray. Wash apples by gently rubbing with an abrasive scrub sponge and a few drops of dish detergent. Rinse and dry well; remove stem. Push sticks into tops of apples; set aside. Melt caramels and hard candies with butter and water in a medium saucepan over low heat until smooth, stirring often. Dip and swirl apples in melted caramel mixture, using a spoon to spread evenly. Roll in cookie crumbs, pressing gently into caramel. Place on prepared pan and refrigerate at least 15 minutes or until caramel sets.
