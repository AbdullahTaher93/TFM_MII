Grease a baking dish. Beat egg, mayonnaise, red pepper flakes, seafood seasoning, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, lemon juice, and black pepper together in a bowl until smooth. Place crabmeat into a separate bowl, trying to not break too many of the big chunks; add 1/4 cup almond flour, parsley, and green onion. Pour egg mixture over the crabmeat mixture and gently mix until dry ingredients are completely moistened; shape into 12 cakes. Spread 1/3 cup almond flour into a wide, shallow bowl. Roll cakes in almond flour to coat and arrange into the prepared baking dish. Refrigerate crab cakes for at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake in preheated oven until hot in the center and golden brown on the outside, 15 to 20 minutes.
