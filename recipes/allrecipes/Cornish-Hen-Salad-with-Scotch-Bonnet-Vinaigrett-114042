Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the hens and carrots in a roasting pan, rub them with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast in the upper third of the oven for 1 hour, then transfer the carrots to a plate to cool. Continue roasting the hens for about 15 minutes longer, or until the cavity juices run clear. Transfer the hens to a platter and let cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, pour the hot pan juices into a measuring cup and skim the fat. Strain the juices into a small saucepan and simmer over moderate heat until reduced to 2 tablespoons, about 4 minutes. Pour the reduction back into the measuring cup and let cool to room temperature. Stir in the hot sauce, vegetable oil, vinegar and allspice and season this vinaigrette with salt and pepper. Remove the meat from the hens and pull it apart into thick shreds. Cut the carrots into 2-by-1/3-inch sticks. In a large bowl, toss the Cornish hen meat with the carrots, radishes, sprouts, cashews and the vinaigrette. Mound the salad on plates and serve.
