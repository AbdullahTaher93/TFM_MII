Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix refried beans with taco seasoning mix in a bowl; spread mixture into the bottom of an 8x8-inch glass baking dish. Spread sour cream over the refried beans; spread salsa over the sour cream. Sprinkle cheese over the top. Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted but not bubbling, 6 to 10 minutes.
