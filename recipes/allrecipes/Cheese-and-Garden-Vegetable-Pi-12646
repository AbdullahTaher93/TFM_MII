Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake the pie shell for 9 to 10 minutes or until browned. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. Cut the tomatoes into bite size pieces, dice the onion and the green bell pepper. In a large bowl, mix the mayonnaise, cheeses, vegetables and bacon. Spoon into the baked pie shell. Top with additional crumbled bacon. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes or until edges brown.
