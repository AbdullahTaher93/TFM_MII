Combine water, cornmeal and salt in a double boiler or heavy saucepan; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 1-1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, brown the sausage and garlic in a large skillet; drain. Cool slightly. Cut sausage into 1-in. pieces; return to the skillet. Add parsley, tomatoes and tomato paste; bring to a boil. Remove from the heat. Spread half of the cornmeal mixture in a serving dish; top with half of the sausage mixture. Repeat layers. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.
