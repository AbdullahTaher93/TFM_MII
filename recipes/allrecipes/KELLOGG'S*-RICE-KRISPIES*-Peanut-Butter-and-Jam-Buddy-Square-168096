In a large saucepan over low heat, melt butter. Add marshmallows and peanut butter; stir until melted and well blended. Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla. Add cereal, stirring until coated. Using lightly-buttered spatula, press mixture firmly and evenly into buttered 3.5 L (13 x 9-inch) pan. Cool about 10 minutes. Cut cooled mixture in half crosswise. Spread jam evenly over one half; top with second half to make one very large sandwich, pressing halves gently together. Chill. Cut into small bars or squares.
