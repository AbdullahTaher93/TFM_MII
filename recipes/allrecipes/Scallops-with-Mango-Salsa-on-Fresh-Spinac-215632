Mix the mango, red bell pepper, shallot, jalapeno chile, and lime juice together in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper and set aside. Heat the olive oil and butter together in a skillet over high heat. Once the butter melts, add the scallops and cook until opaque and browned on the sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Combine the water, vegetable bouillon, and garlic in a large skillet over medium-high heat; bring the mixture to a boil. Add the spinach to the mixture by the handful; cooking until each batch is wilted completely. Remove from heat, squeeze excess moisture from the spinach, and place equal portions into the center of 2 plates. Place half the scallops atop each pile of spinach. Spoon the mango salsa over the scallops.
