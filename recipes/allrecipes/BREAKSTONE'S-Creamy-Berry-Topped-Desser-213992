Preheat over to 325 degrees F. Prepare cake batter: mix flour and baking soda until well blended; set aside. Beat butter in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until creamy. Gradually add sugar, beating until light and fluffy. Blend in vanilla. Add eggs, 1 at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add flour mixture alternately with 1 cup of sour cream, beating until well blended after each addition. Spoon into greased and floured 12-cup fluted tube pan or 10-inch tube pan. Bake 1 hour 15 minutes or until toothpick inserted near center comes out clean. Meanwhile mix remaining sour cream and sugar. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Combine strawberries and preserves. Let stand at room temperature 30 min. Spoon sour cream mixture over cake slices just before serving; top with strawberry mixture and blueberries.
