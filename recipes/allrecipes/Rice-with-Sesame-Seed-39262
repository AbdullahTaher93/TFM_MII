Heat 1/2 the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, and saute the garlic paste and ginger paste until lightly browned. Mix in the tamarind paste, turmeric, salt, and pepper. Gradually mix in the rice. Cook and stir until well coated. Heat the remaining oil in a small skillet, and saute sesame seeds until lightly browned. Mix into the rice mixture.
