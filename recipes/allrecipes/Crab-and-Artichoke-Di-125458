In a mixing bowl combine the cream cheese and egg, beat until smooth. Add the artichoke hearts and garlic and mix until well incorporated. Take bowl off mixer and fold in all other ingredients. Be careful not to break up the crab meat. Transfer to an oven proof serving dish and bake at 350 degrees 25-30 min. The dip should be golden brown and bubbling on the edge. Serve with crusty bread.
