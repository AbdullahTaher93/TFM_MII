Combine bulgur and warm water in a medium bowl; let stand until the bulgur is tender and the liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes. Prepare a grill or preheat the broiler. Add beef, watercress, salt and pepper to the plumped bulgur and mix thoroughly but lightly. Shape the mixture into eight 3/8-inch-thick patties (see Cooking tips). Sandwich cheese between the patties to form 4 stuffed burgers. Grill or broil the patties on a lightly oiled rack (see Cooking tips) until browned and cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per side. (An instant-read thermometer inserted in the center should register 160 degrees F.) Place the burgers on buns and garnish with watercress sprigs.
