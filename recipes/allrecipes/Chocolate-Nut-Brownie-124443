In a mixing bowl, beat shortening, sugar, eggs and vanilla just until smooth. Combine dry ingredients; stir into batter. Fold in half the nuts. Spread into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Sprinkle remaining nuts on top. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until brownies pull away from the sides of the pan. Cool on wire rack. Cut into squares.
