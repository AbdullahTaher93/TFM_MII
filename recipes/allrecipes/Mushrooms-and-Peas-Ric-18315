In a large skillet, saute mushrooms in butter. Set aside. Warm condensed cream of mushroom soup and milk. When it comes to a slow bubble, add instant rice and cover. Let sit for at least 5 minutes. While the soup mixture is warming, thaw the peas in the microwave at 30 second intervals. Do not overheat the peas. When the rice is tender, stir mushrooms and peas into the rice and season with salt and pepper to taste.
