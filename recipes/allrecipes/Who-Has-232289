Heat oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Spread potatoes and meat in a single layer into the skillet; cook until browned on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Turn potatoes and meat to cook other side until browned, about 5 minutes more. Stir onion into the potato mixture; cook and stir until the onion is tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
