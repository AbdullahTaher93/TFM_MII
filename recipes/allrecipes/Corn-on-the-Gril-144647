Heat grill until medium hot. Pull husks back from corn, keeping husks attached. Remove as much silk from the corn as possible; replace husks, covering kernels. Using kitchen twine, secure husks at tops. Place corn in a large bucket of cold water. Let soak 1 hour. Transfer corn to grill. Cook until husks are charred and the corn has steamed, about 15 minutes. Remove from grill; discard husks. Serve with butter, salt, and pepper.
