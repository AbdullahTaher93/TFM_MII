On a 10-inch square cheesecloth, combine peppercorns, fennel seed, allspice, and lemon peel. Bring edges of cloth together and tie with cotton string to enclose spices. In a 5- to 6-quart pan, combine broth and bouquet garni. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover and simmer 30 minutes. Meanwhile, sort and discard debris from lentils; rinse and drain well. Trim off and discard dark tops and root ends of leeks. Split leeks in half lengthwise, rinse well, and thinly slice. Peel squash and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Add lentils to broth. Simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. Add squash and leeks. Cover and simmer until both are tender to bite, about 15 more minutes. Meanwhile, cut chard into 1/4-inch strips. When lentils and squash are cooked, add chard to broth. Simmer until chard wilts, about 5 minutes. Remove and discard bouquet garni.
