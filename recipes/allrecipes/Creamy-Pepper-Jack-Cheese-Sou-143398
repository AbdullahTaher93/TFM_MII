Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour and cook until the flour begins to turn golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add onion and garlic, cook until the onion softens and turns translucent, about 3 minutes. Slowly whisk in chicken broth and milk. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes until thickened and smooth. Remove from the heat and immediately whisk in the shredded cheese until it has melted and the soup is smooth. Season with Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, and black pepper. Ladle in to serving bowls, and sprinkle with cilantro to garnish.
