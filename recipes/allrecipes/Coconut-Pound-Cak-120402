In a mixing bowl, cream butter, shortening, cream cheese and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Beat in extracts. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture. Fold in coconut. Transfer to a greased and floured 10-in. tube pan. Bake at 325 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
