Mix sugar, mochiko, cornstarch, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk eggs, green onions, soy sauce, sesame seeds, and garlic together in a bowl. Whisk into the flour mixture to form a smooth batter. Stir chicken strips gently into the batter. Marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight. Fill a deep saucepan with 1 1/2 inch oil; heat over medium heat. Fry chicken strips in batches in the hot oil, turning occasionally, until golden brown and no longer pink in the center, about 7 minutes.
