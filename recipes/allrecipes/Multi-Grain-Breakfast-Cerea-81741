Mix together all ingredients in a large bowl (big enough for handling the boiling bubbles without spilling over) stir well. Zap in the microwave for 1 minute (or until it boils) and stir. Zap for another minute then stir. Let sit for 2 minutes then zap again for about 30 seconds. Let it cool a bit before eating.
