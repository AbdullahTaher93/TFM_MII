In a 5- to 6-quart pan over medium heat, stir nuts often until golden (3 to 4 minutes). Pour out of pan and set aside. Meanwhile, in a large, wide bowl, mix soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, sugar, and chili oil; set aside. In same pan in which nuts were toasted, bring about 3 quarts water to a boil over high heat; stir in pasta and cook, uncovered, for 3 minutes. Stir in pea pods and shrimp. Cook until pasta is just tender to bite and pea pods are bright green (1 to 2 more minutes). Drain well. To soy sauce mixture, add pasta mixture, cilantro, and green onions. Mix lightly. Sprinkle with nuts.
