In a large saucepan, heat the oil over moderate heat. Add the sausages and cook, turning, until browned, 5 to 10 minutes in all. Remove. When the sausages are cool enough to handle, cut them into 1/4-inch slices. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from the pan. Add the onion, celery, bell pepper, and garlic to the pan and cook, covered, over moderately low heat until the vegetables start to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the rice, broth, sausage, cayenne, bay leaves, and salt and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. Stir in the chicken and simmer, covered, until the chicken is just done and the rice and the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes longer. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for about 2 minutes.
