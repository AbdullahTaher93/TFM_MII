Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente; drain. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the corn, raise the heat slightly and cook until the corn is heated through and golden, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt. Add the vegetables, butter and basil to the pasta and toss.
