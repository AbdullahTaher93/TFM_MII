Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Wash the chicken, pat dry and arrange in a 9 x 13 inch baking dish. Mix Russian dressing, preserves and soup mix together in a bowl and spoon the mixture over the chicken pieces. Bake in preheated oven for 45 to 60 minutes, occasionally spooning the sauce over the chicken.
