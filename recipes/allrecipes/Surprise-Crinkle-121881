In a large mixing bowl, cream the shortening, butter and sugars. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Combine flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Roll into 1-1/2-in. balls. Cut each candy bar into fourths; push one portion into the center of each ball, completely covering candy with dough. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until golden brown and surface cracks. Remove to wire racks to cool.
