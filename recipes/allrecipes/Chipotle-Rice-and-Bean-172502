In a 2- to 3-quart pan, combine water and salt; bring to a boil over high heat. Add rice, cover pan, reduce heat, and simmer until water is absorbed and rice is tender to bite, about 20 minutes. When rice is done, stir in black beans, salsa, and cheese until well mixed. Spoon into bowls and top with sour cream and sliced avocado, if desired.
