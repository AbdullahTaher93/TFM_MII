Add pasta to a large pot of salted boiling water. Let cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain. Meanwhile, saute chicken breasts in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Saute for 8 to 10 minutes each side or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Remove chicken from skillet and cut into bite size pieces. In a large mixing bowl, toss cooked pasta with oil to coat. Add chicken pieces, sun-dried tomatoes, zucchini and squash and toss again. Finally, add cheese and serve.
