In a saucepan over low heat, stir unsweetened chocolate and butter until chocolate is melted. Remove from the heat; stir in sugar. Cool for 10 minutes. Blend in eggs and vanilla. Stir in flour and nuts. Pour into a greased foil-lined 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean (do not overbake). Immediately drop marshmallow cream by spoonfuls over hot brownies; spread evenly. Cool on a wire rack. Lift out of the pan; remove foil. Place on a serving tray. For web decoration, melt semisweet chocolate and pour into a small resealable plastic bag. Cut a small hole in one corner of the bag; drizzle chocolate over creme in a spiderweb design.
