Unroll breadsticks and cut in half widthwise. Place butter in a shallow bowl. In another shallow bowl, combine sugar and cinnamon. Dip one side of each bread stick in butter, then in cinnamon-sugar. Place sugared side up in a greased 9-in. pie plate, overlapping layers. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
