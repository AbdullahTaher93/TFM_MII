Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Cut bacon crosswise into thin strips. Cook bacon and onion, stirring occasionally, in a small skillet over medium heat until bacon is crisp and onion is golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer mixture to a paper towel to drain. Meanwhile, place pizza crust on a cookie sheet. Scatter olives and bell peppers over pizza; top with reserved bacon mixture. Sprinkle cheese evenly over pizza. Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until crust is golden brown and cheese is melted. Top with basil if desired; cut into wedges.
