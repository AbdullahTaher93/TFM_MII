Soak the dried chile in boiling water for 20-30 minutes or until softened; drain well. Remove the stem from the chile and place the hydrated chile in a food processor with 1 cup of chicken broth. Puree until smooth. Pour the pureed chile mixture into a slow cooker. Add the remaining ingredients to the slow cooker. Cover and cook on HIGH for 5-6 hours or LOW for 7-8 hours. Remove the bay leaf before serving. Spoon soup into bowls and serve with shredded lettuce, sliced radishes, onions, cheese and fresh cilantro.
