Heat the oil in a 6-quart saucepot. Add the beef and cook until it's well browned on all sides. Pour off any fat. Add the stock and vegetable juice to the saucepot and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 1 hour 45 minutes. Add the carrots, potatoes and celery to the saucepot. Cover and cook for 30 minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Remove the beef and vegetables from the saucepot. Stir the flour and water in a small bowl. Add to the saucepot. Cook and stir until the mixture boils and thickens. Serve with the beef and vegetables.
