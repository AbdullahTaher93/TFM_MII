Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place 2 cups of the pecan pieces in food processor or blender container; cover. Process until finely ground, using pulsing action. Mix with granulated sugar and butter. Press firmly onto bottom and up side of 9-inch pie plate. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool completely. (If crust puffs up during baking, gently press down with back of spoon.) Microwave the caramels and 1/3 cup of the whipping cream in microwavable bowl on High 2 1/2 to 3 minutes or until caramels are completely melted, stirring after each minute. Pour into crust. Chop remaining 1 cup pecans; sprinkle over pie. Place the chocolate, remaining 1/3 cup whipping cream, the powdered sugar and vanilla in saucepan; cook on low heat just until chocolate is completely melted, stirring constantly. Pour over pie; gently spread to evenly cover top of pie. Refrigerate at least 2 hours. Store leftover pie in refrigerator.
