Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add carrots and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and place in a 2 quart casserole dish. Stir in onion, butter, cream, salt, pepper and cheese; mix well. Sprinkle bread crumbs over the top. Bake in preheated oven for 50 minutes.
