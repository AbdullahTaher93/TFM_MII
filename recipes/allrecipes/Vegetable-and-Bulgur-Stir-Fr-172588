Heat oil in a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add bulgur, sesame seeds, garlic, and onions; cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add carrots and cook, stirring, until sesame seeds are lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Add zucchini, crookneck squash, and mushrooms and continue to cook for 1 more minute. Add basil, marjoram, oregano, and 1 cup water; reduce heat, cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Add broccoli and cook, covered, until liquid is absorbed, about 5 more minutes. Transfer to a serving dish. Sprinkle with cheese. Serve with lemon wedges, salt, and pepper to taste.
