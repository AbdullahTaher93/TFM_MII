Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and shortening. Add eggs and beat until smooth. Stir in the flour, baking powder, and salt until well blended. Mix in the orange juice and orange zest. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut out rabbit shapes with a cookie cutter. Place rabbits onto an unprepared cookie sheet and place the cinnamon candies onto them for eyes. Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes. Frost if desired.
