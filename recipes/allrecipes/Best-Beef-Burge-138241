Heat grill to high. In a medium bowl, use a fork to gently combine beef, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Gently form mixture into four 1-inch-thick patties. Place patties on hottest part of grill; sear until browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Move patties to cooler part of grill; continue grilling until desired doneness, 4 to 8 minutes per side.
