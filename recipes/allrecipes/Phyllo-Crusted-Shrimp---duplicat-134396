In a small saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon oil over moderate heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until tender but not browned, about 6 minutes. Stir in the curry powder. Add the wine, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Whisk in the peanut butter until smooth. Stir in the coconut milk and simmer very gently until thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the lime juice until incorporated. Season with salt to taste. Keep the Peanut Butter-Curry Sauce warm over very low heat. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper and brush with the thinned peanut butter. Combine the coconut and kataifi on a sheet pan and gently roll the shrimp around in the mixture, pressing gently to help the mixture adhere and form a crust. Reserve the prepared shrimp in the refrigerator until ready to cook. In a medium skillet, warm 1 tablespoon of the oil over high heat. Add the bok choy and the tomatoes, season with salt and pepper and cook over high heat until the bok choy is slightly wilted and the skin on the tomatoes begins to pucker, 2 to 3 minutes. Reserve the vegetables and keep warm. In a large nonstick skillet, warm 1 tablespoon of oil over moderate heat and add the shrimp, cooking until the kataifi crust on the bottom is golden brown, 2 or 3 minutes. Using tongs, gently turn each shrimp over; drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil around the edge of the skillet. Lower the heat and cook until the crust is golden but the shrimp are crisp-tender, about 1 more minute. Spoon the warm sauce into the center of 4 plates. Evenly divide the bok choy mixture among the plates and top each serving with 3 shrimps. Serve immediately with the Peanut Butter-Curry Sauce.
