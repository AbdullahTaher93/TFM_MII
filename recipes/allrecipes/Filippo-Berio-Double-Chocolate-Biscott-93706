On a sheet of waxed paper, combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat 1/2 cup olive oil and sugar until smooth and light. Add the eggs and egg yolk, one at a time, beating, until smooth. Add the vinegar and milk. Beat until smooth. Turn the mixer speed to low. Gradually add the dry ingredients, beating just until combined. Stir in the chocolate morsels by hand with a large spoon. Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Coat 2 large baking sheets each with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. With a pastry scraper, divide the dough into quarters. Roll each piece of dough into a log 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Place the logs, separated, on the sheets. Bake for 30 minutes or until golden and set. Remove to a rack to cool for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F. On a cutting board with a serrated knife, cut each log into 3/4-inch-wide diagonal slices. Place the slices, cut sides down, on the baking sheets. Bake for about 15 to 18 minutes, or until toasted. Remove to racks to cool.
