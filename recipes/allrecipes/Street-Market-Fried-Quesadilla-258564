Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add olive oil. Cook and stir onions and red bell pepper until starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Add corn and serrano pepper; cook 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook 1 minute more. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add HORMEL(R) MARY KITCHEN(R) Roast Beef Hash and chipotle pepper. Cook until the hash is heated and well mixed with the rest of the ingredients, about 2 or 3 minutes. Heat tortillas in a skillet, turning once, until they are soft and can be folded without breaking. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the hash filling and 1 1/2 tablespoons of mozzarella cheese on each tortilla. Fold tortillas in half. Fry in vegetable oil until quesadillas are golden and crispy, about 3 minutes on each side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Mix cilantro and onions together in a small bowl. Serve the quesadillas with salsa, sour cream, onions and cilantro. Enjoy!
