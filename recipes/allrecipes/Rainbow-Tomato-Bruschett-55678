Cut seeded baguette diagonally into 1/4-inch-thick slices; arrange in a single layer on two 14- by 17-inch baking sheets. Bake in a 450 degrees F regular or convection oven until golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Let cool, then mound in a basket or arrange on a platter. Rinse and core tomatoes. For tomatoes larger than 1 inch in diameter, thinly slice crosswise; arrange in a single layer on a rimmed platter. For smaller tomatoes, halve lengthwise and scatter on top. Drizzle extra-virgin olive oil evenly over tomatoes; sprinkle with chopped fresh herbs. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve with toasted baguette slices. Mound tomatoes on slices to eat.
