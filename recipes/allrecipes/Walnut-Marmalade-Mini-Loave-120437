In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Combine the marmalade, orange juice, oil and egg; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Stir in walnuts. Pour into three greased 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-50 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
