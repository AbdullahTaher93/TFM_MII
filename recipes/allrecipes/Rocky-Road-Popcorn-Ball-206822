Place the marshmallows and butter into a large pot over medium-low heat, and melt them together, stirring often. Cook until blended and smooth, about 5 minutes, and remove from heat. Stir in the popcorn and peanuts, and stir gently to thoroughly coat them with the marshmallow mixture. Stir in the chocolate chips. With greased hands, shape the mixture into 3 inch balls, and wrap each ball in plastic wrap.
