In a bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In another bowl, combine the remaining ingredients; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Pour into a greased 9-in. ovenproof skillet. Bake at 425 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cut into wedges; serve warm.
