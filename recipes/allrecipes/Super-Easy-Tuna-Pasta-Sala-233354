Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Rinse pasta with cold water until chilled; drain. Mix pasta and salad dressing in a large bowl; fold tuna into the pasta mixture. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the salad is cold, at least 1/2 hour.
