Place potatoes in medium saucepan, cover with water. Bring to a boil on medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer 15 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Drain potatoes; place in large bowl. Mash with potato masher. Add ham, 1/4 cup green onions and half of the peppers; mix well. Set aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
