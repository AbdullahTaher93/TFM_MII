Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with paper liners. Mix flour, sugar, wheat germ, oat bran, baking soda, and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Add eggs and pineapple; stir until just combined. Fold in coconut. Pour batter into lined muffin cups to about 2/3 full. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
