Combine cider or juice, frozen sliced strawberries, the 4 inches stick cinnamon, and cloves in a large saucepan. Bring to boiling and reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Strain through a sieve lined with 100-percent-cotton cheesecloth. To serve, pour cider mixture into eight heatproof glasses or cups. Garnish each serving with a fresh strawberry slice, if desired.
