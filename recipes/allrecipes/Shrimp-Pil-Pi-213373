Melt the butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and cayenne pepper, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Increase the heat to high, and add the shrimp and white wine. Bring to a boil, and cook until the shrimp are no longer transparent in the center, about 3 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and sweet paprika before serving.
