Make the cake batter according to the directions on the package. Bake in a greased 9-inch cake pan. Once baked, remove from pan and cool. Cut the cake in half. Arrange the cake on a serving platter, turning the halves so that the rounded sides touch. To shape the wings, cut out a 1-inch triangle from each straight side, 2-inches from the bottom. Completely frost the cake with the icing. Design a mosaic pattern with M&M'S(R) Brand Milk Chocolate Candies for Easter, and then press them into the top of the cake. To make the butterfly's antennae, unwrap and soften the STARBURST(R) Brand FUN SIZE(R) Fruit Chews for Easter in the microwave for approximately 5 seconds. Then roll the candy into thin ropes and place them at the top of the butterfly.
