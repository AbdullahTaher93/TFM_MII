Heat the olive oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in chicken and cook about 1 minute. Mix in garlic and onion; cook until tender. Stir in carrot, zucchini, and red bell pepper. Pour in tomatoes with juice. Season with red pepper flakes, basil, and bay leaf, and continue cooking 10 minutes, until vegetables are tender and chicken juices run clear. Stir in the butter until melted, and season with salt and pepper just before serving.
