Combine couscous spice bag and 1 1/4 cups warm water in a 2-quart microwavable bowl. Cover tightly and cook on high for 6 to 7 minutes or until simmering. Remove and stir in couscous and pistachios. Cover and let stand 8 minutes. Meanwhile, in a 2-quart microwavable dish, mix lemon-pepper, thyme, sugar, cardamom, turmeric, and saffron. Add lamb and toss to coat. Mix in onions, garlic, and ginger. Cook on high for 5 to 6 minutes or until vegetables are soft, stirring once halfway through. Stir in raisins and tomatoes, cover tightly with microwave-safe plastic wrap, and cook on high for 5 to 7 minutes or until lamb is no longer pink. Serve with couscous.
