To make the dip: Puree the mixed fruit, tomato paste and vinegar in a blender or food processor; set aside. To make the rice balls: Puree the mixed vegetables, egg, garlic and Worcestershire sauce in a blender or food processor. Mix with rice, cheese, salt and pepper until completely combined. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F, or heat oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees F. Scoop tablespoon-size balls of the rice mixture and gently form into balls, rolling them in the crushed rice cereal to coat. If baking: line a rimmed cookie sheet with foil and spray with oil. Place balls on the sheet and spray with more oil. Bake until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Cool for 3 minutes.
