Combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic powder, ground ginger, dry minced onion, and bourbon whiskey in a 9x13 inch baking pan. Stir in chicken pieces. Cover and refrigerate, stirring often, for several hours or overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Uncover chicken; place in the preheated oven. Baste chicken every 10 minutes. Cook until the juices run clear, about 1 hour. Remove cooked chicken from baking pan; scrape juices and browned bits from the baking dish into a skillet. Stir in the white wine. Cook and stir over medium heat until sauce is hot, and has reduced slightly. Stir in chicken; heat for 1 additional minute before serving.
