In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the simple syrup, ginger and lemongrass stalk. Bring to simmer, cook for about 3-4 minutes to infuse. Place cherries in a stainless steel bowl or container. Pour over the simmered gingered syrup, let cool to room temperature, wrap with plastic, refrigerate for at least eight hours (overnight). To assemble the cocktail: In an old-fashioned glass, combine the kumquats, cherries, sugar, lime juice; carefully muddle the mixture with a pestle. Next, fill a large cocktail shaker half-way with ice cubes and combine the blood orange vodka, grapefruit juice, and cherry juice. Place a few ice cubes in the glasses with the muddled fruit. Then strain the shaken mixture over the ice. Carefully stir each finished drink with the lemongrass stick, garnish with a couple fresh cherries and serve immediately.
