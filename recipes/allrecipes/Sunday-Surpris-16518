In a deep frying pan over high heat, saute butter, tofu, onion and Chinese five- spice seasoning until onions begin to appear translucent. Stir mushrooms into the frying pan, and reduce heat to medium-high. Let cook for 15 minutes; you will notice the mushrooms releasing their juices. Stir constantly, so that nothing gets burned onto the bottom of the pan. Place torn bread in the bottom of each serving dish. Sprinkle shredded cheese over top of the bread. With a ladle, scoop out mushroom-mixture (including the mushroom broth) and ladle it over the bread and cheese. Serve immediately.
