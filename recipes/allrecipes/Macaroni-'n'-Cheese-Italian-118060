Prepare pasta according to package directions until cooked but firm. Meanwhile, in a large nonstick skillet, saute the onion, celery and green pepper in oil until tender. Stir in spaghetti sauce, basil and oregano. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Drain macaroni; stir into sauce. Transfer to a 2-qt. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray; set aside. In a saucepan, combine the flour, salt, nutmeg and cayenne. Gradually stir in milk until smooth. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Reduce heat; stir in cheddar and mozzarella cheeses until melted. Pour over macaroni mixture. Top with Parmesan cheese and tomatoes. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until bubbly and golden brown. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
