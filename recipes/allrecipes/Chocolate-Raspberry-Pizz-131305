Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 12-inch pizza pan with cooking spray. In a medium bowl, stir yogurt into brownie mix until combined well. Pour mixture into pan and spread with a spatula. Bake 18 to 22 minutes or until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean. Let brownie cool completely. Keeping brownie in pan so it doesn't break, spoon whipped topping to cover all but outer inch. Sprinkle on raspberries, then drizzle syrup in a fine stream to create a crisscross pattern across the pan. Sprinkle almonds over top. Cut into 8 slices and serve.
