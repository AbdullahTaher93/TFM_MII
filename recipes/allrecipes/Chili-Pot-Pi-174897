Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Cook ground beef with chili powder in large skillet over medium high heat 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cooked through and crumbled. Meanwhile, prepare cornbread as directed on package, using milk, oil, and eggs called for on cornbread mix package--except do not pour into pan or bake. Stir remaining ingredients into ground beef and heat until hot. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour chili into 13x9-inch baking dish. Spoon prepared cornbread evenly over chili. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown. Serve topped with a bat shaped cheese slice or shredded cheese, if you like.
