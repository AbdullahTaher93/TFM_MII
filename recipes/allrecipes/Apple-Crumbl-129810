Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Mix cream cheese spread and crushed wafers with fork until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. (Do not overmix.) Toss apples with sugar and cinnamon until evenly coated. Spoon evenly into 8 (4-ounce) custard cups or a 1-1/2 quart casserole dish; sprinkle with the crumb mixture. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until crumb mixture is lightly browned and fruit is tender. Serve warm. Store leftover dessert in refrigerator.
