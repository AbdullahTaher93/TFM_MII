Heat the oil in a soup kettle or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the chorizo sausage; cook until browned. Add the onion and ham. Continue to cook and stir until onion is tender. Stir in garlic and red peppers; cook just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in the tomatoes, beans and chicken broth and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add sweet potato and simmer covered until tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in mango and cilantro. Season with salt and pepper.
