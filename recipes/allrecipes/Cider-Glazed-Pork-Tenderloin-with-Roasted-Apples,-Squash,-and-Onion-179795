Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bring cider to a boil in a small saucepan over high heat. Boil until reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare produce: Spread squash, apples, and onions in a single layer in a baking pan. Drizzle with 3 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon each salt and pepper and the rosemary. Transfer to oven and bake, stirring occasionally, until tender and brown, about 40 minutes. Season pork with remaining salt and pepper. In a large ovenproof frying pan, heat remaining 2 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat. Add pork and cook, turning once, until browned on both sides, about 10 minutes total. Pour reduced cider over pork and transfer to oven. Bake, basting occasionally with cider, until a meat thermometer inserted in thickest part reads 150 degrees , about 20 minutes. Remove from oven, tent pan with foil, and let rest 10 minutes before slicing. Serve pork sliced, accompanied by cider pan juices and roasted vegetables.
