Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease or line a 9x13-inch pan with non-stick foil. Mix cake mix, eggs, melted butter, coconut extract and 1 cup of flaked coconut together in a large bowl. Using your fingers, press dough evenly into pan. Bake for 18 minutes. Cool completely. Spread remaining 1/2 cup of coconut on a sheet pan and toast in the 350 degrees F oven for 5 to 8 minutes, checking coconut often to prevent burning. Remove from oven when coconut is lightly toasted. Pour packet of key lime flavour mix into can of frosting starter. Stir until evenly blended. Frost bars with key lime frosting you just created. Cut into bars, then sprinkle toasted coconut on top of each bar.
