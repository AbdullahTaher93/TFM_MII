Butter both sides of bread. Cut a circular hole in the center of the slice of bread, about 2 inches in diameter. Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat. When the frying pan is hot, place the bread into the pan and toast for 1 minute. Turn and toast the other side for 1 minute. Break the egg into the hole in the bread. Cook for 2 minutes, or until the egg is cooked to your preference.
