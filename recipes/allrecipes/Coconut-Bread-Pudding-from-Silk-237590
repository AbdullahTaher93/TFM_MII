Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Coat a 9x13 pan with cooking spray. In a large bowl, whisk together sugar, Silk, eggs, (or egg substitute), spices, salt, coconut extract and rum, if using. Stir in 1 1/2 cups flaked coconut. Gently stir in bread cubes until evenly coated. Spoon mixture into prepared pan, cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 30 minutes. Place pan on a cookie sheet and bake for 25 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup flaked coconut and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until center springs back. Serve warm.
