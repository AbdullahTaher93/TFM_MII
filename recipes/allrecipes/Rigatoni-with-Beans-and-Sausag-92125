In a 5- to 6-quart pan, bring 3 quarts of water to a boil. Add rigatoni and cook until pasta is tender to bite, 12 to 14 minutes. Drain pasta and rinse with cold water until cool to touch. Drain well and set aside. Rinse and dry pan. Meanwhile, discard sausage casing and break meat into small chunks. In a 4- to 5-quart pan, combine sausage, onion, garlic, and 1/4 cup broth. Stir often over high heat until liquid evaporates and browned bits stick to pan, about 15 minutes. Add another 1/4 cup broth, stir browned bits free, and boil again until browned bits stick again. Add remaining broth, the cooked rigatoni, beans, tomato sauce, wine, basil, and oregano. Stir often until mixture is hot, about 5 minutes; mix in 1/2 cup parmesan. Spoon mixture into bowls and offer additional cheese to add to taste.
