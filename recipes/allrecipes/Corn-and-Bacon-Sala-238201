Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the corn and cook until slightly soft but still crisp, about 5 minutes. Cut corn kernels from the cobs; discard cobs. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir bacon in hot oil until browned and crisp, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, reserving drippings in the skillet. Cook potatoes, stirring occasionally, in the same skillet over medium heat until potatoes are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add red bell pepper and salt; cook and stir until peppers are tender, about 5 minutes more. Stir corn kernels into potato mixture and cook until corn is heated through, about 5 minutes. Pour corn-potato mixture into a large bowl. Add bacon, red onion, cider vinegar, and red pepper flakes; toss to combine.
