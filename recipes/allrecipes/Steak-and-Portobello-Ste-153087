Place steak in a medium bowl and sprinkle with flour; turn to coat. Reserve 1 teaspoon of the excess flour. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the steak and cook, stirring once or twice, until browned on most sides and still pink in the middle, about 3 minutes. Transfer the steak to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm. Add tomato, mushrooms and onions to the pot and cook, scraping up any browned bits, until the vegetables have released their juices, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle the reserved teaspoon of flour over the vegetables and stir to coat. Add broth, green beans, wine, thyme, salt and pepper; increase heat to high and bring to a boil, stirring often. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring often, until the broth has thickened, about 5 minutes. Add the steak and any accumulated juices and cook, stirring often, until heated through, about 2 minutes.
