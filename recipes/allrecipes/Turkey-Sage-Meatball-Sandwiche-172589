In a medium bowl, combine egg whites, broth, bread crumbs, sage, and salt; mix until well combined. Add turkey, cranberries, and onion; mix lightly. Shape turkey mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls. Spray a shallow baking pan with cooking spray; arrange meatballs, slightly apart, in pan. Bake in a 450 degrees F oven until meatballs are no longer pink in center; cut to test (12 to 15 minutes). Wrap rolls in foil and place in oven to warm 6 to 8 minutes before meatballs are done. Place half the arugula on bottom half of each warm roll. Set half the hot meatballs on arugula on each roll, then top with half the cheese. Add top halves of rolls; offer mustard to add to taste.
