Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray 12 muffin cups with cooking spray. Combine mozzarella cheese and Asiago cheese together in a bowl. Press a wonton wrapper into the bottom of each muffin cup. Spoon pasta sauce about halfway full in each muffin cup; sprinkle with 2 to 3 tablespoons cheese mixture. Press another wonton wrapper on top of cheese layer. Add another spoonful of sauce; sprinkle with cheese. Repeat to fill all the muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling and cheese is melted, 20 to 25 minutes.
