Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Once the Sister Schubert Mini Loaf is thawed gently remove it from pan. Partially separate each piece and return loaf to pan. In a small mixing bowl, combine butter, garlic, parsley, Parmesan cheese and pepper. Using a small metal spatula spread each side of the bread with the mixture. Spread the top surface with the remaining mixture. Place loaf in oven and bake 8 to 10 minutes or until warm. Serve.
