In a 2-quart (2-L) saucepan, bring the strawberries, grape juice, orange juice, lemon extract, and nutmeg to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 minute. Let cool for 5 minutes. Transfer the soup to a blender and puree until smooth. Pour into a large bowl. Chill for 30 minutes. Whisk in the yogurt and chill another 30 minutes before serving.
