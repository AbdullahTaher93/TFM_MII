Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, celery, carrots, basil, garlic, and black pepper until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer 1/2 of the vegetable mixture to a food processor. Stir 2 cans stewed tomatoes into the pot. Drain the remaining can of stewed tomatoes and add to the food processor. Blend vegetable-tomato mixture until smooth. Stir pureed mixture into pot with vegetables. Mix clams, clam juice, and potatoes into the pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer soup until heated through, 15 to 20 minutes. Season soup with Worcestershire sauce.
