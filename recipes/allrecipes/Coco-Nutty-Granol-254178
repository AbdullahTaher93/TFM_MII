Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Combine oats, coconut, pecans, almonds, sea salt, flax seeds, cinnamon, nutmeg, paprika, and ginger in a large bowl. Spread evenly on the lined baked sheet. Stir 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons coconut oil, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons brown sugar, honey, molasses, and vanilla extract together in a saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves, about 3 minutes. Pour over oat mixture and mix with a spoon until evenly coated. Bake in the preheated oven, stirring halfway through, until granola is evenly browned, about 20 minutes. Cool completely before storing.
