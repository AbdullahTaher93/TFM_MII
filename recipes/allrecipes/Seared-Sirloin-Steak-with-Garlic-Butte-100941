Mix butter with garlic and garlic powder, and set aside. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Coat steaks with oil and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Add steaks to pan and cook until well-browned on both sides, about 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium-rare to medium or to desired doneness. Transfer each steak to a dinner plate. While steaks rest, add broth and wine to the hot skillet; simmer until reduced by half. Pour sauce over each steak, and smear a little butter over each steak before serving.
