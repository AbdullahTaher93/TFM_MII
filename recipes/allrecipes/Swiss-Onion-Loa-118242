In a bowl, combine cheese and minced onion with dry ingredients of hot roll mix. Prepare mix according to package directions. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Shape into a 5-in. ball and place on a greased baking sheet. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes or until doubled. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Brush with butter. Remove to a wire rack to cool.
