Place sirloin flat on a cutting board, spread on mustard and salt and pepper to taste. Place 1/2 strip bacon, 1 onion wedge, and 1 pickle wedge onto the steak. Roll making sure all items stay inside and tuck ends in. Tie up with butcher string. Repeat for each steak. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large stock pot, over medium heat. Brown meat well. Pour in enough water to cover meat. Reduce heat to medium/low heat and cook for 1 hour. When meat is cooked, stir in gravy mix. Heat through.
