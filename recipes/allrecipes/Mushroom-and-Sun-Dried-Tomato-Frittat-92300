In a large bowl, beat eggs lightly with half-and-half. Add salt and pepper to taste. Set aside. Heat olive oil in a 12-inch nonstick ovenproof frying pan over medium-high heat. Add onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, and garlic; cook, stirring, until mushrooms are limp, about 8 minutes. Add egg mixture to vegetables and lightly scramble until eggs begin to solidify, about 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat and sprinkle goat cheese on top of egg-vegetable mixture. Place pan in a 400 degrees F oven and bake until mixture is lightly brown, about 12 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Slide out of pan and serve.
