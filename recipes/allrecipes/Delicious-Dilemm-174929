Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease 13 x 9-inch baking pan. Place bar in prepared baking pan. Allow to soften for 5 to 10 minutes. Using fingertips, pat dough gently to cover bottom and one inch up side of pan. Stir raspberry jam in small bowl until smooth. Spread the jam evenly over the dough leaving a 1/2-inch border. Sprinkle 2/3 cup white morsels and 2/3 cup mini morsels over the jam. Beat cream cheese and sugar in medium mixer bowl until smooth. Add egg and vanilla extract; beat until combined. Spread cream cheese mixture over the morsels. Sprinkle the top with remaining 1/3 cup morsels and almonds. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until sides are golden brown and center is set. Cool completely in pan on wire rack. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Cut into bars.
