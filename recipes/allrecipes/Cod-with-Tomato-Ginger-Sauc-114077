In a large deep frying pan, heat the oil over moderately low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in the ginger; cook, stirring, 2 minutes longer. Add the tomatoes and salt and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10 minutes. Add the fillets and black pepper to the pan and cook, covered, until just done, 10 to 12 minutes longer for 1-inch thick fillets. Stir the cilantro into the sauce. Serve the fish topped with the sauce.
