Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place biscuits 1 to 2 inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, 13 to 17 minutes. Remove from oven and cool until easily handled, about 5 minutes. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken; cook and stir until golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Add butter, garlic, and onion powder; stir well to combine. Stir in hot pepper sauce. Split biscuits open; spread blue cheese dressing over each half. Top with chicken mixture.
