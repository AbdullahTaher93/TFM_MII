Preheat oven to 350 degrees (175 degrees C). Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add turnips; cook until tender but still firm. Drain. In a large bowl, add turnips, butter, salt, cream, eggs, brown sugar and 1 cup corn flakes. Blend until well mixed. Pour into a 2 quart casserole dish, sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons crushed corn flakes. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes.
