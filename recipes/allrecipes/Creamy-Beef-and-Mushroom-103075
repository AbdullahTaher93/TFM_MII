Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook mushrooms and onion in butter until onions are tender and mushrooms are golden brown, about 5 to 7 minutes. Crumble meat into pan, and season with dill; cook until meat has browned, about 4 to 5 minutes. Mix in flour, and then pour in broth and milk. Simmer until sauce is bubbly and thick, about 2 to 3 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
