In a saucepan over medium heat, add the sliced onions and add just enough water to cover. Bring to a simmer and cook just enough to soften. Remove from heat and drain. Rinse with cold water and drain. Take one 1 large tomato and score an 'X' , skin deep, on the top and bottom. Place in the same saucepan used for the onions and add enough water to cover. Bring to a simmer and cook until soft and the skin starts to peel, about 5 minutes. Remove the tomato and rinse under cold water until it's cool enough to hold in your hand. Using your fingers or the blade of a knife, gently peel off the skin. Place the peeled tomato in a blender and puree. In a large glass dish or bowl, combine the onions, olive oil and lemon juice. Stir in the oysters, pureed tomato, diced tomato, green onions, ketchup and soy sauce. Season with garlic salt, parsley, sugar, and salt to taste.
