In a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon, onion and red pepper flakes until onion is tender but not browned. Stir in the tomatoes and wine; simmer for about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Add pasta to the sauce and toss well; simmer for 2 to 3 minutes more (this will infuse the pasta with the sauce). Add salt and black ground pepper to taste; serve.
