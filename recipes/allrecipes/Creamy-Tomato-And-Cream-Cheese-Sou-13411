Place the tomatoes with juice in a well buttered oven-proof baking dish. Mix in celery, garlic, and red pepper. Cover, and bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 25 minutes. In a large stock pot, melt butter or margarine over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and onions, and cook and stir for about 8 minutes. Slowly stir in flour and sugar. Add beef stock, basil, rosemary, and thyme, stirring until soup comes to a boil. Add the contents of the baked tomato pan from the oven, and bring to a boil. Cover, and simmer the soup for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a food processor, blend the cream cheese until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Slowly stir the cream cheese into the soup. Garnish with chopped parsley.
