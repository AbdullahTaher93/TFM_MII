Beat pudding mix and milk in medium bowl with whisk 2 minutes. Gently stir in COOL WHIP. Spoon 2 tablespoons chopped cookies into each of 8 (8- to 9-ounce) paper drinking cups. Cover evenly with half the pudding mixture. Press gently with back of spoon to eliminate air pockets. Repeat layers. Cover with foil. Freeze 5 hours or until firm. Remove from freezer about 15 minutes before serving. Let stand at room temperature to soften slightly. Peel away paper to unmold onto dessert plates. Top each with a cherry.
