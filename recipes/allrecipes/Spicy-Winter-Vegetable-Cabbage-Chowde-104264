In large saucepan, simmer cauliflower and carrots in one cup chicken broth and one cup water for 10 minutes, season with 1/2 teaspoon Morton(R) Kosher Salt. Cool 5 minutes; puree in blender until smooth. Set aside. In same large saucepan, saute cabbage, leek and garlic in olive oil and giardiniera relish until soft; add remaining chicken broth and water; bring mixture to boil. Stir in pasta shells and simmer for 8 minutes. Stir in cooked beef and cauliflower/carrot puree until combined with pasta/cabbage mixture. Season with remaining teaspoon Morton(R) Kosher Salt.

Serve chowder immediately with toasted Focaccia or spicy quesadillas.
