In a large bowl, stir together soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, chili flakes, sesame oil, and garlic. Cut swordfish into 3/4-inch cubes and place in bowl with marinade. Mix well, then cover and chill for 1 hour or up to 6 hours; mix fish with marinade several times. Thread fish and jicama onto 8 slender 10-inch-long skewers, alternating pieces of fish with jicama. Reserve marinade. Lay skewers on a lightly oiled grill above a solid bed of medium-hot coals (you can hold your hand at grill level for only 3 to 4 seconds) or over medium-high heat on a gas grill. Close lid on gas grill. Turn fish to cook evenly, basting with the marinade. Cook until fish is opaque but still moist-looking in the center (cut to test), about 6 minutes total; jicama will stay crisp. Arrange skewered fish on platter.
