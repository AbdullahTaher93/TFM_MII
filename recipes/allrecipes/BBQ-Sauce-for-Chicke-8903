In a medium skillet saute onion and garlic for 4 to 5 minutes (until translucent). Add the orange juice, mustard, ketchup, lemon, Chianti/burgundy, salt and pepper. Simmer all together over low heat for 30 minutes, then put through food processor. Sauce may be thinned with water to taste, if desired.
