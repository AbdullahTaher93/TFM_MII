Line a baking sheet with foil and crimp the edges up, in case filling oozes out of any cracks in the dough. Coat with cooking spray. To make the crust: Mix the 2 flours and salt together in a bowl. Cut the butter in until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center and add the egg yolk, honey, and sour cream. Stir to combine and fold into the flour just until combined. Flatten the dough into a disc, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for an hour or up to 24 hours. To make the jam: Bring the apple, juice, and honey to a boil. Keep on a low boil for 20 minutes. Watch carefully--do not let all the liquid boil away! Add the berries and cinnamon and continue to cook for another 15 minutes. Turn the jam into a wide-bottom bowl and allow to cool. This part may be made up to one day in advance. Bring the jam to room temperature before baking. To bake the crostata: Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Roll the dough out to 11 inches in diameter. Place it on the baking sheet and brush the entire surface with the egg white. Spread the jam evenly in the center of the dough. Fold and crimp the crust over, making a slightly higher barrier of the crust to prevent the jam from bubbling over. After folding, the crostata should measure about 7 inches in diameter. Place in the center of the oven and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until golden brown.
