Bruise lemon grass (to release its flavor). Coarsely chop 1/4 cup cilantro leaves, reserving stems (save extra leaves for other uses). In a 4 to 6 quart pan, combine broth, crushed lemon grass, cilantro stems, 1/4 cup of the green onions, ginger, chilies, garlic, and peppercorns. Bring to a simmer over high heat; cover, reduce heat to maintain a simmer, and cook 30 minutes. Pour through a strainer over a large bowl; discard solids. Meanwhile, in another 4 to 6 quart pan over high heat, bring about 3 quarts water to a boil. Add noodles and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender to bite, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain. Divide noodles between two large soup bowls and ladle broth over noodles. Sprinkle with chopped cilantro leaves and remaining 1/4 cup green onions.
