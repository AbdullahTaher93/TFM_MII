Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Sift together flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. In a large bowl, beat eggs with sugar for 10 minutes. Gradually add oil and beat for two more minutes. Mix in lemon extract, zucchini and pecans. Fold in flour mixture until evenly moistened; do not overmix. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean.
