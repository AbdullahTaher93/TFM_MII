Place carrots, celery, and red bell pepper in small microwaveable bowl. Add 1/4 cup water, cover top of bowl loosely with plastic wrap, and microwave on high 5 minutes or until vegetables are just tender. Heat oil in stockpot over medium heat. Add onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add steamed vegetables and season with salt. Saute an additional 5 minutes or until vegetables are slightly caramelized. Add tomatoes (with juice) and water. (Depending on the brand of tomatoes, you may need to add more water.) Add beans, cilantro, and chipotle sauce. Stir to blend, bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook 25 to 30 minutes. Add lime juice and top each serving with tortilla strips and a tablespoon of sour cream (if using) right before serving.
