Place eggplant in a pot of salted water, bring pot to a boil. Let eggplant cook until tender; drain well. In an electric food processor, combine eggplant, flour, egg, white pepper, and pepperoncini. Blend until a smooth paste is formed. In a heavy pot or deep fryer, heat vegetable oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Drop eggplant paste into the oil one spoonful at a time. Fry until the eggplant balls are golden. Salt to taste and drain on paper towels before serving.
