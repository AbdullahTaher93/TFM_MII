Preheat barbecue grill. Combine juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, and cornstarch in 1-cup glass measure, mixing well. Microwave on full power (100%) 2 1/2 to 3 minutes or until thickened, stirring once. Place beef steaks on grid over medium, ash-covered coals. Grill, uncovered, 11 to 14 minutes for medium rare to medium doneness, turning occasionally and brushing both sides with some of the glaze during last 5 minutes. Carve steaks; drizzle with remaining glaze.
