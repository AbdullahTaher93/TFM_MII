Heat a panino press according to the manufacturer's instructions. Place 1 slice prosciutto and 1 slice fontina cheese onto a slice of bread; repeat with remaining prosciutto, fontina cheese, and slice of bread. Add 1/2 of the giardiniera on top of each cheese layer and top sandwiches with remaining bread slices, creating 2 sandwiches. Cook each panino in the press until the cheese has melted and the bread has toasted, about 3 minutes. Serve with hot pickled peppers on the side.
