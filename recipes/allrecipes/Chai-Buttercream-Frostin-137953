Prepare a very strong tea by steeping the tea bag in boiling water for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, cream the butter in a large bowl using an electric mixer until fluffy. Add confectioners' sugar, and continue creaming until well blended. Pour tea into cold milk; beat milk into frosting until incorporated. Continue beating frosting until fluffy.
