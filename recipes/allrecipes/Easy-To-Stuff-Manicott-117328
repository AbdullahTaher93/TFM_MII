Cook manicotti according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the spaghetti sauce. Spread half of the meat sauce into a greased 13-in.x 9-in.x 2-in. baking dish. Drain manicotti; stuff each shell with a piece of string cheese. Place over meat sauce; top with remaining sauce. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 24-30 min. or until heated through. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Bake, uncovered, for 5-10 minutes or until the cheese is melted.
