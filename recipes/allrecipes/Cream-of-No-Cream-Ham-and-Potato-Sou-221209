Heat vegetable oil in a large soup pot over medium heat; cook potatoes, celery, white kidney beans, onion, and garlic in the hot oil until onion is lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour chicken broth over the vegetables and place ham bone into the soup. Bring soup to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer soup until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes; remove ham bone and 2 cups of vegetables and kidney beans. Place the 2 cups vegetables and beans into a blender and process until pureed. Stir chopped ham into soup and pour in the pureed vegetables. Mix in corn and let the soup heat through before serving.
