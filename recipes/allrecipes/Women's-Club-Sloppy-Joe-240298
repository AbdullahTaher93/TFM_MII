Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and onion to skillet and season with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until beef is completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Return skillet to stove top. Stir chili sauce, green bell pepper, and tomato sauce into the beef mixture; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring regularly, until the sauce is thick, about 30 minutes.
