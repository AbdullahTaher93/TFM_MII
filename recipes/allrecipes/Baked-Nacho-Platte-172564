Scatter half the tortilla chips on a 10- by 15-in. rimmed baking sheet. Into an 8- or 9-in. frying pan, spoon refried black beans; warm over medium-high heat. Drop half the beans over the chips, then sprinkle half the chiles and olives over the beans. Top with 1 cup cheese. Repeat to make one more layer, starting with another layer of chips, then using the remaining beans, chiles, and olives. Top with remaining cheese. Bake in a 350 degrees F oven until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes. Immediately sprinkle sliced onions over top. Garnish with sour cream, guacamole, and cheese, if desired. Serve from baking sheet; pull apart to eat.
