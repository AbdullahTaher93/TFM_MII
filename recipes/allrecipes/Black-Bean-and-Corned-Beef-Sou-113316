In a large pot, heat the oil over moderate heat. Add the onion, carrots, celery, bell pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables start to soften, about 10 minutes. Add the water, broth, and the remaining teaspoon of salt to the pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir the beans and jalapeno into the soup and simmer for 5 minutes more. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the corned beef, vinegar, and parsley.
