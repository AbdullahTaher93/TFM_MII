Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until beginning to crisp and release bacon drippings. Add onion and kohlrabi to skillet; cook and stir 5 minutes. Add yellow squash, garlic, salt, and black pepper. Cook until squash has released some liquid but is not soggy, about 10 minutes. Serve immediately.
