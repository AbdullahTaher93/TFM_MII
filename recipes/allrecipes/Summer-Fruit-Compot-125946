In a large saucepan, combine the water, dried fruit, orange juice concentrate, brown sugar, allspice berries, bay leaf, and cinnamon stick or ground cinnamon. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until the fruit is very tender. Add the peaches and plums. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the peaches and plums are tender but not mushy. Stir in the cherries, if using, and cook for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and place in a serving bowl. Let stand for at least 1 hour, or until the fruit has cooled and the flavors have blended. Remove and discard the bay leaf and cinnamon stick before serving.
