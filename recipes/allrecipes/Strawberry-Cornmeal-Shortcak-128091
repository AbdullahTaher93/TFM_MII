In a large bowl, combine the strawberries, blueberries, juice, and orange peel. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Coat a large baking sheet with nonstick spray. Reserve 2 tablespoons (25 mL) of the flour. In a food processor, combine the remaining flour, the cornmeal, sugar, and baking powder. Add the margarine and pulse on and off until coarse crumbs form. With the motor running, add the buttermilk and process just until a dough forms. Sprinkle a flat work surface with the reserved 2 tablespoons (25 mL) of flour. Turn out the dough and knead 10 times. Roll the dough to a 6 x 12-inch (15 x 30 cm) rectangle. With a 3-inch (7.5-cm) round biscuit cutter, cut out 8 biscuits. Place them on the baking sheet. Bake until the shortcake biscuits are golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 12 to 15 minutes. Split the warm biscuits in half horizontally and fill each with an equal amount of the berry mixture. Garnish with the whipped topping.
