In a large skillet, brown meat. Add the onions and celery; cook until onions are transparent. Stir in sauerkraut, noodles, soup and mushrooms; season with salt and pepper. Spoon into a greased 2-qt. casserole. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours or until the meat is tender. Stir occasionally.
