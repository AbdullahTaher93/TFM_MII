Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Mix onion and green bell pepper into ground beef. Mix tomato sauce, diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, ranch-style beans, stewed tomatoes, and chili powder into beef mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until flavors have blended, 30 to 45 minutes. Layer corn chips and hamburger mixture into serving bowls and top with Cheddar cheese.
