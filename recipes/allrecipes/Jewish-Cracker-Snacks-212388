Stir together the cottage cheese, matzo meal, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Place about 1 tablespoon of the cheese filling onto a cracker, top with another cracker, and press down. Set the filled crackers aside. Beat the eggs in a shallow bowl. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip both sides of each filled cracker in the beaten egg, then place into the hot oil. Pan-fry the cracker snacks on both sides until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Serve hot.
