Pound chicken gently, smooth side down, with meat mallet or rolling pin until 1/2 inch thick. Mix in shallow dish butter and 1 tablespoon of the cooking sauce; in another shallow dish, mix bread crumbs and cheese. Dip chicken into butter mixture, then dip into bread crumb mixture to coat. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Brown chicken in oil 12 to 15 minutes, carefully turning once, until chicken is no longer pink in center and coating is golden brown. Heat remaining sauce until hot. Serve with chicken and mashed potatoes.
