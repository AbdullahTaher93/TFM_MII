Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray. Sift 2 cups flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a large bowl. Stir in lemon peel. Cut butter in with a pastry blender or fork until the mixture is resembles cornmeal. Mix in 1/2 cup HERSHEY'S Cinnamon Chips. In a small bowl, whisk together sour cream, egg yolk, and vanilla. Stir in 1/2 cup melted HERSHEY'S HUGS . Mix into flour and butter mixture, and mix until dough comes together in moist clumps. Gather dough into ball. Press dough out on lightly floured surface to form a 8 inch round; cut into 6 wedges. Transfer wedges to prepared baking sheet, spacing 1 inch apart. Brush tops lightly with cream. Bake until scones are crusty on top, and a tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 15 to 20 minutes. Cool slightly. Drizzle the scones alternately with 1/4 cup melted HERSHEY'S HUGS and 1/4 melted HERSHEY'S Cinnamon Chips.
