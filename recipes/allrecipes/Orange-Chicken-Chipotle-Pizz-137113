Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly spray 14-inch pizza pan with cooking spray. Unroll dough; place on sprayed pan. Starting at center, press out dough to edge of pan. Bake at 425 degrees F for 6 to 8 minutes or just until crust begins to brown. Meanwhile, in 10-inch skillet, heat oil over medium heat until hot. Add onion; cook 6 to 8 minutes, stirring frequently, until caramelized. Remove partially baked crust from oven; reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Add chicken to skillet; cook 5 to 6 minutes, stirring frequently, until chicken is no longer pink in center. Stir in marmalade, seasoned salt, cumin, chipotle chiles and mandarin orange segments. Remove from heat; cool 1 minute. Spread chicken mixture evenly over crust. Sprinkle both cheeses over top. Return to oven; bake at 375 degrees F for 10 to 13 minutes or until cheese is melted and crust is deep golden brown. Cut into wedges.
