Heat the oil on medium heat in a nonstick skillet. When the oil is hot, add the onion, peppers, and corn and stir to mix. Add the eggplant and saute for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the tomatoes and cook until the vegetables are tender, stirring as needed. Remove from heat and add the oregano, cheese, and walnuts. Serve immediately.
