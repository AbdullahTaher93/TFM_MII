Toast rye bread in a toaster until lightly browned. Cut into cubes. Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion and celery in butter until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir flour into onion mixture. Gradually stir water and bouillon into onion mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir corned beef, half-and-half, 1 cup Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut into pot. Cook, stirring frequently, until soup thickens, about 30 minutes. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Ladle soup into 8 oven-proof bowls. Top each soup bowl with bread cubes and 1/4 cup cheese. Broil soup in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.
