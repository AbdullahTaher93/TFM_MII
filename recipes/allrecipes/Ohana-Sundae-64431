Heat grill to medium. Combine orange juice, pineapple juice, lemon juice, honey, allspice and cornstarch in small saucepan. Over medium heat, stirring occasionally, bring to a boil and cook until thickened. Remove from heat; cool slightly. Thread pineapple, banana, strawberry and mango on wooden skewers. Repeat so there are 2 pieces of each fruit on each skewer. Repeat for remaining skewers. Grill kabobs 3 to 5 minutes per side until fruit starts to brown. Generously brush fruit with sauce while grilling. Serve skewer alone or with vanilla ice cream. Pour remaining sauce over fruit and ice cream to taste.
