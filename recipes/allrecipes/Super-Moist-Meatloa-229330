Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Thoroughly mix ground beef, onion, eggs, bread, milk, green bell pepper, salt, sage, and black pepper together in a bowl. Press into a loaf pan. Spread ketchup over the top of the loaf. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
