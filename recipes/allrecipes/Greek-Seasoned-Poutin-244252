Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Combine potato slices, olive oil, mint, Greek seasoning, lemon zest, salt, and pepper together in a resealable plastic bag; close and shake until evenly coated. Spread coated potato slices onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until fries are crisp and browned, 40 to 60 minutes. Sprinkle cheese curds over fries and top with gravy.
