Place chili peppers, cumin seed, ginger-garlic paste, salt, turmeric, lime juice, and cilantro into a blender. Puree until the cilantro is very finely chopped, then add yogurt, and puree until smooth. Pour over the chicken drumsticks in a resealable plastic bag, and mix to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours. To cook, heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion, and cook until the onion softens and turns translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken and marinade, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the drumsticks are tender, 30 to 40 minutes.
