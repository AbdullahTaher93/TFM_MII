In a greased 9-in. microwave-safe pie plate, layer the bacon, cheese, mushrooms and onion. In a bowl, beat the eggs, milk and cayenne; pour over the onion. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 6 minutes, stirring twice. Cook 2-3 minutes longer or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand for 5 minutes or until set. Cut into wedges.
