Place bread, cheese, garlic, thyme and black pepper in blender or food processor. Cover and blend until fine crumbs form. Slowly add olive oil and blend until moistened. Arrange fish fillets in large shallow roasting pan. Brush with egg. Divide bread crumb mixture evenly over fillets. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10 minutes or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork and crumb topping is golden.
