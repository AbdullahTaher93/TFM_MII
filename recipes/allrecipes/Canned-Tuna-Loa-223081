Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prepare a glass loaf pan with cooking spray. Beat eggs, mayonnaise, horseradish, parsley, paprika, cayenne pepper, and black pepper together in a large bowl until smooth. Add tuna in water, bread crumbs, and onion; mix until evenly moistened. Pack tuna mixture into prepared loaf pan. Bake in preheated oven until hot and fully cooked in the center, about 30 minutes.
