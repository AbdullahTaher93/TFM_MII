Prepare chocolate mousse or pudding per the package instructions substituting 1/2 cup milk with Kahlua Mocha. Pour pudding into the tarts and chill to set. Whip the whipping cream until peaks form. When mousse has set up, place a dollop of whipped cream on top and garnish with chocolate shavings and a pinch of cayenne pepper.
