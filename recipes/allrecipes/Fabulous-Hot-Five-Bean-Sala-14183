Cut bacon into small pieces using kitchen shears, and place in a large skillet. Cook, turning frequently, over medium high heat until evenly browned. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup drippings. Set bacon aside. Return reserved drippings to skillet. Mix together sugar, cornstarch, and salt and pepper; blend into drippings. Stir in vinegar and water; cook and stir until boiling. Stir in drained beans. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Stir occasionally. Turn bean mixture into serving dish. Crumble bacon over beans.
