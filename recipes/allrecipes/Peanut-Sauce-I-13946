Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, jalapeno pepper, and ginger; cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Stir in peanut butter, water, tamari, and honey until smooth. Add shredded basil. Heat through, and remove from heat. Garnish with whole basil leaves, if desired.
