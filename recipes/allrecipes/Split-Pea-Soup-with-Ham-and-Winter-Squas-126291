In a large saucepot or Dutch oven, combine the ham hock, water, garlic, thyme, sage, and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer, turning the ham hock once, for 1 hour. Cool. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. After the broth has chilled, skim and discard the fat from the surface. Remove the ham hock and cut the meat off the bone; set aside. Discard the bone and any fat. Add the split peas to the broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour, or until the peas are soft and tender. Add the squash, potatoes, carrots, celery, onions, salt, and ham. Return to a boil. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.
