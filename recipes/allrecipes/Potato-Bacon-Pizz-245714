Place potato slices in a deep skillet and cover with 1 inch of water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until just tender, about 5 minutes. Drain; set aside to cool. Place bacon slices in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; set aside to cool. Heat cream, butter, and garlic together in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until butter is melted, about 5 minutes. Add Parmesan cheese; stir until melted. Reduce heat to low and simmer sauce, uncovered, until thick, about 5 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 2 pizza pans. Combine warm water, honey, and yeast in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. Stir oil into yeast mixture. Mix in flour, 1 cup at a time, until dough starts to come together. Turn out dough onto a well-floured surface. Knead, adding more flour as you work, until dough is no longer sticky. Divide dough into 2 pieces and roll out to the size of your pizza pans; transfer to greased pans. Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven and spread sauce over both crusts. Cover sauce with potato slices. Crumble bacon slices over potatoes and cover with mozzarella cheese. Bake pizzas in the preheated oven until crusts are golden brown and cheese is bubbly, about 10 minutes.
