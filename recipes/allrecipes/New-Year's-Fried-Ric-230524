Cook and stir bacon in a wok or large skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon and leave drippings in wok. Cook and stir red bell pepper, peas, and green onion in the hot droppings for 1 minute. Pour egg into wok with vegetables and toss lightly in the bacon drippings to scramble, about 2 minutes. Mix bacon and cooked rice into vegetables and egg, stirring to break apart any clumps of rice. Drizzle rice with soy sauce and cook until heated through, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Serve immediately.
