Trim off eggplant stem. Slice eggplant crosswise 1/2-inch thick. Lay slices in a single layer on a lightly oiled 10- by 15-inch baking pan. Brush tops with olive oil. Bake in a 450 degrees F oven until browned and very soft when pressed, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, peel, pit, and dice avocado. Add lime juice, tomato, and cilantro to diced avocado. Add minced chilies to taste. Top each eggplant slice with cheese, trimming slices to fit. Return to oven until cheese melts, about 3 minutes. With a wide spatula, carefully transfer rounds equally onto 4 dinner plates. Place 1/4 of the onion and 1/4 of the avocado salsa over each portion. Garnish with cilantro sprigs.
