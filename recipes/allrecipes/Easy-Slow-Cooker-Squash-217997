Place the squash and onion into a pot, and pour in enough water just to cover. Bring to a boil, cover the pot, and simmer the vegetables until tender, about 10 minutes. Do not stir. Drain the squash and onion in a colander set in the sink. Gently layer the cooked squash and onions, cubes of butter, and cheese food cubes in a slow cooker. Set the cooker on Low, and cook until the squash are very tender and the butter and cheese have formed a creamy sauce, about 1 hour. Do not stir.
