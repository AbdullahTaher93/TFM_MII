Heat olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Stir in green onions, and cook until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix white wine and tomatoes with the green onions, and bring to a boil. Place orange roughy fillets in the white wine mixture. Season with basil, pepper, thyme, and rosemary. Reduce heat, and simmer 15 to 20 minutes, until fish is easily flaked with a fork. Remove fish fillets from skillet. Sprinkle fish fillets with black olives and feta cheese.
