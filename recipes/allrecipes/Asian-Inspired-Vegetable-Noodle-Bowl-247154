Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add noodles; cook until tender yet still firm to the bite, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain and divide among 4 large soup bowls. Combine vegetable stock, soy sauce, ginger, chile sauce, and garlic in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a gentle simmer. Simmer until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Squeeze spinach to drain out excess moisture; coarsely chop. Add to stock with soybeans and red bell pepper; cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Ladle over noodles.
