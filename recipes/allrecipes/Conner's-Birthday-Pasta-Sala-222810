Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and rinse under cold water. Mix pasta, kidney beans, garbanzo beans, cherry tomatoes, green bell pepper, green olives, ripe olives, Cheddar cheese, and sausage together in a bowl. Add dressing and toss to coat. Marinate in refrigerator for at least 2 hours before serving.
