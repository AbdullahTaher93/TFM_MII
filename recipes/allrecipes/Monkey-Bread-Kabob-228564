Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line three baking sheets and three cooling racks with parchment paper. Mix white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a large resealable bag. Cut each biscuit into four pieces. Dip each biscuit piece in melted butter; transfer to sugar mixture. Gently shake bag to coat biscuits in sugar mixture. Thread three biscuit pieces onto a skewer; add a maraschino cherry. Repeat with three more biscuit pieces, ending with a maraschino cherry. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make 20 kabobs. Arrange kabobs on the prepared baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are cooked through, about 15 minutes. Flip kabobs halfway through cooking. Transfer kabobs to prepared wire racks and let cool.
