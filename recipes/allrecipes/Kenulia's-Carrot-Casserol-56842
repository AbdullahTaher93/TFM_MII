Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a bowl, mix the carrots, cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, butter, 1/2 cup French fried onions, and garlic salt. Scoop into a 2 quart casserole dish. Top with remaining French fried onions and dried parsley. Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly and lightly browned.
