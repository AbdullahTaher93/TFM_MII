Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Mix ground turkey, onion, almond flour, egg, garlic, basil, seasoning blend, and black pepper together thoroughly in a bowl. Form 5 burger patties using about 1/3 cup of the turkey mixture for each. Cook turkey burgers on preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
