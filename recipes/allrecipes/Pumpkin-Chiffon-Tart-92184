Crust. In a bowl, mix crushed gingersnaps and butter until thoroughly blended. Divide mixture evenly among 4 individual tartlet pans (4 1/2 in. in diameter) with removable rims. Press crumb mixture over bottom and up sides of pans. Bake crusts in a 325 degrees F oven until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Cool crusts completely. Filling. Meanwhile, combine pumpkin, 1/2 cup sugar, egg, milk, ginger, and cinnamon in a 3- to 4-quart pan; whisk until well blended. Stir often over medium heat until mixture thickens, 7 to 8 minutes (160 degrees F on a candy thermometer, if using). Remove from heat and cool pumpkin mixture to room temperature. (To hasten cooling process, set pan in a shallow bowl of ice water and stir often until mixture is cool.) When cool, pour 2 tablespoons water into a small cup. Sprinkle gelatin over top of water and let stand until softened, about 5 minutes. Add softened gelatin mixture to pumpkin mixture; stir to blend completely. In a bowl with an electric mixer on high speed, beat whipping cream until it's just barely fluffy. Add remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and continue beating until cream holds soft peaks. Gently fold cream into pumpkin mixture. Spoon equally into crusts, then chill until set, at least 4 hours or up to 6 hours. When ready to serve, gently remove pan rims and place tarts on individual plates. If desired, garnish with sweetened whipped cream and sliced almonds.
