Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and slowly cook and stir the onions and celery until soft. Transfer to a large bowl. Mix in the stuffing mix, Golden delicious apples, water chestnuts, turkey broth, applesauce, sugar and pepper. Increase the amount of broth, if desired. Transfer the mixture to a medium baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven 25 to 30 minutes, or until lightly browned.
