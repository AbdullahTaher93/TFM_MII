Place chicken in a large resealable plastic bag; add buttermilk. Seal bag and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. In a shallow bowl, combine butter, lemon juice and garlic. In another bowl, combine bread crumbs, sesame seeds, Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper. Drain chicken, discarding buttermilk; dry on paper towels. Dip chicken in butter mixture, then coat with crumb mixture. Place in an ungreased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Drizzle with remaining butter mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 450 degrees F for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F and bake an additional 20 minutes or until juices run clear.
