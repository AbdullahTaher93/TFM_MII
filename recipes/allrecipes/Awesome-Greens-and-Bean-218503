Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat, and brown the sausage, breaking it apart into crumbles as it cooks. Pour in chicken broth, and bring to a boil. Lightly pile in as many mustard greens as will comfortably fit in the pot, and allow to wilt, stirring often; when they have wilted, place more mustard greens into the pot and allow to wilt, until all greens have been added. Stir in the beans, diced tomatoes, salt, and black pepper. Bring back to a boil, and simmer until greens are cooked and tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in Parmesan cheese.
