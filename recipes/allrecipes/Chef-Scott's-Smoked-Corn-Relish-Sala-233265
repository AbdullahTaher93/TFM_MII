Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Toss corn kernels with 1/2 cup vegetable oil in a skillet. Place skillet in the preheated grill and roast until browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer corn to a large bowl and add bell pepper, onion, celery, and olives. Whisk vinegar, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, cilantro, jalapeno, and granulated garlic in a small bowl. Pour vinegar mixture over corn mixture; toss. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.
