Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; remove from heat and cool for about 5 minutes. Bring water in a double boiler to a simmer; add egg yolks, lemon juice, and water. Whisk egg mixture using a balloon whisk until light and frothy, about 4 minutes. Remove bowl from double boiler. Constantly whisk egg mixture while slowly drizzling melted butter into egg mixture until sauce is light in color and thickened. Whisk curry powder into sauce.
