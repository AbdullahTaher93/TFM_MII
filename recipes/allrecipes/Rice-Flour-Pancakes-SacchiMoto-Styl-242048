Beat eggs, coconut milk, 1 1/2 coconut oil, baking powder, and sea salt together in a bowl until smooth. Gradually stir rice flour into the egg mixture until completely incorporated into a batter. Refrigerate batter for at least 1 hour. Melt enough coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat to coat cooking surface completely. Spoon batter into hot skillet to make 4-inch rounds. Cook pancakes until bubbles form on the top, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip cakes and continue cooking until golden on the bottom, about 2 minutes more.
