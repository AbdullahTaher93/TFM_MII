Soak cedar planks in water 30 minutes - 2 hours. Meanwhile, pat fish dry with homelife(TM) paper towels. Place skin side down on a large baking sheet; set aside. In a small bowl, combine remaining ingredients; brush on salmon. Cover and marinate 30 minutes - 2 hours. Remove planks from water. Place side by side on a hot grill. Allow planks to cook about 2-3 minutes. Remove salmon from marinade; discard marinade. Place salmon, skin side down, on planks. Reduce grill to medium-low and cover. Grill salmon until it flakes easily with a fork (about 20-25 minutes). Have a spray bottle with water available to put out flare-ups on planks.
