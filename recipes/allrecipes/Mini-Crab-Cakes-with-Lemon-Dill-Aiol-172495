To prepare aioli, combine 1 cup of mayonnaise, lemon peel and juice, dill, and garlic. Cover and refrigerate. For crab cakes, combine remaining mayonnaise, mustard, egg, cayenne, 1 cup bread crumbs, and chopped vegetables in a large bowl. Gently stir in crab. Place 2 cups bread crumbs in a shallow dish. Shape crab into small cakes (about 1 1/2-inch diameter); coat with bread crumbs, pressing gently to adhere. Place apart in two oiled 12- by 17-inch rimmed baking pans. Baked in a 500 degrees F oven for 7 minutes, switch pan positions, and continue baking until golden brown, about 7 minutes longer. Serve hot with aioli.
