Mix 3 teaspoons of the caraway seeds with the garlic, salt and pepper. Rub mixture all over pork roast. Adjust oven rack to center position, and heat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large flame-proof roasting pan set over 2 burners. Add pork roast; cook until well browned on all sides, about 10 to 12 minutes. Remove pork to a platter, and add carrots, onions, cabbage and bay leaves to pan. Cook until vegetables are soft and golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, mix beer, molasses, broth and remaining caraway seeds; add to roasting pan. Place pork roast on top of vegetables. Transfer pan to oven; bake until thickest part of the roast registers 150 degrees F (65 degrees C), about 60 to 75 minutes. Baste roast every 25 minutes. Remove roast from pan, and let rest 10 minutes. Slice, and serve with vegetables and broth alongside.
