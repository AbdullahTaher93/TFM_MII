Preheat grill for medium-high heat. Grill beef to desired doneness, and allow to cool. While beef is cooling, stir together fish sauce, lime juice, kecap manis, garlic, ginger, cilantro, sesame oil, and chili oil; mix in the green onions and shallots. Adjust seasoning to your taste. Cut beef into bite-sized pieces. In a large bowl, toss with onion, tomatoes, cucumber, and chili peppers. Pour in the dressing, and toss to coat.
