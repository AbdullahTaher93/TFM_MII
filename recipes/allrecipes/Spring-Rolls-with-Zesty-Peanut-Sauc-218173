PEANUT SAUCE: Combine soy sauce, oil, water, peanut butter, rice wine vinegar, ginger, honey and red pepper flakes in small bowl. Set aside. SPRING ROLLS: Mix rice noodles, carrot, bean sprouts, cucumber and cilantro. Divide into 12 equal portions. Place one portion of mixture along one long side of a wrapper. Dampen edges of wrapper, fold the bottom of the wrapper over the top of the ingredients, fold in sides and roll up like a burrito. Repeat with remaining wrappers. Heat oil in large skillet over medium high heat. Place rolls seam side down in skillet; cook on each side 3 to 4 minutes until golden brown. Remove from skillet and drain on paper towels. Keep warm. Serve spring rolls with warm peanut sauce for dipping.
