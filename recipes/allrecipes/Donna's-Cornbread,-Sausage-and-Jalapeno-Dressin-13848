Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 9x9 inch pan. In a heavy skillet, melt 8 tablespoons butter over low heat. Saute the onion and peppers until soft. Place sausage in skillet; crumble and cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, and transfer to a large bowl. Combine sausage mixture with stuffing mix, bread crumbs, chicken stock, egg, and salt and pepper. Mix well, and transfer dressing to prepared pan. Dot with remaining butter. Bake for 45 minutes.
