Mix paprika, ancho chile powder, black pepper, and allspice together in a spice shaker or bowl. Place pork chops on a plate and coat both sides of chops with spice mixture. Sprinkle the remaining spice mixture onto the plate and pat the outsides of each chop into the spice mixture until entire chop is coated. Put coated pork chops in a resealable plastic bag and refrigerate for flavors to absorb into the pork chops, 4 to 12 hours. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place pork chops in the hot oil and reduce heat to medium; season with salt. Cook pork chops until partially blackened, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer pork chops to a sheet of aluminum foil and wrap edges together creating a seal. Allow pork chops to "cook" from the residual heat inside the foil wrap, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Place pork chops on a serving plate and spoon residual juices in the foil over each chop.
