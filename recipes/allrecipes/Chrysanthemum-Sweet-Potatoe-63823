Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 2 quart baking dish. Place the sweet potatoes into a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain. Mash potatoes with pineapple, honey and butter using a whisk or electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Stir in the lemon zest and chrysanthemum petals. Transfer to the prepared baking dish. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until hot and fragrant.
