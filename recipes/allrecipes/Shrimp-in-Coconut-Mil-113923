In a large frying pan, heat the oil over moderately high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until golden, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the coriander, cumin, cinnamon, cayenne, and turmeric and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the coconut milk, water, and salt and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat and cook at a low boil, stirring frequently, until thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add the shrimp to the pan. Reduce the heat to low and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are just done, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the cilantro. Serve with the lime wedges.
