Thread 3 shrimp onto each of eight 6-inch bamboo skewers. Combine soy sauce and vinegar in a shallow dish, and put sesame seeds on a plate. Dip each skewer of shrimp into the soy-vinegar mixture, and then dip both sides in the sesame seeds. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add skewered shrimp, and cook until shrimp are opaque, about 3 minutes on each side. Transfer skewers to a plate. Pour the remaining soy-vinegar mixture into the hot pan, and cook, stirring, until slightly thickened, about 15 seconds. Drizzle sauce over shrimp, and serve warm or at room temperature.
