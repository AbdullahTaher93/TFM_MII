Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 3-quart casserole dish. Mix turkey, chicken soup, tomatoes with green chiles, onion, bell pepper, 1 cup Cheddar cheese, mushrooms, garlic, and chili powder together in a bowl. Cover the bottom of the casserole dish with half the tortilla strips; pour turkey mixture onto tortilla layer. Top with remaining tortilla strips. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Sprinkle with 1 cup Cheddar cheese. Return uncovered dish to the oven and bake until cheese is melted and casserole is bubbling, 15 to 20 minutes.
