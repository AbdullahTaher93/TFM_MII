Place an egg roll wrapper on your work surface with one corner pointing towards you. Smear a teaspoon of mayonnaise halfway between the bottom corner and the center of the wrapper. Place some of the mango strips on top of the mayonnaise. Fold the bottom corner snugly over the filling, then fold in the left and right corners. Moisten the remaining edges with egg white, then continue rolling the spring roll to the top corner to form a tight cylinder. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Heat canola oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry the spring rolls, a few at a time, until they float and turn golden brown, about 4 minutes. Turn the spring rolls over halfway through frying to brown evenly. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.
