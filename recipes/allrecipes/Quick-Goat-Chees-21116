In a large sauce pot over medium heat, bring the milk to a slow boil; be careful not to scorch. Add dried onion and salt, if desired. As the milk really bubbles up, turn off the heat and pour in the vinegar; wait for the milk to curdle, then pour it through a cheesecloth-lined colander. Let cool, and enjoy!
