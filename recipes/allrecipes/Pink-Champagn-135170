Drop one drop of red food coloring into sugar and mix with a fork until the sugar turns pink. Rim the top of each glass with water and dip the top of each glass into the pink sugar. Place a couple of raspberries into each glass. Pour one teaspoon of grenadine into each glass. Fill glasses with champagne to the rim. Be careful not to let the champagne touch the sugar rim.
