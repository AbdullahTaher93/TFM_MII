Coat a grill rack with nonstick spray. Fire up the grill and heat for 20 to 30 minutes. Place the rack on the grill. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, mix the chili sauce, ketchup, honey, vinegar, ginger, mustard, black pepper, garlic powder, and red pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, then remove from the heat. Set the sauce aside. Place the chicken on the rack over the heat. Grill, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Turn the chicken over and brush with the sauce. Grill until the chicken is no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Brush with the remaining sauce before serving.
