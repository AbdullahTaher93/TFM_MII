Place rice in a large bowl and cover with water. Let soak, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain. Combine ghee, parsley, cinnamon stick, clove, and cardamom in a large skillet. Heat over medium-low heat until ghee melts and smells fragrant, about 5 minutes. Combine rice and ghee mixture in a rice cooker. Cover with water. Seal cooker and cook rice according to manufacturer's instructions. Pause cooking a quarter of the way through; stir tomato puree and salt into the rice. Continue cooking until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed. Discard whole spices before serving.
