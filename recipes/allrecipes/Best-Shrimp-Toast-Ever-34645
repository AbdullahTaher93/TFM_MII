In a bowl, thoroughly mix the shrimp with the ginger, salt, cornstarch, oyster sauce, and eggs. Cut each slice of bread into 4 squares, and arrange on a baking sheet. Spread shrimp mixture over each square, and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes. In a wok or deep fryer, heat the oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Carefully drop bread into hot oil, shrimp side down, and fry until golden brown. Remove from oil, drain on paper towels, and serve.
