Peel onion and cut lengthwise into thin slivers. Peel and chop garlic. In a 6- to 8-quart pan over medium-high heat, stir onion, garlic, and oil until onion is limp, about 5 minutes. Add chili powder, cumin, and cinnamon; stir until spices are fragrant, about 1 minute. Add broth, tomatoes (including juice), zucchini, corn, jalapenos, and oregano. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover pan, reduce heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, rinse chicken and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Add chicken to broth mixture. Return to a boil over high heat; cover pan, reduce heat, and simmer until chicken is white in center (cut to test), 2 to 3 minutes. Ladle into soup bowls. Add salt, pepper, and cheese to taste.
