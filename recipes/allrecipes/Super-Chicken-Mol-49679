Heat the oil in a large deep skillet over medium heat. Add onions, and cook for a few minutes, then stir in tomatoes, and cook until they release all of their juice. Stir in the hot chile peppers, cilantro, black pepper and sugar. Bring to a boil, and let it cook for about 10 minutes to thicken. Add chicken breasts to the skillet, along with the oregano, cinnamon, cumin, bay leaf, chocolate and lime juice. Simmer over medium heat for 15 to 20 minutes or until chicken breasts are cooked through. Chicken breasts should have an internal temperature of 170 degrees F (75 degrees C) when fully cooked. Remove bay leaf, and serve chicken breasts smothered in sauce. Garnish with additional fresh parsley or cilantro.
