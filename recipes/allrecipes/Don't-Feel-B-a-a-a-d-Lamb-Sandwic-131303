Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Remove all visible fat from lamb. Mix black pepper, cayenne, garlic, and salt. Rub lamb with oil until it's covered, then with pepper mixture. Place in a baking dish just large enough to hold meat and roast 30 to 40 minutes or until pink inside. Use thinly sliced lamb and remaining ingredients to make four sandwiches.
