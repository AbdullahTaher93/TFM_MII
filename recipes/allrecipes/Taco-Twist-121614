In a skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until the meat is no longer pink; drain. Add the cheese, salsa, chilies, garlic powder, hot pepper sauce, salt and cumin; mix well. Unroll crescent roll dough and separate into 12 rectangles. Place on ungreased baking sheets; press perforations to seal. Place 1/2 cup meat mixture in the center of each rectangle. Bring four corners to the center and twist; pinch to seal. Bake at 350&deg for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.
