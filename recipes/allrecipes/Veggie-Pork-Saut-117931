In a large resealable plastic bag, combine 3 tablespoons flour, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. Add pork; seal bag and shake to coat. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown pork in 3 tablespoons butter and oil; remove and keep warm. In the same skillet, saute the onion, celery and mushrooms in remaining butter for 5 minutes. Add pork and zucchini; saute until meat juices run clear and vegetables are tender. Stir in the tomato. Place the remaining flour in a small bowl; stir in the broth and vinegar until smooth. Add to skillet. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Serve with rice.
