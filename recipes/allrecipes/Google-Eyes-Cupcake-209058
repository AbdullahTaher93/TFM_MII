Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the cupcake pans with the paper cupcake liners. Prepare the cake mix according to the package instructions. Fold 3 MUSKETEERS Bars into the batter before filling the cupcake cups. Bake for 18 to 21 minutes. Remove pans from oven, transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely. To decorate: Frost the cupcake tops with the vanilla icing. Use the blue icing to pipe a 1 1/2-inch circle in the middle of each cupcake. Place one M&M'S Brand Chocolate Candies in the center of each blue circle. Make squiggly lines using the red gel, starting at the blue circle and going to the edge of each cupcake.
