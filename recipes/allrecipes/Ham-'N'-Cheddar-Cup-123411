In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and pepper. Beat eggs and milk; stir into dry ingredients until well mixed. Stir in ham, cheese, bacon and onion. Fill well-greased muffin cups three-fourths full. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack.
