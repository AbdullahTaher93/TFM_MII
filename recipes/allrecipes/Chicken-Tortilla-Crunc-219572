Spray a 12-inch skillet with the cooking spray. Heat over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Add the chicken in 2 batches and cook until well browned, stirring often. Reduce the heat to medium. Stir the soup, picante sauce, chili powder and half the cheese in the skillet and cook until the chicken is cooked through, stirring occasionally. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and the chips.
