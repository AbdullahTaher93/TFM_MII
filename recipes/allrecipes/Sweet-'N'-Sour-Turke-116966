In a small bowl, combine cornstarch and brown sugar. Stir in the broth, soy sauce and lemon juice until smooth; set aside. In a wok or large skillet, stir-fry the celery, carrots and onion in butter for 3-4 minutes or until crisp-tender. Stir broth mixture; add to that pan. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Add the turkey, pineapple with juice and almonds; heat through. Serve over rice if desired.
