Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cook and stir ground beef, onion, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper in a skillet over medium heat until beef is browned and crumbly, 7 to 10 minutes. Spread beef into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Stir cream of mushroom soup, potato nuggets, and Cheddar cheese together in a large bowl until potato nuggets are evenly coated in soup and cheese. Spread potato nugget mixture over beef mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 45 minutes. Sprinkle paprika and parsley flakes over the top.
