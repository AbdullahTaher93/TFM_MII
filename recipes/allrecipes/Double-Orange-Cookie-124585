In a large mixing bowl, cream sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Add sour cream and eggs. Beat until well blended. Reserve 1 tablespoon orange juice concentrate for frosting. Add the remaining concentrate with combined dry ingredients to the creamed mixture; mix well. Stir in orange peel. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls onto lightly greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for about 10 minutes or until edges just begin to brown. Remove to wire racks to cool completely. In a small mixing bowl, combine all ingredients until smooth. Spread a small amount over each cookie.
