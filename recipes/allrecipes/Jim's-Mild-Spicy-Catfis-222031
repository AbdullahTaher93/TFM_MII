Mix cornmeal, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper on a plate. Beat milk and eggs together in a bowl. Dip catfish fillets in milk mixture, then gently press fillets into cornmeal mixture, coating both sides. Shake off excess breading. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet; pan-fry catfish in hot oil until the fish is golden brown and flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes per side.
