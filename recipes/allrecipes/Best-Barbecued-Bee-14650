Rub the beef with half the lard and all the red chile. Place meat in a large bowl. In a medium saucepan, bring 1/2 cup water to a boil, add the remaining lard and the butter. When melted, remove from heat. Add vinegar, tarragon, wine, onion, Worcestershire sauce, and minced garlic. Pour over meat. Refrigerate, uncovered, for up to 2 days; turn the meat frequently. Preheat broiler. Transfer meat to a broiler pan. Position the meat 3 to 4 inches from the broiling unit, and broil for 15 minutes. Turn the meat over. Baste it with the marinade, rubbing the fat from the marinade over the surface. Broil another 15 minutes. Turn, baste, and broil for another 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, and let the meat stand 15 minutes before serving.
