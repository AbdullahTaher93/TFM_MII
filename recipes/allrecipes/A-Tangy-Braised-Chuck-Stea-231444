Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place beef chuck steak on a work surface and pound with a meat mallet to tenderize steak; flip steak and repeat on other side. Cut steak into 6 to 8 pieces. Heat olive oil in an oven-safe Dutch oven over medium heat. Season both sides of steak pieces with salt; coat with a thin layer of flour. Cook steak in the hot oil until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Remove steak from Dutch oven. Pour beef stock and 1/4 cup reserved artichoke juice into the Dutch oven, scraping any brown bits of food from the bottom. Mix artichokes, red peppers, green chiles, horseradish, and capers into broth mixture; bring to a boil. Return beef to broth mixture in Dutch oven and cover. Place Dutch oven in the preheated oven; bake until meat is tender, 45 to 60 minutes. Allow steak to cool in Dutch oven for 15 minutes before serving.
