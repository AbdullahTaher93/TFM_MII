Mix together egg, mayonnaise, red guajillo cooking sauce, cumin, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce. Add the crab and bread crumbs. Mix well. Shape into four crab cakes. Refrigerate 2 hours. Mix together the ranch dressing and guajillo chile saucer; refrigerate until ready to serve. Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat; melt the butter with the grape seed oil. Place crab cakes into the oil-butter and fry until brown on one side, about 5 minutes. Turn crab cakes, and brown on the other side, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spatula, transfer the crab cakes to a warm paper-towel-lined plate. Divide the salad greens among individual plates. Top with carrots, pecans, and orange sections. Drizzle with the guajillo ranch dressing. Place one cooked crab cake on top of each salad, and place a goat cheese medallion on the side, if desired.
