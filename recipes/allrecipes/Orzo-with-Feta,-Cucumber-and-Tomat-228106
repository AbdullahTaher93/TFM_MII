Place orzo pasta, chicken broth, water, and half the chopped red bell pepper into a saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until orzo are tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 10 minutes. Drain and rinse. Allow to cool. Place orzo into a large salad bowl with remaining red bell pepper and 2 tablespoons olive oil; toss to coat. Mix in cucumbers, feta cheese, roma tomatoes, red onion, Kalamata olives, lemon juice, white wine vinegar, and cumin; toss salad well. Drizzle 2 more tablespoons olive oil over top of salad. Refrigerate 1 hour, tossing once or twice; season to taste with salt and black pepper before serving.
