Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, medium-high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above the cooking grate only 3 to 4 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). While grill heats, cut into each unpeeled banana lengthwise, making a deep slit but taking care to avoid cutting all the way through. Slip pieces of chocolate into each pocket and sprinkle with some of the cinnamon. Wrap each banana in foil. Lay bananas on cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook, turning once, until soft when squeezed with tongs, about 10 minutes. Lift bananas to a platter. Carefully unwrap each banana and place on a plate with the cut side facing up. Top each with small scoops of ice cream; add a dollop of whipped cream, a sprinkling of walnuts, and a cherry, if you like.
