Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add carrots, onion, and mushrooms; cook and stir until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour broth into the pot; bring to a boil. Add quinoa, soy sauce, and ginger. Reduce heat and simmer until quinoa is mostly tender, about 17 minutes. Add baby kale; cook until wilted, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand until quinoa absorbs remaining cooking liquid, about 5 minutes.
