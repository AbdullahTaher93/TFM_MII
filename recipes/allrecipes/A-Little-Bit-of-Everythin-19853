In a tall glass combine barbeque sauce, steak sauce, vinegar, garlic powder, hot sauce and beer. Mix well. Place the meat of choice in a container and rub the diced garlic firmly into it. Pour the marinade over the meat until fully covered, and marinate for about 5 hours; cover and refrigerate while marinating. Cook as desired.
