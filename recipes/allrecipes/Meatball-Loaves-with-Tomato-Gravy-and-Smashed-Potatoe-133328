Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place the potatoes in a pot, cover with cold water and cover the pot with a lid. Bring to a boil, then salt the water and cook the potatoes until tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain the potatoes and add them back to the pot. While the potatoes are working, in a large bowl, combine the ground meats with 1/2 cup cheese, 1/2 cup bread crumbs, a splash of cream, the egg, parsley, half of the chopped garlic, the Worcestershire sauce and allspice; season with salt and pepper. Drizzle 1 tablespoon EVOO onto a baking sheet, form the meat mixture into 4 loaves about 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick and place on the baking sheet. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon EVOO. Bake the loaves for 20 minutes. While the meatloaves bake, in a large skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons EVOO, 2 turns of the pan, over medium heat. Add the remaining garlic, the carrot, onion and bay leaf and cook until tender, 7 to 8 minutes; season with salt and pepper and the rosemary. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute. Whisk in the broth and simmer until thickened. Discard the bay leaf. Add the remaining 1/3 cup cream and 1 cup cheese to the potatoes and season with 1 teaspoon salt; smash to desired consistency. Divide the potatoes among 4 plates and make a small well in the center. Remove the meatloaves from the oven, turn in their sauce and set alongside the potatoes. Spoon extra sauce into the wells and over the meatloaves.
