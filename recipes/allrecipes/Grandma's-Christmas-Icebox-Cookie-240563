Beat brown sugar, butter, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat the first egg into the butter until completely blended, then beat in the vanilla extract with the last egg. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; stir into creamed butter mixture until dough is just mixed. Fold pecans and candied cherries into dough. Shape dough into 1 1/2-inch rolls on a piece of waxed paper. Seal waxed paper on the ends with tape; refrigerate until chilled and firm, at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Slice cookies to about 1/4-inch thickness and arrange on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
