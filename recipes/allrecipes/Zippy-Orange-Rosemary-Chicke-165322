Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray an 8x8 inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper; place in prepared dish. Combine orange marmalade, horseradish, and rosemary in a small bowl; pour over chicken. Bake the chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, and the juices run clear, 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
