Cream together butter or margarine, shortening, sugars, eggs and vanilla. Add dry ingredients (except candy) and mix well. Dough will be greasy. Using a floured surface and rolling pin, roll out dough. Cut out 2 inch heart shaped cookies. Using a 1 inch heart shaped cookie cutter, cut out a smaller heart in the middle of the larger one. Put cookies on a foil lined cookie sheet. Inside of cut-out heart, sprinkle crushed candy crumbs (such as red life savers or candy canes). Spread the crumbs to the inside edges of the cookie. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degees C) for 10-12 minutes. When cookes have cooled, remove from sheets. The cookie can be frosted if you desire.
