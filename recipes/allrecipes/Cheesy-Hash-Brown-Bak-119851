In a bowl, combine the potatoes, soup, sour cream, 1-3/4 cups of cheddar cheese and Parmesan cheese. Transfer to a greased 3-qt. baking dish. Sprinkle with remaining cheddar cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until bubbly and cheese is melted. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
