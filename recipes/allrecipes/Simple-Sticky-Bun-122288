Cut each loaf of dough into 18 pieces. Arrange half in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with cinnamon. In a saucepan over low heat, melt butter. Remove from the heat; stir in brown sugar, pudding mix and milk until smooth. Pour over dough. Sprinkle with pecans and raisins if desired. Arrange remaining pieces of dough over top. Cover and refrigerate overnight or let stand at room temperature for 3 hours. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 35 minutes or until center sounds hollow when tapped with fingers. Invert onto a serving platter or baking sheet.
