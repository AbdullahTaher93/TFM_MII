In large bowl, beat butter, sugar, brown sugar, egg and vanilla until well blended. Add applesauce mixture; blend well. Stir together flour, cocoa, baking soda and cinnamon, if desired.

Cool slightly in pan on wire rack. Sprinkle muffin tops with confectioners' sugar, if desired. Serve warm. Variation: Omit peanut butter chips, add one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.
