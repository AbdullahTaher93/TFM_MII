In a very large skillet, heat the olive oil. Add the anchovies and cook over moderately low heat, mashing the anchovies until pureed, about 3 minutes. Increase the heat to high. Season the veal chops with salt and pepper. Add them to the skillet and cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the chops to a platter. Add the wine, sage, cloves and bay leaves to the skillet and cook over moderately high heat until the wine is reduced to 2 tablespoons, about 5 minutes. Add the stock and bring to a boil. Add the veal chops and their juices, cover and simmer over low heat until the chops are barely pink in the center, about 3 minutes per side. Return the chops to the platter and cover loosely with foil. Add the grapes and honey to the skillet, cover and cook over moderate heat until the grapes are tender, about 4 minutes. Scatter the grapes over the chops. Boil the pan juices over high heat until reduced to 1 cup, about 5 minutes. Discard the cloves and bay leaves. Pour the sauce over the chops and serve.
