In a bowl, combine mustard and onion. In another bowl, combine bread crumbs and parsley. Toss chicken in mustard mixture, then coat evenly with crumb mixture. Line a baking sheet with foil; coat the foil with nonstick cooking spray. Thread chicken onto metal or soaked wooden skewers, leaving a small space between chunks. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Bake, uncovered, at 450 degrees F for 6-8 minutes or until juices run clear.
