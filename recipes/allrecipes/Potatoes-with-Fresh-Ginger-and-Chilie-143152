Place the potatoes in a large pot of salted water, and bring to a boil. Cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, and cool. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the ginger and chile pepper; cook 2 minutes. Stir in the turmeric; cook 30 seconds. Combine the potatoes with the chile pepper mixture. Add salt as desired. Stir and cook 5 to 10 minutes more. Stir in the tomatoes and curry leaves; cook another 2 to 3 minutes. Serve immediately.
