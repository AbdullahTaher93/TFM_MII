Heat a large skillet over medium heat; add enough olive oil to completely coat the bottom. Stir cashews into the hot oil until evenly coated and cover skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until cashews are toasted and golden, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and gradually mix rosemary, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, salt, and pepper into cashews until well coated. Cover skillet and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.
