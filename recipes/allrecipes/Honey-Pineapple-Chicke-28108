In a small bowl, blend pineapple juice and honey. Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Dredge chicken in flour, and arrange in the skillet. Brush with the pineapple juice and honey. Sprinkle with red wine vinegar. Cook 7 to 10 minutes on each side, until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear. Top with crushed pineapple and fresh mint to serve.
