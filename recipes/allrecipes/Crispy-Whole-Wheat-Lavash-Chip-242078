Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush lavash with olive oil. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Using a very sharp knife or a pizza cutter, cut lavash into strips, squares, or triangles. Place lavash pieces on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven to cool completely; store in an airtight container.
