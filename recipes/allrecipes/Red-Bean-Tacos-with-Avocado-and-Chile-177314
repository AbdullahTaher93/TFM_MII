In a medium-size bowl, combine onion, chiles, bell pepper, avocado, and vinegar. Mix lightly; season to taste with salt and black pepper. Set aside. Drain beans, reserving 1/4 cup of the liquid. Rinse beans, then place beans and reserved 1/4 cup liquid, oregano, and cumin in a 3-qt. pan. Place over medium-high heat and cook, stirring and mashing beans lightly, until hot and bubbling (about 5 minutes). To serve, spoon bean mixture into warm taco shells. Top with avocado mixture, lettuce, and cheese.
