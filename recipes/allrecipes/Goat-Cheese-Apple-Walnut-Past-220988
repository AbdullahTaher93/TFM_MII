Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and set aside in a large bowl. Melt butter in saucepan over medium heat. Stir in apple; cook and stir until golden around the edges, about 3 minutes. Stir in chicken broth and increase heat to medium high and simmer 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Stir in goat cheese, 2 tablespoons at a time, to apple broth mixture, stirring well to incorporate after each addition. Remove from heat. Mix apple and goat cheese mixture with drained pasta until combined. Stir in walnuts, thyme, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper.
