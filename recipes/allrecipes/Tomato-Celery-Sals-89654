Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garlic, tomato, celery, and onion, and cook about 3 minutes, until heated through. Pour in tomato juice, bring to boil, reduce heat to medium, and continue cooking 5 minutes, or until onions and celery are tender. Stir flour into the salsa to thicken. Continue cooking to desired consistency. Season with salt, pepper, and hot sauce.
