Preheat an oven broiler. Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Line the prepared pan with the polenta slices; set aside. Combine diced tomatoes, cucumber, and olives in a large bowl. Add balsamic vinegar, olive oil, oregano, basil, and salt and pepper to taste; mix. Spoon this topping over the polenta slices, then sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Broil in preheated oven until the polenta is hot, and the cheese is lightly browned, about 3 minutes.
