Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain. Stir pumpkin puree, butter, and cheese with the drained macaroni in a large bowl until the butter is melted and the noodles completely coated.
