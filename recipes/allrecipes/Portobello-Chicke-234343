Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir mushrooms in hot oil until warmed, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour wine over the mushrooms, bring to a simmer, and cook until the wine becomes thick and the mushrooms tender, about 35 minutes. Arrange chicken on a serving platter; top each with a slice of provolone cheese. Pour mushroom and merlot sauce over the chicken.
