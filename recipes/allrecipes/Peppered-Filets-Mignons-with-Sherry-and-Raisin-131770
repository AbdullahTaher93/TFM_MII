Crack the peppercorns by putting them in a resealable heavy plastic food-storage bag. Place the bag on a flat work surface, and, with the bottom of a heavy sauce pan or skillet, tap them lightly to crack them into large pieces. Put the cracked peppercorn on a plate. One by one, sprinkle both sides of each fillet evenly with salt to taste, and then press each side into the peppercorn to coat it. Over high heat, heat a heavy skillet or saute pan large enough to hold the steaks comfortably (cook the steaks in batches if your pan is not big enough). Add the oil and as soon as you see the slightest wisps of smoke carefully add the steaks. Cook the steaks undisturbed for 4 minutes, then carefully turn them over and cook 4 minutes more for medium-rare. For well-done steaks, reduce the heat to medium low and cook a few more minutes on both sides. Transfer the steaks to a heated platter and cover with aluminum foil to keep them warm while you make the sauce. Pour off the excess fat from the skillet and return it to high heat. Add the sherry, stir and scrape with a wooden spoon to deglaze the pan deposits, and boil until it reduces to about half its original volume, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the stock and raisins and continue boiling until the liquid reduces by half again, 4 to 5 minutes more (if using hoisin sauces, simply stir it in). A piece at a time, whisk in the butter to form a thick, glossy sauce. Adjust the seasoning to taste with a little salt. Transfer the steaks to individual services plates. Stir the juices that have collected on the platter into the sauce. Spoon the sauce over and around the steaks and serve.
