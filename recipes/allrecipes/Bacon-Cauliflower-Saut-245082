Place diced bacon in cold saute pan; turn on heat to medium-high. Cook bacon until fat is rendered and bacon is crispy, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon from pan; drain on paper towels. Heat olive oil in the same pan over medium-high heat. Saute cauliflower until it begins to brown, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in wine, Swanson(R) Chicken Broth, and thyme; bring mixture to a boil. Reduce the temperature to medium and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until cauliflower begins to soften and liquid has almost completely evaporated, about 12 minutes. Stir in the reserved bacon and adjust seasoning to taste. Serve immediately!
