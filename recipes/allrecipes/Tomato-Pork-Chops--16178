Heat enough oil to just cover the bottom of a large skillet over medium high heat. Dredge the pork chops in flour, add to pan and brown well on both sides. Remove chops and set aside. Add the onion and bell pepper and cook and stir for 5 minutes, or until almost tender. Return pork chops to skillet and pour in the tomato sauce. Allow the sauce to start bubbling and then reduce heat to low. Simmer for 30 minutes and season with garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste.
