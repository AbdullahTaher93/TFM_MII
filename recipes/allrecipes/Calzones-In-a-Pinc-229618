Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook and stir ground beef and onion in a skillet over medium heat until the meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain grease. Combine ground beef mixture, chicken, tomato, mushrooms, and ripe olives in a bowl. Stir spaghetti sauce into ground beef mixture. Lightly mix mozzarella, sharp Cheddar, and Parmesan cheeses into the filling. Place a pie crust flat onto a work surface; spread with half the cream cheese, leaving an edge about 1/2-inch deep without cream cheese. Spoon half the filling over cream cheese. Fold the crust over the filling to make a large half moon-shaped calzone; press the edges together with a fork. Cut several slits in the top of the calzone to vent steam. Repeat with second crust and remaining filling. Place calzones onto a baking sheet. Brush tops with olive oil. Bake in the preheated oven until filling is hot, about 25 minutes. Sprinkle tops with Italian seasoning; return to oven and bake until crusts are lightly golden brown, about 5 more minutes. Let calzones stand for 5 minutes before cutting into servings.
