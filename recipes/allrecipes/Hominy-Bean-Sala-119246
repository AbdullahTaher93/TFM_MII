Place green beans in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Cook, uncovered, for 8-10 minutes or until crisp-tender; drain and rinse in cold water. In a serving bowl, combine the green beans, kidney beans, hominy, black beans, celery, onion and red pepper. In a jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine the remaining ingredients; shake well. Pour over vegetables and stir gently to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
