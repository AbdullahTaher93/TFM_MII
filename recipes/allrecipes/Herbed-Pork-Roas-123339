Combine the first seven ingredients; rub over roast. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. Place roast on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 2-1/2 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F-170 degrees F. Let stand for 15 minutes before slicing. Refrigerate or freeze remaining pork (may be frozen for up to 3 months).
