In a bowl, combine the egg, milk, pickle relish, 6 tablespoons bread crumbs and mustard. Crumble ham over mixture and mix well. Shape into four patties. Sprinkle each side with remaining bread crumbs. In a large skillet, cook patties in butter over medium heat for 4 to 4-1/2 minutes on each side or until lightly browned.
