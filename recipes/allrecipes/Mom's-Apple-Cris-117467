In a bowl, combine the apples, 1/4 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Transfer to a greased 8-in. square baking dish. In a small bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt and remaining sugar; cut in butter until crumbly. Sprinkle over apples, pressing down to smooth top. Slowly pour water over the top; sprinkle with remaining cinnamon. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until apples are tender. Serve warm.
