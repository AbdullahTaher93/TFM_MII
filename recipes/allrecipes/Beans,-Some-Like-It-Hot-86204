Stir the coconut milk, ginger, garlic, and parsley into a deep skillet over medium heat. Season with salt, turmeric, cumin, chili powder, and curry paste. Bring to a slow boil. Then stir in black beans, kidney beans, and red and green bell peppers; simmer, stirring often, until about 1/3 of the liquid is evaporated and the sauce has thickened, about 30 to 45 minutes. Cover, and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes.
