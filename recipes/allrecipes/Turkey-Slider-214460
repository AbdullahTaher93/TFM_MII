Mix the ground turkey, goat cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, panko bread crumbs, salt, pepper, and hot chili flakes together in a large bowl with your hands until evenly mixed. Form the mixture into patties about 3-inches in diameter. Dust each patty lightly with flour on each side. This will allow patties to brown nicely in oil. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook the patties in the hot oil until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Pour the white wine over the patties, place a cover over the skillet, and continue cooking until the sliders are no longer pink inside and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes. Remove the sliders to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Serve on the mini dinner rolls.
