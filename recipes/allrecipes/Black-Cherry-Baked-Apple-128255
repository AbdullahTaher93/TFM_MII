Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Using an apple corer or small knife, remove apple cores from stem ends without cutting all the way through the other end. Place apples in a 9 inch x 9 inch baking dish. Sprinkle cinnamon inside and outside of apples. Spoon cherries or raisins and walnuts into apples. Drizzle a little soda into each apple. Pour remaining soda into the baking dish. Bake 20 minutes, or until tender.
