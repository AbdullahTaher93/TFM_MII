Combine figs, honey, water, butter, lemon juice, cinnamon, vanilla extract, cloves, salt, and ginger in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until figs are soft, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Blend figs with an immersion blender until mixture reaches desired consistency. Stir in walnuts. Cook until flavors combine, about 15 minutes. Remove pot from heat and pour fig mixture into a container; transfer to the refrigerator.
