Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Microwave butter in a small microwave-safe bowl until melted, 20 to 30 seconds. Whisk in lemon juice. Add Cajun seasoning. Place salmon fillets in a shallow baking dish. Drizzle butter mixture over salmon. Bake salmon in the preheated oven until cooked through, about 20 minutes. Flake into smaller pieces with a fork. Mix corn, black beans, tomato, red onion, and cilantro in a bowl to make salsa. Arrange corn tortillas on a baking sheet. Warm tortillas in the preheated oven for about 5 minutes. Divide salmon, salsa, and Cheddar cheese among warm tortillas. Wrap up and serve with sour cream and guacamole.
