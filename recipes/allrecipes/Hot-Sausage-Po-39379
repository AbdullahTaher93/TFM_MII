Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large, deep skillet over medium high heat, cook sausage in the beer until evenly browned. Drain, and set aside. In a large baking dish, mix sausage, potatoes, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, sweet onion, red onion, jalapeno pepper, habanero pepper, red chile pepper, green onions, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in chicken broth. Cover, and bake in the preheated oven 1 hour, or until all vegetables are tender.
