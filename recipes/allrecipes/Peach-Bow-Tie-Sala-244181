Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and run under cold water to cool. Combine pasta, spinach, romaine lettuce, and peaches in a large bowl; add poppy seed dressing and toss to coat. Top salad with chicken.
