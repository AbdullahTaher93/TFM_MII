Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the sausages; cook until browned on all sides, following cooking instructions indicated on the packaging. Remove sausages from the pan. Drain grease, leaving about a tablespoon for the vegetables. Cook peppers and onions in skillet over medium heat until they begin to soften. Add garlic, salt, and pepper and cook one more minute. Stir in Classico Tomato & Basil Sauce. Increase heat until sauce begins to boil; reduce heat and simmer over low heat. Cut the sausages into 1-inch pieces; add to the pan and stir to combine. Cook until the sauce has thickened and the peppers and onions are soft, about 10 minutes. Serve in bowls or on rolls as sandwiches.
