PREHEAT your EASY-BAKE(R) oven for 15 minutes. MIX THE DOUGH. Pour one cinnamon pretzel mix and 3 1/2 teaspoons of water into a bowl. Mix until you form a dough. PREPARE A WORKSPACE. Spray the baking pan with cooking spray. Sprinkle flour onto your hands and a clean counter. Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. ROLL THE DOUGH. Roll each piece of dough between your hands and the counter until you form a long, thin rope. Each rope should be between 7-11 inches long. Use a ruler if you need to. FORM A PRETZEL. Bring both ends of your rope up to form a U-shape. Cross one end over the other. Bring the ends down, as if you are forming a bow. Press the ends into the bottom of the U-shape. Place one pretzel in a baking pan. MIX THE GLAZE. Pour 1/2 of the glaze mix and 1 teaspoon of water into a bowl. Mix until you form a glaze. (Save the other half of the glaze mix for the salted pretzel recipe.) GLAZE THE PRETZEL. Use a spoon to drizzle 1/2 of the glaze all over the top of your pretzel. BAKE THE PRETZEL. Use the pan pusher to move the pretzel into the oven. Bake for 10-12 minutes. After baking, use the pan pusher to move the pretzel into the cooling chamber. Let it cool for 10 minutes. Then bake the other pretzel, using a clean pan. MIX THE FROSTING. Pour the frosting mix and 1 teaspoon of water into a warming cup. Stir the frosting until it is smooth. WARM THE FROSTING. Slide the frosting into the warming chamber. Allow the frosting to warm, but do not let it get hot. FROST THE PRETZELS. Spread the frosting evenly over both pretzels. Arrange them on a plate and share with a special friend!
