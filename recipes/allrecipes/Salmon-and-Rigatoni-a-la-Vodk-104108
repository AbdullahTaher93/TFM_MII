In shallow glass dish, combine 1 tablespoon each: parsley, chives, vodka and oil. Stir in lemon juice, 1 clove minced garlic, Morton Lite(R) Salt Mixture and black pepper. Coat both sides of fish fillets generously with mixture; place skin-side-up in marinade. Cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes. In large non-stick skillet, melt butter and heat remaining oil; saute onion and remaining garlic until soft and translucent. Add remaining vodka to onions and cook until absorbed by onions and reduced to about 3 tablespoons. Add crushed tomatoes and stir; simmer for about 8 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup cream, simmer while stirring, 2 minutes; cover and keep warm. Cook pasta according to package directions, substituting Morton Lite Salt(R) Mixture for salt; drain. Toss pasta with remaining cream, parsley and 1/4 cup cheese. Stir pasta into tomato/vodka sauce. Keep warm. Preheat broiler to 500 degrees F. Place fish on broiler rack skin-side-down; press marinade ingredients over top of fish. Broil fish fillets for 10 to 15 minutes (depending on thickness of fish) or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Cool 5 minutes on cutting surface. Slice salmon fillets into pieces; remove and discard skin. Arrange salmon evenly over pasta. Garnish with chopped chives and Parmesan cheese, if desired. Serve immediately.
