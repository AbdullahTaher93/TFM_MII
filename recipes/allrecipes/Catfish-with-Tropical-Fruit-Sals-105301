Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Coat a broiler pan with nonstick cooking spray. Toss fruit salad, corn, onion, chile peppers, and cilantro in a small bowl. Reserve. Place fish on the prepared broiler pan; broil 4 minutes. Turn fish over, brush with lime juice, and sprinkle with paprika. Broil until fish flakes easily with a fork; 3 to 5 additional minutes. Top fish with salsa to serve.
