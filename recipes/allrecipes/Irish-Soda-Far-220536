Heat a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat. Mix the self-rising flour and buttermilk together in a bowl until a workable dough forms; turn out onto a lightly floured work surface. Pat the dough into a 1 1/2-inch thick round. Cut the dough into 4 wedges. Sprinkle enough all-purpose flour into the bottom of the skillet to lightly coat. Cook the dough in the hot skillet until evenly browned and cooked through, about 8 minutes per side.
