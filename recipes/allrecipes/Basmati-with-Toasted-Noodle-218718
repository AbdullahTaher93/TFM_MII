Bring the basmati rice, 2 cups of water, and salt to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the fideo noodles into the skillet in a thin layer, and gently cook and stir, turning the noodles frequently, until they fry to a rust-brown color. Pour 1/2 cup of water into the noodles, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until noodles are tender and water has absorbed, 5 to 8 minutes. Gently fluff the cooked basmati rice with a fork, and lightly fold in the cooked fideo and parsley. Add salt to taste.
