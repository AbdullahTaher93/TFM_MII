In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, water and salt. Add the matzo meal and whisk until smooth. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, drop rounded teaspoonfuls of dough carefully into the oil and cook until golden brown on both sides. Drain briefly on paper towels, then toss in sugar while still warm.
