Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Stir sugar into water to dissolve. Cook beets in boiling water until tender, about 45 minutes; drain and cool beets completely. Cut cooled beets into 1/2-inch cubes. Measure 1/2 cup of beet cubes and reserve remainder for later use. Stir beets into yogurt in a bowl; season with salt.
