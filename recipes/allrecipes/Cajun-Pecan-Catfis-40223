Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Coat a shallow baking pan with nonstick cooking spray; place fish in pan. Combine oil, Cajun seasoning, lemon juice and thyme in a small bowl. Spoon or brush half the mixture over fish. Add pecans, Parmesan cheese, breadcrumbs and parsley to remaining oil mixture; mix well. Spoon onto fish and spread evenly. Bake 10 to 15 minutes (depending on thickness of fish), or until fish flakes easily with a fork. If desired, garnish with lemon.
