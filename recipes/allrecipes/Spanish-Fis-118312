Brush oil onto bottom of a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish; top with onion and pimientos. Pat fish dry. Combine the salt, mace, cayenne and pepper; sprinkle over both sides of fish. Arrange fish over onions and pimientos. Top each fillet with a tomato slice; sprinkle with mushrooms and green onions. Pour wine or broth over fish and vegetables. In a nonstick skillet, melt butter; add bread crumbs. Cook and stir over medium heat until lightly browned. Sprinkle over fish. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes. Uncover and bake 20-25 minutes longer or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
