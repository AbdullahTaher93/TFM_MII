Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise and wasabi powder. Place the salmon on a greased baking tray, skin side down. Spread the mayonnaise mixture evenly over the top. Press crushed potato chips into the mayonnaise. Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fish flakes with a fork.
