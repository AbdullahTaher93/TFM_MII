Mix peas, green beans, corn, onion, celery, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Combine sugar, oil, and vinegar in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Pour mixture over vegetable mixture and stir to coat; refrigerate until flavors blend, 8 hours to overnight.
