Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add soba noodles (or spaghetti) and cook, stirring occasionally, until the noodles are just tender, 6 to 8 minutes or according to package directions. Drain. Meanwhile, whisk lime juice, hoisin sauce and chile-garlic sauce to taste with cornstarch in a small bowl. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook, stirring occasionally, until just cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer the steak to a plate using tongs. Add bell pepper to the juices in the pan and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add edamame and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Add ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir the sauce mixture and add to the pan along with the beef and any accumulated juices. Cook, stirring, until the sauce is thickened, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat. Add the noodles; toss to coat. Top with cilantro.
