Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the bacon in the skillet until crispy. Lie the cooked bacon on a plate lined with paper towels to drain and cool; crumble the bacon. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the celery, garlic, and onion in the hot butter until the onion begins to caramelize; pour the wine into the skillet. When the wine is heated, stir in the cranberry sauce, jalapeno peppers, and green chile peppers. Cover the mixture and cook until boiling. Remove from heat and stir in the bacon and pecans. Place the stuffing mix in a large bowl. Pour the liquid mixture and the chicken stock over the stuffing mix; stir until completely moist. Transfer to a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until browned on top, about 35 minutes.
