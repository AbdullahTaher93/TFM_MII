In a large frying pan, heat the oil over moderate heat. Add the garlic, bay leaf, and red-pepper flakes and cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the shrimp, salt, and black pepper to the pan and stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are just done, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the sherry, lemon juice, and parsley.
