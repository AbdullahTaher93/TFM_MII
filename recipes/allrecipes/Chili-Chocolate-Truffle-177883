Combine cream and ground chili in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart pan. Stir over low heat until chili is blended and cream is bubbly. Add chocolate and stir over low heat just until chocolate melts and blends with cream. Taste mixture; stir in cayenne to taste if it lacks heat. Pour into a small dish, cover, and chill until firm enough to shape (11/2 to 2 hours). Scoop out rounded teaspoonfuls of the chocolate mixture and quickly press and roll them into rough 1-inch balls. Roll in cocoa to coat. Place balls slightly apart on a plate, then cover and chill until firm. Truffles can be stored airtight in the refrigerator up to 3 weeks.
