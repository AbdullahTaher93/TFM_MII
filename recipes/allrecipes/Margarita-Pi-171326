Pour half and half into a medium saucepan and stir often over medium-high heat until simmering, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat, add marshmallows, and stir often until melted, about 4 minutes. Let cool, then whisk in 1/2 tsp. lime zest, lime juice, tequila, and liqueur until smooth. In a food processor, whirl pretzels and 1/4 cup sugar until fine crumbs form. Add butter; whirl until mixed. Press pretzel mixture evenly over bottom and 3/4 inches up sides of a 9-inch cake pan with a removable rim. In a bowl with a mixer on high speed, whip cream with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar until it holds soft peaks. Fold in marshmallow mixture, blending well. Pour filling into crust and spread level. Sprinkle with remaining 1 teaspoon lime zest. Freeze until firm to touch in the center, about 1 hour, then wrap airtight and freeze until solid, at least 1 more hour or up to 1 week. Unwrap pie, run a thin knife between crust and pan rim, and remove rim. Set dessert on a plate. Let stand 15 to 20 minutes to soften. Cut into wedges.
