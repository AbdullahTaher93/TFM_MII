Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir mushrooms in hot oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes; transfer to a bowl. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in the skillet over medium heat. Cook pork chops in hot oil until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove pork chops to a plate. Drain all by 1 tablespoon of the drippings from the skillet and heat again over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in reserved drippings until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour tomatoes over the onion mixture; season with basil, oregano, salt, and pepper and stir. Gently lie the pork chops into the tomato mixture. Bring the mixture to a simmer, place a cover on the skillet, and cook at a simmer until the chops are tender and no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Stir water into the tomato mixture to thin as desired; add mushrooms and stir. Place a bell pepper piece atop each pork chop; cook until the bell pepper pieces are tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
