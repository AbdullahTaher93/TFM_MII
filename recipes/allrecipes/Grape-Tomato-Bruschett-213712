Toast the Sandwich Thins(R) halves to a light golden brown. In a bowl, mix tomatoes with balsamic, olive oil, salt and pepper to taste. Stack basil leaves and roll them in the shape of a log. Slice the rolled basil, making ribbons. Toss most of the cut basil with the tomatoes, reserving a bit of fresh basil to garnish. Spoon dressed tomatoes on top of each toasted Sandwich Thins(R) half and garnish with a few fresh basil ribbons. Eat and Enjoy!
