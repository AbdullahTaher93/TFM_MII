In a mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugar, egg, flour and orange peel until smooth; set aside. Soak apricots in warm water for 15 minutes; drain well. Cut apricots into small pieces; set aside. In a large mixing bowl, combine the dry ingredients. In another bowl, beat the egg, orange juice, oil and water. Stir into the dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in pecans and apricots. Spoon two-thirds of the batter into a greased and floured 10-in. fluted tube pan. Top with cream cheese filling and remaining batter. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-65 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate before slicing.
