Line bottom and sides of a 2-1/2-qt. bowl with half of the wafers; drizzle with half of the coffee. Layer half of the pudding mixture over wafers, and then top with half of the grated chocolate. Repeat all layers starting with the wafers and coffee. Top with remaining whipped topping and raspberries. Refrigerate at least 2 hours. Store leftovers in refrigerator.
