Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Use a fork to lightly blend the biscuit mix and milk in a large bowl. With spoon, drop 16 biscuits onto prepared baking sheet. Make a small depression in the center of each biscuit. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Just before serving, evenly fill the depression in each biscuit with cranberry sauce.
