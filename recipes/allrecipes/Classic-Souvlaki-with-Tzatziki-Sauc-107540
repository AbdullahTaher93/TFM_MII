Place lamb in a gallon-size resealable plastic bag. In a small bowl, whisk 1/2 cup olive oil, wine, salt, pepper, oregano, mint and 4 garlic cloves. Pour over lamb and seal the bag. Rotate until lamb is coated with marinade. Refrigerate for 3 hours, or overnight. Preheat grill to high heat, and lightly oil grate. In a medium bowl, combine yogurt, cucumber, dill, garlic and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper; refrigerate until ready to use. Thread meat onto skewers. Place on hot grill and cook for 8 - 10 minutes, or until meat is well seared, turning once. Remove skewers from heat and set aside to rest. Lightly brush pita bread with oil, and place on grill until warm, about 1 minute. Arrange a portion of lamb in each pita. Top with yogurt sauce and serve.
