Sprinkle the salt over the minced garlic in the bottom of a mixing bowl; make a paste, rubbing the salt into the garlic thoroughly with the back of a spoon. Add the red bell pepper, green onion, shallot, parsley, dill, cilantro, and lemon juice; mix lightly until well combined. Season with black pepper. Add the buttermilk, mayonnaise, and sour cream to the mixture; beat with a wire whisk until evenly combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours. Dressing keeps refrigerated up to 1 week.
