Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Separate refrigerated dough into individual breadsticks. Wrap a strip of bacon around each one, tucking bacon ends underneath. Arrange on prepared baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Mix Parmesan cheese and garlic powder together in a shallow dish. Roll breadsticks in the mixture while they are still warm.
