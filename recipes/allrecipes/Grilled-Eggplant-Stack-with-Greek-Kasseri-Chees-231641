Lightly sprinkle salt over eggplant slices and place in a colander until salt has drawn out excess moisture, about 30 minutes. Rinse eggplant slices and pat dry with a paper towel. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Whisk olive oil, garlic, oregano, mint, and black pepper together in a bowl. Brush eggplant and tomato slices with oil mixture. Cook eggplant slices on the preheated grill until softened and show grill marks, 2 to 4 minutes. Cook tomatoes just until warmed, 1 to 2 minutes. Preheat oven to 370 degrees F (188 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Assemble stacks on the prepared baking sheet starting with 1 eggplant slice on the bottom, 1 tomato slice atop the eggplant slice, and a layer of Kasseri cheese on top. Repeat 3 times ending with a generous sprinkling of Kasseri cheese. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, 5 to 10 minutes.
