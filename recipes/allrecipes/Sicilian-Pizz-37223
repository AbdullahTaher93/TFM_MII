COMBINE 2 cups flour, yeast, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in a large mixing bowl; stir in 1 1/2 cups warm water and vegetable oil. BEAT at low speed with an electric mixer for 1 to 2 minutes; beat at high speed 3 minutes. Gradually stir in enough remaining flour to make dough stiff. TURN dough out onto a well-floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic (about 5 minutes). Place in a well-greased bowl, turning to grease top. COVER and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in bulk. PUNCH dough down, and press onto a lightly greased 12-inch round pizza pan or into a 15- x 10-inch jellyroll pan. COVER and let rise in a warm place, free from drafts, 45 minutes or until doubled in bulk. SAUTE onion and garlic in hot olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until tender. Add remaining 1 teaspoon salt, tomatoes, and next 6 ingredients. BRING to a boil; cook, covered, over medium heat 10 minutes. Spoon sauce over dough. BAKE at 475 degrees for 20 minutes. Sprinkle evenly with desired toppings; bake 10 to 15 more minutes. Garnish, if desired.
