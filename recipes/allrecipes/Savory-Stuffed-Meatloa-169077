Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix meat, 1 of the eggs, 1/4 cup each of the steak sauce and onion, salt and pepper in large bowl. Shape into 12x10-inch rectangle on wax paper. Mix cracker crumbs, celery, walnut pieces, poultry seasoning, remaining egg and remaining 1/4 cup onion until well blended. Spread over meat mixture to within 1 inch of edges; press lightly into meat mixture. Roll up from one of the short ends as for a jelly roll, removing the wax paper as it is rolled. Press ends and edges together to seal. Place in greased 13x9-inch baking pan. Bake 45 minutes. Meanwhile, mix remaining 1/4 cup steak sauce and the marmalade in small saucepan; cook on low heat until mixture comes to boil. Spoon over meatloaf. Bake an additional 15 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before cutting into slices to serve.
