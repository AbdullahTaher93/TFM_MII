Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). In a medium bowl, beat the eggs, egg whites, flour, milk, and vanilla until smooth. Melt the margarine in a heavy, 12-inch (30-cm) cast-iron skillet. When the skillet is hot, pour in the batter and put the skillet in the oven. Bake for 15 minutes; lower the temperature to 350 degrees F and bake until golden brown.
