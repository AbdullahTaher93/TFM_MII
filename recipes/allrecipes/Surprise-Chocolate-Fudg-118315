In a microwave-safe dish, mash beans with a fork until smooth; cover and microwave for 1-1/2 minutes or until heated through. Add cocoa, butter and vanilla. (Mixture will be thick.) Slowly stir in sugar; add nuts. Press mixture into a 9-in. square pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Cover and refrigerate until firm. Cut into 1-in. pieces.
