In double boiler over hot water, melt chocolate with liqueur and water; stir gently to blend. Cool until chocolate mixture no longer feels warm to the touch. In large bowl with electric mixer, beat cream until soft peaks form; fold cream into chocolate mixture. In large bowl with clean mixer, whisk egg whites until soft peaks form. With rubber spatula, fold egg whites into chocolate mixture. Divide mousse among 6 dessert bowls or glasses. Chill at least 1 hour.
