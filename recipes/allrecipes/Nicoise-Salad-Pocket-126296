To make the dressing: In a large bowl, combine the vinegar, olive oil, flaxseed oil, mustard, Italian seasoning, and garlic. To make the sandwiches: Place a steamer basket in a saucepan with 1/2 inch of water. Place the potatoes and beans in the steamer. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 7 minutes, or until tender-crisp. Rinse briefly under cold running water and drain. To the bowl with the dressing, add the potatoes, beans, tuna, onion, egg whites, olives, and spinach. Toss to coat well. Spoon the tuna mixture into each pita pocket. Drizzle lightly with any dressing left in the bowl.
