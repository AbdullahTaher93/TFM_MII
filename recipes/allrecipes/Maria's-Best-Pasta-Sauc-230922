In a deep pot over high heat, brown ground beef, onion, garlic, Italian seasoning, hot pepper flakes and 1/4 tsp (1 mL) each salt and pepper, breaking up beef with a spoon, for about 8 min or until beef is no longer pink. Pour in cream and boil, stirring, for 3 min or until about half is absorbed. Add tomatoes and bring to a boil; reduce heat and boil gently, stirring often, for about 5 min until flavours are blended and sauce is thickened. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
