In a small non-metallic bowl, add the vinegar, lemon juice, lime juice, lemon pepper, orange extract, cumin, chili powder, allspice and a pinch of salt. Whisk and let sit until after you cut up the veggies. It is nice if your cucumber is seedless and the skin is tasty. If not, then peel and remove the seeds before slicing into match sticks. For the zuke, I usually cut it into quarters lengthwise then cut off and discard the center section before cutting into matchsticks. For the bell peppers, cut off both ends (reserve for some other dish) and then use only the straight sides. Be sure to remove the seeds and membrane. In a large bowl, toss the veggies. Vigorously whisk the vinaigrette while you (or a helper) slowly adds the canola oil. Pour over the veggies and toss. Cover and refrigerate at least 20 minutes or up to several hours.
