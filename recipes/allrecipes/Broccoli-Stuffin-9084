Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook broccoli according to package instructions. Lightly grease a large baking dish. In a bowl, mix the cheese, eggs, onion, cream of mushroom soup, and mayonnaise. Arrange the cooked broccoli in the prepared baking dish. Pour cheese sauce over broccoli. Spread stuffing mix over the sauce. Drizzle butter over all. Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly and lightly browned.
