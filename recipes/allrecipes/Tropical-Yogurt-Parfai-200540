Toast all of the coconut in a small frying pan over low heat for 5-8 minutes or until golden brown. Stir frequently. Mix yogurt, crushed pineapple, vanilla, SPLENDA(R) No Calorie Sweetener with Fiber and 2 tablespoons of toasted coconut together in a small mixing bowl. Set aside. Mix chopped fruit together. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of yogurt mixture into parfait glasses or other clear serving dishes. Top with about 1/4 cup of the fruit mixture. Repeat so there are two layers of yogurt and two layers of fruit in each serving dish. Sprinkle each parfait with a bit of the remaining toasted coconut.
