Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Beat the eggs until they form ribbons (that is when the eggs form a string shape impression for a moment on top of the beaten eggs when drizzled from a distance of about 1 foot over the bowl). In a double broiler (or over very low heat stirring constantly) melt the butter and the chocolate bars. Remove the chocolate from the heat and stir in the instant coffee and vanilla. Add about 1 Tbsp of chocolate to the eggs and whisk vigorously. This is tempering the eggs. Add another 2 Tbsps, whisking vigorously. Fold in the remaining chocolate. Pour the batter into 5 cupcake parchment paper cups. Don't worry that this does not look like enough batter per cup cake; it will raise doubling in size. Bake at 325 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until a tooth pick comes out clean. Don't peak at them cooking for the first 12 minutes. Allow to cool for at least 5 minutes - if you can resist.
