Over medium-high heat, melt butter in a large saucepan. Add pork chops and cook until browned on both sides. Season with salt and pepper. Top with onion slices. In a bowl, stir together soup, ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. Pour soup mixture over pork chops. Cover pan and simmer until meat is no longer pink inside and thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 40 to 60 minutes.
