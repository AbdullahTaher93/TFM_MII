Mix whole wheat flour, bread flour, olive oil, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Mix in enough water to bring dough together. Turn dough out on a lightly floured surface. Let rest for 10 to 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Divide dough into 6 to 8 pieces. Roll out each piece to paper-thin thickness. Transfer pieces of dough to the lined baking sheets; cut into strips or squares. Bake in the preheated oven until browned and edges curl up, 15 to 20 minutes.
