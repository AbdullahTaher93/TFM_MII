In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup warm milk. Stir in 1 tablespoon sugar; let stand for 5 minutes. Add the eggs, butter, salt, and remaining milk and sugar. Beat in 4 cups flour until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. For filling, melt butter in a small saucepan. Stir in flour until smooth. Add the orange juice, pineapple, sugar, orange peel and salt. Bring to a boil; cook and stir over medium heat for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat; cool. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Roll out into a 24-in. x 12-in. rectangle. Spread filling over dough to within 1/2 in. of edges. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch seam to seal. Cut into 15 slices. Place cut side down in a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan and a 9-in. square baking pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Top each roll with a cherry. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until golden. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool. Combine glaze ingredients; drizzle over rolls.
