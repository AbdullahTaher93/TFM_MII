Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Prepare 24 muffin cups with cooking spray or line with paper liners. Beat eggs, flour, brown sugar replacement, olive oil, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl until smooth. Add squash, oats, and rosemary; stir until you have a smooth batter. Divide batter between prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
