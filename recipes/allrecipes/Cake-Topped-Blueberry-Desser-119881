In a saucepan, combine the blueberries, brown sugar and butter; cook for 5 minutes or until saucy. Pour into an 8-in. square baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. In a mixing bowl, cream shortening and sugar. Beat in egg and orange peel. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; add to the creamed mixture alternately with orange juice, beating just until combined. Drop batter by spoonfuls over blueberry mixture. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center of cake comes out clean. Serve warm.
