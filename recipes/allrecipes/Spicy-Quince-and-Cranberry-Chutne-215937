Stir the sugar, cloves, allspice, cinnamon, and salt together in a large saucepan. Stir in the water, then bring to a boil over high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Add the quince, and reduce heat to low. Cook and stir until the quince have turned rose colored, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the orange zest, orange juice, vinegar, and cranberries. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the cranberries have burst and the chutney has thickened, about 20 minutes. Cool completely before serving.
