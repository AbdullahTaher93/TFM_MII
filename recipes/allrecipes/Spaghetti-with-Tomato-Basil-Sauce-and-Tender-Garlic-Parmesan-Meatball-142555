Make the sauce: In a large pot, heat 4 tablespoons of olive oil, and saute the onion and garlic until translucent. Add chopped tomatoes, oregano or thyme, and chili flakes and simmer for 20 minutes. Add tomato soup and cook for 5 more minutes. Make the meatballs: In a medium skillet, over medium heat, melt butter. Add onion and garlic, cook for about 5 minutes, until soft, taking care not to brown the onions. Remove from skillet, set aside to cool. Reserve. In a bowl, combine bread and milk. Allow to soak for 10 minutes or until all the milk is absorbed. In a large bowl, combine ground veal, sauteed onion and garlic, soaked bread, egg, 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon of parsley, basil, thyme, salt, pepper and sugar. Mix until thoroughly combined. With wet hands, divide the meat mixture into 8 portions. Roll each portion into a large meatball. Transfer to a plate. Repeat process until you have 8 large meatballs. Carefully lower meatballs into simmering sauce, cook covered, for about 30 minutes or until done and the sauce has thickened and the flavors have developed. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the spaghetti until al dente. Drain. With a slotted spoon, remove the meatballs from the tomato sauce and transfer to a bowl plus about 1-1/2 cups of sauce. Add the drained pasta to the tomato sauce remaining in the saucepan. Stir to coat spaghetti thoroughly. To serve: Twirl sauced spaghetti onto each of 8 heated pasta plates. Top with a meatball and drizzle with some of the reserved sauce. Garnish with minced parsley and Parmesan cheese.
