Pancakes: Combine eggs, cottage cheese, flour, oil, baking powder, vanilla and salt in a blender. Cover and blend on high speed for 1 minute. Scrape down the side of the blender container and blend for a few seconds more. Alternately, combine ingredients in a bowl and beat well with an electric mixer. For each pancake, pour 1/4cup batter into a lightly greased frying pan or griddle over medium-high heat. Cook until bubbles start to appear, then flip and cook the second side. Sauce: Combine blueberries, sugar, water, cornstarch and cinnamon in a large saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved; continue cooking for a few minutes until mixture is slightly thickened. Keep sauce warm while preparing pancakes. To serve, spoon about 2 tbsp blueberry sauce on one half of each pancake. Fold pancakes over blueberry mixture.
