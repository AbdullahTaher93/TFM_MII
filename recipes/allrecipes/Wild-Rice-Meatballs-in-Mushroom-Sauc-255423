Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine beef, onion, rice, seasoned salt, garlic salt, bread crumbs, and evaporated milk. Shape into 1 inch meatballs. Place meatballs on rimmed baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until brown, about 15 minutes. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and sprinkle with salt; saute until mushrooms release their moisture and soften, about 10 minutes. Add the wine, water, soup, salt, and sage to saucepan; stir to combine. Transfer meatballs to the sauce and simmer until cooked through and hot, 30 minutes. Prepare Idahoan Signatureâ„¢ Russets Mashed Potatoes according to package instructions. Serve with the meatballs and mushroom sauce.
