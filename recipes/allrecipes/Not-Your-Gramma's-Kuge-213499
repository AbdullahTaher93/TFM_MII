Spray the inside of a 3 1/2-quart slow cooker with the cooking spray. Cook the noodles according to the package directions until they're almost tender. Drain and place them in the cooker. Sprinkle with the currants. Beat the soup, cottage cheese, sugar, orange zest and eggs in a medium bowl with a fork. Pour over the noodles and stir to coat. Cover and cook on LOW for 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until it's set. Serve warm.
