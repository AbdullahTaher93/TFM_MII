In a large saucepan over medium heat, heat the oil. Add the rice, onion and bell pepper and saute for 5 minutes, or until onions are tender. Add the ground beef and saute until browned. Drain excess oil and fat. Add the corn, tomato sauce, ketchup and water. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until rice is cooked, stirring occasionally. Season with salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste.
