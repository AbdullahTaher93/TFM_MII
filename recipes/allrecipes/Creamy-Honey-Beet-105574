Reserve half of the zest from oranges. Heat orange segments with water and honey. Bring to a rolling boil then strain into a medium saucepan, squeezing as much juice out of the oranges as possible before discarding. Add beets and orange zest to sauce then simmer, covered, for a half hour. Season to taste with kosher salt.
