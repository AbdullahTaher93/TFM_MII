Season pork with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir pork in hot oil until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer pork to a plate and return pot to heat. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cook and stir onion and 2 tablespoons water in hot pot until water has evaporated and onion is soft and golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic, serrano peppers, cumin, and coriander; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir 2 cups water, chicken broth, and tomatoes into onion mixture. Whisk in cornmeal and bring to a simmer over high heat, stirring often; add hominy, pork, salt, and pepper to taste. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is soft and hominy mixture thickens, about 30 minutes. Stir in cilantro and lime juice.
