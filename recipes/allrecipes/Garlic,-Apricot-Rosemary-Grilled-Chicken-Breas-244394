Preheat grill to medium-high or oven to 450 degrees F. Place jam, olive oil, garlic, rosemary, salt, pepper and garlic salt into a small bowl until combined. Center two chicken breast halves on each sheet of Reynolds Wrap(R) Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil. Spoon 1/4 the apricot sauce over each piece of chicken and lay 2 slices of lemon on top. Bring up foil sides. Double fold top and ends to seal packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside. Repeat to make two packets. Grill 12 to 15 minutes in covered grill on a baking sheet until chicken reaches 170 degrees F on meat thermometer. Open packets carefully, allowing steam to escape, by cutting along top fold with sharp knife.
