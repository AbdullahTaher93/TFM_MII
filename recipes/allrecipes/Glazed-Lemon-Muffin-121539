In a bowl, combine flour and sugar. Cut in butter until crumbly; set aside. For muffins, cream butter and sugar in a mixing bowl. Beat in eggs, sour cream, lemon juice and peel. Combine flour, baking soda and salt; stir into creamed mixture just until moistened. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Sprinkle with reserved crumb topping. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until muffins test done. Cool in pans for 5 minutes before removing to wire racks. Combine glaze ingredients; drizzle over muffins.
