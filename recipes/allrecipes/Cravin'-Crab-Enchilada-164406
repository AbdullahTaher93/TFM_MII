Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 13x9-inch (3-quart) glass baking dish with CRISCO(R) Original No-Stick Cooking Spray. In 2-quart saucepan, heat enchilada sauce and whipping cream to boiling over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low; simmer uncovered 7 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until sauce is reduced and slightly thickened. Meanwhile, in 12-inch skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until hot. Add onion; cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and translucent (do not brown). Stir in corn, chiles, 1/4 cup of the cilantro, the sherry and crabmeat until well mixed. Remove from heat. Spoon slightly less than 1/2 cup crabmeat mixture down center of each tortilla; top each with 1/4 cup of the cheese. Roll up tortillas; place seam sides down in baking dish. Sprinkle remaining 1 1/2 cups cheese over enchiladas. Pour sauce mixture over enchiladas. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until bubbly around edges. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cilantro, the green onions and almonds. Serve with sour cream and lime wedges.
