Prepare barbecue grill or preheat broiler. In baking dish, combine tomato and lime juices, jalapeno, cilantro, garlic, oil, oregano, chili powder, and cumin. Add chicken and turn to coat. Let stand for 10 minutes. Remove chicken from marinade and grill over hot coals or broil 2 inches (5 cm) from heat until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes on each side.
