Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir onion with a pinch of salt in hot oil until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant; about 1 minute. Stir in thyme and cook for about 30 seconds; transfer mixture to a large bowl. Stir sweet potatoes, quinoa, sea salt, and black pepper together with onion mixture until well-combined. Divide mixture into golf-ball size balls and press into patties. Heat coconut oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties in hot oil until browned, about 2 minutes per side.
