Combine heavy cream, milk, water, orange juice, butter, mustard, honey, and salt in a pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring frequently, until sauce thickens, 20 to 25 minutes. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook salmon until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes per side. Transfer salmon to a serving plate and top with sauce. Squeeze lemon slices over salmon.
