Mix beer, Parmesan cheese, yeast, salt, pepper, and granulated garlic in a large mixing bowl, stirring to dissolve salt. Let mixture stand until yeast forms a creamy layer, 10 to 20 minutes. Stir in olive oil. Stir flour into yeast mixture until dough is smooth, adding small amounts of beer or flour if dough is too dry or sticky. Let dough rise 1 hour. Punch down dough and roll out into a pizza crust on a floured work surface.
