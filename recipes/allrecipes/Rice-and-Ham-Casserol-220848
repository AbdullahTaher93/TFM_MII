Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large baking dish. Combine ham, Cheddar cheese, carrot, green bell pepper, instant rice, diced onion, milk, and cream of celery soup in a bowl until well mixed. Transfer ham mixture to the prepared baking dish; cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 90 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until casserole is hot and bubbly, about 30 minutes more.
