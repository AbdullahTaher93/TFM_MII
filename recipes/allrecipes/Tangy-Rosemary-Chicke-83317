Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place chicken breasts in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Put several slices of onion on top. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, stir in ketchup, vinegar, butter, garlic, rosemary, salt, and mustard. Bring to a boil, then pour sauce over chicken. Bake in a preheated oven for 30 minutes. Turn chicken breasts over, and continue baking until done, about 20 to 30 minutes.
