Spray the inside of a 4-quart slow cooker with the cooking spray. Combine the soup, water, eggs and cake mix in a medium bowl and mix according to the package directions. Pour the batter into the cooker. Stir the water, brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Pour over the batter. Cover and cook on HIGH for 2 hours or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Spoon the cake into bowls, spooning the sauce from the bottom of the cooker. Serve warm with the ice cream.
