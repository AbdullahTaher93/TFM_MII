Blend olive oil, shallots, chile pepper, garlic, shrimp paste, lemon grass, ginger root, and turmeric together in the bowl of a food processor until smooth paste forms, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Heat paste in a large saucepan over medium heat until very fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add coconut milk, palm sugar, kaffir lime leaves, cinnamon, cloves, sea salt, and white pepper. Bring mixture to a boil and cook until thickened slightly, about 10 minutes. Stir in beef; reduce heat to gentle simmer. Cook mixture until beef is tender and sauce is thick, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Remove kaffir lime leaves to serve.
