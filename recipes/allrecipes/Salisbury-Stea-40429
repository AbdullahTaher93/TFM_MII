Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Lightly grease a large shallow baking dish. In a large bowl, combine ground beef, ground pork, tomatoes, eggs, onion, garlic, salt and pepper. Mix well. Shape into 12 (4-inch) round patties. Place in baking dish. Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes, until evenly brown, and juices run clear. Cook to a minimum of 160 degrees F (73 degrees C).
