Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place olive oil in a heavy oven-safe Dutch oven which can be tightly covered. Add 1/3 of the chicken, garlic, parsley, celery leaves, tarragon, salt, white pepper, allspice, cinnamon and dry white wine. Mix. Repeat two more times. Cover pot tightly and place in preheated oven, cook for about 1 1/4 hours. The chicken will not be brown, but moist and succulent. If desired, serve with crusty bread to mop up the sauce.
