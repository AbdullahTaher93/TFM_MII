In large skillet, bring water to a boil. Stir in pasta, seasonings and bell pepper. Return to a boil. Reduce heat to medium. Gently boil uncovered 4 to 5 minutes, or until pasta is tender, stirring occasionally. (Sauce will be thin.) Stir in spaghetti sauce, mushrooms and pepperoni. Remove skillet from heat. Let stand 3 to 5 minutes for sauce to thicken. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.
