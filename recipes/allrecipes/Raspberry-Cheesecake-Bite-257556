Beat cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla together in a bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and creamy, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a piping bag. Pipe cream cheese mixture into raspberries, filling the center. Roll raspberries in graham cracker crumbs. Refrigerate about 1 hour before serving.
