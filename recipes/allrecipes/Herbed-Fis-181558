Cut fish into 4 serving pieces. In 10-inch skillet, heat oil over medium heat. In small shallow dish, mix Bisquick mix, bread crumbs, basil and salt. In another shallow dish, beat egg. Dip fish into egg, then coat with Bisquick mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cook fish in oil 8 to 10 minutes, turning once, until fish flakes easily with fork and is brown on both sides.
