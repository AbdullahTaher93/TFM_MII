Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Put cornmeal in a large bowl. Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together into cornmeal. Stir in chopped rosemary. Put eggs, sugar, buttermilk, and oil in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed until combined. Reduce speed to low. Add flour mixture in two batches; mix until just combined. Divide batter between two 5 1/8-by-3 3/4-by-2-inch wooden molds; top each with 3 rosemary sprigs, if desired (remove before cutting). Bake until a cake tester inserted in centers comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool completely in molds on a wire rack. Store at room temperature, wrapped in plastic wrap, up to 2 days.
