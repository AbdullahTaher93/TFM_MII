Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 14-inch pizza pan. Mix cookie dough, softened butter, and egg together in a bowl. Spread cookie dough mixture onto prepared pizza pan to cover entirely. Bake in preheated oven until dough begins to brown, 10 to 12 minutes; set aside to cool. Beat confectioners' sugar into peanut butter in a bowl until completely integrated. Spread peanut butter mixture over cooled cookie dough crust. Arrange halved peanut butter cups atop peanut butter layer. Sprinkle chocolate chips around peanut butter cups.
