Use a cheese cloth to strain the yogurt over a bowl for 3 to 4 hours, until most of the water has drained. Press excess liquid out of the shredded cucumber. In a medium bowl, stir together the cucumber and strained yogurt. Mix in the garlic, salt, pepper and mint. Chill the mixture for 1 to 2 hours.
