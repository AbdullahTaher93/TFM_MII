Combine sugar, butter, egg, vanilla and peppermint extract in large mixer bowl. Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until creamy (2 to 3 minutes). Reduce speed to low; add flour, baking powder and salt. Beat until well mixed (1 to 2 minutes). Remove half of dough. Add cooled melted chocolate to remaining dough in bowl. Beat until well mixed (1 minute). Add green food color to white dough; mix well. Shape each half into 4x5-inch rectangle; wrap in plastic food wrap. Refrigerate 1 hour. Roll out chocolate dough between two sheets of lightly floured waxed paper to 12x7-inch rectangle. Repeat with green dough. Place green dough on top of chocolate dough. Gently press doughs together. Roll up, jelly-roll fashion, starting with 12-inch side; wrap in plastic food wrap. Refrigerate until firm (at least 2 hours). Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Cut rolls with sharp knife into 1/4-inch slices. Place 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 7 to 9 minutes or until set. Remove from cookie sheets; cool completely.
