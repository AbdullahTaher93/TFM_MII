Stir in vanilla. Sift together flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt in a separate mixing bowl. Gradually add flour mixture to SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend for Baking mixture, beating until blended. Do not over beat. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface. Divide dough in half; pat each half into a circle. Roll one portion to 1/8-inch thickness on a lightly floured surface.
