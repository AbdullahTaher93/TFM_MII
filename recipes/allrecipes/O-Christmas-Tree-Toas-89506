Beat the egg with milk and green food coloring. Next have your little helpers cut trees out of the bread with a Christmas-tree cookie-cutter. Dip the trees in the egg mix and fry until golden on both sides. Pour the red raspberry syrup on your plates and place your green trees right in the middle. To decorate, add snow (also known as powdered sugar), raisins or sprinkles.
