Season the chicken with Mexican blend. In a large saucepan or Dutch-oven set over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the chicken and stir occasionally, until the chicken is cooked, about 5 minutes. Add the bell pepper and onions, cook for 3 minutes. Remove and set aside. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in same pan, add 2 cups of the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Add the Knorr(R) Fiesta Sides(TM) - Spanish Rice and prepare according to package directions (cover and simmer for 7 minutes). Stir in the chicken/onion and pepper mix, along with the beans and remaining chicken broth. Bring to a low boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Serve, if desired, with sour cream, shredded cheese, chopped cilantro, lime wedges and tortilla strips.
