Combine 1/2 cup warm water and 1 teaspoon sugar in a bowl; add yeast. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 10 minutes. Mix flour, 2 cups water, butter, and salt into yeast mixture and stir until smooth. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight. Stir 1/4 cup sugar, vanilla extract, and baking soda into flour mixture until batter is smooth. Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Drop batter, about 1/4 cup per waffle, onto the griddle until waffles quit releasing steam, about 10 minutes.
