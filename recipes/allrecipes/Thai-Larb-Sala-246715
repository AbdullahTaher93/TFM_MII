Bring water to a simmer in a large skillet over medium heat. Add turkey; cook and stir until no longer pink and and it registers 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) on an instant-read thermometer, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir green onions, cilantro, mint, lime juice, fish sauce, and chile flakes into the ground turkey.
