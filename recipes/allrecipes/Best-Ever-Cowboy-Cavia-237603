Combine olive oil, vegetable oil, cider vinegar, and sugar in a saucepan; bring to a boil, remove from heat, and cool to room temperature. Stir pinto beans, black-eyed peas, corn, onion, celery, red bell pepper, and cilantro together in a large bowl. Pour cooled oil mixture over bean mixture and toss to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, stirring occasionally, for 24 hours. Drain excess dressing before serving.
