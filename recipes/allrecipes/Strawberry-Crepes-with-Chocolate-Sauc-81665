Make the chocolate fudge sauce. Set aside. Crepes: This takes a little bit of practice, if you are not already familiar with the technique. If this is your first time at making crepes then perhaps you might want to make a double batch of the crepe mix so that you can screw up one or two of them. In a small bowl, beat the egg. Add the milk, Splenda and extract and beat again. Then beat in the whey powder, mix well. It may be a little lumpy but that's okay. Heat a crepe pan or a small non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Once it is hot, melt a tiny bit of butter and spread it around. Add 1/2 of the egg mixture and immediately tilt the pan around so that the batter evenly covers the bottom of the pan. Set back on the heat and let it cook for about 20 or 30 seconds. Carefully lift up an edge to see if it has begun to brown. When it is a nice golden brown, carefully flip it over and cook another 30 seconds. Remove to a paper towel or parchment paper. Repeat with a tiny bit of butter and the remaining batter. If you are not using the crepes right away layer parchment paper between them and slip into a large baggie or place on a plate and cover with plastic. Refrigerate up to two days. Filling: The strawberries can be fresh or frozen. You may want to slice 1 strawberry into several very thin slices and reserve as a garnish (this is not easy with frozen berries). If frozen then let thaw until they are soft enough to cut. Cut into quarters or smaller if they are large berries. In a bowl, mix together the yogurt, ricotta cheese and Splenda. Fold in the strawberries. To assemble: Place a crepe on a flat surface and heap 1/2 of the filling across the lower third of the crepe and then carefully roll up. Transfer to dessert plate with the seam side down. Repeat for the other crepe. Heat the chocolate sauce in the microwave for a few seconds and pour over the crepes.
