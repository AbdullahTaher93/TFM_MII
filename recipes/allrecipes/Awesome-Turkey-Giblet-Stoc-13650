In a large saucepan, combine the neck and giblets (excluding the liver), 6 cups water, celery, carrot, onion, tangerine zest, bay leaf, and peppercorns. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, skimming the froth occasionally, for 1 hour. Add liver and continue to cook at a bare simmer for an additional 30 minutes. Strain the stock through a fine sieve into a bowl. Reserve the liver for Awesome Sausage, Apple and Dried Cranberry Stuffing (see Cook's Note). Reserve the neck and remaining giblets for the gravy. There should be about 3 cups of stock. If there is more, simmer the stock until it is reduced to about 3 cups; if there is less, add enough water to measure about 3 cups.
