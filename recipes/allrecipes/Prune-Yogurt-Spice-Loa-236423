Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. Mix flour, oats, baking powder, ground ginger, baking soda, nutmeg, and cloves together in a bowl. Whisk yogurt, prunes, sugar, and eggs together in a large bowl; add flour mixture and stir. Fold maple syrup into the mixture; pour into prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely.
