Beat soy milk, water, dairy-free margarine, maple syrup, 1 tablespoon sugar, and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Beat in flour until batter is smooth. Cover bowl and refrigerate for 2 hours. Spray a small nonstick skillet or crepe pan with cooking spray; place over medium-high heat. Pour in 1/4 cup batter and swirl it around to cover the bottom of the skillet. Cook until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining batter. Combine dairy-free cream cheese, 3/4 cup sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Combine maraschino cherries, 1/2 cup sugar, and cornstarch in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until sugar melts and sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Let cool. Fill crepes with cream filling; drizzle cherry sauce on top.
