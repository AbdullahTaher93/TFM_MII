In a large bowl, mix the celery, onions, green pepper, ketchup, water, barbeque sauce, vinegar, and hot pepper sauce. Season with chili powder, salt, and pepper. Place the roast in a slow cooker, and cover with the sauce mixture. Cover, and cook on Low for approximately 12 hours. Shred the meat with a fork. Increase cooking temperature to High, and continue cooking until most of the liquid has been reduced.
