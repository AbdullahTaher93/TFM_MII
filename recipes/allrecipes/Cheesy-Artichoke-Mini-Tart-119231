Gently press wonton wrappers into miniature muffins cups coated with nonstick cooking spray, allowing edges to extend above cups. Spritz edges with nonstick cooking spray. In a mixing bowl, combine the cream cheese, cheddar cheese, mustard and cayenne until blended. Stir in artichokes and red pepper; mix well. Spoon into wonton cups. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until cheese mixture is set and wontons are lightly browned. Garnish with dill or tarragon if desired.
