In a medium bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until well light and fluffy. Stir in the egg, then the flour. Mix in the tea leaves. Form the dough into a ball, and flatten to about 1 inch. Wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about 15 minutes, or until firm. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Roll the dough into walnut sized balls, and place on cookie sheets. Flatten slightly. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven until the edges begin to brown slightly. Remove cookies from baking sheets to cool on wire racks.
