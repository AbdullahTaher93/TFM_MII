Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for direct heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is directly under the food). For charcoal grill: Before you put the grill over the hot coals, brush it with a light coat of oil. For gas grill: When hot, brush grill with a light coat of oil. Rinse and drain vegetables. Snap off tough stem ends from asparagus; trim ends from squash; and stem and seed peppers. Cut larger vegetables lengthwise into pieces 1/3 to 1/2 inch thick. Drizzle or brush vegetables with 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle on all sides with salt and pepper. Lightly oil grill with 1 tablespoon of oil. Lay vegetables crosswise on grill over a solid bed of medium hot coals or medium high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand just above grill level for only 3 to 4 seconds). Keep charcoal grill uncovered; close lid on gas grill. Cook vegetables, turning once with tongs, until tinged with brown on both sides, 8 to 10 minutes total. Transfer to a clean platter as done. Serve warm or at room temperature.
