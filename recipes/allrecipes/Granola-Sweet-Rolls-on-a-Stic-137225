Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease large cookie sheet with shortening or cooking spray. Separate dough into 5 rolls; set icing aside. Place rolls on cookie sheet. With sharp knife or 1- to 1 1/4-inch cookie cutter, cut hole in center of each roll; set roll cutouts aside. Place yogurt in shallow bowl. Place crushed granola bars in another shallow bowl. Peel banana; cut off small slice from each end and cut remaining banana into 5 equal pieces. Place banana pieces in yogurt; stir with spoon until coated. Roll banana pieces in crushed granola bars to coat well. Place 1 coated banana piece in hole in each roll, making hole larger if necessary. Set remaining yogurt aside. Thread stick through side of each roll, through banana and out other side of roll. Slide roll down stick about 1/3 of length. Thread 1 reserved roll cutout onto stick. Bake 12 to 17 minutes or until golden brown and dough around center of roll is no longer doughy. Cool 5 minutes. Meanwhile, stir reserved icing into remaining yogurt for sauce. If desired, cut off sharp ends from sticks with kitchen scissors. Loosen rolls and remove from cookie sheet. Serve with yogurt sauce for dipping.
