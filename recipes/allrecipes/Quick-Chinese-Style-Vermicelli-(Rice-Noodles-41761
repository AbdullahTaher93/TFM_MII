Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add rice noodles, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until al dente; do not overcook, or they will become mushy. Drain. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute garlic until tender. Stir in noodles, and season with soy sauce, chili sauce, salt and pepper. Sprinkle top with chopped green onion.
