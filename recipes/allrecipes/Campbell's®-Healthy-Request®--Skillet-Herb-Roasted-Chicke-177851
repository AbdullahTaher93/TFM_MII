Mix the sage and thyme in a small bowl. Sprinkle over the chicken. Spray a 12-inch nonstick skillet with the cooking spray and heat over medium heat for 1 minute. Add the chicken and cook for 15 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Remove the chicken and keep warm. Add the garlic to the skillet and cook until it's lightly browned. Add the soup and water and cook until the mixture is hot. Serve over the chicken with Parslied Rice.
