Pour 1/4 cup broth into a large pan with a lid; bring to a simmer. Add peppers and onions. Simmer until softened, about 3 minutes. Add black beans and simmer for an additional 2 minutes. Add remaining broth to the pan. Stir in 1 packet Knorr(R) Fiesta Rice(TM) - Mexican Rice, cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir often. Add sliced chicken and gently stir to coat the chicken with the pan sauce. Cook until rice is cooked through, another 2 to 5 minutes. Stir lightly to keep rice from sticking. Sprinkle cheese on warm tortillas and top with slices of chicken and rice and pepper mixture. Top with more cheese, roll them up, and enjoy!
