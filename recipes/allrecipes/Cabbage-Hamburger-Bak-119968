In a skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in salt. In a greased 2-1/2-qt. baking dish, layer half of the beef mixture, cabbage and soup. Repeat layers (dish will be full). Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until cabbage is tender. Serve with a slotted spoon.
