Whisk together all ingredients in a small bowl, cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld. Combine the shrimp, celery and red onion in a large bowl. Add the red chile mayonnaise and gently fold to combine, season with salt and pepper. Can be made up to 8 hours in advance and stored covered in the refrigerator. Heat a grill, grill pan or preheat the broiler. Butter both sides of each bun and season with salt and pepper. Grill butter-side down or broil butter-side up until lightly golden brown. Divide the shrimp salad among the rolls and top with some of the blue corn chips.
