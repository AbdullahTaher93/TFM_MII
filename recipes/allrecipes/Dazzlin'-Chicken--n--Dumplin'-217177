Place the chicken breasts into a large soup pot, cover with water, and sprinkle in the salt, black pepper, and sage. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat and simmer until the chicken is no longer pink inside, about 30 minutes. Remove the chicken to a bowl, and let cool; shred chicken when cooled. While chicken is cooling, bring the chicken broth left in the pot back to a boil over medium heat, and stir in the celery, onion powder, and garlic powder. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the celery is tender, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk 1 cup of all-purpose flour, the whole wheat flour, salt, and baking powder together in a mixing bowl. Stir in the cream to make a dough. Sprinkle a work surface with the remaining 1/4 cup of flour, and roll the dough out about 1/4-inch thick. Using a pizza cutter, cut the dough into 1 1/2 inch squares. Toss the dumplings in the flour on the work surface. Drop the dumplings, a few at a time, into the simmering broth. Stir frequently to keep them from sticking to the bottom; allow to simmer until the dumplings puff up and the broth thickens, about 30 minutes; stir in the cooked shredded chicken and parsley. Bring back to a boil, and serve hot in bowls.
