Preheat a panini press according to manufacturer's instructions to medium-low heat. Coat inside surfaces with butter. Spread 1 to 2 tablespoons peanut butter onto half the bread slices; cover peanut butter with 1 to 2 tablespoons chocolate chips. Top each with a second slice of bread, creating 4 sandwiches. Grill each sandwich in the panini press until bread is toasted and chocolate is melted, 2 to 4 minutes.
