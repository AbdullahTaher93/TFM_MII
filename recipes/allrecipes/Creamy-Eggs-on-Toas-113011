Use any bread you like: I prefer crusty Italian. After toasting, I rub a ton of garlic on for spice and drizzle olive oil to mellow out the flavors. Radicchio's bite is nice, but any leafy vegetable will do. I add the eggs directly to the warm pan (fewer dirty dishes). I poke the yolks and start stirring over low heat, slow and steady, like when I make risotto. If I lose my patience, I turn up the heat a bit. I layer the bruschetta-like toast with radicchio, add the creamy eggs and Monterey Jack (which melts instantly as it hits the eggs), then scatter parsley on top -- all mine to enjoy.
