Toast almonds in small skillet over medium-low heat until light golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Cook the garlic cloves in the hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool to room temperature; chop. Pulse the almonds, garlic, and cilantro together in a food processor until roughly chopped. Slowly stream the 1/2 cup olive oil into the mixture with the food processor running continually. Add the lemon juice, red pepper, salt and pepper and continue processing until smooth.
