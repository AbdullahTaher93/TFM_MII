Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Arrange pita bread on a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until pita is lightly toasted, about 4 minutes. Spread pesto evenly over toasted pita bread and arrange tomato slices in a single layer. Top with feta cheese. Continue baking until feta cheese is browned and pita bread is crisp, about 11 minutes more.
