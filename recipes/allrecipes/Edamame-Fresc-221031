Place red onion in a bowl with enough water to cover; soak about 5 minutes. Drain. Combine soaked red onion, edamame, black beans, garbanzo beans, rice vinegar, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, parsley, ginger root, and extra-virgin olive oil in a large glass bowl, carefully folding to avoid smashing the beans; season with salt and black pepper. Refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.
