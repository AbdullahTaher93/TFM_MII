Melt chocolate chips with coffee-flavored liqueur in a small, heavy saucepan over low heat; stir until smooth, about 5 minutes. Stir a small amount of hot chocolate mixture into egg yolk; return chocolate and egg mixture to pan, stirring constantly. Cook and stir until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in vanilla extract. Cool, stirring several times. Beat heavy cream in a large bowl until it begins to thicken. Stir in sugar; beat until soft peaks form. Fold whipped cream mixture into cooled chocolate mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight. Garnish with whipped cream.
