In a nonstick skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, cook and stir egg substitute over medium heat until completely set. Stir into cheese mixture. For each strudel, place one sheet of phyllo dough on work surface with a short side facing you (keep remaining dough covered with waxed paper to avoid drying out). Coat dough with nonstick cooking spray; fold in half lengthwise. Coat with nonstick cooking spray; spritz with butter-flavored spray. Sprinkle with 2 teaspoons bread crumbs. Spread some egg mixture over bottom third of dough to within 3/4 in. of bottom and sides. Fold in sides. Roll up dough, starting at end with egg mixture. Place seam side down on an ungreased baking sheet. Coat with nonstick cooking spray; spritz with butter-flavored spray. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown and filling is heated through (filling may expand and come out of dough during baking). Sprinkle each with parsley and remaining Parmesan cheese.
