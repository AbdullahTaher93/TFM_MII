Stir coconut, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, flax seeds, almonds, hemp seed hearts, and protein powder together in a bowl; add honey, almond butter, and olive oil, stir until well combined. Shape mixture into balls about 1 1/2-inches in diameter. Coating your hands with a little olive oil will help prevent the mixture from sticking. Cover and refrigerate until serving.
