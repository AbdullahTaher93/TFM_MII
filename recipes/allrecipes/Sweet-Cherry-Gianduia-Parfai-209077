For chocolate leaves, place chopped chocolate in a small microwave-safe bowl. Micro-cook at 50% power (medium) for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes or until melted and smooth, stirring once or twice. Transfer melted chocolate to a small self-sealing plastic bag. Seal bag and snip a very small portion off one of the corners. Line a small baking sheet with parchment paper. Squeeze the chocolate in LEAF designs or freeform designs on the parchment paper. Chill chocolate designs about 15 minutes or until chocolate is firm. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl combine pie filling and cardamom; transfer 4 of the cherries to a small bowl for the garnish. Set both mixtures aside. In a large chilled mixing bowl beat whipping cream and sugar with an electric mixer on medium to high speed until soft peaks form. Remove 1/2 cup of the whipped cream; reserve for the garnish. In a medium bowl gently stir together chocolate-hazelnut spread and about 1/4 cup of the whipped cream. Fold in remaining whipped cream. To assemble, divide half of the chocolate-hazelnut whipped cream among four parfait glasses or dessert dishes. Top with half of the pie filling mixture and half of the hazelnuts. Repeat layers once. Top with the reserved whipped cream. Place a reserved cherry atop each parfait. Carefully peel chocolate leaves or designs off the parchment paper; place atop parfaits.
