Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut each pork chop horizontally three-fourths of the way through the meat creating a pocket, being careful to not cut all the way through. Rub pork chops with cumin, paprika and salt. Fill each pork chop with 1 tablespoon pesto; secure with wooden picks. Heat oil in medium, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Add pork chops; cook for 1 minute on each side until brown. Place skillet in oven. Bake pork chops and onion for 15 to 20 minutes or until pork is cooked through. Remove wooden picks; top with remaining 3 tablespoons pesto.
