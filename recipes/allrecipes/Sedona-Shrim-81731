In a large re-sealable baggie, pour in the olive oil, lime juice, wine, tabasco, garlic, chili flakes, cumin, and salt. Mix about and then add the shrimp. Remove as much air as possible before sealing the bag. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes but 1 or 2 hours in preferable. Choose one of the following three cooking methods. Broil: Place shrimp in a single layer (skewers can be used) in a shallow baking dish. Broil as close to heat as possible for 2 minutes on each side. Shrimp should turn a bright pink/orange, curl up and started to sizzle along the edges. Grill: Place skewered shrimp on preheated grill. Cook 2 minutes per side. Shrimp should turn a bright pink/orange, curl up and started to sizzle along the edges. Stir Fry: In a large skillet (or a wok) over high heat. Cook shrimp, stirring frequently, for 4 minutes. Shrimp should turn a bright pink/orange, curl up and started to sizzle along the edges. Place shrimp on platter and sprinkle with the fresh cilantro and diced bell peppers. Serve immediately.
