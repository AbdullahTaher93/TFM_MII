Rinse quinoa and drain well. Add to boiling water; reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 12 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork and let chill for about 30 minutes. Stir together quinoa, plums, walnuts, peppers and onions in a medium bowl. Whisk together remaining ingredients in a small bowl and pour over salad; toss well to coat all ingredients with dressing. Cover and chill for 1 hour.
