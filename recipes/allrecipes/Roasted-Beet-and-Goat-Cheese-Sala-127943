Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Wrap the beets in foil, place on a baking sheet and bake until tender and easily pierced with the tip of a knife, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove and let cool. When cool enough to handle, remove skins from beets and discard. Cut beets into thin wedges. Set aside in a small bowl. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F and toast walnuts in a small baking pan until fragrant, about 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from pan immediately. In a large bowl, whisk together olive oil, vinegar, thyme, and salt. Pour about 1 teaspoon of the dressing into the bowl with the beets, and toss to coat. Add the lettuce to the dressing in the large bowl along with the onion and toasted walnuts, and toss gently. Divide among four serving plates. Arrange the beets on top of the salad, sprinkle with goat cheese, and serve immediately.
