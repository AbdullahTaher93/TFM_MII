Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Prepare Stuffing as directed on package. Remove from heat; gently stir in apples, dried fruit, pecans and sage. Unroll meat; place stuffing mixture evenly over meat. Roll up meat, starting at one of the long sides, to enclose filling. Place, seam side down, on foil-covered baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray. Season with salt and pepper. Bake 45 minutes or until meat thermometer reaches 155 degrees F when inserted into the thickest part of the meat. Remove from oven; let stand 10 minutes before slicing.
