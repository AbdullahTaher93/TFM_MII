Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Place butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave until melted, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Dip the bottom of each mushroom cap in melted butter and place on a rimmed baking sheet. Stir Monterey Jack cheese, garlic powder, and thyme into the remaining melted butter. Stir in wine and soy sauce. Add enough bread crumbs to make a wet and sticky mixture. Spoon bread crumb mixture into each mushroom cap, mounding it slightly to use up all the filling. Broil in the preheated oven until brown and bubbly, 3 to 4 minutes. Cool slightly before serving, about 5 minutes.
