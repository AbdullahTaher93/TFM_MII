Bring cherries, sugar and 2/3 cup water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring often. Stir 1/4 cup water and cornstarch in a small bowl until smooth and stir into the boiling cherry mixture. Return to a boil, stirring constantly; cook until thickened, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice.
