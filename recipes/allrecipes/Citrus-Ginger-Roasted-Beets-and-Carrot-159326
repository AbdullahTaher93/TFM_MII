Place the remaining beets and carrots in a 9x13 inch baking dish, drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, sprinkle with the sea salt, and toss to coat. cover the dish with aluminum foil. Bake the vegetables in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, place the reserved beets and carrots into a blender.
