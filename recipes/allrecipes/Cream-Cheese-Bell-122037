In a mixing bowl, cream butter and cream cheese. Beat in egg yolks. Gradually add the flour. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Remove from refrigerator about 1 hour before rolling. For filling, combine the nuts, sugar, butter and egg white; set aside. Divide dough into fourths. On a floured surface, roll out each portion to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut with a 2-3/4-in. round cookie cutter. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Place 1 teaspoon filling in center of each circle. Shape into a cone by folding edges of dough to meet over filling. Moisten edges with water and pinch edges together. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on wire racks. Sprinkle cooled cookies with confectioners' sugar.
