In small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons warm water, 1 teaspoon sugar and yeast; let sit about 5 minutes or until foamy. In mixer with paddle, mix flour, remaining 1/4 cup sugar and salt on low speed until blended. Add yeast mixture; mix on medium speed until combined. Whisk together 8 eggs. With mixer on medium speed, slowly add eggs to flour mixture until combined. Replace paddle with dough hook; on medium speed, add butter 1 tablespoon at a time. Knead with dough hook 8 to 10 minutes or until dough is smooth and elastic, adding up to 1/4 cup flour if dough is too sticky. Transfer dough to greased bowl; cover with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature about 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in bulk. Cut dough in half; form each piece into a ball. Cover with a towel and let rest for 10 minutes. Roll out each piece into an 8- x 14-inch rectangle. Sprinkle chocolate over dough. Roll each rectangle into a log, starting from one of the short sides; place seam-side down in greased 8 1/2- x 4 1/2- x 2 1/2-inch loaf pan. Cover with plastic wrap; let rise about 1 hour or until dough reaches rim of pans. Beat remaining egg; brush tops of loaves with egg and sprinkle with sugar. Bake in 375 degrees F oven 30 to 40 minutes or until deep golden brown. Turn out onto rack; cool completely before cutting.
