Coat the tenderloin in the orange marmalade. Place it in a shallow glass dish. Pour the soy sauce into the dish, and add the garlic and fresh cilantro. Season with salt and pepper. Cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, turning the meat over occasionally so that it marinates evenly. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Place the meat over direct heat, and grill for about 12 to 15 minutes on each side. Discard marinade. The meat is done when the internal temperature is at 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove from grill, and let stand for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
