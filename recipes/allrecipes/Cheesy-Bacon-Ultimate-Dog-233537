Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Smear 1/4 teaspoon mustard inside each butterflied hot dog. Put 2 Cheddar cheese matchsticks inside each hot dog. Secure one end of a bacon strip to one end a hot dog using a toothpick. Wrap the bacon strip tightly around the entire hot dog, securing the far end with another toothpick; repeat for remaining hot dogs. Cook on preheated grill until hot dogs are heated and bacon is cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Place each cooked hot dog onto a bun and top with 2 pickle slices.
