For Pudding: Combine rice, milk, cinnamon sticks, salt and grated orange peel in a large saucepan. Bring milk to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes or until rice is tender and the mixture thickens stirring frequently. Mix in vanilla, raisins, and SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener. Remove cinnamon sticks and discard. Place pudding in refrigerator to chill. For Mango Sauce: Stir together mango juice and SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener in a medium saucepan. Over medium-low heat reduce juice by half or until syrupy (about 25 to30 minutes). Place in refrigerator to chill. Garnish pudding with sauce. For Topping: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix almonds and SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend in a small bowl. Place on greased baking sheet and bake for 5 minutes or until almonds are toasted. Sprinkle on top of rice pudding.
