Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Pierce potatoes with fork. Bake 1 hour. Let stand 5 min. Cut potatoes in half crosswise; scoop out centers, leaving 1/8-inch-thick shells. Place potatoes in large bowl. Add butter and milk; beat with electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy. (If potatoes are dry, beat in small amount of additional milk.) Spoon evenly into shells; lightly press 1 cheese cube in center of each potato. Place potatoes in muffin pan. Bake 30 min. or until heated through. Sprinkle each with 1/2 tsp. bacon bits. Top with broccoli.
