To Marinate: Place chicken in a nonporous glass dish or bowl; pour dressing and salsa over chicken and turn to coat. Cover with lid or aluminum foil and refrigerate to marinate for at least 2 hours, or overnight. Preheat oven to Grill/Broil. Remove chicken from dish or bowl, discarding any remaining marinade, and grill/broil for about 20 minutes or until cooked through and juices run clear. Serve immediately.
