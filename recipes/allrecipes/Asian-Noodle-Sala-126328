Preheat the broiler. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. Place the scallops or shrimp on the prepared sheet and coat with the pepper. Let stand for 5 minutes. Prepare the spaghetti according to package directions, adding the carrots during the last 2 minutes of cooking. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid. Drain the spaghetti and carrots. Rinse briefly under cold running water and toss with the oil. Meanwhile, broil the scallops or shrimp, turning often, for 4 minutes, or until the scallops or shrimp are opaque. In a large bowl, combine the peanut butter, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and 2 to 3 tablespoons of the pasta cooking liquid. Add the scallops or shrimp, spaghetti mixture, and cucumbers. Toss to coat well.
