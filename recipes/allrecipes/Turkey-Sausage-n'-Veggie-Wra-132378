In a large skillet, brown the sausages according to package directions. Remove sausages from the skillet, let cool slightly and cut diagonally into 1/4 inch slices. In a medium bowl, toss the bell peppers, cucumber and onion with the vinaigrette. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spread the center portion of each spinach wrap with 1/3 of the soft herb goat cheese. Divide the vegetable strips and the sausage slices evenly among the wraps, spreading on top of the cheese. Fold or roll each wrap. May be made and refrigerated up to 2 hours ahead.
