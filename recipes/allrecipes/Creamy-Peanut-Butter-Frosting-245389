Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth and no longer gritty, about 5 minutes. Add peanut butter, cream, and vanilla extract to the butter mixture. Beat on medium speed until frosting is well-mixed and smooth, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer frosting to an airtight container and refrigerate until firm, 1 to 2 hours.
