Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Melt butter in 1-cup microwavable measuring cup; stir in chili powder and garlic salt. Mix remaining ingredients in large roasting pan. Pour butter over mixture, stirring to coat evenly. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, stirring frequently, until hot and flavors are blended. Serve warm. Store any remaining snack in airtight container, when it's cool.
