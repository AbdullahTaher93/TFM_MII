In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the pasta until al dente. Drain the pasta well and return to the pot. Meanwhile, in a large, deep skillet, heat the oil over medium heat until hot but not smoking, about 2 minutes. Stir in the curry paste (adding more if a spicier sauce is desired) and cook until shiny and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in the chicken broth, coconut milk and 1/4 cup water and bring to a gentle boil, stirring constantly, over medium-high heat; cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk in the peanut butter, fish sauce, sugar and soy sauce to form a smooth, creamy sauce, about 1 minute. Toss the sauce with the noodles and top with the peanuts.
