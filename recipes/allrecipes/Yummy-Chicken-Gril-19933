In a large bowl combine fresh onion juice, olive oil, lime juice, saffron, salt and pepper. Mix in the cubes of chicken. Cover, and store in the refrigerator overnight. The next day, slide the cubes of chicken onto skewers for grilling. Brush each side with melted butter. Cook on the grill over medium heat until the chicken turns golden brown.
