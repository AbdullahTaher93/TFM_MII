Shape the goat cheese into a flat disc so it will cover a large amount of the chicken; set aside at room temperature. Season and baste all sides of the chicken and place on a hot grill. Cook on the grill, basting several times. When chicken is almost finished (internal temperature of 165 degrees F), place the goat cheese on top of the chicken and let it soften as the chicken finishes cooking. While chicken is finishing, place warm lemon butter, sun dried tomatoes, and chopped basil in a saute pan and heat over low heat. Do not let the sauce get too hot or the butter will separate. Just heat enough to meld flavors (approx 30-45 seconds). Place chicken on a plate and spoon the lemon butter, sundried tomatoes, and basil sauce on top of the chicken. Be sure to cover the goat cheese. The best way to do this is to make the lemon butter sauce first and hold it on low heat (120 degrees F) while cooking the rest of the recipe. Lemon Butter Sauce: In a saute pan place 1 Tbsp. butter, saute onions and garlic until softened. Add white wine and lemon juice; simmer approximately 2-3 minutes on medium-low heat to reduce by 90%. Let cool slightly. A little at a time, add remaining butter, stirring constantly, until butter melts and mixture emulsifies. Do not let the butter get too hot or it will separate. Season to taste.
