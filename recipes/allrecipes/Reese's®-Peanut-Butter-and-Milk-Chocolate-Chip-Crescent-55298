Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Stir together chips and nuts in small bowl. Unroll dough to form 8 triangles. Lightly sprinkle 1 heaping tablespoon chip mixture on top of each; gently press into dough. Starting at shortest side of triangle, roll dough to opposite point. Place rolls, point side down, on ungreased cookie sheet; curve into crescent shape. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown.
