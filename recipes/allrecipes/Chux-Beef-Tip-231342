Heat olive oil in a large skillet over high heat; cook and stir onion in hot oil until browned, about 15 minutes. Add beef, garlic, ground black pepper, and cracked pepper to the hot oil; cook until stew meat is browned and garlic is golden, about 10 more minutes. Pour water, red wine, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce into a slow cooker and stir brown gravy mix and kosher salt into wine mixture until gravy mix dissolves; add beef mixture to slow cooker and stir to combine. Cook on High until mixture nearly comes to a boil, about 1 hour; reduce heat to Low and cook until beef is tender and sauce has thickened, 1 more hour.
