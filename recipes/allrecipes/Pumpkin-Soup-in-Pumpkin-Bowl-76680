Cut the tops off of the 6 small pumpkins and set the tops aside. Hollow out the pumpkins, taking care not to puncture the skin. Slice a very small amount off the bottom of each pumpkin, so they won't tip. If you do not want to serve the soup in pumpkins, skip this step; soup bowls are fine. Heat the CRISCO(R) Pure Canola Oil over medium heat in a large saucepan. Add the garlic, onion, and celery, and cook until tender. Add the broth, pumpkin, ginger, and nutmeg and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for about 20 minutes. Allow to cool. Season with salt and pepper to taste. In a food processor or blender, puree the soup until smooth. Return to the pot and add the apple juice and simmer for about 2-3 minutes. Place each pumpkin on a serving plate and fill about 3/4 to the top of each. Garnish with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of chives. Place the tops on the pumpkins and enjoy!
