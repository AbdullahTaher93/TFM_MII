Wash the lettuce and dry the leaves well. Tear into 1 to 2 inch pieces, and transfer to a salad bowl. Using a food processor puree or pulverize the garlic. Add the lemon juice, mustard, anchovies, oil, liquid egg, pepper, parmesan cheese, and vinegar and mix well. Just before serving, toss the romaine lettuce with the dressing and top with croutons.
