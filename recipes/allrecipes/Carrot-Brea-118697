Coat an 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray and dust with flour; set aside. In a bowl, combine the sugar, flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. In another bowl, combine the applesauce, egg substitute and vanilla; stir into dry ingredients until just moistened. Fold in carrots and walnuts. Pour into prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-55 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
