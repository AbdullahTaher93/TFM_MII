In a small bowl, cut butter and cheese spread into flour until well blended. Add water and toss with a fork until a ball forms. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Press tablespoonfuls onto the bottom and up the sides of greased miniature muffin cups. In a bowl, beat the egg, milk and salt. Stir in ham and cheese. Spoon a rounded teaspoonful into each shell. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
