Put frozen broccoli in a microwave-safe bowl; cook in microwave until hot, about 4 minutes. Transfer broccoli to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir chicken in hot oil until no longer pink in the middle, 5 to 7 minutes. Top broccoli with chicken pieces evenly. Stir chicken soup, mayonnaise, sherry, and lemon juice together in a bowl until smooth; pour over the chicken and broccoli. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Mix bread crumbs, Cheddar cheese, and melted butter together in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly over the dish. Continue baking until the topping is browned, about 10 minutes. Serve over rice.
