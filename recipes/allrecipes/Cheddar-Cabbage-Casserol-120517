Toss the cornflakes and butter; sprinkle half into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Layer with the cabbage, onion, salt and pepper. In a bowl, combine the soup, milk and mayonnaise until smooth. Spoon over top; sprinkle with cheese and remaining cornflake mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until golden brown.
