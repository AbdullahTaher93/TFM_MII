In a skillet, cook sausage and onion until sausage is no longer pink and onion is tender; drain. Stir in beans, chili powder and cumin. Stuff into manicotti shells; place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Combine tomato sauce and chilies if desired; pour over manicotti. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes or until heated through.
