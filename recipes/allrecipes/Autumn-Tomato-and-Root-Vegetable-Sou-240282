Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir yellow onion, leeks, sweet potato, beet, and garlic in hot oil until the onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour tomatoes and water into the pot; add spinach and stir. Season soup with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer soup until the vegetables are soft, about 35 minutes. Blend soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Stir garbanzo beans into the soup; cook until beans are heated, about 5 minutes.
