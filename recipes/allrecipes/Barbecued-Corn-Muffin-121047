In a skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain and place in a bowl. Add brown sugar, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Prepare corn bread mix according to package directions. Fill greased muffin cups with a scant 2 tablespoons of batter. Top each with 2 tablespoons beef mixture; sprinkle with cheese. Top with remaining corn bread mix. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.
