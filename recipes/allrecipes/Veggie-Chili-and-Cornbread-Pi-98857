Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Spoon chili into a greased 9-inch pie plate. Cover with vented plastic wrap and microwave for 2-1/2 to 3 minutes or until hot in the center. Meanwhile, make cornbread as package directs. Spoon cornbread mixture over chili, spreading to edges. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden and the tip of a sharp knife inserted in the center comes out clean. If desired, top with cheese the last 10 minutes of baking.
