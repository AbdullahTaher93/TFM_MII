Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Toast pine nuts in a shallow baking pan, stirring occasionally until golden brown, about 7 minutes. Cool and chop finely. Combine nuts, red pepper, parsley, basil and mint in a medium bowl. Crumble feta in small pieces, add to nuts. Whisk garlic, salt, pepper, and yogurt in a small bowl until well blended. Stir into the nut and feta mixture. Chill for one hour. Serve with crackers.
