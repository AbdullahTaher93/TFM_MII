Bring chicken broth to a boil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven. Gradually add polenta, stirring constantly with a long-handled wooden spoon. Reduce heat to simmer; cook 15 minutes or until polenta is thickened and pulls away from sides of pan, stirring constantly. Pour polenta into a greased 15 1/2 x 10 1/2 x 1-inch jellyroll pan; spread evenly. Let stand 1 hour or until cool and firm. Cut into approximately 3-inch squares. Saute onion in oil in a large skillet until tender. Add eggplant, mushrooms, zucchini, and red pepper; cook over medium heat 20 minutes or until vegetables are soft and liquid is evaporated, stirring frequently. Stir in chili. Arrange half of polenta squares in bottom of a greased 13 x 9-inch baking pan. Spoon half of vegetable mixture over polenta squares, spreading to edges of pan. Sprinkle with half of cheese. Repeat layers. Bake at 400 degrees F 20 to 25 minutes or until cheese melts. Let stand 10 minutes before cutting.
