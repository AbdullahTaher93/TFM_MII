In a large skillet on high heat, warm the oil until hot and add the shallots. Cook until golden. Add the mushrooms, top side down, and cook them for 5 minutes. Turn them over and add the butter, thyme, wine, and salt and pepper to taste. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes.
