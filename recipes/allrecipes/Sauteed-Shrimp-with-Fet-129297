Put the ginger in a garlic press and squeeze the ginger juice into a small bowl. Stir in the soy sauce. Add the cubes of feta and gently toss to coat. Set aside to marinate while you cook the rice. Heat 1/2 tablespoon of the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the long-grain rice and stir-fry until the rice is translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Slowly pour in the vegetable stock, still stirring, then cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid. Leave to simmer over low heat for 12 to 15 minutes or until the stock is absorbed and the rice is tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a saute pan or large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the scallions and mushrooms, and saute 1 minute. Add the sugar-snap peas and shrimp and saute stirring frequently, until the shrimp are pink and cooked through and all the vegetables are tender-crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the feta cheese with its marinade and cook slowly just to heat through, turning the cheese carefully to prevent it from breaking up too much, about 30 seconds. Sprinkle the chopped cilantro and parsley and the sesame seeds on top, and season with pepper to taste. Toss gently to mix. Spoon the shrimp and feta saute onto warm plates and garnish with sprigs of fresh cilantro. Fluff up the rice with a fork and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with the shrimp and feta.
