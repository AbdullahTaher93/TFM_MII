Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge tofu slices in flour and place in hot butter. Brown slightly, then turn over and brown the other side. Add water, wine and bouillon cubes; simmer for 10 minutes, or until bouillon completely dissolves. Stir in mustard and honey. Simmer until thickened.
