Preheat grill to medium-high. Toss the red pepper, tomatoes and onions in 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 teaspoons of Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM) and place on grill for 10 - 12 minutes or until red peppers, tomatoes and onions are charred and softened, (the onions may take a little longer than the tomatoes). Turn once or twice for even grilling. Allow red peppers, tomatoes and onions to cool to room temperature and chop coarsely. Gently mix together the red pepper, tomato and onions, garlic, goat's cheese, balsamic vinegar and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Season to taste with 1/2 teaspoon of Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM) and let sit for half an hour at room temperature. Slice the French bread, on an angle into 10-12 1-inch thick slices and brush with olive oil. Toast both sides of the sliced French bread, lightly on the grill. Transfer bread to a baking sheet. Generously spoon the roasted pepper and goat's cheese bruschetta mixture evenly over the slices of toasted bread. Place the tray on the grill and close the lid, allowing the bruschetta to warm and the cheese to soften for 3 - 5 minutes. Remove from grill, top with chopped fresh basil and serve.
