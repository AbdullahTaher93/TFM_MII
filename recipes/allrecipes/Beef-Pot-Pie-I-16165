Place potatoes and carrots in a medium saucepan and fill with water to cover. Cover and cook over medium high heat until almost done (about 10 to 15 minutes). Drain and let cool for a few minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl combine the potatoes, carrots, onion, beef, gravy, bouillon and seasoning. Season with salt and pepper to taste and mix all together. In a large bowl combine the baking mix, milk and egg and mix together until smooth. Pour beef mixture into an ungreased 9 inch deep dish pie plate. Pour pastry dough on top. Bake in preheated oven 25 to 30 minutes, until crust is golden.
