In a small saucepan, melt the marshmallows with the butter over low heat. Add the rice cereal and stir to coat; let cool slightly. Cut the cherry twists to the length of the fruit roll-ups. Unroll the fruit roll-ups and peel off the plastic film. Place half of the rice cereal mixture on the edge of each roll-up. Place the twists in the center of the rice mixture and roll up the candy sushi. Cut into 2-inch pieces.
