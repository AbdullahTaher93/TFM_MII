Pour vinegar over ham; sprinkle with cloves. Cover with lid or aluminum foil. BAKE at 325 degrees for 4 hours or until meat thermometer registers 140 degrees. Remove from oven, and cool slightly. Slice ham, and serve with hot biscuits. QUICK BUTTERMILK BISCUITS: CUT 1/2 cup butter into flour with a pastry blender until crumbly; add buttermilk, stirring just until dry ingredients are moistened.

BAKE at 425 degrees for 13 to 15 minutes. Brush biscuits with melted butter.
