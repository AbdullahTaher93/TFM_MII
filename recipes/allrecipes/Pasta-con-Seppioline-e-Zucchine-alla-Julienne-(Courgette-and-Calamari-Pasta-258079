Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orecchiette in the boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, 3 to 6 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking water. Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook shallot in the hot oil until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in squid; cook until coated with oil, about 2 minutes. Pour in wine; simmer until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Stir tomatoes and zucchini into the saucepan; season with salt. Cook until softened slightly, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir orecchiette into the saucepan. Cook until coated with tomato and zucchini mixture, adding reserved cooking water a little at a time to make a moist sauce, 2 to 3 minutes. Garnish with parsley and black pepper.
