Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Arrange fig halves, cut sides up, on a baking sheet. Top each fig half with goat cheese; lay prosciutto strips atop goat cheese layer. Broil figs in the preheated oven until prosciutto is crisp and goat cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the warm figs to a serving platter and drizzle with honey.
