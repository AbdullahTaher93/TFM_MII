Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Mix rice and 3 cups of the water; spoon evenly onto center of each of six large sheets of heavy-duty foil. Top each with one chicken breast and 1/2 cup of the vegetables. Drizzle evenly with combined peanut butter, barbecue sauce, soy sauce and remaining 1/4 cup water. Bring up foil sides. Double fold top and both ends to seal each packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside. Place foil packets in single layer in 15x10x1-inch baking pan. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until chicken is cooked through (170 degrees F). Remove packets from oven; let stand 5 minutes. Place one packet on each of six dinner plates. Cut slits in foil with sharp knife to release steam before opening.
