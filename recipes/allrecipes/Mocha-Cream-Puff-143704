Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Grease a baking sheet; set aside. Combine water and butter in a medium saucepan. Bring to boiling. Add flour all at once, stirring vigorously. Cook and stir until mixture forms a ball that doesn't separate. Remove from heat. Cool for 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition with a wooden spoon until mixture is smooth. Using a rounded measuring tablespoon, drop mixture in eight mounds 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in a 400 degree F oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from oven. Cool completely on a wire rack. Split puffs and remove any soft dough from inside. Meanwhile, for filling, prepare pudding mix according to package directions, using the 1 1/2 cups LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk and adding the espresso powder or coffee crystals. Cover surface with plastic wrap. Refrigerate the filling until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour. To serve, spoon about 3 tablespoons of filling into the bottom half of each cream puff. Top with strawberries. Replace cream puff tops. If desired, sprinkle with powdered sugar.
