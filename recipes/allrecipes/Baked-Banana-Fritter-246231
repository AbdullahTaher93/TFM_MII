Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine bread crumbs, coconut, sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Beat egg white in a small bowl until frothy. Dip each banana piece in egg white and press into bread crumb mixture. Place the breaded bananas on prepared baking sheet; do not stack. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
