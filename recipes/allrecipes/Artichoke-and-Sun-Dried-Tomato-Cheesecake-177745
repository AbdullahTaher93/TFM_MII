Bake, cool and remove the 'tops' of the pastry shells according to the package directions. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Stir the remaining ingredients in a medium bowl. Spoon 1 teaspoon of the artichoke mixture into each pastry shell. Place the filled shells onto a baking sheet. Bake for 5 minutes or until the filling is hot.
