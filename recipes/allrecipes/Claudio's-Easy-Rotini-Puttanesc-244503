Pour whole box of pasta into a large skillet (approximately 12 inches in diameter). Pour 3 cups of cold water into the pan, ensuring that the water covers the pasta. Turn the burner to high, then set your timer for 10 minutes (optional: add a bit of salt to taste). Cook on high, stirring occasionally, until 1/2 of the liquid has evaporated. Add garlic and chili flakes, stir to combine. Continue to cook on high. With about 1 minute left add the sauce, olives and capers, season with salt and pepper. Remove the skillet from heat and top with parsley. Serve immediately.
