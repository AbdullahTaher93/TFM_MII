In a saucepan, saute garlic in oil until tender. In a blender or food processor, process garlic and tomatoes in batches until smooth. Return all to the pan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low. Add cream and heat through. Follow directions to cut bat wings from bread.(To make bat wings, remove crusts from bread. Flatten with a rolling pin. Using a kitchen shears, cut each slice in half diagonally, cutting wavy lines to resemble bat wings.) Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Spread with butter; sprinkle with Italian seasoning. Bake at 400 degrees F for 5-8 minutes or until golden brown, turning once. Add two wings to each bowl of soup. Serve immediately.
