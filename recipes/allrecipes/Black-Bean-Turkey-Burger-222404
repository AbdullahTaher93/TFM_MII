Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Mix black beans, ground turkey, Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, egg, and onion soup mix with your hands in a large bowl. Divide into 6 portions and shape into patties. Cook on preheated grill until no longer pink in the middle, 5 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
