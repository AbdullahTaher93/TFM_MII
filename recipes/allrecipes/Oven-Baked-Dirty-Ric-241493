Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Mix ground beef, rice, French onion soup, cream of mushroom soup, and Cajun seasoning together in a casserole dish. Bake dish in preheated oven until the rice is tender, about 1 hour.
