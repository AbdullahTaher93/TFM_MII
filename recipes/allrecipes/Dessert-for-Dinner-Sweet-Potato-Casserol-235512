Place sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and immediately peel sweet potatoes; transfer to a large bowl and mash. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir white sugar, 1/2 cup melted butter, milk, eggs, and vanilla extract into mashed sweet potatoes; pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix pecans, brown sugar, 1/2 cup melted butter, and flour together in a bowl. Sprinkle pecan mixture over sweet potato mixture. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 25 to 35 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and continue baking until pecans are lightly browned, about 5 more minutes.
