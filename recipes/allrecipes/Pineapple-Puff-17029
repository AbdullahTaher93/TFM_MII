Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg; beat well. Stir in the crushed pineapple and its juice. In a large mixing bowl, mix together the flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder and cinnamon. Add this mixture to the pineapple mixture; stir well. Scoop batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes in the pans before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
