Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Slice squash in half lengthwise. Scrape out seeds and discard. Slice a little off bottoms so squash rest flat, cut side up. In a skillet, heat butter and oil over medium heat. Cook onion and garlic until soft. Add squash blossoms, if using; saute 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl and cool slightly. Stir in ricotta, 1/4 cup of Parmesan, 2 tablespoons bread crumbs, egg, marjoram, salt, and pepper until blended. Spoon into squash shells. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan and bread crumbs over tops. Bake 25 minutes, until sides are tender; broil 3 minutes, until tops are golden. Serve hot.
