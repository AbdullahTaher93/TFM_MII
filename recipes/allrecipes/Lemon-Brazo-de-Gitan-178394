Prepare Lemon Filling: Whip heavy cream in the bowl of an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Add SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and continue to whip until stiff peaks form. Mix pudding cups, lemon juice and zest together in a separate bowl. Gently fold pudding mixture into whipped cream. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Prepare Cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a jelly roll pan with parchment paper and spray with nonstick cooking spray that has added flour. Beat eggs, SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, and salt on high speed until mixture is light and fluffy and has doubled in size. Reduce speed to low and fold in lemon zest and flour. Pour batter onto prepared pan, spreading evenly over entire surface. Bake cake 15 minutes or until light golden brown. Place clean dish towel on work surface and dust with powdered sugar. Run a knife around the edge of the cake to loosen. Flip warm cake over onto the dish towel. Remove pan and parchment paper. Roll cake and cool to room temperature. Unroll cake and spread filling over cake surface. Roll again. Chill until ready to serve or cut and serve immediately.
