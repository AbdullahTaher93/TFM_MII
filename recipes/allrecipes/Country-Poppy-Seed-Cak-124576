In a large mixing bowl, combine poppy seeds, pudding and cake mix. Add oil, eggs, water and almond extract. Blend with an electric mixer on low speed until dry ingredients are moistened. Increase speed to medium and mix for 2 minutes. Combine sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle into a greased fluted tube pan. Pour batter into pan and bake at 325 degrees F for about 1 hour or until cake tests done. Allow cake to cool 10 minutes before removing to a cooling rack. Combine glaze ingredients and drizzle over cooled cake.
