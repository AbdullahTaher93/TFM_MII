Place 1 wafer on bottom of each of 12 paper-lined medium muffin cups; set aside. Beat cream cheese and sugar in large bowl with wire whisk or electric mixer until well blended. Add 2-1/4 cups of the whipped topping; mix well. Spoon evenly into muffin cups. Refrigerate 3 hours or overnight. Spread tops with remaining whipped topping. Sprinkle with coconut just before serving. Store leftover cheesecakes in refrigerator.
