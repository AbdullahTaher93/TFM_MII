Heat canola oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir jalapeno peppers, ginger, and garlic in the hot oil until the garlic is soft and the oil is fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir yogurt, chili powder, turmeric, coriander, cumin, garam masala, and salt together in a Dutch oven; warm gently over low heat. Fold oil mixture into the yogurt mixture, remove from heat, and top with cilantro.
