In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. In a large bowl, combine yeast mixture, butter, remaining white sugar, egg, whole wheat flour and salt; beat well. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. Cover dough and refrigerate for at least two hours and up to one week. Break off small even pieces of dough, form into rounds and place in greased muffin tins. Let dough rise until nearly doubled, about 90 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden.
