Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Mix ground beef, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, celery salt, chipotle chile powder, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl with your hands. Stir breadcrumbs, egg, ketchup, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce into meat mixture until thoroughly combined; form into a loaf shape. Spread barbeque sauce out into the bottom of a loaf pan; place meatloaf on top of barbeque sauce and press into pan. Bake meatloaf in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour, 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Drain the fat from the loaf pan and invert pan over a plate to transfer meatloaf. Let rest for 5 minutes before slicing.
