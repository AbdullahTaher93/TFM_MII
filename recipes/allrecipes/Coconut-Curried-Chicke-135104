In a 2-quart, microwavable dish, stir the chicken with the oil until it's good and greasy. Stir in the curry powder, garlic, onion, ginger, and cayenne pepper. Nuke for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring a few times, until the spices are fragrant and the chicken is almost cooked through. Move the chicken to the sides of the dish and mix the coconut milk and tomato paste in the middle. Mix thoroughly with the chicken and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Heat for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring a few times, until the sauce thickens slightly. Stir in the salt and serve.
