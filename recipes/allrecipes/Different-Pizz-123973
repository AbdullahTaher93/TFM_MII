For topping, lightly brown ground beef and onion in a skillet; drain well. Stir in Worcestershire sauce, marjoram, oregano, sage, pepper and soup. Stir until well blended; set aside. For crust, combine flour, salt, and baking powder in a mixing bowl; cut in shortening. Add milk and stir until combined (mixture resembles a soft biscuit dough). Pat dough into a lightly greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Spread beef mixture over crust. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Bake at 400 degrees F for 25 to 30 minutes or until lightly browned.
