Place steak in nonmetal dish or resealable plastic bag; set aside. Beat dressing and steak sauce with wire whisk until well blended. Pour 1/2 cup of the steak sauce mixture over steak; toss to coat. Cover. Refrigerate 30 min. to marinate, turning occasionally. Reserve remaining steak sauce mixture for later use. Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Remove steak from marinade; discard marinade. Grill steak 6 min. on each side or until medium doneness (160 degrees F). Heat reserved dressing mixture just until warmed. Meanwhile, cover large serving platter with the lettuce; top with the tomatoes and cucumbers. Cut steak into thin slices; arrange over salad. Drizzle with the warm dressing mixture just before serving; sprinkle with the cheese.
