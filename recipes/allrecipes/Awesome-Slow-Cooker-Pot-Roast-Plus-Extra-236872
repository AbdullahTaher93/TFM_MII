Stir cream of mushroom soup, water, and dry onion soup mix together in a slow cooker. Set pot roast into the soup mixture and spoon liquid over the meat. Add potatoes, carrots, yellow squash, and zucchini. Cook on High until the beef is cooked through, 3 to 4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). You can also cook on Low for 5 to 6 hours.
