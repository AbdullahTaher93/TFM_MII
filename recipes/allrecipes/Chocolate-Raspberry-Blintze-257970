Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix cream cheese, chocolate-hazelnut spread, berry cream cheese, milk, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Pour melted butter into a shallow bowl. Combine sugar and cinnamon in a separate shallow bowl. Flatten bread slices out on a work surface. Spread cream cheese mixture over each slice. Roll up each slice. Dip rolls in melted butter; coat with cinnamon sugar. Arrange seam-side down in a baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, 15 to 20 minutes.
