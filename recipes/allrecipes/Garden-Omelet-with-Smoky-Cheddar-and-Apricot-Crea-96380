In small bowl, combine sour cream and apricot preserves. In medium bowl, lightly beat eggs and water; season with salt and pepper. In 10-inch nonstick skillet, heat 1 teaspoon oil over high heat; add remaining filling ingredients. Cook and stir 3 to 5 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender and turkey sausage is browned; remove from skillet. Heat same skillet over high heat until very hot; add 1 tablespoon oil. Working quickly, add egg mixture all at once to skillet. Using a heat-proof rubber spatula or large spoon, scrape the egg mixture from the outside of the pan to the center, tilting the pan continuously to allow the uncooked egg mixture to flow underneath. When the surface of the omelet is still shiny, sprinkle with 1/2 cup cheese. Remove from heat. Spoon turkey sausage and vegetable mixture over half the omelet; fold the other half over. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon cheese and chives. Serve with apricot cream.
