Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. Place one eggplant half and one tomato half on each sheet of aluminum foil. Sprinkle with garlic salt and black pepper. Drizzle with the olive oil. Fold the foil up to form packets. Grill the packets until the eggplant and tomato are very tender, about 15 minutes.
