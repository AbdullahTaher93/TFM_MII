Place 1 tsp. each of blackened seasoning, lemon pepper, garlic powder, gumbo file, cayenne pepper and Cajun gumbo seasoning mix in a bowl; mix. Season the tilapia by rubbing the seasoning mixture on both sides of the fillets. Melt 1 stick of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place tilapia in the pan; cook first side. Continue to monitor this pan and turn fish once first side is browned. Meanwhile, melt remaining stick of butter in second large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chopped garlic, green onions, mushrooms, cream of celery soup, cream cheese and heavy cream; stir gently to ensure a well-blended sauce. Once fish is browned on both sides, lower the heat on the pan to keep the fish warm, but not overcooked. To the cream cheese sauce, add 1 tsp. each of blackened seasoning, cayenne pepper, gumbo seasoning mix and parsley; mix well. Add the shrimp, stirring until the shrimp turns bright pink. Add mozzarella; stir until sauce is well blended. Place tilapia on a serving platter. Top the tilapia with the creamy sauce. Place 2 tsp. of parsley flakes across the dish for garnish. Enjoy!
