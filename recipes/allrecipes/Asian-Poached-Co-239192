Arrange cod into the bottom of a saucepan. Mix water, soy sauce, green onions, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, and Chinese five-spice powder together in a bowl; pour over the cod. Place saucepan over high heat and bring liquid to a boil; reduce heat to low and cook at a simmer until cod flakes easily with a fork, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove cod from liquid with a slotted spoon.
