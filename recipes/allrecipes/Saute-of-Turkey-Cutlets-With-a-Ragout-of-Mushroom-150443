Combine flour, salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Dredge turkey cutlets in the flour mixture, shaking off excess. Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Saute half of the turkey cutlets until golden brown on the outside and no longer pink inside, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining turkey and oil. Place butter in the pan and reduce the heat to medium. Add shallots and saute until softened but not browned, about 1 minute. Add mushrooms and saute until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour in broth and bring to a boil. Dissolve arrowroot or cornstarch in water in a small bowl. Add to the mushroom mixture and cook, stirring, until slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Stir in chopped or dried tarragon. Taste and adjust seasonings. Spoon the mushroom sauce over the turkey cutlets, garnish with tarragon sprigs and serve immediately.
