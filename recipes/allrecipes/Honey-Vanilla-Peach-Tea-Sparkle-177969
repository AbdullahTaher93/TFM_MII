In a 1- to 1 1/2-quart pan, combine the tea concentrate, vanilla bean, and honey; heat to boiling. Cover and chill until cold, 1 hour or up to 2 days. Remove the vanilla bean and reserve for other uses. Combine the concentrate mixture with the nectar and sparkling water. Pour into tall, ice-filled glasses.
