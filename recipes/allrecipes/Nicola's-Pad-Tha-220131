Soak uncooked noodles in 8 cups of water until soft, 8 hours or overnight. Drain rice noodles and set aside. Whisk together vegetable broth, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, brown sugar, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, peanut butter, 1 teaspoon fresh cilantro, onion powder, tamarind paste, hot chile paste, garlic powder, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, ground coriander, ground ginger, salt, and ground black pepper in a saucepan. Heat sauce over medium heat until it bubbles; reduce heat to low, and simmer sauce while you prepare the remaining ingredients. Heat 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large wok over medium heat. Cook and stir broccoli, carrots, snow peas, water chestnuts, baby corn, mushrooms, and zucchini in the wok until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the drained noodles and 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to vegetables. Cook and stir until noodles are heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the wok from heat and pour the sauce over vegetables and rice noodles. Toss to fully coat the vegetables and rice noodles with sauce. Garnish with peanuts, 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro, and paprika.
