Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Reduce heat to low, and stir in flour to form a thick paste. Gradually blend in milk, stirring constantly, and bring to a low boil for approximately 1 minute. Reduce heat, and stir in mustard, processed American cheese, salt and pepper. Continue stirring until cheese is melted. Place 1/2 the beans in a medium baking dish. Layer with 1/2 the processed cheese mixture and remaining beans. Top with remaining processed cheese mixture. Melt remaining butter in a small saucepan, and mix in bread crumbs. Top the bean and processed cheese layers with the bread crumb mixture. Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, until lightly brown.
