Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2 quart casserole dish. Arrange half of the tomato slices in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle half of the sliced onion, and half of the shredded cheese, then half of the crushed potato chips. Repeat layers. Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until top is golden and crispy.
