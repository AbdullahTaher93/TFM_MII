Coat 12 muffin cups with nonstick spray. Set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the flours, cinnamon, baking powder, and baking soda. In a large bowl, beat the buttermilk, bran, brown sugar, oil, and egg. Stir flour mixture into the buttermilk mixture until just combined. Fold in the apples. Spoon the batter into the muffin cups. Bake at 400F (200C) until done, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cook for 5 minutes, remove from pan and cool on a wire rack.
