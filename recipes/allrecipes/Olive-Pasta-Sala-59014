Place the eggs in a saucepan with enough cold water to cover. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove saucepan from heat. Cover, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel, and chop. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. In a large bowl, mix the olives, mayonnaise, celery seed, pepper, and salad seasoning. Toss in the eggs and macaroni. Cover, and chill at least 3 hours in the refrigerator before serving.
