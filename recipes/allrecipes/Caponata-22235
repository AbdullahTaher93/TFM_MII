Heat oil in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook onion and garlic in oil about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until onion is tender. Stir in eggplant and tomato. Cook uncovered 8 to 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until eggplant is very tender. Stir in remaining ingredients. Cover and refrigerate about 2 hours or until cool. Garnish with fresh oregano if desired.
