Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Toss bread cubes, 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons olive oil, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Spread onto a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake in the preheated oven, tossing once halfway through baking, until golden, about 8 minutes. Let cool. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees (175 degrees C). Spread walnuts onto a baking sheet. Toast walnuts in the preheated oven until golden brown and fragrant, 10 to 15 minutes. Whisk lime juice, honey, Dijon mustard, 1/2 teaspoon salt, cumin, and pepper together in a bowl. Pour in 1/2 cup olive oil, whisking continuously, until dressing is blended. Combine bread cubes, watermelon, spinach-arugula mix, and feta cheese in a large bowl. Add a few tablespoons of dressing; toss to mix. Sprinkle toasted walnuts and basil on top. Drizzle more dressing over the top.
