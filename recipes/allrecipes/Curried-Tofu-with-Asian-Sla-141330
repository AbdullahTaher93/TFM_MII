Prepare marinade. In small bowl, combine coconut milk, curry powder, garlic, and soy sauce. Place tofu in wide bowl, add marinade, and turn each piece to coat. Marinate at least 1/2 hour and up to 4 (cover and chill in refrigerator if more than 2 hours). Preheat broiler. Arrange tofu slices in single layer on foil-lined baking sheet. Coat lightly with cooking spray and broil 4 minutes. Gently turn tofu, coat lightly with spray, and broil 4 minutes longer or until golden brown. Remove from broiler and cool slightly. Make dressing. In medium bowl, whisk together vinegar, peanut butter, soy sauce, lime juice, honey, garlic, and curry paste. Assemble salad. In large bowl, combine cabbage, peppers, carrots, scallions, tofu, and half of the cilantro. Add dressing and toss well to coat. Divide among 4 bowls and top with remaining cilantro.
