Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine together in a baking dish: beef cubes, pork cubes, tomato soup, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, onion and water. Bake in a preheated oven for 4 hours. Add more water if liquid evaporates. When done, remove from oven and shred with a wooden fork or a potato masher.
