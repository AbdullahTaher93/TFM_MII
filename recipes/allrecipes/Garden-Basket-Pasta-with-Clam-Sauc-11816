Drain clams, reserving 1 cup clam juice; set clams aside. Heat oil in large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add minced onion, carrot, and garlic; saute 3 minutes; add reserved clam juice, tomatoes, bell pepper, salt, red/black pepper and bring to boil. Reduce, heat and simmer 20 minutes or until slightly thickened. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Remove sauce from heat, stir in clams, parsley, and basil. Pour over pasta and gently toss.
