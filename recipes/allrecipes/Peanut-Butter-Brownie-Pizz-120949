Prepare brownie batter according to package directions and spread into a greased 12-in. pizza pan. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool completely on a wire rack. In a mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, peanut butter and sugar until smooth. Spread over crust. Toss bananas with juice; drain well. Arrange bananas over cream cheese mixture. Sprinkle with peanuts. In a microwave, melt chocolate and butter. Drizzle over bananas. Refrigerate until chocolate is set.
