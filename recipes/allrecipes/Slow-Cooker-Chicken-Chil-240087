Lightly grease the crock of your slow cooker with vegetable oil. Put chicken breasts into the bottom of the slow cooker crock; add chicken broth, black beans, cannellini beans, diced tomatoes, yellow onion, chili powder, garlic, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, hot sauce, salt, and black pepper. Cook on Low for 6 hours (or on High for 3 hours). Remove chicken breasts from the crock to a cutting board. Shred chicken into strands with a pair of forks and return it to the mixture in the crock; add sour cream and stir. Continue cooking on Low for 30 minutes more.
