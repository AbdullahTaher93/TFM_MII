Combine flour, salt, and baking powder. Stir in 1 1/2 cups lukewarm water. Knead until soft but not sticky. Shape dough into balls about 3 inches in diameter. Flatten into patties 1/2 inch thick, and make a small hole in the center of each patty. Fry one at a time in 1 inch of hot shortening, turning to brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels.
