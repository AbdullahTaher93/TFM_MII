Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with the olive oil. Brush potato wedges with butter, and roll in bread crumbs. Place wedges on prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and turn wedges; cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until tender.
