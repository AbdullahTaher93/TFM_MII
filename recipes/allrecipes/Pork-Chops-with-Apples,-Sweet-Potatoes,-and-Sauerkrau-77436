Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and coat with cooking spray. Quickly brown the pork chops on each side. Set aside. Arrange sweet potato slices in the bottom of a 3 to 4 quart slow cooker. Cover with the onion slices, then the apple slices. Sprinkle brown sugar, nutmeg and salt over the apples, and grind a little pepper. Place the pork chops on top of the pile, and cover with sauerkraut. Cover, and cook on Low for about 5 hours. It can go an extra hour without drying out though. Serve pork and vegetables with juice from the slow cooker spooned over them.
