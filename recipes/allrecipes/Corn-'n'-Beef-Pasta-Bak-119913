In a large skillet, cook the beef, onion, green pepper and garlic over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the corn, tomatoes, pasta, buttermilk, cream cheese, chili powder, salt and pepper. Transfer to a greased 2-1/2-qt. baking dish; sprinkle with cheese. Cover and bake at 375 degrees F for 40 minutes. Uncover; bake 25-30 minutes longer or until the pasta is tender.
