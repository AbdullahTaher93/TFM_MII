Line 9-inch square baking pan with foil. Set aside 16 (1/4 cup) whole Shreddies. Place remaining Shreddies in a resealable plastic bag and crush by hand to yield 1-1/2 cups coarse crumbs. Combine crumbs with butter and salt. Press evenly into bottom of prepared pan. Bake at 325 degrees F for 10 min. Cool. Combine condensed milk, lime juice, lime rind and food colouring in large bowl. Gently fold in whipped topping. Pour over crust. Insert 16 Shreddies over top, forming rows of 4 x 4. Freeze at least 6 hrs. Before cutting, let stand 15 min. at room temperature. Holding ends of foil, lift from pan; cut into squares.
