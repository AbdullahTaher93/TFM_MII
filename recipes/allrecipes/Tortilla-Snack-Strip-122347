Brush butter over one side of each tortilla. Combine the seasonings; lightly sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon over each tortilla. Make two stacks of tortillas, with three in each stack. Using a serrated knife, cut each stack into nine thin strips. Place in an ungreased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake at 400 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Serve warm.
