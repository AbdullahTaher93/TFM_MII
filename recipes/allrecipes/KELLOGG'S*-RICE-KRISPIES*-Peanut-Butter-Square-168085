In large saucepan, combine sugar and corn syrup. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until sugar dissolves and mixture just begins to boil (or microwave at HIGH 3 minutes in large microwaveable bowl, stirring twice). Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla. Stir in peanut butter; mix well. Stir in cereal, mixing until well coated. Press evenly and firmly into buttered 3.5 L (13 x 9-inch) pan. Cut into bars.
