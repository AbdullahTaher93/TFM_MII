In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the flour and salt. Add pork chops, one at a time, and shake to coat. In a large skillet, brown chops in oil on both sides. Transfer to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Top with pineapple and green pepper; set aside. In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, cornstarch, broth, vinegar, ketchup and water until smooth. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Pour over chops. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Serve over rice.
