Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain on paper towels, and crumble into large pieces. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the rigatoni pasta and cook until al dente, about 13 minutes. Drain, and place pasta into a large bowl. Place olive oil in another skillet, and heat over medium-high heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Mix in the bacon, red pepper flakes, tomatoes, artichokes, olives, and capers. Cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add bacon-vegetable mixture to pasta, and toss until evenly mixed. Divide between two serving plates. Sprinkle with feta cheese, and garnish with parsley. Serve immediately.
