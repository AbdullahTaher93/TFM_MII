In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce and lemon peel until smooth. Dissolve bouillon and honey in boiling water; stir into the cornstarch mixture. Set aside. In a large nonstick skillet or wok, stir-fry turkey in 1 tablespoon hot oil until no longer pink; remove and keep warm. In the same pan, stir-fry the onions, celery and red pepper in remaining oil until crisp-tender. Return turkey to the pan. Stir bouillon mixture and pour over turkey mixture. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Add water chestnuts and peas; heat through. Stir in lemon juice and pepper. Serve over rice if desired.
