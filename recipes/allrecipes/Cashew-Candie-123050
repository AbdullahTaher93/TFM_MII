In a bowl, combine the first four ingredients; knead until smooth(mixture will be dry). Shape into eight rolls 5 in long x 1/2 in. in diameter (do not butter hands before shaping the mixture). Wrap in waxed paper and freeze until firm, about 2 hours. Place caramels in a shallow microwave-safe dish; microwave, uncovered, on high until melted. Add water; stir until smooth. Carefully dip the frozen rolls into the caramel mixture, then roll in cashews. Wrap in waxed paper and refrigerate 1 hour. Cut into 1/3-in. slices.
