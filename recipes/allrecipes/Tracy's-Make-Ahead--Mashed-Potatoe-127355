Place potatoes in a large saucepan; cover with water and bring to a boil on medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and cook 10 to 15 min. or until potatoes are tender; drain. Add cream cheese spread, sour cream and onion powder; beat with an electric hand mixer until creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon into a lightly greased 2-quart casserole dish; cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to use. Remove potatoes from refrigerator about 30 min. before baking. Remove plastic wrap. Bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour or until heated through. Sprinkle with bacon and onion.
