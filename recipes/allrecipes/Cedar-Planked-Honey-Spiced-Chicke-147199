Immerse planks in water, placing a weight on top of each plank to keep it submerged. Soak at least 4 hours or overnight. Preheat grill to medium heat. Remove planks from water; brush tops with oil. Place 2 chicken breasts on each plank. Place on grate of grill; cover with lid. Grill 30 minutes. Meanwhile, mix dressing, honey, mustard and seasonings until well blended. Remove 1/2 cup of the dressing mixture to serve with the cooked chicken. Brush chicken with some of remaining dressing mixture. Grill, covered, an additional 30 to 45 minutes or until chicken is cooked through (165 degrees F), brushing occasionally with the remaining dressing mixture. Remove chicken from grill; discard planks. Remove bones from chicken; cut each breast in half. Serve with the reserved dressing mixture.
