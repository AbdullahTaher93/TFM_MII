Place the quinoa in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water until the water runs clear. Bring the water to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Add the quinoa and salt and return to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until tender and the liquid is absorbed. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the chickpeas, tomato, garlic, lime juice, cilantro, oil, and cumin. Add the quinoa and toss to coat well.
