Toss the cabbage, red bell pepper, red onion, carrots, mango, and cilantro together in a large bowl. Whisk the yogurt, mayonnaise, mustard, cider vinegar, agave nectar, salt, pepper, and hot sauce together in a small bowl; pour over the cabbage mixture and toss to coat. Allow the slaw to marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to combine.
