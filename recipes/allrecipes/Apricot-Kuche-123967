Place apricots and water in a bowl; soak overnight. In a saucepan, combine apricots, soaking liquid, and sugar. Simmer until apricots are transparent. Cool; drain and set aside. Place flour in a mixing bowl; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Dissolve yeast in water; add to crumb mixture along with sugar, salt, eggs and cardamom. Beat until smooth (dough will be soft and sticky). Place dough in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, knead dough for 2 minutes. Divide into three portions; roll each in a 9-inch circle. Place each in a greased 9-inch round cake pan. Let rise until doubled, about 1 1/4 hours. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place apricots on top of dough. Combine cinnamon and sugar; sprinkle over apricots. Bake in preheated oven for 25-30 minutes. Cool on wire racks.
