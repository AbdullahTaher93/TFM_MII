In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, salt, and nutmeg. Dissolve the yeast in warm water. Stir the yeast mixture, milk, and eggs into the dry ingredients until just combined. Fold in the raisins. Cover and let rise for about 2 hours. Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). To prepare the glaze, mix the melted butter and 1 teaspoon warm water in a small bowl. Stir in the confectioners' sugar, cornstarch, cream, and vanilla. Drop the dough by rounded tablespoons into the hot oil. Cook 2 to 5 minutes, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and cool slightly. Dip each cookie into the glaze and set aside to completely cool.
