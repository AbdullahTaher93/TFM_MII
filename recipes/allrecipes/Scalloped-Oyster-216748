Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour the butter into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix the oysters, cream of mushroom soup, evaporated milk, crackers, and eggs together in the baking dish until well blended. Bake in the preheated oven until the center of the mixture is set and the edges are slightly browned, about 45 minutes.
