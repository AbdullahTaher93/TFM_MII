Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Cook the noodles in a large pot of boiling water according to the package directions. Drain. Lay the noodles flat on a work surface to prevent them from sticking together. Warm the oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or until softened. Transfer to a medium bowl. To the bowl, add the ricotta, spinach, egg whites, basil, Parmesan, pepper, nutmeg, and 1/4 cup (60 mL) of the mozzarella. Mix well. Spread 1/3 cup (80 mL) of the ricotta filling over the length of each noodle and roll up from one end. Spread one-half of the marinara sauce on the bottom of a 13 inch x 9 inch (32.5 x 32-cm) baking dish. Add the rolls, seam side down. Top with the remaining sauce and the remaining 1/2 cup (120 mL) mozzarella. Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 5 minutes.
