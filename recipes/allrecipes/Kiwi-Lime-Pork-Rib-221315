Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Blend kiwis, sugar, vinegar, lime juice, salt, chili powder, cornstarch, and garlic in a blender until thickened into a sauce. Place pork ribs on a baking sheet. Drizzle blended kiwi sauce over ribs. Loosely cover ribs with a sheet of aluminum foil. Cook in preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour.
