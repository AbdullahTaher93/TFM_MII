Mix honey, sriracha sauce, sriracha paste, onion, jalapeno pepper, soy sauce, cilantro, and lime juice together in a bowl. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Brush salmon fillets with olive oil; place skin-side up on the lined baking sheet. Broil salmon in the preheated oven until skin is crisp, about 5 minutes. Flip and spread honey mixture over salmon. Continue cooking until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 10 minutes more.
