Place dried fruit in a bowl and pour in tea; let soak for 2 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan with cooking spray and line with parchment paper. Beat flour, brown sugar, and egg into fruit mixture until batter is well mixed; pour into the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven on the center rack until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours.
