Spread chickpeas on paper towels; allow to air dry completely, about 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread chickpeas on prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 40 minutes, shaking pan every 10 minutes. Remove chickpeas from oven; toss with mixed spice and salt. Place chickpeas back into the oven; turn oven off until completely cold, about 2 hours or up to overnight.
