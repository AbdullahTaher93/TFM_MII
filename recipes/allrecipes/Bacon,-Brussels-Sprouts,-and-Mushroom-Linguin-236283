Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain pasta, reserving 1/2 cup pasta water. Return pasta to the pot and toss with olive oil to coat. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook and stir until bacon begins to crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain and discard 1/2 the bacon fat, leaving bacon in the skillet; stir in rosemary. Stir mushrooms, salt, and black pepper into bacon mixture. Add Brussels sprouts; cook and stir until mushrooms and sprouts are heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour reserved pasta water into bacon mixture; add linguine and Parmesan cheese and toss vegetables with pasta until thoroughly mixed and heated through, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
