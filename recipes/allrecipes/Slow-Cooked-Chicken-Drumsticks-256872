Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Grease a baking pan with cooking spray. Arrange chicken drumsticks on the baking pan. Sprinkle Cajun seasoning, poultry seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper over chicken. Sprinkle flour on top. Spray cooking spray over chicken. Cover baking pan with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until juices run clear, about 2 1/2 hours. Uncover and spread barbeque sauce evenly over chicken. Continue baking, uncovered, until chicken is tender and falling off the bone, about 30 minutes more.
