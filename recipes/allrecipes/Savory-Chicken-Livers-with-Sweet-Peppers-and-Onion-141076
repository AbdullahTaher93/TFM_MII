Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the green and red peppers, onion, and garlic. Cook and stir for 5 minutes until peppers and onions begin to soften. Add the liver to the pan, along with the sumac, allspice, and soy sauce. Cook and stir until the liver is cooked through, about 10 minutes.
