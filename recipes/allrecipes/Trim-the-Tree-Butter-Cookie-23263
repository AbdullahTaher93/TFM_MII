Combine all cookie ingredients in large bowl. Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until well mixed (3 to 4 minutes). Divide dough in half. Wrap in plastic food wrap; refrigerate until firm (1to 2 hours). Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface, one-half at a time (keeping remaining dough refrigerated), to 1/8 to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut with 2 to 3-inch cookie cutters. Place 1 inch apart onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 6 to 10 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Let stand 1 minute; remove from cookie sheets. Cool completely. Combine 4 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 cup butter and vanilla in small bowl. Beat at low speed, adding enough milk and scraping bowl often, for desired spreading consistency (1 to 2 minutes). Tint frosting with food color, if desired. Decorate cookies with frosting, sprinkles or candies, if desired.
