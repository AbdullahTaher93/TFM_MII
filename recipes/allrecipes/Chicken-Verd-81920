Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut the boneless, skinless chicken parts into bite sized pieces. In a non-stick frying pan, brown the chicken in batches and transfer to a lightly greased casserole dish (you don't need to cook the chicken completely through at this step). Arrange the chicken and frozen chopped broccoli into an even layer. (You can minimize this step by using pre-cooked or leftover chicken but then remember to reduce the cooking time to 20 minutes). Spread the green chile sauce evenly over the chicken. Top with shredded cheddar cheese and bake for 35 minutes uncovered.
