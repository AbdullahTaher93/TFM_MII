Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cook the beef in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until it's well browned, stirring often to break up meat. Pour off any fat. Stir the soup, water, Worcestershire and black pepper in the skillet and heat to a boil. Spoon the beef mixture into a 1 1/2-quart casserole. Arrange the biscuits around the inside edge of the casserole. Bake for 15 minutes or until the biscuits are golden brown. Sprinkle the cheese over the beef mixture.
