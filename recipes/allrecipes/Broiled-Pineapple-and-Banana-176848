Peel each banana and cut in half lengthwise, then crosswise, to make 4 pieces. You will have 12 pieces in all. Arrange banana and pineapple in a single layer in a baking dish. Sprinkle brown sugar over the top, dot with butter, and sprinkle with lemon juice. Broil about 8 inches from heat, basting several times, until fruit is glazed (5 to 7 minutes). While still hot, arrange 2 pieces of banana and 1 piece of pineapple in each of 6 dessert dishes. Top each with a dollop of sour cream; spoon some hot butter sauce over the sour cream.
