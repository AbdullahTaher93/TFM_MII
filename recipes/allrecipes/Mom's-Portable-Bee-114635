In a Dutch oven, combine the first 10 ingredients; add roast. Cover and bake at 325 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours or until meat is tender. Remove the roast and cool completely. Meanwhile, skim fat and strain cooking juices. Discard bay leaf. Thinly slice the beef. Serve on rolls with warmed juices and lettuce, tomato and onion if desired.
