Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Place baguette slices on a baking sheet. Mix cream cheese and semi-soft cheese together in a bowl. Combine black olives, green olives, red peppers, parsley, and garlic in a bowl to make the olive salad. Broil baguette slices until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Spread cheese mixture over baguette slices and top with the olive salad.
