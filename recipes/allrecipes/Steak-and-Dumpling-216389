Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; place the strips of steak into the hot oil. Sprinkle with garlic powder, salt, and black pepper to taste. Cook, stirring frequently, until the steak pieces are browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour in the beef broth, and use a spoon to scrape up and dissolve any browned flavor bits from the bottom of the skillet. Stir in onion and carrot; drop in the beef bouillon cubes. Bring the mixture to a simmer, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until steak strips are tender, at least 1 1/2 hours. Stir occasionally. About 10 minutes before serving time, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over medium heat. Mix together the flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, and baking powder in a bowl; stir in eggs and water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to make a thick batter. Drop tablespoon-sized blobs of batter into the boiling water, and stir; dumplings will sink at first, but then rise to the top. Let the dumplings simmer for about 4 minutes after they float to the surface of the water. With a slotted spoon, scoop out the dumplings into a serving bowl. Serve topped with the steak strips and gravy.
