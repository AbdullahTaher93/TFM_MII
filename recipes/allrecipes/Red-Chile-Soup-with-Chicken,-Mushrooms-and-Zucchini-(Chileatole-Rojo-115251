Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring regularly, until golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the onion and garlic to a food processor or blender. Add ground chile, masa harina, salt and 1 1/2 cups broth; process until smooth. Return the puree to the saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Add the remaining 2 1/2 cups broth, mushrooms, zucchini and parsley and return to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in chicken and continue to simmer until cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes more. Remove parsley and ladle into soup bowls. Serve with a wedge of lime.
