Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove excess fat from goose. Rub cavity of goose lightly with salt. Fasten neck skin of goose to back with skewer. Fold wings across back with tips touching. Tie drumsticks to tail. Prick skin all over with fork. Place goose, breast side up, on rack in shallow roasting pan. Insert meat thermometer so tip is in thigh muscle and does not touch bone. Roast uncovered 3 to 3 1/2 hours, removing excess fat from pan occasionally, until thermometer reads 180 degrees F or drumstick moves easily and juice is no longer pink. If necessary, place a tent of aluminum foil loosely over goose to prevent excessive browning. One hour and 15 minutes before goose is done, place potatoes in roasting pan around goose. Brush potatoes with goose fat; sprinkle with salt, pepper and paprika. When done, place goose and potatoes on heated platter. Cover and let stand 15 minutes for easier carving. Garnish with kumquats and parsley if desired.
