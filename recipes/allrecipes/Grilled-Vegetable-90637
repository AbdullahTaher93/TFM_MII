Rinse eggplant and peppers; pat dry. Trim and discard eggplant stem; cut eggplant crosswise into 1/2 inch thick slices. Peel onion and cut crosswise into 1/2 inch thick slices. Brush eggplant slices, whole peppers, and onion slices with about 1/4 cup olive oil total. Lay vegetables in a single layer on a barbecue grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning as needed to char all sides, 8 to 12 minutes total. Transfer vegetables to a bowl as they complete grilling. When all are cooked, let stand until cool, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix 1/2 cup olive oil with the vinegar, basil, and garlic. Peel, stem, and seed grilled peppers. Quarter lengthwise. In a deep bowl (at least 1 1/2 quart capacity), layer vegetables with herb marinade (using all the marinade); season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and let stand for at least 30 minutes or for up to 4 hours; or cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days.
