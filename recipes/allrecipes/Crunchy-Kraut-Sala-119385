In a serving bowl, combine the sauerkraut, celery, green pepper and onion; set aside. In a saucepan, bring sugar and vinegar to a boil; cook and stir for 1 minute or until sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat; cool slightly. Pour over sauerkraut mixture; sprinkle with celery seed. Toss to coat. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
