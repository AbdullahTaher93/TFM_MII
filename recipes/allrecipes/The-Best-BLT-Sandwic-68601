Place bacon in a skillet over medium heat. Mix together the mustard powder, curry powder and red pepper flakes. As soon as you turn the bacon over, sprinkle the spice mixture onto the cooked side of the bacon. Place the lettuce and tomato onto one slice of toasted bread, then top with the seasoned cooked bacon. Top with the other slice of toasted bread.
