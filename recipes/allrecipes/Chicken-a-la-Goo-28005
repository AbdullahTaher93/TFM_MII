Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Sprinkle each flattened breast with garlic salt and pepper to taste on both sides. Lay a slice of ham onto each breast, then a slice of Swiss cheese. Roll each breast up like a cinnamon roll. Secure with a toothpick if necessary. Wrap a piece of bacon loosely around each roll. Place the rolled breasts in a 2 quart glass baking dish and pour in chicken broth. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the juices run clear. Broil for a few minutes before serving to crisp up the bacon.
