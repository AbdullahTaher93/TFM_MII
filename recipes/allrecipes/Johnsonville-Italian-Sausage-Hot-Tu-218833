Preheat grill to medium-low heat. In a disposable foil pan, combine the wine, peppers, onions, olives, garlic and parsley. Place on the grill; cover with foil. Bring to a slow simmer. Meanwhile, grill sausage according to package directions. When sausage is browned and fully cooked (180 degrees F), transfer links to the wine steam bath. Cover and keep warm until guests arrive.
