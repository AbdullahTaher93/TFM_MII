In a large saucepot or Dutch oven, combine the garlic, potatoes, onion, ham, broth, water, marjoram, and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are very tender. Using a potato masher, mash the potatoes slightly, breaking them up to give the soup a chunky (not smooth) texture. Add the green beans and carrots, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until tender. Add the sour cream and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly, until the soup is slightly thickened and creamy.
