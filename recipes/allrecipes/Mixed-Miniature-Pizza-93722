Punch down the dough and divide it into 48 balls. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 5 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Sprinkle several large baking sheets with cornmeal. On a lightly floured surface, roll or pat the balls into 2 1/2- to 3-inch circles. Place on the prepared pans. Brush or mist each circle with oil. Cover with desired toppings. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden and bubbling.
