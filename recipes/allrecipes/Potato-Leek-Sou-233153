Combine water, leeks, potatoes, salt, and black pepper in a large saucepan; bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to low, partially cover saucepan, and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 1 hour. Blend soup using an immersion blender until smooth. Season with more salt and pepper as needed. Stir in milk and hot sauce before serving.
