Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken pieces in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a medium bowl combine the chutney, mayonnaise, soda and water. Mix together and pour mixture over chicken, then sprinkle with seasoning and salt. Bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside.
