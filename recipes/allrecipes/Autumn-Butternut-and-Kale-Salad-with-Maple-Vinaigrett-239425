Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Toss squash, onion, maple syrup, oil, thyme and black pepper in a large bowl. Place evenly on large rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper; roast 30 minutes or until squash is tender and edges are starting to brown. Place kale in the same large bowl. Toss with hot, cooked squash and onions and set aside. Whisk vinaigrette ingredients together. Drizzle over salad and toss to combine. Sprinkle with cheese and pecans; serve immediately.
