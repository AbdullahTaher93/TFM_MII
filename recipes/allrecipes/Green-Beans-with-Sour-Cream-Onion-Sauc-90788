In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over high heat, frequently stir onions, 1 cup broth, and the sherry until liquid is evaporated and onions begin to brown, 15 to 20 minutes. In a bowl, mix cornstarch with remaining 1/4 cup broth. Add sour cream and thyme; mix well. Add to onion mixture and scrape browned bits free from bottom of pan; stir until sauce boils. Keep warm. Meanwhile, in a 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat, bring 2 quarts water to a boil. Add beans; cook until tender-crisp to bite, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain. Put beans in a bowl and pour onion sauce over them. Add salt to taste.
