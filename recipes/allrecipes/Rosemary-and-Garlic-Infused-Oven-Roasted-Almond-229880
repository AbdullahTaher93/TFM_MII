Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread almonds on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until almonds are golden brown and fragrant, 15 to 20 minutes. The nuts will continue to cook after removing from oven. Transfer hot almonds to a wide-bottomed glass or stainless steel bowl. Heat olive oil, garlic, rosemary leaves, red pepper flakes, and sea salt in a saucepan over low heat, just before almonds are out of the oven. Mash the garlic and rosemary in the hot oil to release flavor. Pour hot oil mixture over almonds; stir almonds every 5 to 10 minutes until completely cooled. Drain oil from the almonds; transfer almonds to a paper towel-lined plate. The almonds will still be shiny and oily to the touch.
