In a medium bowl, whisk together pineapple juice, vegetable oil, white wine, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt, ground black pepper and rosemary. Place ribs in a large, shallow dish, and pierce several times with a fork. Pour 1/2 the marinade over ribs, reserving remainder. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator 8 hours, or overnight, turning once. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium, indirect heat and lightly oil grate. Place ribs on the prepared grill. Cook 10 minutes per side, basting frequently with remaining marinade. Continue cooking 20 minutes, or to desired doneness, turning occasionally.
