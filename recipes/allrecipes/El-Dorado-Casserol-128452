Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Coat a 13 inch x 9 inch (32.5 x 23-cm) baking dish with nonstick spray. In a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, cook beef or turkey and onion, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes, or until meat is no longer pink and onion is tender. Drain off any fat. In a large bowl, combine ricotta, cream cheese, peppers (with liquid), and olives. Spoon half of meat into the prepared baking dish. Top with half of ricotta mixture. Top with 2 cups tortilla chips. Sprinkle with half of Monterey Jack and half of Cheddar. Repeat layers with remaining meat mixture, ricotta mixture, chips, and shredded cheeses. Cover and bake 20 minutes. Uncover and bake 10 minutes, or until hot and bubbly. Serve with salsa, if using.
