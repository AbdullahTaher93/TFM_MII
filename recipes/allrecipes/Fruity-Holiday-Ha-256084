Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place ham in a deep roasting dish. Mix syrup, apple juice, brown sugar, cinnamon, and cloves together in a small bowl. Pour over ham. Coat ham with maraschino cherries and crushed pineapple. Bake ham in the preheated oven, basting every 30 minutes with juices, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), about 1 hour 30 minutes. Garnish ham with reserved mandarin oranges.
