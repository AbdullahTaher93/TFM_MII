Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour 3 (9 inch) pans. Mix together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, allspice and cloves. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk. Stir in the blackberry jam. Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
