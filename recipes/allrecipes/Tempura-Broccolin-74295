Preheat 2 inches of oil to 375 degrees on a deep-fat thermometer. Preheat oven to 300 degrees. In a large bowl, mix together the water, teriyaki sauce and egg. Add flour and mix lightly until batter just blended. (It's okay if there are some lumps). Working in small batches, dip Mann's Broccolini in batter and deep-fry until very lightly browned, about 30 seconds. Drain on paper towels. Keep warm in the oven while you fry the remaining Broccolini. Serve warm, with lemon wedges on the side.
