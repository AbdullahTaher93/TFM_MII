Cover fish with water, refrigerate and let stand for 2 days. Change water every six hours. Two to twelve hours before fish is to be cooked, drain water and cover fish with salad dressing. Heat a grill to medium heat. Remove fish from marinade and place skin side down on grill. Cook until meat is tender and flaky, about 20 minutes.
