Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain and set aside. Heat a dry large skillet over medium-low heat and toast pine nuts, stirring frequently, until pine nuts are golden in spots, about 3 minutes. Remove and set aside. Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in the same skillet on medium-high heat. Saute the smoked sausage for 5 minutes, or until golden brown, stirring occasionally. Remove smoked sausage and set aside. Add the zucchini and vegetable broth to the skillet and simmer until zucchini are soft, about 5 minutes. Add spinach, white beans and cherry tomatoes; continue to simmer for 2 minutes until spinach is wilted and tomatoes are soft. Turn the heat to low; add the pasta and smoked sausage to the vegetables mixing well to combine and cook for 30 seconds until heated through. Garnish with toasted pine nuts and serve warm.
