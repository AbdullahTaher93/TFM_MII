Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; add cumin and caraway seeds until they begin to pop and oil bubbles, 1 to 2 minutes. Cook and stir onion and garlic in the hot oil until onion is soft and translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir cauliflower and potato into onion mixture to coat with oil. Add chili powder, turmeric, and salt; stir to coat vegetables. Cover skillet and cook vegetables over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until cauliflower and potatoes are softened, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle with cilantro.
