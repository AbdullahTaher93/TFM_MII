In a skillet over medium heat, brown pork chop in oil on both sides. Continue cooking until a meat thermometer reads 160 - 170 degrees F, about 6 minutes. Remove and keep warm. In the same skillet, saute onions, mushrooms and garlic until tender. Add marmalade and soy sauce; cook and stir until heated through. Pour over chop. Sprinkle with sunflower kernels if desired.
