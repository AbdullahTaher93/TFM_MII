Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Add onion, garlic, rosemary, and sage. Saute for 5 minutes over low heat. Add the ground meats and cook until the meat begins to stick to the bottom of the pan. Deglaze with red wine and let mixture reduce well. Add the canned tomatoes and water, and season with salt and pepper. Simmer sauce mixture until water evaporates. Bring a pot of water to a boil, add salt, and cook pasta according to package directions. Drain pasta, toss with sauce and sprinkle with pecorino cheese.
