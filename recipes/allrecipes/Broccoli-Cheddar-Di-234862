Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix sour cream, broccoli, ranch dressing mix, and 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese in a bowl; transfer to an 8x8-inch baking dish. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese over mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until dip is bubbling and cheese is melted, about 30 minutes.
