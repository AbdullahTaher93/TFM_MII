Place hash browns, eggs, shredded cheese, pepper and salt in a large bowl. Mix the ingredients using your hands, making sure everything is well coated. Add 1 teaspoon of olive oil to a large nonstick saute pan over low to medium heat. Grab a handful of the potato mixture, about 1/4 cup, and create a ball. Place it down on the pan and carefully pat it down to create a flat disc shape. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes and then flip it over and cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and place on a paper towel. Repeat until all hash browns have been used. In a small bowl, mash the avocados and sprinkle with a little garlic salt. Place a spoonful of the mixture onto a hash brown stack. Top with half slice of serrano ham and a slice of mozzarella cheese. Top it with another hash brown stack.
