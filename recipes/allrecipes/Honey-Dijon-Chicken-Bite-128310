Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine honey, juice, mustards, and soy sauce. Stir in chicken. Let stand for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, line a jelly-roll pan with foil. Remove chicken from marinade and place in pan. Bake until chicken is browned and no longer pink in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley.
