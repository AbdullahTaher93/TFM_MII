Place the beef, onion, and garlic in a skillet over medium heat. Cook until beef is evenly brown and onion is tender. Drain grease. Transfer beef, onion, and garlic to a large pot. Mix in tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, peas, carrots, spinach, bouillon cube, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and cook 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Add more water or tomato sauce as needed. Stir macaroni into the soup. Season with Italian seasoning. Continue cooking 10 minutes, or until macaroni is tender.
