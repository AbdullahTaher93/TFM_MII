Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a shallow baking dish that is big enough to accommodate all the fish. Slice the frozen spinach souffle into 4 equal pieces. Wrap a fillet around each piece, and place seam side down in prepared baking dish. Pour undiluted soup over the fish, and sprinkle with small shrimp, Parmesan cheese, and paprika. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a fork can be easily inserted into the souffle.
