Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray 24 regular-size muffin cups with cooking spray. In 3-quart saucepan, heat water and butter over high heat to a full rolling boil. Remove from heat. Stir in flour, cornmeal and salt until mixture forms a dough and all lumps have disappeared. Gradually stir in beaten eggs until well blended. Stir in both cheeses and the chiles. Spoon dough evenly into sprayed muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 25 to 29 minutes or until golden brown. Cool 2 minutes; remove from muffin cups. Serve warm.
