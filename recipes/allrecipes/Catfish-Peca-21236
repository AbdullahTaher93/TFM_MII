Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix the cornmeal, salt and pepper. Dip the catfish in the cornmeal mixture; coating well. Place catfish on a flat, greased baking sheet. Pour the oil over the fish. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes or until catfish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Sprinkle with pecans toward the end of the cooking period. Garnish with lemon wedges and parsley sprigs.
