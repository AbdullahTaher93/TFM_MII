In a skillet, saute onions in butter until golden brown. In a bowl, beat eggs and cream. Add the onions, salt and pepper. Line a deep-dish 9 in. pie plate with bottom pastry. Add egg mixture; sprinkle with bacon and cheese. Roll out remaining pastry to fit top of pie; place over filling. Seal and flute the edges; cut slits in top. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-60 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Let stand 15 minutes before cutting. Refrigerate leftovers.
