Pour whole box of pasta into a large skillet (approximately 12 inches in diameter). Pour 3 cups of cold water into the pan, ensuring that the water covers the pasta. Turn the burner to high, then set your timer for 10 minutes (optional: add a bit of salt to taste). Cook on high, stirring occasionally, until half of the liquid has evaporated. Add asparagus and stir to combine; continue to cook on high. With about 1 minute left, add the sauce and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove skillet from heat, top with bacon, cheese and parsley. Serve immediately.
