Thaw shrimp, if frozen. Place shrimp in a resealable plastic bag set in a shallow bowl. For marinade, combine olive oil, wine, garlic, lemon zest, salt, crushed red pepper, and black pepper in a small bowl. Pour marinade over shrimp. Seal bag; turn to coat shrimp. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Drain shrimp, reserving marinade. Melt butter over medium heat in an extra-large skillet. Cook shrimp in hot butter for 3 to 5 minutes or until shrimp are opaque. Add reserved marinade and cook for 1 minute more. Cook pasta according to package directions in a large pot; drain. Return pasta to pot. Add shrimp mixture; toss to combine. Serve with lemon wedges and fresh basil.
