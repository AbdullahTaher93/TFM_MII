Heat olive oil in a large pot until very hot. Add haddock; cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Add red bell pepper, shallot, and garlic; cook and stir until shallot softens, about 3 minutes. Pour coconut milk into the pot. Whisk in curry paste, curry powder, coriander, and turmeric. Reduce heat; simmer until coconut milk is reduced by 1/4, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir in spinach and edamame. Cook until spinach is wilted and edamame is heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle green onions over curry.
