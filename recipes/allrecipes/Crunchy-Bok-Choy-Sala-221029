Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place ramen noodles, sunflower seeds, and almonds on a baking sheet. Drizzle butter over the ramen noodle mixture and toss to coat. Toast the ramen noodle mixture in the preheated oven until lightly browned and fragrant, stirring occasionally to avoid burning, about 8 minutes. Set aside to cool. Whisk sugar, vegetable oil, vinegar, and soy sauce together in a small bowl for the dressing. Place bok choy, onion, and toasted ramen noodle mixture in a large bowl. Toss with dressing until well coated.
