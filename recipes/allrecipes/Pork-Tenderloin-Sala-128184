In a small bowl, whisk the orange juice, soy sauce, honey, gingerroot, rosemary, oil, garlic, and pepper. Place the pork in a medium bowl, and pour the orange-soy sauce marinade over it, turning it to coat all sides. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate at least 1 hour. Remove the pork from the marinade and transfer it to a 9-inch (23-cm) pie plate. Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and let stand about 10 minutes before carving into 1/4- to 1/2-inch (5-mm to 1-cm) slices. In a small bowl, whisk the vinegar and mustard. Place the greens in a large bowl. Drizzle with the dressing and toss well. Top with the pork slices.
