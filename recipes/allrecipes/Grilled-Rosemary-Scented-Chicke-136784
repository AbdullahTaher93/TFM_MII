Prepare Sweet & Sour Onion Jam (see Note). Prepare a charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill. Rub chicken breasts with oil and season with salt and pepper. Place rosemary sprigs on the grill and lay a chicken breast over each one. Grill until chicken is browned on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Turn, keeping rosemary under chicken, and grill until no trace of pink remains in the center, about 5 minutes more. Discard rosemary. Serve chicken with black olive paste and the onion jam.
