Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Combine cereal, flour and seasoned salt in a shallow dish or pie plate. Beat egg white with 1 Tbsp. water in a shallow bowl. Dip meaty side of each chicken piece in egg white mixture, then in cereal mixture. Place chicken, coating sides up, on baking sheet; spray lightly with cooking spray. Bake 40 min. or until chicken is golden brown and cooked through.
