Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Pour 5 cups water into a 4- to 5-quart pot. Put turkey in pot with 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce to simmer until turkey is opaque in center (cut to test), about 20 minutes. Remove turkey from water and set aside. While turkey is cooking, prepare sauce and filling. Pour salsa into blender or food processor and whirl until smooth. In a medium frying pan, cook onion and garlic in olive oil over medium-high heat until softened, about 5 minutes, stirring often. Transfer to a medium bowl (do not wash pan). Reserve 1/4 cup salsa; pour remaining salsa into pan and reduce heat to low. Using two forks, coarsely shred turkey and add to bowl with onion. Stir in half the cheese, Jalapeno chiles, half the cilantro, and remaining salt. Moisten mixture with reserved 1/4 cup salsa. Spray a 9- by 13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Working with 1 tortilla at a time, dip into warm salsa, turning to coat both sides. Transfer tortilla to plate and place about 1/4 cup turkey mixture in center. Roll up tortilla to enclose filling; transfer to prepared baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling, then top with the remaining shredded cheese. Bake until warmed through, about 15 minutes, then broil 3 to 4 inches from heat until cheese is browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Top with remaining cilantro. Accompany with sour cream, if you like. Offer extra salsa on the side.
