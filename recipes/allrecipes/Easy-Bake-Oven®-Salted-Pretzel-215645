PREHEAT your EASY-BAKE(R) oven for 15 minutes. MIX THE DOUGH. Pour the Pretzel Mix and 3 1/2 teaspoons of water into one bowl. Mix until you form a dough. PREPARE A WORKSPACE. Spray the baking pan with cooking spray. Sprinkle flour onto your hands and a clean counter. Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. ROLL THE DOUGH. Roll each piece of dough between your hands and the counter until you form a long, thin rope. Each rope should be between 7-11 inches long. Use a ruler if you need to. FORM A PRETZEL. Bring both ends of your rope up to form a U-shape. Cross one end over the other. Bring the ends down, as if you are forming a bow. Press the ends into the bottom of the U-shape. Place one pretzel in a baking pan. MIX THE GLAZE. Pour 1/2 of the glaze mix and 1 teaspoon of water into a bowl. Mix until you form a glaze. (Save the other half of the glaze mix for the sweet pretzel recipe.) GLAZE & SALT THE PRETZEL. Use a spoon to drizzle 1/2 of the glaze all over the top of your pretzel. Then sprinkle the pretzel with about 1/2 of the coarse salt. BAKE THE PRETZEL. Use the pan pusher to move the pretzel into the oven. Bake for 10-12 minutes. After baking, use the pan pusher to move the pretzel into the cooling chamber. Let it cool for 10 minutes. Then bake the other pretzel, using a clean pan. MIX THE CHEESE DIP. Pour the nacho cheese mix and 1 tablespoon of water into a warming cup. Stir until smooth. WARM THE CHEESE DIP. Slide the cheese dip into the warming chamber. Allow the dip to warm, but do not let it get hot. SERVE your pretzels on a plate with the nacho cheese dip on the side. Dip and enjoy!
