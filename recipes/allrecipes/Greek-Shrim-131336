In a large skillet, heat 1/2 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. Add shrimp. Saute until just opaque. Remove to a plate. Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil to pan. Add scallions and garlic and saute until golden. Add tomatoes, wine, oregano, and salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced to a sauce-like consistency, about 7 minutes. Return shrimp to pan and cook until heated, about 1 minute. Sprinkle with goat cheese and cook until melted. Serve over toasted orzo pilaf.
