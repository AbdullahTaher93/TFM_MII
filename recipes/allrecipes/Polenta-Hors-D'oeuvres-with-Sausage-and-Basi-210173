For polenta, bring water, olive oil and salt to a boil over high heat in 4-quart saucepot. Remove from heat and stir in polenta with a wooden spoon. Cook over medium heat , stirring constantly, 5 minutes. Immediately spread into two lightly greased half sheet pans (18 x 12-inches). Let cool completely. Using a 2-inch round cookie cutter, cut into 48 rounds per sheet pan (6 across and 8 down). Place on clean sheet pan. Store covered with plastic wrap until ready to assemble. For sausage mixture, meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat and cook onion and sausage, stirring occasionally, 3 minutes or until sausage is brown. Stir in sauce and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes or until sausage is done. To assemble, preheat broiler. Uncover polenta rounds; brush with additional olive oil and season lightly with additional salt. Broil about 7 minutes or until heated through and a light crust forms. Immediately top each round with 1 heaping teaspoon sausage mixture. Sprinkle generously with cheese and garnish with basil. Serve immediately.
