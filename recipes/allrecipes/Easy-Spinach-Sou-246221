Melt butter in a stockpot over medium heat. Add carrots, scallion, and garlic; cook and stir until scallion is soft, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in chicken broth; bring to a boil. Add pasta and cook, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in spinach; cook until tender, 2 to 3 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.
