In a large soup pot, brown the Italian sausage; drain off fat. Add ham bone (or ham hocks), lima beans, navy beans, tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, celery, carrots, garlic, parsley, bay leaves, chives, basil, green onion, thyme, mustard, cayenne pepper, salt, ground black pepper, Worcestershire sauce and chicken base or bouillon. Add the can of beer and water to cover all. Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until beans are tender, about 4 or 5 hours, and the ham has been released from the bone. Refrigerate overnight to let the fat to come to the surface of the soup. When ready to serve, skim fat, remove ham bone (or hocks), pick off remaining ham from bone and put into soup. Discard bones and bay leaves. Heat soup until warm. Serve and enjoy!
