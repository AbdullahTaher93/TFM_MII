Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Whisk Sriracha sauce, honey, butter, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper together in a small bowl. Place chicken in a baking dish. Pour Sriracha mixture over the chicken and turn to coat chicken completely. Cook in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
