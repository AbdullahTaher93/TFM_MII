Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the potatoes. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir the soup, milk, garlic powder, broccoli and chicken into the skillet. Sprinkle with the cheese. Heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the potatoes are fork-tender.
