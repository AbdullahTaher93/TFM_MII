Layer each of 2 bread slices with 1 cheese slice, 1/2 of apple slices, 1 ham slice, and 1 more cheese slice. Top each sandwich with remaining bread slices and spread with thin layer of butter. Heat grill pan over medium-low heat. Put sandwiches in pan, buttered side down, and place heavy skillet on top of sandwiches to weigh them down. Cook until golden brown and crisp on bottom, about 1 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and spread remaining butter on top of sandwiches. Flip sandwiches, weigh down with skillet, and cook until browned and crisp, 1 to 2 minutes more.
