Slice pork into long, 1/2 inch-thick strips. Place in a bowl with zest, half the lime juice, garlic, salt, cayenne, black pepper, and 2 teaspoons oil; toss to coat. Marinate at room temperature 20 minutes (or longer, or overnight, in the fridge). Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok (or 12-inch nonstick skillet) over medium-high heat. Add bell peppers, onion, and jalapeno stir-fry until onions and peppers are soft and slightly charred, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a metal bowl and toss with cilantro and remaining lime juice; cover with foil and keep warm. Return wok to medium-high heat. Add remaining 2 teaspoons oil and the pork; stir-fry until meat is seared and just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Place pork in warmed tortillas and top with vegetables.
