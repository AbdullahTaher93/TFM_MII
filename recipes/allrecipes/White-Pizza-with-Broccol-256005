Place a pizza stone on the bottom rack of your oven. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Stretch pizza dough into a round disc on a floured surface. Brush 1 tablespoon olive oil over dough. Sprinkle minced garlic, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper on top. Cover dough with Italian cheese blend and dollops of ricotta. Scatter broccoli and tomato over cheese. Swirl remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil on top. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over pizza. Transfer pizza to the preheated pizza stone and bake until the crust is crispy and the cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.
