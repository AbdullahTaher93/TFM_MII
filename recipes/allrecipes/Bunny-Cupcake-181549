Heat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F for dark or nonstick pans). Make and cool cake as directed on box for 24 cupcakes. Stir a few drops pink food color into 1 container of frosting. Frost cupcakes with pink frosting. Spoon 1 heaping teaspoonful white frosting on center of each cupcake. To make ears, cut each large marshmallow crosswise into 5 pieces with kitchen scissors. Using scissors, cut through center of each marshmallow piece to within 1/4 inch of edge. Separate to look like bunny ears; press 1 side of cut edges into pink sugar, flattening slightly. Arrange on each of the white frosting mounds as shown. Use candy decorations and sprinkles to make eyes, nose and whiskers as shown. Store loosely covered.
