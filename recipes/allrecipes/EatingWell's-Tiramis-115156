If ladyfingers are soft, toast them in a 350 degrees F oven for 6 to 8 minutes. Stir together 3 tablespoons brandy, coffee granules and water in a small bowl until the granules are dissolved. Brush over the flat side of the ladyfingers. Bring about 1 inch of water to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Combine reconstituted egg whites, sugar and cream of tartar in a heatproof mixing bowl that will fit over the saucepan. Set the bowl over the simmering water and beat with a hand-held mixer at low speed 4 to 5 minutes. Increase speed to high and continue beating over heat for about 3 minutes longer. (The mixture should form a ribbon trail.) Remove the bowl from the heat and beat until cool and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Set aside. Beat mascarpone and cream cheese in a large bowl until creamy (no need to wash meringue from beaters). Add about 1 cup of the beaten whites and the remaining 1 tablespoon brandy and beat until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the remaining whites by hand. Line the bottom and sides of a 3-quart trifle bowl or souffle dish with ladyfingers, flat sides toward the center. Spoon in one-quarter of the filling and top with a layer of ladyfingers. Repeat with two more layers of filling and ladyfingers, arranging the fourth layer of ladyfingers decoratively over the top, trimming to fit, if necessary. Top with remaining filling. Cover and chill for at least 4 hours or overnight. Before serving, sprinkle with chocolate shavings and dust with confectioners' sugar.
