Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart glass casserole dish with cooking spray. Mix olive oil, dill, garlic, lemon juice, cumin, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Add cauliflower; mix until coated. Spread in the prepared dish. Roast in the preheated oven, turning halfway through, until tender, about 25 minutes. Transfer to a platter; spoon any juices left in the dish on top.
