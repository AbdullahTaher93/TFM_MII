Bring water and sugar to a boil in a pot over medium heat; boil for 5 minutes stirring occasionally. Add the cranberries, ginger, and cinnamon stick; return the mixture to a boil and cook until the cranberries start popping, about 5 minutes. Transfer the sauce to a shallow container; chill in refrigerator until cold, about 3 hours.
