In a medium saucepan, combine sugar and gelatin. Stir in milk. Cook and stir over medium heat until gelatin is dissolved. Remove from the heat; stir in sour cream and vanilla. Cover and chill for about 2 hours or until the mixture mounds when dropped from a spoon. Spoon into parfait glasses or glass bowls. Top each with 1/4 cup berries. Serve immediately.
