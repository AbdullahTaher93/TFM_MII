Crush cookies and set aside 1/4 cup of crumbs. Place remaining crumbs in a medium bowl and mix in melted butter. Press mixture firmly into bottom and sides of a 9 inch springform pan. In a large mixing bowl, whip together marshmallow creme and creme de menthe until smooth. In a separate bowl, whip cream until soft peaks form, then fold into marshmallow mixture. Pour mixture into pan and sprinkle reserved cookie crumbs on top. Freeze at least 2 hours, until firm. Remove from freezer 20 minutes before serving to soften slightly.
