Put the sausage in a 16 1/2 x 12 x 2 1/2-inch disposable foil pan. Bake at 425 degrees F for 45 minutes or until the sausage is browned. Carefully pour off juices that are in the pan. Stir in the pasta sauce, peppers and onions. Cover the pan. Bake for 45 minutes more or until the sausage reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees F. Divide the sausage and peppers among the roll halves. Top with the cheese and remaining roll halves.
