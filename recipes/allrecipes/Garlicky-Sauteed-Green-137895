Heat garlic and oil in large skillet over medium-low heat until garlic begins to turn golden, about 3 minutes. Transfer mixture to small bowl and set aside. Add greens, red-pepper flakes, and salt to skillet. Using tongs, turn greens until wilted enough to fit in pan. Raise heat to medium, cover, and cook 7 to 10 minutes, tossing. Transfer greens to a colander to drain. Return greens to pan and toss with reserved garlic and oil mixture. Refrigerate leftover greens in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
