In a skillet, cook bacon and onion over medium heat until bacon is crisp and onion is tender. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. In a large saucepan, melt butter. Stir in the flour until smooth. Gradually stir in cream. Bring to boil over medium heat; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Reduce heat; stir in spinach, salt, pepper, nutmeg, bacon and onion. Cook and stir for 5 minutes or until heated through. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
