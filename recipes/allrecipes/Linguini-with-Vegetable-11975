In a large pot with boiling salted water cook linguini pasta until al dente. Drain well. Meanwhile, in a large skillet heat olive oil and add thinly sliced zucchini, squash, carrots, red bell pepper, onions, salt-free spice blend, and minced garlic. Cook on medium-high for five minutes, stirring frequently. Add white wine and lemon juice and continue cooking until vegetables are crisp-tender and liquid has reduced, about 5 to 10 minutes. Toss cooked and drained pasta with sauteed vegetables and serve.
