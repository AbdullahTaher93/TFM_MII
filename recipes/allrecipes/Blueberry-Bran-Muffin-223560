Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray 12-cup muffin tin with non-stick baking spray. Combine sugar, egg and oil in a large bowl and stir together with a wire whisk. Add buttermilk and blueberry juice cocktail and stir with whisk until blended. Combine bran cereal, flour, baking soda and salt in a separate bowl. Add to juice mixture and stir just until dry ingredients are moistened. Fold in blueberries. Let mixture sit 20 minutes to allow cereal to soften. Scoop evenly into muffin cups. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.
