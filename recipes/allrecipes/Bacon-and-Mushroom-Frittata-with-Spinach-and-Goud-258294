Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In medium nonstick pan, heat vegetable oil over medium heat. Add bacon and cook until crispy. Transfer bacon to paper towel-lined plate and reserve. Keep bacon fat in pan. To pan with bacon fat, add mushrooms and cook until well browned. Remove and reserve. Add onions and cook until softened; add garlic and cook for additional 2 minutes. Add red pepper flakes and spinach. Cook until spinach just starts to wilt. Return bacon and mushrooms to spinach mixture and add eggs whisked with 2 tablespoons milk, stirring to combine. Pour mixture into ovenproof serving dishes. Top with smoked Gouda and place in oven. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until eggs are just set.
