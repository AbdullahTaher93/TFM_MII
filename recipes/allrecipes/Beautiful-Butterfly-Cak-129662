Prepare and bake cake batter as directed on package for two 9-inch round layers. Cool completely on wire racks. Cut layers crosswise in half. Spread two of the cake halves with jam; top with remaining two cake halves to form two stacks. To assemble, arrange cookies in center of large board or tray with edges slightly overlapping to form the 'butterfly's body,' securing cookies to each other with small amount of the whipped topping. Arrange cake stacks around body to resemble the 'butterfly's wings.' Tint remaining whipped topping with food coloring as desired. Spread onto cake stacks. Decorate butterfly with tinted whipped topping, cereal, candies and mini cookies.
