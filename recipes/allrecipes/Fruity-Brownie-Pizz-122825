Prepare brownie mix according to package directions. Spread the batter into a greased 12-in. pizza pan. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool completely. In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Spread over crust. Drain pineapple, reserving juice. Toss banana slices with juice; drain well. Arrange banana, kiwi, strawberries and pineapple over cream cheese layer; sprinkle with pecans. In a microwave, melt chocolate and butter; stir until smooth. Drizzle over fruit. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
