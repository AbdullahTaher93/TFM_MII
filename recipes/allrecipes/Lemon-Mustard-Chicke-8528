Combine lemon and lime juices with the prepared mustard. Brush over chicken. Set aside. Combine bread crumbs, salt, pepper, curry powder, oregano, and grated lemon peel. Roll chicken in crumb mix, coating well. In a heavy baking pan or iron skillet, melt butter or margarine over medium heat. Place chicken in pan, skin side down. Place in a preheated 350 degree F (175 degree C) oven. Bake, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Turn chicken and bake until tender, about 30 more minutes. Serve on a warm platter with sliced lemons and chopped parsley, if desired.
