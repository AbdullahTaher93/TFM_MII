Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil a 6- or 8-cup tube pan or coat it with nonstick spray. Sprinkle pan with 2 tablespoons sugar, tapping out excess. In a large bowl, whisk flour, poppy seeds, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In another bowl, whisk egg until frothy. Whisk in remaining 1 1/4 cups sugar, buttermilk, oil, lemon zest and vanilla. Gradually add wet ingredients to dry ingredients, whisking until just moistened. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake cake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until top springs back when touched lightly and a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean. Immediately loosen edges and invert onto a wire rack. Let cool completely. Serve with Lemon Curd, if desired.
