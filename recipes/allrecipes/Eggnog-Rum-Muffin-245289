Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners or grease. Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl; mix in walnuts. Combine eggnog, melted butter, rum, egg, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture until just moistened, forming a lumpy batter. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups and bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes.
