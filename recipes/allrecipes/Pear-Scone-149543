Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Sift together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl; cut in the butter until the mixture has a crumbly texture. Whisk together the egg and half-and-half in a separate bowl; stir the egg mixture into the flour mixture until combined; stir in the pear. Drop large spoonfuls of the dough onto an ungreased baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes; rest briefly on a cooling rack before serving.
