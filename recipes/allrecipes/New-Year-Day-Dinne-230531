Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir pork in hot vegetable oil until browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer pork to a bowl. Heat butter in the same skillet; cook and stir cabbage until wilted, about 5 minutes. Stir onion into cabbage and cook until onion is translucent, stirring often, about 5 more minutes. Sprinkle vegetables with caraway seeds and season with salt and black pepper; pour 1/2 cup chicken broth into skillet. Raise heat to medium-high and cook until broth has nearly evaporated; pour remaining 1 cup broth into skillet. Return pork to skillet, add red and green bell peppers, and cover; cook until peppers start to soften, about 10 minutes.
