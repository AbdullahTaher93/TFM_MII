Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place 1 wafer in bottom of each of 12 paper-lined medium muffin pan cups; set aside. Beat cream cheese and sugar in small bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, mixing just until blended after each addition. Spoon evenly into prepared muffin cups, filling each cup 2/3 full. Bake 30 minutes. Turn off oven; open oven door slightly. Let stand in oven 30 minutes. Remove from oven; cool completely. Top with pie filling. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving. Store leftover cheesecakes in refrigerator.
