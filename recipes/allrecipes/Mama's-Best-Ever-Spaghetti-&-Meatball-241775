Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, eggs and 1/2 cup Sauce in medium bowl; shape into 18 meatballs. Bring remaining Sauce to a boil over medium-high heat in 12-inch skillet. Gently stir in uncooked meatballs. Reduce heat to low and simmer covered, stirring occasionally, 20 minutes or until meatballs are done. Serve over hot spaghetti.
