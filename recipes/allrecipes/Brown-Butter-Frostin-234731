Heat butter, stirring constantly, in a saucepan over medium-low heat until it browns and becomes very aromatic, 5 to 10 minutes. Whisk confectioners' sugar into butter until dissolved and remove saucepan from heat; stir in milk and vanilla extract. Beat butter mixture using an electric mixer until frosting is smooth; add more milk if frosting is too thick.
