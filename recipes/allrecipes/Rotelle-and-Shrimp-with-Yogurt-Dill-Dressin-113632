In a medium frying pan, melt the butter over moderate heat. Stir in the garlic and then the shrimp, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and the pepper. Cook, stirring, until the shrimp are just done, about 4 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside to cool. In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, the mayonnaise, if using, the jalapeno, cucumber, dill, scallions, paprika, and the remaining 1 1/4 teaspoons salt. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the rotelle until just done, about 12 minutes. Drain the pasta, rinse with cold water, and drain thoroughly. Toss with the yogurt sauce and the shrimp and garlic.
