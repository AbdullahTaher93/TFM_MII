In a large bowl, combine the first six ingredients. Stir in eggs, baby food, oil and nuts just until moistened. Spoon into four greased 5-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 325 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. In a saucepan, combine topping ingredients; bring to a boil. Boil and stir for 3 minutes. Poke holes with a fork in top of loaves. Cool in pans for 10 minutes or until topping is absorbed. Remove to wire racks to cool.
