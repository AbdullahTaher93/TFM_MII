Char bell peppers over a low gas flame or under a broiler, turning often, until skins are evenly blistered, 5 to 10 minutes. Place the peppers in a bowl, cover and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove skins and seeds of the peppers with a paring knife. Cut the peppers into wide strips, saving any juices accumulated in the bowl. Set aside. Pat chicken dry and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add garlic and crushed red pepper and cook, stirring, until golden, about 1 minute. Add the chicken and cook until browned on all sides, about 6 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate. Add wine to the pan and increase heat to high, scraping up any browned bits. Stir in tomatoes and one-third of the roasted peppers and their juices. Add the chicken. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer, turning once, until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 25 to 30 minutes. Add remaining bell peppers and cook until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes more. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Tilt pan and spoon off any surface fat from sauce. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Transfer chicken and vegetables with a slotted spoon to a warm serving bowl. Reserve 3 cups of sauce for another use. Spoon the remaining sauce over the chicken and vegetables. Serve hot.
