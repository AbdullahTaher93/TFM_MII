In a bowl, combine the rice, egg, celery and onion. In another bowl, combine the mayonnaise, pickle relish, salt and pepper. Add to rice mixture and toss to coat. Transfer to two custard cups or a 1/2-cup mold. Cover and refrigerate until chilled. Just before serving, unmold onto lettuce-lined plates.
