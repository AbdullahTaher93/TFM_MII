Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Beat butter, white sugar, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Sift flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture, about 1/4 cup at a time, into creamed butter mixture until dough is well combined; fold in oats, chocolate chips, and raisins. Drop dough by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned on the bottom and sides, 7 to 9 minutes. Cool cookies on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
