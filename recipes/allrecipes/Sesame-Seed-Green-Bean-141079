Toast sesame seeds in a large dry skillet over medium heat until they turn golden brown. Spread out onto a plate and allow to cool. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add green beans and soy sauce. Cook, stirring constantly, until the beans are hot and tender, about 10 minutes. Season with black pepper to taste, and toss with toasted sesame seeds.
