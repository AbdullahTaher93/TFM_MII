Whisk flour, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Beat eggs together in a separate bowl. Dip chicken pieces in the egg; transfer chicken to flour mixture and coat completely. Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Fry coated chicken pieces in the hot oil, working in batches, until no longer pink in the center, about 3 minutes per side; drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Combine hot sauce, garlic, and butter in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in the microwave until butter is melted and sauce is warm, about 1 minute. Serve hot sauce mixture as a dipping sauce or pour over buffalo chicken bites.
