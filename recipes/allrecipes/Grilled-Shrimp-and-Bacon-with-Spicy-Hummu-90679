Place shrimp in a bowl and toss with paprika and salt and pepper to taste. Slice bacon strips in half, crosswise, to make 12 pieces. In a wide frying pan over medium-high heat, cook bacon until some fat drains out but it's still slightly limp (2 to 3 minutes). Transfer to towels, drain, and let cool slightly. Discard fat from pan. Tightly wrap a piece of cooled bacon around each shrimp. Push a slender skewer through the bacon and shrimp just above the shrimp's tail and out through the bacon at the fat end of the shrimp. Repeat until you have two skewers per person. If assembled ahead, cover and chill up until the next day. Preheat grill. For hummus, drain garbanzos and whirl until smooth in a food processor or blender with cilantro, yogurt, green onions, lime juice, and jalapeno. Add salt to taste. Set aside. Lay shrimp on grill 4 to 6 inches above a solid bed of medium-hot coals (you can hold your hand at grill level for only 3 to 4 seconds) or over medium-high heat on a gas grill. Turn frequently to brown evenly; cook until shrimp are opaque in center (cut to test), about 5 minutes. Serve with hummus.
