In a small saucepan, cook and stir the cream cheese and 2 tablespoons butter over low heat until melted and smooth. In a large skillet, saute the onion, celery and green pepper in remaining butter until tender. Stir in the shrimp, crab, soup, mushrooms, garlic salt, hot pepper sauce, cayenne and rice. Transfer to a greased 2-qt. baking dish. Combine cheese and cracker crumbs; sprinkle over the top. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until bubbly.
