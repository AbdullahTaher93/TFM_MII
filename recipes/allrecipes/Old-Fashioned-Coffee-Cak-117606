In a small mixing bowl, cream butter and 1 cup sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg. Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and 1 teaspoon nutmeg; add to creamed mixture alternately with buttermilk. Pour into a greased 9-in. square baking pan (batter will be thick). Combine the remaining sugar and nutmeg; sprinkle over batter. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
