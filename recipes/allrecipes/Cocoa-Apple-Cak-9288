Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt pan or tube pan. Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add the room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Mix in the water and vanilla. In another bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, cinnamon, allspice, and salt. Add dry ingredients to creamed mixture and mix well. Fold in chocolate chips and grated apple and mix until fully incorporated. Spoon batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes. Cool on wire rack.
