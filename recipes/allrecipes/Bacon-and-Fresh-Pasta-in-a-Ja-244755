Bring a pot of water to a boil; add fresh pasta and cook until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir pea vines and garlic until vines are wilted, 3 to 4 minutes. Add pasta, bacon, butter, and chile oil to pea vines mixture; toss using tongs until butter is melted. Transfer pasta mixture to a 1-pint mason jar.
