Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Beat butter, margarine, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl until creamy. Add sugar, flour, and salt; continue beating until completely incorporated. Fold nuts and chocolate through the butter mixture. Drop cookie dough by spoonful onto baking sheet about 1 1/2 inches apart. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown around the edges, about 45 minutes. Cool cookies on baking sheets to room temperature before serving.
