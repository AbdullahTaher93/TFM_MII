Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels until cool. Stir sour cream, ranch dressing, and Cheddar cheese together in a large bowl. Crumble bacon into the dip; mix well. Chill until flavors blend, about 1 hour. Serve dip with chips.
