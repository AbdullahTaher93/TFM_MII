Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and lightly grease two 9x13 inch baking dishes. Bring chicken breasts and 1 1/2 cups of broth to simmer in a large covered skillet. Simmer until fully cooked, about 15 minutes. Remove chicken from skillet and cool slightly. Add remaining 1/2 cup of the chicken broth to the salsa. Shred chicken into bite-size pieces. Transfer to a medium bowl. Add 1 1/2 cups of the salsa, garlic, 2 cups of cheese, 3/4 cup of cilantro, and salt and pepper to taste. Toss to coat. Warm tortillas until very pliable. Working one at a time, spoon about 1/4 cup of the chicken filling into a tortilla. Roll into a cylinder and place, seam-side down in one of the prepared baking dishes. Drizzle remaining salsa and sprinkle remaining cheese over each casserole. Cover with foil and bake until heated through, about 30 minutes. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in onion slices and cook for 4-6 minutes Remove foil, sprinkle over remaining cheese, onion and cilantro. Allow to stand for a few minutes before serving.
