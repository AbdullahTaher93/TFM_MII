Whisk eggs, seasoned salt and milk together. Scramble eggs in a large skillet over medium heat until just set but still moist. Spread cream cheese on each tortilla. Spoon about 1/3 cup eggs down center of each tortilla. Top with salmon. Fold opposite sides of each tortilla over filling (sides will not meet in center). Roll up tortilla, beginning at one of the open ends. Place wraps, seam sides down on jelly roll pan. Cover with foil. Bake about 10 minutes
