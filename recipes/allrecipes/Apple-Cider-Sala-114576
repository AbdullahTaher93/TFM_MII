In a small saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over 1/4 cup of cider; let stand for 2 minutes. Add lemon juice, sugar, salt and remaining cider. Cook and stir over medium heat until sugar and gelatin are dissolved. Cover and refrigerate until slightly thickened, about 2-1/2 hours. Fold in apples and walnuts. Transfer to a 2-qt. serving bowl. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
