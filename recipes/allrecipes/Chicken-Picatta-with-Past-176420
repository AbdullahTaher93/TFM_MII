Slice chicken across grain into 1/2-inch-thick strips; sprinkle evenly with paprika, then set aside. In a medium-size bowl, combine lemon juice, wine, broth, and capers. Stir in cornstarch until mixture is smooth. Bring about 3 quarts water to a boil in a 6-quart pan over high heat; stir in fettuccine and cook, uncovered, until just tender to bite (4 to 5 minutes). Meanwhile, combine oil and butter in a wide nonstick frying pan over high heat. When hot, add about half the chicken; stir-fry until pieces are slightly browned and still faintly pink in the center (cut to test), 2 to 3 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer cooked chicken to a bowl. Repeat to cook remaining chicken, then return cooked chicken to pan. Stir sauce ingredients to mix, then pour mixture into the pan with the chicken. Cook, stirring, until sauce boils rapidly; season to taste with salt and pepper. Drain pasta and serve topped with chicken and sauce. Garnish with parsley.
