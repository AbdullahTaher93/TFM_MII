Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bring water and salt to a boil in a pot; add barley. Reduce heat to low and cover the pot; cook until water is absorbed and barley is softened, about 20 minutes. Toss sweet potatoes with olive oil and Cajun seasoning in a bowl; spread onto a baking sheet. Roast sweet potatoes in the preheated oven for 15 minutes; flip and continue cooking until tender, about 10 minutes more. Combine black beans and coconut milk in a saucepan over medium heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through and coconut milk thickens, 7 to 10 minutes. Heat canola oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute kale until slightly wilted, about 5 minutes. Divide kale between 2 plates. Spoon barley over kale; top with black bean mixture and sweet potatoes.
