Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and rinse under cold water. Combine peas, water chestnuts, imitation crabmeat, mayonnaise, chives, and dill in a large bowl; stir until evenly mixed. Add cooled pasta and mix until coated.
