In a large bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. In a microwave-safe bowl, melt chocolate and butter; cool slightly. Stir in the egg substitute, walnuts and vanilla. Stir into the dry ingredients. Pour into an 8-in. square baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. Dust with confectioners' sugar if desired. Cut into bars.
