Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with margarine. Pour peaches and heavy syrup into the prepared baking dish. Spread cake mix evenly over peaches. Arrange butter pats in even rows on the cake mix. Bake in the preheated oven until top of cake is golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.
