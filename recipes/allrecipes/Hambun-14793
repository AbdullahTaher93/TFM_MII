Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl combine the ham, cheese, green onion, olives, eggs, mayonnaise, salt and pepper. Mix all together. Spoon mixture into buns and wrap each bun separately in a piece of aluminum foil. Place wrapped buns on a cookie sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Unwrap and enjoy!
