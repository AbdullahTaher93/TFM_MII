Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a food processor, combine the flour and baking powder. Add the water and 2/3 cup olive oil and process until smooth and well blended. Remove; knead into a ball, cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 10 minutes or until ready to use. Thoroughly clean and rinse the greens. Dry in a towel. Chop roughly and set aside. In a large saute pan on medium high, heat 1/2 cup olive oil. Add leeks and onions; saute until soft. Add the green onions and saute about 2 minutes. Add the chopped greens and cook until wilted. In a large bowl, mix the cooked greens with the dill, parsley, mint, feta cheese and pepper. Taste to see if the cheese has added enough salt; if not, add a touch of salt. Divide the dough into 4 pieces. On a floured surface, roll out each piece of dough as thinly as possible into a rectangle. Brush the dough lightly with the remaining oil and put 3/4 cup to 1 cup of the filling lengthwise in the center of each rectangle. Roll the dough and filling up like a cylinder. Place it seam-down on a large buttered baking sheet, bent in an arc. Repeat this process, placing the arcs next to each other to form one large coil. Brush the coil with olive oil and poke small holes in it with a fork. Reduce the oven heat to 375 degrees and bake until golden brown, about 35 to 40 minutes. Serve warm.
