Rinse dry beans. Soak beans overnight in 6 cups water in a covered 4- to 6-quart Dutch oven. (Or bring beans and water to boiling. Reduce heat and simmer for 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Cover and let stand for 1 hour.) Drain and rinse beans. Add 6 cups fresh water and ham bone or pork hocks to same pan. Bring to boiling. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 hour. Remove ham bone or pork hocks. When cool enough to handle, cut meat off bones. Discard bones and coarsely chop meat. Return meat to pan. Add thyme or sage, if desired. Add onion, seasoned salt, celery salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Return to boiling. Reduce heat and simmer for 45 to 60 minutes or till beans are tender.
