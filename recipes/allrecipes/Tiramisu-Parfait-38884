Reserve 4 wafers for garnish. Coarsely break remaining wafers; place in small bowl. Drizzle with coffee; mix lightly. Beat cream cheese, sugar and vanilla in medium bowl with electric mixer at medium speed until creamy. Gently stir in 1-1/2 cups of the whipped topping. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese mixture into each of 4 (12 oz.) parfait glasses; top with 1 to 2 tablespoons soaked wafer pieces. Repeat layers. Cover with remaining cream cheese mixture. Refrigerate at least 1 hour. Top with remaining 1/2 cup whipped topping and 4 reserved wafers. Garnish with coffee beans and unsweetened cocoa powder, if desired.
