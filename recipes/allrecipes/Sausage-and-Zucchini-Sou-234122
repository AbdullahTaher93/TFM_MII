Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage, celery, and onion in the hot skillet until sausage is completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir zucchini, diced tomatoes, chicken broth, Italian seasoning, and garlic salt into the sausage mixture. Place pot over low heat and cook mixture at a simmer until the zucchini is tender, about 25 minutes. Top individual servings with Cheddar cheese.
