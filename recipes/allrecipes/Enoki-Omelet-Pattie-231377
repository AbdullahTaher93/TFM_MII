Mix mushrooms, green onion, and carrot together in a large bowl. Add eggs to mushroom mixture; stir until well combined. Season with white pepper; mix well. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Spoon about 2 tablespoons egg mixture for each patty into hot oil. Press patties lightly with the back of a spatula. Cook until bottom of patty is solid enough to flip, about 50 seconds. Flip and cook other side is lightly browned, 10 to 15 seconds. Repeat with remaining egg mixture.
