In a skillet, cook the beef, onion, green pepper and garlic over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain and set aside. In a saucepan, bring tomato sauce and Italian seasoning to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir 1/2 cup into the meat mixture; keep remaining sauce warm. Unroll pizza crust on a floured surface. Roll into a 12-in. square; cut into four squares. Spread cream cheese over each to within 1/2 in. of edges. Top with meat mixture. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese, mushrooms and olives. Fold dough over filling, forming a triangle; press edges with a fork to seal. Place on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Serve with the remaining sauce.
