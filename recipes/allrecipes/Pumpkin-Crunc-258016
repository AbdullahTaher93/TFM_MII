Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan. Stir pumpkin puree, evaporated milk, sugar, eggs, and cinnamon together in a large bowl until smooth. Pour into the prepared baking pan. Sprinkle cake mix over the pumpkin mixture in the baking pan. Pour melted butter on top. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 1 hour to 10 minutes.
