In a large bowl, combine the tomatoes, zucchini, onion, yellow pepper and garlic. Drizzle with oil; toss to coat. Place in a 13-inch x 9-inch x 2-inch baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 450 degrees F for 20 minutes. Stir in sausage. Bake 5-8 minutes longer or until vegetables are crisp-tender and sausage is hot. Meanwhile, cook fettuccine according to package directions; drain. Add fettuccine and feta cheese to sausage mixture; toss to combine. Serve immediately.
