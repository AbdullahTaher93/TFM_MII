Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In large bowl, break up cookie dough. Stir in brown sugar, 1 1/4 teaspoons cinnamon, the ginger, nutmeg and orange peel until well combined. Stir in white chocolate baking bars, pecans and crystallized ginger. On ungreased cookie sheets, drop dough by 1/4 cupfuls 3 inches apart. Bake 13 to 17 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Cool 2 minutes. Remove from cookie sheets to cooling racks. Cool completely, about 15 minutes. In small bowl, blend powdered sugar, 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon and enough orange juice for desired drizzling consistency. Drizzle glaze over cooled cookies. Let stand until glaze is set.
