Sprinkle the celery and green onions into the bottom of a slow cooker; place the turkey chunks on top. Combine the pineapple juice, sweet chile sauce, vinegar, water, beef bouillon, and garlic powder; pour over the turkey. Place the pineapple rings on the turkey chunks. Cook on Low until the turkey pulls apart easily, 6 to 7 hours. Meanwhile, make the coleslaw by stirring the mayonnaise, lemon juice, parsley, and onion together in a mixing bowl. Add the cabbage and Cheddar cheese; season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover, and refrigerate while the turkey cooks. Once the turkey is tender, shred using two forks. Pile some of the shredded turkey and a pineapple ring onto a Kaiser roll; top with coleslaw to serve.
