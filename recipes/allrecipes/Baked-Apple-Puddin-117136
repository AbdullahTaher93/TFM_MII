In a mixing bowl, beat together the butter, sugar and egg until blended. In a bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, salt, nutmeg and cinnamon; gradually add to the sugar mixture and mix well. Stir in the apples, walnuts and vanilla until well combined. Spread mixture into an 8-in. square baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until pudding is lightly browned and springs back when lightly touched. Serve warm with frozen yogurt.
