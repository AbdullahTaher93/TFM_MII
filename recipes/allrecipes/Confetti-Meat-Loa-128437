Cook rice according to package directions. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Warm oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add onion and bell peppers. Cook 5 minutes, or until tender. In a large bowl, combine meat, salsa, egg substitute or egg, salt, black pepper, and celery seeds. Stir in vegetables and rice. Place mixture in a round baking dish and pat into an oblong loaf. Bake 45 to 50 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted in the center registers 160 degrees F and meat is no longer pink.
