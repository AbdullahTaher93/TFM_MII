Place butter in a small microwave-safe bowl and heat in a microwave oven at full (100%) power until melted, 30 to 60 seconds. Rinse fish, pat dry, and, if fillets are attached, cut apart. Coat fish on all sides with about 1 tablespoon butter total and lay skin side down in a single layer in 2 pans, each 10 by 15 inches. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven until fish is opaque but still moist-looking in center of thickest part (cut to test), 8 to 10 minutes, switching pan positions after 4 minutes. With a wide spatula, transfer fish to plates. To remaining butter, add parsley, capers, lemon peel, lemon juice, and garlic. Heat in microwave oven at full power until bubbling, about 30 seconds. Drizzle fish with butter mixture. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve with lemon wedges to squeeze over fish.
