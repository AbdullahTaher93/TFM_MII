In a bowl, dissolve the gelatin in 1 cup boiling water. Stir in 1/4 cup cold water. Pour into an ungreased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Refrigerate until firm. Repeat with strawberry gelatin and remaining boiling and cold water. When gelatin is set, cut into cubes. Just before serving, gently combine gelatin cubes and pears in a large glass bowl or individual dishes.
