Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray large baking sheet with cooking spray. Place two tortillas on the baking sheet. Sprinkle tortilla with half of the cheese, then layer on shrimp, salsa and cilantro. Sprinkle with remaining cheese; top with remaining tortillas to make quesadillas. Brush tops of quesadillas with the butter. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until light golden brown and hot. Cut each into 8 wedges and set out additional salsa for dipping.
