Cut a pocket in the side of each chicken breast. Season inside and out with salt and pepper. Blend chili sauce with onions and brush half inside each pocket. Fill pockets with equal amounts of ham and cheese. Stitch pockets tightly closed using toothpicks. Preheat grill to medium high and grease lightly. Stir butter with olive oil, cider vinegar, honey and thyme. Brush chicken all over with some of this mixture. Set the chicken on the grill and reduce the heat to medium. Grill the chicken, covered, for 8 to 10 minutes. Turn and brush with remaining glaze. Grill, covered, for 8 to 10 minutes longer or until cooked through.
