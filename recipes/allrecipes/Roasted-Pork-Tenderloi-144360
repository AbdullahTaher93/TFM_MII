Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Heat oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle pork with pepper and salt. Add to the pan and brown on all sides, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven; bake until the pork has just a hint of pink in the center and an instant-read thermometer registers 155 degrees F, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer the pork to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. (The internal temperature will increase to 160 degrees F during resting.) To serve, cut the pork into thin slices.
