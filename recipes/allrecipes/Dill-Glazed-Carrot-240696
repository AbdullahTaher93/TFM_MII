Combine carrots, water, butter, vinegar, salt, and pepper in a skillet; bring liquid to a boil. Cover skillet, reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is evaporated and carrots are tender and glazed, about 20 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and stir dill and honey into carrots.
