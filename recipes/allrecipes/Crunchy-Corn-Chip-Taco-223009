Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brown the ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease; stir in water and taco seasoning mix. Reduce heat to low and simmer the meat mixture until thickened, 4 to 6 minutes. Bake taco shells on a baking sheet in the preheated oven until crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Let cool for about 5 minutes and break apart into bite-size pieces. Transfer seasoned ground beef to a large serving bowl and mix in the nacho cheese corn chips, taco shell pieces, Mexican cheese blend, and hot pepper sauce.
