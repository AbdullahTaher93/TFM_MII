Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut the lemon in half and juice into a small bowl. Remove seeds. Reserve juice and rind. Cut the broccoli into spears. Trim off the ends of the asparagus. In a large roasting pan with a rack, pour in as much boiling water as you can without submerging the rack. Add the Old Bay seasoning and the lemon rinds into the water. Place in the rack and stack on the crab legs, broccoli and asparagus. Then strategically place the shrimp and scallops on top of things such that they won't fall thru the rack into the liquid. Cover and place in a 350 degrees F oven and steam for about 12 minutes. Meanwhile melt the butter with the herbs. Keep warm until ready to serve. Add the lemon juice just before serving. Using tongs transfer to a serving platter. A platter that has a lid is wonderful but everything in this meal is still fine when they cool off to room temperature.
