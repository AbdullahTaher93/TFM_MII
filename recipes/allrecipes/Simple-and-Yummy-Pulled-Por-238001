Put pork in the bottom of a pressure cooker. Pour root beer over the pork. Lock the lid onto the pressure cooker and place over a burner on high. Cook pork for 45 minutes. Release pressure from the pressure cooker according to manufacturer's directions before checking meat for tenderness; it should be tender enough to easily pull apart. If the pork is not yet done enough, again lock the lid on the cooker and continue cooking over high heat another 30 minutes. Release pressure from the cooker; drain liquid and transfer meat to a large bowl. Pull pork into strands using two forks. Pour barbeque sauce over the pork; stir to coat.
