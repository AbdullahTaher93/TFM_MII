In a saucepan, combine brown sugar, flour, water, lemon juice and salt; stir until smooth. Bring to a boil; boil and stir for 2 minutes. Add apples; return to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 10-12 minutes or until apples are tender. Remove from the heat; add butter and vanilla. Stir until butter is melted. Serve warm or at room temperature over ice cream. Topping can also be served over pound cake or gingerbread.
