In a medium bowl, whisk the egg white until frothy. Whisk in the cornstarch, 1 tablespoon of the sherry and 1 teaspoon of salt. Add the chicken breasts and toss to coat. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium saucepan, cover the jasmine rice with 2 cups of water and bring to a boil. Cover the saucepan and cook over low heat for 12 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the rice stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff the rice and transfer to a large rimmed baking sheet; spread it out in an even layer. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate until chilled. Spread the sliced almonds in a pie pan and bake for about 4 minutes, or until pale golden. Let cool. In a medium saucepan of boiling salted water, cook the rice cakes until tender but still chewy, about 7 minutes. Drain and spread them out on a large plate. Add 4 cups of water and 1 tablespoon of oil to the saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the chicken and simmer over low heat, stirring once or twice, until the outside turns white, about 25 seconds; drain. In a bowl, mix the mushrooms with the lemon juice. In a wok, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil until shimmering. Add the onion and cook over moderate heat until translucent, 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and stir-fry until fragrant, 4 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook over moderately high heat until softened, 3 minutes. Add the chicken and rice cakes, season with salt and pepper and stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of sherry and simmer for 10 seconds. Add the rice and heat through. Add the almonds and daikon and toss again. Stir in the coconut milk. Off the heat, season with salt and pepper and a drizzle of sesame oil. Serve at once.
