Place raw chicken in a large stockpot. Add parsnips, carrots, celery, onion, dill, and parsley to the stockpot; cover with water, and boil until the chicken is 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) or begins to fall apart, about 1 hour. Remove chicken from the stock and set aside for another use. Whisk together eggs and oil in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Add matzo meal to the bowl with eggs and oil, stirring until well combined. Cover and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Remove matzo mixture from the refrigerator and gently hand-roll into 1 inch balls. Be careful not to over-roll as this can make the matzo balls tough. In a separate pot, heat chicken stock. Place matzo balls into the stock and simmer until they are soft, at least 1 hour. Transfer the matzo balls into the soup pot with the vegetables. Season with salt and pepper to taste. To serve, place pieces of the roasted chicken into soup bowls and ladle the chicken soup with matzo balls over it. Enjoy!
