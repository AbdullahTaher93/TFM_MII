In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar until fluffy. Add milk and vanilla; mix well. Add flour. Fold in the cherries and pecans. Shape dough into two 8-in. x 2-in. rolls; wrap in waxed paper and freeze. To bake, unwrap and let stand at room temperature for about 10 minutes. Cut into 1/4-in. slices. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on wire racks.
