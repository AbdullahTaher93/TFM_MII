Thoroughly wash the escarole. Cut or tear into bite size pieces. Dry in a salad spinner. Remove the casing or 'skin' from the sausage (and trim the ends, if desired). Cut into 4 equal lengths. Each length will be one serving. Then cut each length into 5 or 6 thin slices. Crush, peel and chop the garlic. Add garlic to a large bowl with the mustard, vinegar, oil and salt & pepper. Whisk thoroughly. Add the escarole and toss until well coated. Divide the escarole onto 4 plates. Arrange the sausage on each plate and serve.
