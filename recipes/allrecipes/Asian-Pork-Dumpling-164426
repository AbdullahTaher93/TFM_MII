Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In large bowl, mix all ingredients except biscuits and sweet-and-sour sauce. Remove 1 can of biscuits from refrigerator just before filling (keep remaining can of biscuits refrigerated). Separate each biscuit into 3 layers. Press each layer into 3 1/2-inch round, being careful not to tear dough. Spoon 1 rounded tablespoon of pork filling on center of each dough round. Bring all sides of dough up over filling, stretching gently if necessary, and gather in center above filling to form a dumpling; press gathered dough to seal. On ungreased large cookie sheet, place 24 dumplings 2 inches apart.* Bake 17 to 27 minutes or until thermometer inserted in center reads 160 degrees F** and sides and tops of dumplings are golden brown. Repeat to make remaining dumplings. Serve warm with sweet-and-sour sauce.
