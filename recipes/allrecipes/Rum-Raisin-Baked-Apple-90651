Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Core apples using an apple corer. Arrange apples slightly apart in a shallow baking dish just large enough to hold them without crowding. In a small bowl, mix raisins, butter, nutmeg, and brown sugar; press a fourth of the mixture into center of each apple, mounding any excess on top. Drizzle with rum. Bake until apples are tender when pierced (35 to 40 minutes). Serve hot or warm; add a dollop of whipped cream or vanilla yogurt to taste, if desired.
