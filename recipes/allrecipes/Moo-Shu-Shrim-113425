Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Stack and wrap the tortillas in foil and heat until warmed through. Heat a large wok or skillet until very hot to the touch. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and heat until smoking. Add the shrimp and stir-fry over high heat until lightly browned and cooked through, about 2 minutes. Scrape the shrimp onto a large platter. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil to the wok. Stir the eggs, season them with salt and pepper and add to the wok. Cook, stirring, until large soft curds form, about 2 minutes. Scrape the eggs onto the platter with the shrimp. Add 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil to the wok. Add the ginger, garlic and mushrooms and stir-fry over high heat until lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the coleslaw mix and scallions, season with salt and pepper and stir-fry until the cabbage is just wilted but still crunchy, about 4 minutes. Return the shrimp and egg to the wok, add the 1 tablespoon of hoisin sauce and stir-fry just until combined. Transfer the moo shu shrimp to a large bowl and serve with the warmed tortillas, cilantro leaves and hoisin sauce.
