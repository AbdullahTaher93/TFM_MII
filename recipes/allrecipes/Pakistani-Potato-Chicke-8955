Heat vegetable oil in a pot over medium heat. Stir in garlic paste and ginger; cook and stir for about 1 minute. Add the minced chile, cumin, salt, and yogurt. Stir in chicken pieces and bell pepper. Cover pot and simmer over low heat, until the oil separates and chicken is mostly cooked, 20 to 30 minutes. Mix in potatoes; add a little water, if necessary. Cook on low heat until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes more. Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve.
