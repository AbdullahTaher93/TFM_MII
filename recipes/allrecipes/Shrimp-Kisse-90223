Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place a small piece of cheese into the butterflied opening of each shrimp. Wrap half of a slice of bacon around each one to conceal the cheese, securing with toothpicks. Place on a cookie sheet. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until bacon is browned.
