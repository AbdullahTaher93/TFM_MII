Place stuffing mix in a blender and pulse until crumbly; mix with pecans and Parmesan cheese on a plate. Combine cornstarch and flour on a separate plate, mixing with a fork. Beat egg in a shallow bowl. Preheat an electric skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) or over medium-high heat; add coconut oil. Pat swai fish dry with a paper towel. Press fillets, 1 at a time, in the flour mixture, shaking off excess. Dip each fillet in the egg, allowing excess to drip back onto plate; press into stuffing mixture until evenly coated. Cook fillets in the hot coconut oil until lightly browned and fish flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
