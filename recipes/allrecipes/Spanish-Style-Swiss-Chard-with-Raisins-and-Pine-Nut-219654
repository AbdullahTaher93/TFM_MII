Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and pour in enough water to reach just below the bottom of the insert. Bring the water to a boil. Add the chard and steam until just tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and set aside. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook the raisins and pine nuts in the hot oil until the pine nuts turn golden, about 5 minutes. Add the chard, season with salt and pepper, and continue cooking while stirring constantly until the chard is hot, about 2 minutes.
