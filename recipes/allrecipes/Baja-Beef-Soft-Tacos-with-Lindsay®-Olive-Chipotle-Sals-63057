Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add yellow onion; saute for 3 minutes. Add garlic; saute for 1 minute. Add beef; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned completely, about 6 minutes. Stir in canned tomatoes, chiles and seasoning. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Set aside; keep hot. To make the salsa, in a medium bowl combine the olives, fresh tomato, red onion, chipotle in adobo, lime juice and cilantro; set aside. For each serving, down the center of each of 2 tortillas, layer 1/4 cup lettuce, 1/2 cup meat mixture, 2 tablespoons cheese and 1/4 cup salsa. Fold over and serve.
