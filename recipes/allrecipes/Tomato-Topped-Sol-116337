In a small skillet, saute onion in oil until tender. Transfer to a greased 1-qt. baking dish. Place fillet over onions. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Top with tomato slices. Combine butter and garlic powder; pour over tomato. Sprinkle with parsley. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 14-18 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
