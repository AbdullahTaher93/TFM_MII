Place candy cups on baking sheet. Place 1 cup milk chocolate morsels in small, heavy-duty plastic bag. Microwave on Medium-High (70%) power for 1 minute; knead. Microwave at 10- to 20-second intervals, kneading until smooth. Cut small corner from bag and squeeze bag to pipe chocolate about 1/4-inch deep into about half of the candy cups. Place a peanut (if using SWIRLED Milk Chocolate & Peanut Butter Morsels) or a pecan (if using SWIRLED Milk Chocolate & Caramel Morsels) and 5 to 6 SWIRLED Morsels into the chocolate. Press down slightly. Melt remaining milk chocolate morsels in another plastic bag. Finish filling the remaining paper cups with melted chocolate, nuts and morsels. Refrigerate for a few minutes to set chocolate. Store in airtight container in refrigerator.
