Heat oven to 425 degrees F. In 12-inch nonstick skillet, cook chorizo over medium heat 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until no longer pink. Remove chorizo with slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. Drain all but 1 tablespoon drippings from skillet. Place chorizo in medium bowl; add green chiles, salsa, chipotle chile and adobo sauce; stir until well mixed. Set aside. Spray 13x9-inch pan with CRISCO(R) Original No-Stick Cooking Spray. Unroll pizza crust dough in pan; press dough to edges of pan. Prick pizza crust thoroughly with fork. Brush reserved 1 tablespoon chorizo drippings evenly over crust. Bake 8 to 9 minutes or until edges are light golden brown. Spread chorizo mixture over partially baked crust. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake 8 to 10 minutes longer or until crust is deep golden brown. Meanwhile, wipe out skillet. In skillet, melt 1 to 2 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat until hot. Break eggs and slip into skillet. Immediately reduce heat to low. Cover; cook 7 to 10 minutes or until whites and yolks are firm, not runny (eggs will cook together in skillet). Cut pizza into 8 pieces. Separate eggs. Top each serving with 1 fried egg; sprinkle with cilantro. Serve with avocado slices.
