Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage, beef, and onion in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Transfer meat mixture to a large pot and add Cheddar cheese, tomatoes with green chile peppers, cream cheese, picante sauce, garlic powder, and cumin. Heat cheese mixture over medium-high heat. Gradually stir in processed cheese until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.
