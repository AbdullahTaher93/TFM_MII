Let stand for 1 minute. Blot top of beef with additional white paper towels. Transfer beef mixture to fine mesh strainer over a 1-1/2-qt. bowl. Pour hot water over beef. Drain for 5 minutes. In a large saucepan, combine spaghetti sauce, beans, tomatoes, corn, salsa, chilies, chili powder, salt and pepper. Stir in beef mixture. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 10-15 minutes. Serve over spaghetti.
