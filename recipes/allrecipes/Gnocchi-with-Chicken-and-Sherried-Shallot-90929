In a 5- to 6-quart pan over medium-high heat, combine shallots, sherry, and butter. Stir until shallots are limp and sherry is almost completely evaporated, about 10 minutes. Add sour cream and chicken broth to pan; whisk until smooth. Add gnocchi, chicken, and parsley. Stir until heated through, about 5 minutes. Spoon into bowls and season to taste with nutmeg and salt.
