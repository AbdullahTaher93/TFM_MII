Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix salsa, Cheddar cheese, Parmesan cheese, black beans, and cilantro together in a bowl. Spoon salsa mixture on the center of 1 tortilla and spread evenly. Place remaining tortilla on top of filling. Arrange quesadilla on a baking sheet and brush top tortilla with butter. Bake in the preheated oven until top begins to brown and cheese is melted, 9 to 12 minutes. Slice quesadilla with a pizza cutter; garnish with guacamole and red bell pepper.
