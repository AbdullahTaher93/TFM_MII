Bring the shucked clams, clam juice, and chicken stock to a simmer in a large pot over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 15 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion and celery; cook and stir until the vegetables are tender. Stir the onion mixture and potatoes into the clams. Season with dill, black pepper, salt, cayenne pepper, and hot pepper sauce. Simmer 15 minutes longer. Sprinkle with parsley to serve.
