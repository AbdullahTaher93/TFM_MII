Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a dry skillet, toast walnuts over medium-high heat for 1 to 2 minutes. In a large bowl, combine all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Whisk to combine. In a medium bowl, combine sugar, lemon zest, buttermilk, eggs, vanilla, melted butter and oil. Whisk just to combine. Make a well in center of dry ingredients. Add liquid ingredients and mix gently just to combine; do not over-mix. Gently fold in walnuts and blueberries. Pour batter into a greased and floured 8 x 4-inch loaf pan. Bake in preheated oven for 55 to 60 minutes or until tester inserted in center comes out clean. Cool on rack for 20 minutes; remove from pan, cool to room temperature. To make the glaze, combine sugar and lemon juice in a small saucepan. Bring to boil over high heat, then reduce heat and continue stirring until sugar dissolves. Brush glaze over bread while still warm.
