Melt butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place shredded sweet potatoes and onion in the pan; cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until sweet potatoes are tender and onion is translucent, about 10 minutes. Stir in the chipotle chile powder, garlic powder, and brown sugar. Cook, uncovered, until potatoes are golden brown on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Turn and allow the potatoes to brown on the other side.
