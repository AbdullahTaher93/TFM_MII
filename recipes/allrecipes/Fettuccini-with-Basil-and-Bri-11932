In a large bowl combine chopped tomatoes, minced garlic, brie, chopped basil, olive oil, vinegar, salt and pepper. Mix well. Cover and let stand at room temperature to marinate for 1 to 2 hours. In a large pot of boiling salted water over high heat, cook the fettuccine until al dente, about 12 minutes. Drain the fettuccine and toss with the sauce. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese.
