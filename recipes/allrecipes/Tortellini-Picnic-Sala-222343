Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook tortellini in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until pasta floats to the surface, about 5 minutes. Drain. Mix tortellini, feta cheese, tomatoes, olives, walnuts, green onions, and garlic together in a large bowl. Whisk vinegar, olive oil, and basil together in a separate small bowl. Pour dressing over tortellini mixture; toss to coat. Sprinkle with salt. Chill in refrigerator for 1 hour before serving.
