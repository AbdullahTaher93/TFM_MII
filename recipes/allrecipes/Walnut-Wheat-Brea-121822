In a large mixing bowl, combine 3/4 cup all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, walnuts, brown sugar, yeast and salt. In a saucepan, heat water, yogurt and margarine to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F; stir into flour mixture. Add enough of the remaining all-purpose to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into thirds. Shape each portion into a 15-in. rope. Place the ropes on a greased baking sheet and braid; pinch ends to seal and tuck under. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 23-28 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to cool on a wire rack.
