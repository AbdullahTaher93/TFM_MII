Stir the soup, garlic powder, chili powder and chicken in a 3 1/2- to 4-quart slow cooker. Cover and cook on LOW for 6 to 7 hours or until the chicken is cooked through. Mash the beans with a fork in a medium bowl and stir into the chicken mixture. Spoon about 1/2 cup of the chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Top with the lettuce and tomato. Fold the tortillas around the filling.
