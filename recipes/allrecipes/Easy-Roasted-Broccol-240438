Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut broccoli florets from the stalk. Peel the stalk and slice into 1/4-inch slices. Mix florets and stem pieces with olive oil in a bowl and transfer to a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. Roast in the preheated oven until broccoli is tender and lightly browned, about 18 minutes.
