In a food processor add the walnuts and chop. Transfer to a bowl. Then add the garlic, parsley and about 1 table of the walnut oil to the food processor. Begin to puree. When well blended add the mint leaves and turn on again slowly drizzling the walnut oil into the food processor until everything is well blended. You may need to stop a couple of times to scrape down the sides. Add the mint puree to the walnuts. Add the cheese and stir well. Taste to see if it needs a pinch of salt (depends on the saltiness of the cheese) or even a bit of Splenda.
