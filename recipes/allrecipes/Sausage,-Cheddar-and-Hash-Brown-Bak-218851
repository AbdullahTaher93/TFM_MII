Press hash browns onto the bottom and up the sides of a greased 13-inch x 9-inch baking dish. In a skillet, cook sausage and onion over medium heat until sausage is no longer pink; drain. Spoon over hash browns. In a large bowl, beat the eggs, milk, parsley, salt and pepper. Pour over sausage mixture. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 35 minutes. Uncover; bake 20-25 minutes longer or until center is set. Sprinkle with cheese; bake 5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted. Let stand 5 minutes before cutting.
