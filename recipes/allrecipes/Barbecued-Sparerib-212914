Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Season the spareribs with the salt and pepper. Pour the water into the bottom of a large baking dish and lay the spareribs in the dish; cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; pour about half the chili sauce over the meat, cover, and return to oven. Brush the ribs with more chili sauce every 5 minutes, and continue cooking until the meat pulls away easily from the bone, about 30 minutes more. Serve hot or cold.
