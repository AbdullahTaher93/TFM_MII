Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Roll out pizza dough as directed on package. Spread the pesto evenly on the crust. Arrange mozzarella slices over the pesto; scatter prosciutto over the mozzarella. Sprinkle pizza with the fresh parsley, fresh basil, and grated Parmesan. Bake in preheated oven, until crust is browned and pizza is hot and bubbly, about 10 minutes.
