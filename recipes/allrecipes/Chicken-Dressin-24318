Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large saucepan, bring the chicken broth to a boil. In a large bowl combine the crumbled cornbread and biscuits. Pour in 3 cups of boiling broth; cover and let stand. Meanwhile, heat margarine in a medium skillet over medium heat. Saute celery and onions until tender. Stir into cornbread mixture. To the cornbread mixture add the remaining broth, eggs, sage and black pepper. Pour into a large iron skillet or roasting pan. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until set and well browned.
