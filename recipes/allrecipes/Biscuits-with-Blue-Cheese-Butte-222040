Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Separate biscuits and cut into quarters; place biscuit pieces into prepared baking dish. Mix unsalted butter and blue cheese together in a bowl until thoroughly combined and brush the butter mixture over the biscuits. Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Pull apart to serve.
