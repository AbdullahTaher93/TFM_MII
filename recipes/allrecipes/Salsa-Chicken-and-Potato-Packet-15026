Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place each chicken breast in the middle of a square piece of foil. Pour 1/4 cup salsa over each breast. Slice the potatoes thin and place potato slices on top of chicken and salsa. Spoon another 1/4 cup salsa over each chicken/potato combination. Fold foil up to form 'packets'. Place packets seam side up on a cookie sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Open packets and serve.
