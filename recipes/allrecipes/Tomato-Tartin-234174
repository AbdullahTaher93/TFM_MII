Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Rub 1 side of each baguette slice with the cut-side of halved garlic and drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Arrange baguettes slices, oil-side up, on a baking sheet. Place baking sheet on the middle rack of preheated oven and bake until baguette slices are golden, about 7 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool, leaving oven on. Toss tomatoes, basil, and minced garlic together with 4 teaspoons olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper in a bowl until coated. Mix goat cheese, garlic and herb cheese spread, and ricotta cheese together in a separate bowl. Spread cheese mixture onto cooled baguette slices; top with tomato mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese melts, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.
