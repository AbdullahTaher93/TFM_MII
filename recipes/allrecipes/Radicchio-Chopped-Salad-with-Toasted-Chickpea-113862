Preheat the broiler. Roast the bell pepper under the broiler or over an open flame, turning, until charred all over. Transfer the pepper to a bowl, cover with a plate and let steam for 5 minutes. Peel, seed and core the pepper and cut it into 1/2-inch dice. In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Add the pancetta and cook over low heat, stirring, until lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pancetta to a plate. Add half the chickpeas to the skillet and cook over moderately high heat, shaking the skillet, until the chickpeas are lightly browned and slightly crisp, 3 to 4 minutes; transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining chickpeas. In a small bowl, combine the Prosecco with the vinegar, garlic and the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Return the pancetta and chickpeas to the skillet and rewarm them in the oven for 3 minutes. In a large bowl, toss the radicchio with the arugula, provolone, pancetta, chickpeas and roasted red pepper. Add the dressing, toss well and serve at once.
