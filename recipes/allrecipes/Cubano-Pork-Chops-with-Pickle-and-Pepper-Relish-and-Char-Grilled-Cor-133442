Preheat a grill or a grill pan to medium-high. In a shallow dish, combine the lime zest, brown sugar, grill seasoning, cumin, coriander and allspice and 3 tablespoons of the EVOO. Add the pork chops to the dish and turn to coat evenly. Let the chops hang out for 5 minutes, then grill until the meat feels firm and the juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes on each side with the grill top closed. If using a grill pan, tent the pan with aluminum foil and adjust the heat to prevent scorching. While the chops are working, mix together the pickles and peppers and reserve. In a small bowl, stir together the softened butter and tomatillo salsa until combined. Drizzle a touch of EVOO onto the corn and rub it over the corn. (Wait until you turn those chops before you add the corn to the fire.) Grill the corn with the grill lid closed until charred and cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes, or cook the corn in the tented grill pan. Serve the chops with the pickle-and-pepper relish on top and the grilled corn alongside. Slather the corn with the tomatillo butter.
