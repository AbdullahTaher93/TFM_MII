Arrange frozen chicken breasts on a lightly oiled baking sheet and broil 6 to 8 inches from heat until done, 4 to 5 minutes per side (internal temperature should be 165 degrees F). When meat is cool, tear chicken into bite-size pieces. In a bowl, combine celery, onion, chutney, mayonnaise, and curry powder; add chicken and mix well. If making ahead, cover and chill up to 4 hours. Mix cashews with chicken salad. Gently open bread pockets. Tuck a lettuce leaf into each pocket and fill with equal portions of salad.
