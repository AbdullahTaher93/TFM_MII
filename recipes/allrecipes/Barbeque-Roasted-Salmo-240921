Place salmon in a resealable bag and add lemon juice; marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking dish with aluminum foil and spray foil with cooking spray. Blend brown sugar, chili powder, lemon zest, oil, cumin, cinnamon, and salt together in a blender until brown sugar mixture is smooth. Remove salmon from bag and discard bag and lemon juice. Spread brown sugar mixture over salmon and place in the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 12 to 15 minutes.
