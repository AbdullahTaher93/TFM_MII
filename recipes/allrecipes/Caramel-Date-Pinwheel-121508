In a mixing bowl, cream butter and brown sugar. Beat in egg and vanilla. Combine flour, baking soda and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, combine dates, sugar and water. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in walnuts and cherries. Cool completely. Divide dough in half; roll one portion between two sheets of waxed paper into a 12-in. x 10-in. rectangle. Spread with half of the filling. Roll up into a tight jelly roll, starting with a long side; wrap in waxed paper. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until firm. Cut into 3/8-in. slices with a sharp knife; place 1 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.
