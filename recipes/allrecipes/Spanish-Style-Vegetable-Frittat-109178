Preheat the broiler in your oven. In a large nonstick pan with an ovenproof handle, heat oil over medium heat. Add potatoes and garlic; cook until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Add onions, pepper and zucchini; continue cooking, seasoning generously with salt and pepper, until vegetables are tender-crisp, 5 to 7 minutes longer. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, 1 teaspoon of oregano and cayenne pepper. Season with salt and pepper. Remove pan from heat; pour egg mixture over vegetables; top with tomatoes and sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese and oregano. Place in oven; broil until set, 4 to 5 minutes. Set aside to rest for a minute or two before sliding it out of the pan onto a cutting board. Slice into wedges and serve.
