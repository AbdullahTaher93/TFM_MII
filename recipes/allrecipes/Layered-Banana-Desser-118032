In a bowl, whisk milk and pudding mix for 2 minutes. Let stand for 2 minutes or until soft-set. Fold in half of the whipped topping. Place nine graham cracker squares in an ungreased 8-in. square dish. Top with half of the pudding mixture and half of the banana slices. Repeat layers. Spread with remaining whipped topping. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.
