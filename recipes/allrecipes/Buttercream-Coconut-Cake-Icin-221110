Beat butter and shortening with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth; beat in vanilla extract. Gradually beat confectioners' sugar into butter mixture until well blended. The mixture will appear dry. Stir enough milk into butter mixture to achieve desired consistency for icing. Fold half the coconut into the icing; spread icing over cake. Sprinkle remaining coconut and pecans over icing.
