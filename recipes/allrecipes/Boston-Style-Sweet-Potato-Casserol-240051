Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread sweet potatoes onto baking sheets in a single layer. Roast sweet potatoes in preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour. Cool potatoes completely before mashing with a potato masher until smooth. Measure 6 cups mashed sweet potato into a large mixing bowl. Reserve remainder of sweet potato for another use. Stir 3/4 cup brown sugar, heavy cream, melted butter, 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, and salt with the mashed sweet potato until smooth; spread into an 8-inch square baking dish. Mix oats, 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar, flour, and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl. Cut butter into the oats mixture until crumbly in consistency; spread over the top of the sweet potato mixture to cover. Bake in preheated oven until the top begins to brown slightly, about 1 hour. Spread mini marshmallows over the top of the casserole, turn oven off, and let casserole sit in oven until the marshmallows are melted and slightly browned, about 10 minutes.
