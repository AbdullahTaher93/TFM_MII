Mix the cabbage and carrot together in a bowl. Stir the egg and soy sauce into the vegetables and mix until combined. Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Make a patty with the vegetable mixture the size of a slice of bread. Place the patty into the skillet, and cook until browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Place the patty between two slices of toasted bread to serve.
