Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place salami and bacon in the skillet; cook until just starting to crisp. Stir in garlic and leek; season with salt and pepper, and cook 2 minutes more. Stir in tomatoes and 1 tablespoon basil; cook 1 minute more. Mix the cooked pasta into the contents of the skillet, along with 3 tablespoons Parmesan. Serve topped with remaining Parmesan and basil.
