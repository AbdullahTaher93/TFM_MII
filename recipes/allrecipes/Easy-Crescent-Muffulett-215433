Separate or cut dough into 2 long rectangles. Place long sides together on large ungreased cookie sheet; press into 15x12-inch rectangle (if using crescent rolls, press perforations to seal). Layer ham, salami, roasted peppers and cheese down center of rectangle. Fold short and long sides of dough over filling; pinch edges to seal. Place seam side down on cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F 14 to 18 minutes.
