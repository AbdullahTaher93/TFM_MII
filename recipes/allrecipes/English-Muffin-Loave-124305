In a mixing bowl, combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, cinnamon, salt and baking soda. Add orange juice, water and oil; beat on low speed until moistened. Beat on high for 3 minutes. Stir in the pecans, apricots and remaining flour to form a stiff batter. Do not knead. Greased two 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans; sprinkle with cornmeal. Spoon batter into pans; sprinkle with cornmeal. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown. Immediately remove from pans to cool on wire racks. Slice and toast.
