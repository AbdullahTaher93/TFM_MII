Sprinkle the inside of the goose with salt. Prick skin well; set aside. In a skillet, saute the celery and onion in butter; transfer to a large bowl. Add the apples, raisins, bread, sugar and salt. In a small bowl, beat eggs, cider and water. Pour over bread mixture and toss lightly. Stuff into the goose. Place with breast side up on a rack in a large shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 3 to 3-1/2 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 185 degrees F. Drain fat from pan as it accumulates. Remove all dressing.
