Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat, and cook the garlic until lightly browned. Drain excess oil. Mix in the whole tomatoes, diced tomatoes, green chiles, tomato paste, capers, green olives, parsley, portobello mushroom caps, horseradish, habanero sauce, and sugar. Season with Italian seasoning, oregano, and cumin. Cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 25 minutes.
