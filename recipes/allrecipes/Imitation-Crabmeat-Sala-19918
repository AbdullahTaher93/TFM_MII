In a large bowl, combine onion, green pepper, celery and imitation crab meat. In a separate bowl, mix together sour cream, mayonnaise, salad dressing, lemon juice, oregano, salt and pepper. Pour the dressing mixture into the crab/vegetable mixture and toss lightly to combine. Cover and chill at least 2 hours before serving.
