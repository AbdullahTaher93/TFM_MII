Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, carrot, celery, bell pepper, and garlic in hot oil until vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir chicken and parsley into the vegetable mixture; cook and stir for about 1 minute. Add quinoa to the chicken mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cook and stir until quinoa is toasted, about 2 minutes. Pour chicken broth over the quinoa mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low. Place a cover on the saucepan and cook mixture at a simmer until the quinoa is tender, about 15 minutes. Turn heat completely off and allow mixture to sit covered another 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Fluff with a fork to serve.
