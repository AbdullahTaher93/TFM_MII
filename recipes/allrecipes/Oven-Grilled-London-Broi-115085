Adjust oven rack to lowest position; position pizza stone, if using, on rack and heat oven to 500 degrees F for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat large, heavy, ovenproof skillet, preferably cast iron or stainless steel with an aluminum core, for at least 3 minutes over high heat. Generously sprinkle both sides of steak with salt and pepper; add to pan. As soon as steak smokes, about 5 seconds, carefully transfer pan to oven; cook 3 1/2 to 4 minutes, then flip steak and cook until well seared and meat is medium-rare (125 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer), 3 1/2 to 4 minutes longer. Transfer steak to cutting board; let rest for 5 minutes. Slice very thin, on bias against the grain; adjust seasoning with additional salt and pepper, and serve immediately with meat juices.
