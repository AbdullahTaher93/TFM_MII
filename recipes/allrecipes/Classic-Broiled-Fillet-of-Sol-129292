Heat the broiler to high. Cut a piece of foil to fit the broiler pan and lay the fish on top. (Depending on the size of the broiler, you might have to cook the sole in 2 batches.) Put the potatoes in a saucepan, cover with boiling water, and add the sprig of mint. Boil until the potatoes are just tender, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small saucepan. Stir in the lemon zest and juice, and season with salt and pepper. Brush the lemon butter over the fish and broil until the flesh close to the bone flakes easily when pierced with a knife, 5 to 6 minutes. Carefully turn the fish over, brush again with the lemon butter, and broil 5 to 6 minutes longer. While the fish is cooking, steam the spinach until just wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste. Drain the potatoes and put into a warm serving dish. Add plenty of black pepper, toss lightly, and garnish with mint sprigs. Transfer the sole to warm dinner plates and spoon any cooking juices from the broiler pan over. Add lemon wedges and serve, with the potatoes and spinach.
