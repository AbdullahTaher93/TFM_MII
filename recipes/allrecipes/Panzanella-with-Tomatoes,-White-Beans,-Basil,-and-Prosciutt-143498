Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Coat baking sheet with cooking spray. Place bread cubes on sheet and spritz bread. Bake in oven until lightly toasted, 3 to 4 minutes, shaking once or twice to heat evenly. Meanwhile, in large bowl, toss beans, basil, tomatoes, oil, vinegar, and salt until combined. Set aside. Cut prosciutto into tiny pieces using kitchen shears. Cook in nonstick skillet on medium-high until crispy. Remove and drain on paper towels. Add toasted bread to tomato mixture and toss lightly. Divide among 4 plates and garnish with prosciutto.
