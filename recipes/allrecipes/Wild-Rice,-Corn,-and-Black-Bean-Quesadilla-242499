Prepare rice according to package directions. Mix rice, shredded cheese, beans, corn, green onions, together in a bowl. Place a quarter of the mixture on one side of each tortilla. Top with about 2 tablespoons of mild salsa. Gently fold each tortilla in half. Spray a small saute pan with non-stick cooking spray; set over medium-high heat. Place one quesadilla in saute pan. Cook until lightly golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Spray the pan with additional oil, as needed, to cook the next 3 quesadillas. Let quesadillas cool slightly and cut in half. Serve with additional mild salsa, if desired.
