Lightly coat a 9-inch pie plate with cooking spray. In a medium mixing bowl, combine egg product, pastry flour, pepper, and salt. Stir in cottage cheese, broccoli, feta, and cheddar. Spoon into the pie plate. Bake in a 350 degrees F oven for 40 to 45 minutes or until a knife inserted near center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
