Combine water, pinto beans, and garlic into a large pot and cover; Cook over low heat for 5 1/2 hours; stir salt into beans and continue cooking until beans are very soft, about 30 minutes more. Heat canola oil in a skillet over high heat. Spoon the beans into the skillet without draining excess water; mash beans using a potato masher until they begin to lose their shape, about 3 minutes.
