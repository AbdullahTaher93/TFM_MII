Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter one 9x13 inch baking dish. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes; cook until tender but still firm. Drain, and transfer to a large bowl to cool. Peel and quarter. In a sauce pan, combine pineapple, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves. Bring to boil and reduce heat. Arrange potatoes in a single layer in baking dish. Pour sauce over potatoes and bake for 45 minutes.
