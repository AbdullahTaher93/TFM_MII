In a small bowl, combine the first five ingredients. Cut bread into 1-in. thick slices, but not all the way through, leaving slices attached at the bottom. Spread cheese mixture between slices. Wrap loaf in a large piece of heavy -duty foil (about 28-in. x 18-in.). Fold foil around bread and seal tightly. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes or until heated through. Serve warm.
