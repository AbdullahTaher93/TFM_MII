In a large bowl, beat butter until creamy; add granulated sugar and beat until smooth. Mix in vanilla. In another bowl, stir together flour, cocoa, and salt; gradually add to butter mixture, blending thoroughly. Mix in coconut. Divide dough in half. On a lightly floured board, shape each portion into a roll about 1 1/2 inch in diameter; wrap rolls in waxed or parchment paper and refrigerate until firm (at least 2 hours) or for up to 1 week; freeze for longer storage. Unwrap dough. (If dough is frozen, let thaw in refrigerator.) Using a sharp knife, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices; place slices slightly apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake in a 300 degrees F oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until cookies are firm to the touch and lightly browned on bottom. Transfer to racks and let cool for 5 minutes. Sift about 1/2 cup of powdered sugar onto wax or parchment paper and transfer cookies to it in a single layer; sift additional 1/2 cup powdered sugar on top to cover cookies lightly. Let cookies cool completely. Store airtight.
