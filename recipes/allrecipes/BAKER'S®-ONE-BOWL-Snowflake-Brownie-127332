Preheat oven to 350 degrees F if using a 13x9-inch baking pan (or to 325 degrees F if using a glass baking dish). Line pan with foil, with ends of foil extending over sides of pan to form handles. Grease foil. Microwave chocolate and butter in large microwavable bowl on HIGH 2 minutes or until butter is melted. Stir until chocolate is completely melted. Add sugar; mix well. Stir in eggs and vanilla. Add flour; mix well. Spread into prepared pan. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out with fudgy crumbs. DO NOT OVERBAKE. Cool in pan. Lift out of pan onto cutting board. Cut into star and round shapes using 2-inch cookie cutters, or into 24 (2-inch) squares. Sprinkle cutouts with powdered sugar for snowflake effect.
