Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly grease 24 (3-inch) muffin-pan cups. Beat the eggs, picante sauce, flour and chili powder in a medium bowl with a fork or whisk. Stir in the cheese and onion. Spoon about 1 tablespoon cheese mixture into each muffin-pan cup. Bake for 10 minutes or until the bites are golden brown. Serve warm or at room temperature with additional picante sauce.
