In a blender, whirl milk, melted butter, eggs, and flour until smooth; scrape container sides as needed. Use our Crepe Maker or a nonstick crepe pan that measures 6 1/2 to 7 in. across the bottom. Set pan on medium heat. For first crepe only, rub pan with the 1/2 tsp. butter. Fill a 1/4-cup measuring cup 2/3 full with batter. Cook in Crepe Maker or crepe pan. Slide crepe from Crepe Maker or pan onto plate. Stack crepes as they cook. (Stacked crepes stay warm longer, so theyre ready to use right away.)
