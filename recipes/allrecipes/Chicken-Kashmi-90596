In a large skillet over medium high heat, heat oil. Add onions and saute 1 minute. Reduce heat to low, cover pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until very soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in mushrooms, increase heat to medium-high, and saute uncovered until lightly browned. Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute or until completely absorbed. Stir in broth, cider, wine, curry powder and mustard. Bring to a boil, stirring. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring often, for 5 minutes or until thickened. Before serving, stir chicken and green onions into hot sauce and cook until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes. Serve with rice.
