Place the quinoa in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water until the water runs clear. Bring 2 cups of the broth to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Add the quinoa and return to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until tender. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, ginger, and cumin seeds and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes, or until fragrant. Add the bell peppers and onion and cook, stirring, for 8 minutes, or until tender. Stir in the beans and the remaining 1/2 cup broth and cook for 2 minutes. Fluff the quinoa with a fork and stir in the cilantro. Place in a serving bowl and top with the pepper mixture.
