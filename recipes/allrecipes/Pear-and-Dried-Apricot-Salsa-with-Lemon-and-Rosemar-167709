Combine wine, apricots and bay leaf in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil; cover and cook over low heat until the apricots are plumped but not too soft, about 10 minutes, depending on their dryness. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the apricots to a cutting board, leaving the wine in the pan. When cool enough to handle, cut into quarters and transfer to a medium bowl. Toss pears with lemon zest and juice in another bowl. Add the pears and zest to the wine in the pan. (If using dried rosemary, add it now.) Return to a simmer and cook, stirring, over medium-low heat, until the juices are reduced and the pears are just tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the pear mixture to the apricots; stir in fresh rosemary, if using. Remove the bay leaf; serve the salsa warm, at room temperature or chilled.
