Rinse chicken and pat dry. Pour oil into a 5- to 6-quart nonstick pan over high heat. Add chicken and turn as needed to brown lightly on all sides, 4 to 5 minutes total. Transfer chicken to a bowl. To pan, add broth, wine, and thyme; cover and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, scrub or peel potatoes. When broth is boiling, add potatoes. Cover, return to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. As potatoes cook, peel carrots. Cut bok choy in half lengthwise; rinse well. Add carrots to pan and arrange chicken in a single layer on vegetables. Cover and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes. Lay bok choy on chicken; cover and simmer until chicken is white in center of thickest part (cut to test), about 5 minutes longer. In a small bowl, mix sour cream, mustard, shallots, and capers. With a slotted spoon, transfer equal portions of chicken and vegetables to wide soup bowls. Ladle hot broth equally into bowls and add sour cream sauce, salt, and pepper to taste.
