Bring the apples, peaches, and tea to a light boil in a large wok-style pan. Reduce heat to medium-high heat; cook and stir until fruit is soft, about 30 minutes. Drain any excess liquid from the pan. Let fruit mixture cool slightly. Stir marjoram, ground ginger, ground allspice into the fruit mixture. Fold currants into the mixture.
