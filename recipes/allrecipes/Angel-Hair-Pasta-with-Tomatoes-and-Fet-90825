In a 4- to 5-quart pan, bring 2 to 3 quarts water to a boil over high heat. Meanwhile, in a wide frying pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring often, until onion is soft (3 to 4 minutes). Add pasta to boiling water. Cook, uncovered, stirring often, until barely tender to bite (3 to 5 minutes). Or cook pasta according to package directions. Add tomatoes to pan with onion mixture and stir just until warm (about 2 minutes). Stir in basil and parsley, heating just until basil is wilted (about 30 seconds). Drain pasta well and pour into a wide, shallow bowl. Season tomato mixture with salt and pepper to taste; spoon over pasta, then sprinkle with cheese.
