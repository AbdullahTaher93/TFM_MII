Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, medium heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above the cooking grate only 4 to 5 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). Place hot dogs on oiled cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook, turning once with tongs, until browned, 4 to 6 minutes total. During the last minute of cooking time, place buns with cut sides down next to hot dogs and cook until toasted. Transfer buns to a platter and put hot dogs inside. Serve hot dogs with ketchup, onions, cheese, and additional garnishes to add to taste, if you like.
