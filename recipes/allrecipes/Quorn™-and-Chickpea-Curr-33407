Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Cook Quorn in oil until golden brown. Set aside. Using the same pan, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat. Cook onion, garlic, cumin seed, and mustard seed in oil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft. Season with ground turmeric, cumin, and coriander, chili powder, and salt. Mix in tomato puree, then stir in Quorn, chickpeas, diced tomatoes, and vegetable stock. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat, and mix in garam masala.
