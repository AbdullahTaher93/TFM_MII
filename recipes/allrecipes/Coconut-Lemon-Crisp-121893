In a mixing bowl, cream butter, sugar and vanilla. Gradually add flour. On a lightly floured surface, roll out half of the dough to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut with a 2-in. round cookie cutter. Repeat with remaining dough, using a 2-in. doughnut cutter so the center is cut out of each cookie. Place 1 in. apart on lightly greased baking sheets. Brush egg white over cookies with cutout centers; sprinkle with coconut. Bake at 350 degrees F for 8-10 minutes. Remove to wire racks to cool. In a small saucepan, combine sugar and cornstarch. Stir in water and lemon juice until smooth. Add egg yolk and butter; cook and stir over medium heat until thickened. Cool. Spread a teaspoonful on the bottom of each solid cookie; place coconut topped cookie over lemon filling. Store in the refrigerator.
