Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray two 9-inch round cake pans with no-stick cooking spray. Combine 2 cups flour and 1/2 cup sugar in large bowl; mix well. Cut in butter with pastry blender or fork until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 2/3 cup milk and 1 egg; stir just until blended. Spread batter evenly in prepared pans. Combine peaches, 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon flour in medium bowl; toss gently to coat. Arrange peaches over batter. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until lightly browned. Beat eggs in small bowl. Add sour cream, vanilla and almond extract; mix well. Remove pans from oven. Spoon sour cream mixture over peaches. Return to oven; bake an additional 15 to 20 minutes or until set. Cool slightly. Sprinkle cinnamon-sugar blend evenly over tops of coffee cakes.
