Peel and chop onion. Sort peas for debris; discard debris and rinse peas. Peel potatoes and cut into 1-inch chunks. In a 3- to 4-quart pan over medium-high heat, stir 1 teaspoon oil and the onion until onion is limp, about 5 minutes. Add peas, potatoes, and broth. Bring to a boil, cover pan, reduce heat, and simmer until potatoes and peas are tender to bite, 20 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a 9- or 10-inch-wide pan, mix remaining 1 teaspoon oil with pepper, garlic, and bread cubes. Bake bread mixture in a 375 degrees oven until crisp and lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes (10 to 15 minutes in a convection oven). In a blender or food processor, whirl broth mixture, a portion at a time, until smooth. Return to pan. If soup is thicker than you like, thin with a little water. Add salt and hot sauce to taste. Stir over high heat until steaming. Ladle into soup bowls and garnish with croutons.
