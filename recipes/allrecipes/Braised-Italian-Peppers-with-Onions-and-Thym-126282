Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the frying peppers and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until the onion starts to soften. Add the vinegar, thyme, salt, and black pepper and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and broth or water. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 8 minutes, or until the vegetables are very tender.
