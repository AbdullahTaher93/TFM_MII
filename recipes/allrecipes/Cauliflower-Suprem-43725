Heat one inch of water to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add cauliflower florets, and cook covered for 7 to 9 minutes, or until tender. Drain and set aside. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute mushrooms, onion, and almonds. Stir in the chicken bouillon. Dissolve the cornstarch in water, and gradually stir into the mushroom mixture. Cook until thickened. Pour the mushroom mixture over the hot cauliflower, and serve.
