Place ham, fatty side up, on rack in shallow roasting pan. Bake at 325 degrees F 20 to 25 minutes per pound, or until meat thermometer inserted in center, away from bone, reads 135 degrees F. Let ham stand 10 minutes before slicing. Meanwhile, saute shallots in hot oil in medium saucepan over medium heat 3 minutes, or until translucent. Add apple jelly; cook, stirring, 3 minutes, or until jelly melts. Stir in sweet & sour sauce and cranberries; cover and cook 1 minute until heated, stirring once. Serve sauce with ham slices.
