In a heavy saucepan or microwave, melt 1 cup chocolate chips and butter; stir until smooth. In a mixing bowl, combine biscuit mix, milk, egg and almond extract. Stir in chocolate mixture; mix well. Fold in cherries and remaining chocolate chips. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Sprinkle with almonds. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out with moist crumbs and the edges pull away from the sides. Cool on a wire rack.
