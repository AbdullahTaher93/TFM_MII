Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Mix venison, chipotle peppers, blue cheese, and garlic in a large bowl. Divide mixture into 6 equal parts and shape into patties. Grill on the preheated grill until an instant-read thermometer inserted horizontally into the center registers 160 degrees F, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and banana peppers until onions are lightly golden, about 7 minutes. Top burgers with the onion mixture; serve with hamburger buns.
