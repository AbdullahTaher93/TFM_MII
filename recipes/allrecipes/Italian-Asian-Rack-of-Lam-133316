Combine 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon mustard, the smashed garlic and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Rub the mixture all over the lamb, cover and refrigerate overnight. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine the bread crumbs, cheese, parsley, chopped garlic, wine, olive oil, the remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons mustard and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Place the lamb in a roasting pan and pack the bread crumb mixture into the middle of the crown. Roast for 15 minutes per pound for medium rare. After 20 minutes, cover the lamb loosely with foil and add 1/2 cup water to the pan to prevent over-browning.
