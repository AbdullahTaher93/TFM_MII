In a small bowl, mix ketchup, honey, lemon juice, and cayenne to taste. Brush one side of chops generously with sauce. Place chops sauce side down on a lightly oiled grill 4 to 6 inches above a solid bed of hot coals (you can hold your hand at grill level for only 2 to 3 seconds) or over high heat on a gas grill. Brush tops of chops with sauce. Close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning as needed for even browning, and basting often with remaining sauce, until meat is no longer pink in center; cut to test (10 to 14 minutes). Transfer chops to a platter and garnish with lemon wedges.
