Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Cut squash in half lengthwise. Remove and discard pulp. Blanch squash halves by putting in boiling water for about 30 seconds. Plunge squash in ice water to stop cooking. In a medium bowl, combine chopped eggs, celery, red pepper, sliced green olives, shredded cheese, basil, dill and mayonnaise. Season with cayenne and seasoned salt. Mix well. Spoon egg mixture into squash halves, mounding if necessary. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled thoroughly.
