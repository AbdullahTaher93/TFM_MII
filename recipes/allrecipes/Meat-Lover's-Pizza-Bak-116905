In a large skillet, cook beef and green pepper over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the pizza sauce, pepperoni and olives. Transfer to a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with cheese. In a small bowl, combine the biscuit mix, eggs and milk until blended. Pour evenly over cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
