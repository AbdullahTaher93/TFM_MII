Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with aluminum foil. In a large bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and salt; continue beating until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar and vanilla, beating until stiff but not dry. Fold in the coconut and 1 cup of the chocolate chips. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets, 1 to 2 inches apart. Sprinkle the cookies with the remaining 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the surfaces begin to crack. Cool completely before removing the cookies from the foil. Store loosely covered at room temperature.
