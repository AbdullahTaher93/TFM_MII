Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Make the aioli first. In a small bowl mix together 1 cup of mayonnaise, lemon juice, paprika, garlic powder, and lemon pepper. Taste to see if you want to add any salt. Cover and chill while you make the crab cakes. If the crab meat is canned drain it well. If frozen be sure it is completely thawed and let it drain also. Finely mince the peppers, scallions and celery. Take your time with this; you want the pieces rather small which helps keep the cakes held together. In a mixing bowl add 4 Tbsp of mayonnaise, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, lemon pepper and garlic powder. Mix well. Mix in the peppers, scallions, celery and parmesan cheese. Then fold in the crab meat (try not to break it up too much). To bake on shells be sure that you have sterilized 20 shells first by boiling them for about 5 minutes. If they won't lie flat, then make a bed of rock salt on a sheet pan and twist the shells down until they are flat. Or use aluminum foil and scrunched it up to form cradles for each of the shells. Clam shell usually flay flat so they don't need the salt bed or foil. Arrange 5 rows with 4 shells in each row. Spoon out a bit of the crab mixture into each shell and bake for 8 - 10 minutes (or until golden brown). If you don't use sea shells, then line a sheet pan with parchment paper and spoon out crab mixture and form cakes. Place into 5 rows with 4 crab cakes per row. Bake for 8 - 10 minutes (or until golden brown). Let cool before serving. I usually serve at room temperature. Arrange on a platter. Garnish each crab cake with a dollop of the lemon aioli on top or serve on the side such as in a small bowl in the center of the platter of crab cakes.
