Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir shredded carrot, chopped onion, and minced garlic in the hot oil until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour vegetable broth into the pot. Stir lentils and salsa into the broth mixture. Bring to a boil, place a cover on the pot, and cook at a simmer until the lentils are softened, about 45 minutes. Season the lentil mixture with cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Stir kale into the lentil mixture. Replace the cover onto the pot and cook just until the kale is wilted, 3 to 5 minutes.
