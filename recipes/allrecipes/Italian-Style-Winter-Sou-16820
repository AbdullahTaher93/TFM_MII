Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add garlic and onion and saute for 3 minutes, or until tender. Add the sausage, browning well on all sides, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken stock, oregano, basil and parsley. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour. Add the rice and simmer for 30 more minutes. Finally, add the cream, stirring well. Remove from heat and let soup rest for 5 minutes before serving.
