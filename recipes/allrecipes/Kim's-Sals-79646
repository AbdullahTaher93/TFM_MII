Combine the tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, green pepper, garlic, jalapenos, sugar, chili powder, vinegar, salt, and cumin in a large saucepan. Bring mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the salsa is thickened and is noticeably darker in color, at least two hours. Cool and store it in the refrigerator for up to two weeks or in the freezer for three months.
