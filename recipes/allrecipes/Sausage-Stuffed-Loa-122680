Thaw bread dough on a greased baking sheet according to package directions; let rise until doubled. Meanwhile, in a skillet over medium heat, cook the sausage until no longer pink. Drain and place in a bowl. Add spinach, cheeses, oregano and garlic powder; set side. Roll each loaf of bread into a 14-in. x 12-in. rectangle. Spread sausage mixture lengthwise down the center of each rectangle. Gently press the filling down; dot with butter. Bring edges of dough to the center over filling; pinch to seal. Return to the baking sheet, placing seam side down; tuck ends under and form into a crescent shape. Brush with egg. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand for 5-10 minutes before cutting. If desired, cool one loaf on a wire rack; wrap in foil and freeze for up to 3 months. To use frozen loaf: Thaw at room temperature for 2 hours. Unwrap and place on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until heated through.
