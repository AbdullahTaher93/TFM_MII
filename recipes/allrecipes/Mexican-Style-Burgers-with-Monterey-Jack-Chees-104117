In a large bowl, gently combine all ingredients except Monterey Jack cheese and salsa. Shape mixture into four (4) patties, about 1/2-inch thick. Cover and refrigerate until needed. Set oven control to broil and/or 550 degrees F. Preheat 10 minutes. Place patties on rack in broiler pan with tops 3 to 4 inches from heat. Broil to medium (160 degrees F) doneness, turning once, about 10 to 12 minutes. Place one slice of cheese on each burger. Continue broiling until cheese is lightly melted. Serve immediately with salsa on warm tortillas or buns, if desired.
