Knead together the sesame oil, soy sauce, garlic powder, ground ginger, onion powder, pepper, ground beef, green onion, and water chestnuts in a bowl until evenly combined; form into four patties. Heat the peanut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook in the skillet until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 5 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
