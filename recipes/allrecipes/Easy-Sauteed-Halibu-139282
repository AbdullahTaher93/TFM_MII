Brush 1 tbsp. olive oil on halibut. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste. Pre-heat saute pan to a medium high heat. Coat the pan with 2 tbsp. olive oil. Cook until golden brown, about 4 to 6 minutes. Flip the halibut and continue to cook on the other side for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the middle flakes easily.
