In a large bowl, beat egg and 1/2 cup water until blended. Add lamb, bread crumbs, oregano, mustard, salt, and pepper to taste; mix lightly but thoroughly. Shape mixture into 24 equal-size balls, about 1 inch in diameter, and place slightly apart in a shallow 10- by 15-inch baking pan. Bake in a 425 degrees F oven, turning once, until well browned (18 to 20 minutes). Meanwhile, prepare dressing. In a small pan, combine chicken broth, rice vinegar, lemon peel and juice, fresh oregano, and cornstarch; mix well. Place over medium-high heat; cook, stirring until mixture comes to a boil. Remove from heat and set aside until ready to serve. To serve, divide cabbage evenly onto 4 dinner plates; top each serving with 6 of the meatballs. Drizzle salads with dressing, then garnish with sliced onions, lemon wedges, and oregano sprigs.
