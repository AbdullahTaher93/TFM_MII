In a large shallow dish, combine water, wine, sesame oil, soy sauce, mustard, brown sugar and liquid smoke. Stir in Italian dressing mix, orange zest, ginger, paprika and fines herbs. Place chicken in the dish, and turn to coat. Cover, and refrigerate overnight. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil grate. Discard marinade. Grill chicken 15 to 20 minutes per side, until no longer pink and juices run clear. Occasionally place rosemary sprigs on coals to impart a unique smoky flavor to chicken.
