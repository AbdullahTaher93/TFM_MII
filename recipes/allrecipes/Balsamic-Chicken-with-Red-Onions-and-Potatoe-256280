Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Pour 1 tablespoon oil into a baking dish. Arrange potato slices in the bottom of the dish. Mix parsley and garlic together in a small bowl. Season underside of the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Loosen skin and push parsley and garlic mixture underneath. Place chicken on top of potatoes in the dish. Arrange onion wedges around chicken. Drizzle remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and balsamic vinegar over chicken. Bake in the preheated oven, basting occasionally with juices, until an instant-read thermometers inserted into the center reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 30 minutes.
