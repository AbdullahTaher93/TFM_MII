Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. Layer the bottom of the baking dish with 1/2 the onions and 1/2 the garlic slices. Pour lemon juice and white wine into the baking dish. Season chicken with paprika, salt, and pepper, and place in the baking dish. Top with remaining onions and garlic. Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until chicken juices run clear.
