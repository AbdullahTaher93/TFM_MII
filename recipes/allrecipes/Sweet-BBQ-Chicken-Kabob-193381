Heat grill to medium-high heat. Using 8 long wooden skewers (placing 2, side-by-side, for each kabob), thread chicken alternately onto skewers with pineapple and peppers to make 4 kabobs. Mix barbecue sauce and juice concentrate; brush lightly onto kabobs. Grill 8 to 10 minutes or until chicken is done, turning and brushing occasionally with remaining sauce mixture.
