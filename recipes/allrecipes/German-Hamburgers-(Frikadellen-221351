Soak Kaiser roll in a bowl of water for 10 minutes. Drain, squeezing out excess water, and crumble into a large bowl. Mix crumbled roll with ground beef, ground pork, onion, parsley, egg, paprika, salt, and black pepper until well blended. Shape meat into large flattened meatballs. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat; fry meatballs until browned and no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side.
