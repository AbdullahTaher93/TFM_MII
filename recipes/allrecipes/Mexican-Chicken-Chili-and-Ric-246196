Heat oil over medium heat in a 10-inch skillet; cook onions until starting to turn translucent, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook 1 minute more. Stir in chicken and chili powder. Add diced green chilies, fire roasted tomatoes with juices, pinto beans, and water. Cover and simmer until heated through and flavors blend, about 10 minutes. Add Knorr Fiesta Sides, Mexican Rice and corn. Stir to combine, cover and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and cook, covered for 7 minutes. Turn off heat and let sit, covered, for an additional 5 minutes. Serve garnished with cheese and tortilla chips, if desired.
