Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Wrap each artichoke heart with a piece of bacon. Secure by threading a toothpick through the end of the bacon. Fry bacon-wrapped artichoke hearts in the hot oil until bacon is browned and crispy, 7 to 9 minutes; drain on a paper towel-lined plate for about 5 minutes before serving.
