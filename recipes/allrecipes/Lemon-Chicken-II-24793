To Marinate: Combine chicken and lemon juice in a large resealable plastic bag. Squeeze out air and seal bag. Refrigerate to marinate overnight, turning once. Remove chicken from marinade, reserving 2 tablespoons marinade and disposing of the remainder. Mix together flour, salt, paprika and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken breasts one at a time, seal bag and shake to coat evenly. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Fry coated chicken until well browned, about 10 to 15 minutes. Arrange browned chicken in a 9x13 inch baking dish and sprinkle with brown sugar. Mix broth with reserved marinade and pour mixture over chicken. Top each breast with a lemon slice and sprinkle all with parsley. Bake in the preheated oven for about 20 to 30 minutes, or until cooked through (juices run clear) and tender.
