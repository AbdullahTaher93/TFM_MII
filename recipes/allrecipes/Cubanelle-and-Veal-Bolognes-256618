Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add Cubanelle peppers; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir veal and chuck into the saucepan; cook, breaking up gently with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 10 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Bring sauce to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until flavors combine, about 30 minutes.
