Heat oil in a 3 1/2- to 4-quart pan over medium-high heat. Stir in onion and garlic, then crumble in sausages. Cook, stirring often, until turkey begins to brown (3 to 4 minutes). Stir in basil, tomatoes and their liquid, and wine; continue to cook, stirring often, until sauce is thickened and reduced to about 3 1/2 cups (10 to 12 minutes). Meanwhile, in a 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat, bring about 3 quarts water to a boil. Stir in pasta and cook, uncovered, until just tender to bite (12 to 15 minutes). Or cook pasta according to package directions. Drain pasta well and pour onto a platter or into individual wide, shallow bowls; top with sauce. Add parmesan to taste.
