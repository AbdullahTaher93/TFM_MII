In a 2-qt. microwave-safe dish, combine the oil, onions, carrot and garlic. Cover and microwave on high for 3-4 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender. Stir in water, rice and bouillon. Cover and cook on high for 15-18 minutes or until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, stirring once. Stir in peas, soy sauce and ham if desired. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small microwave-safe bowl, beat the eggs. Cover and heat on high for 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 minutes or until firm. Cut into small pieces; stir into rice mixture. Serve immediately.
