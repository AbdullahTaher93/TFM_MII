In a small bowl, stir together oil and vinegar; season to taste with salt and pepper. Rinse fish, pat dry, and brush with oil mixture. Place, oiled side down, on lightly greased rack in a broiler pan. Brush fish again with oil mixture. Broil about 4 in. below heat, turning once and brushing with remaining oil mixture after turning, until fish is lightly browned on outside but still red in thickest part; cut to test (8 to 10 minutes). Meanwhile, in another small bowl, stir together mayonnaise, tapenade, and parsley; season to taste with salt and pepper. Spread cut sides of roll bottoms with mayonnaise mixture, using about half the mixture. Cover bottom half of each roll with lettuce leaves and top with a hot tuna steak; cut fish to fit, if necessary. Top fish with tomato slices, then with remaining mayonnaise mixture; cover with roll tops.
