Slice tomatoes and peppers and set aside. Slice the red onion and separate the rings. Using a large bowl with a lid, layer the tomatoes, green pepper and onion until all vegetables are used. Shake the bottled dressing and pour over the vegetable layers. Refrigerate for 2-3 hours or, for best results, overnight. Before serving, turn bowl upside down to make sure all vegetables are coated with the dressing.
