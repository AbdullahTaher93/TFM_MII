Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Heat oil in a large heavy-bottom oven-proof pot with a lid, over high heat until very hot but not smoking. Meanwhile, season the lamb to taste with salt and pepper. Cook lamb in batches to avoid crowding the pot, until meat is brown on all sides, 10-15 minutes per batch. Transfer meat to a bowl, using a slotted spoon. Add onions to the oil in the pot and cook, stirring often, until soft and golden on the edges, about 10 minutes. Add lamb and accumulated juices to onions. Add curry paste to the pot, stirring to mix well. Add tomatoes and chicken stock; stir again to mix well. Bring to a boil. Cover pot with the lid, then transfer to the oven, and cook until meat is fork tender, about 1 hour.
