Prepare pudding according to the directions on the back of the box. In a glass serving bowl, layer ingredients: 1/3 of the whipped cream, 1/2 of the pudding, 1/2 of the strawberries, 1/2 of the blueberries, and 1/2 of the chopped cookies. Repeat. Top with 1/3 of whipped cream and garnish with fruit and Vienna Fingers(R) Cookies. Cover and refrigerate for one hour before serving. Helpful Hints: 1) Use any sharp knife to prepare chopped cookies. Each piece should be approximately 1/4 to 1/2 inch. Or, if preferred, pulse cookies within your food processor to desired consistency.
