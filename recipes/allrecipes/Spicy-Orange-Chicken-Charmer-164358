Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly spray 16 mini muffin cups with CRISCO(R) Original No-Stick Cooking Spray. In 12-inch nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add chicken and onions; cook 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to medium-low; stir in marmalade, soy sauce, sherry, garlic powder and red pepper flakes. Simmer uncovered about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened and chicken is no longer pink in center. Remove from heat. Meanwhile, unroll dough into 4 rectangles. Cut each rectangle into quarters by making another diagonal cut in addition to the perforation to make a total of 16 triangles. Press largest part of each dough triangle in bottom and up side of muffin cup, leaving triangle points extending over cup. Fill each cup with about 1 tablespoon chicken mixture. For each cup, slightly stretch points of triangles to make longer; twist points together and place on top of filling. Spray shaped rolls lightly with cooking spray; sprinkle with sesame seed. Bake 11 to 19 minutes or until golden brown. Carefully remove from pan to serving plate. Cool 5 minutes before serving. Serve warm.
