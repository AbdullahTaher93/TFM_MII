In a large bowl, combine the garlic, sour orange juice, lemon juice, oil, oregano and Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM). Divide the sauce mixture in half. In a stainless steel or glass bowl, pour half the sauce over the chicken legs. Set the remaining sauce aside for basting the chicken during grilling. Marinate the chicken legs, over night (at least 4 - 6 hours) in refrigerator. Preheat grill to medium. Remove the chicken from the marinade, discarding the marinade. Grill the chicken pieces for 10 to 12 minutes per side, basting liberally with the reserved marinade until lightly charred, golden brown, and fully cooked (minimum internal temperature of 180 degrees F).
