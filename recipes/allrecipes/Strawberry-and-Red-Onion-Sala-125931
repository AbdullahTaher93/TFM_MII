In a medium glass bowl, combine the all-fruit spread, vinegar, olive oil, flaxseed oil, salt, and red-pepper flakes until well-blended. Gently fold in the strawberries, cantaloupe, bell pepper, and onion. Cover and let stand for 15 minutes to allow the flavors to blend. Place the escarole in a serving bowl. Add the avocado and strawberry mixture and toss to coat well. Season with black pepper to taste.
