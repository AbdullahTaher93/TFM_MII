In a large saucepan over low heat, melt butter and chocolate, stirring constantly. Add sugar, raisins, water, cinnamon and cloves; bring to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat; pour into a mixing bowl and cool for 15 minutes. Add salt and vanilla. Combine flour and baking soda; add to chocolate mixture and mix well. Pour into a greased and floured 8-cup fluted tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool in pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool. Combine icing ingredients; spoon over cooled cake.
