In a pot, bring the rice and water to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes. In a separate pot over medium heat, mix the tomatoes, vermouth, brown sugar, tarragon, basil, sea salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 20 minutes, until most of the liquid has been reduced. Serve over the cooked rice.
