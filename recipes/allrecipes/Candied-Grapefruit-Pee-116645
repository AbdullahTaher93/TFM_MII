With a sharp knife, score grapefruit into 8 to 10 wedge-shaped sections. Loosen peel with a tablespoon. With a small sharp knife, carefully remove white pith from peel. (Save fruit for another use.) In a large saucepan, combine peel and salt; cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Drain. Repeat process twice (only covering with water and not adding more salt). Cool for 10 minutes. Cut peel into 1/4- to 1/2-in. strips; set aside. In the same saucepan, combine 1-1/2 cups sugar and 1 cup water. Cook and stir until sugar is dissolved and mixture comes to a boil. Cook and stir 2 minutes longer. Add grapefruit peel. Return to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 35-38 minutes or until syrup is almost absorbed and peel is transparent, stirring occasionally (watch carefully to prevent scorching). Drain any remaining syrup. Cool peel in a single layer on a foil-lined baking sheet for at least 2-1/2 hours. Sprinkle with remaining sugar if needed. Store in an airtight container.
