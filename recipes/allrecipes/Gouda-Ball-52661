In a bowl, mix the sour cream, butter, and flour. Divide into two equal portions, cover, and refrigerate 2 hours. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Roll out the dough portions on a flat surface. Place a gouda ball in the center of each portion, and wrap. Roll wrapped balls in the cumin. Place on a baking sheet. Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned.
