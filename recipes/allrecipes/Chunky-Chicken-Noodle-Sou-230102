Bring water, chicken stock, and chicken bouillon to a boil in a large stock pot. Add chicken breast, egg noodles, peas and carrots, chopped carrots, celery, onion, salt, black pepper, basil, bay leaf, and oregano. Continue to boil, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and noodles are tender, 5 to 10 minutes more.
