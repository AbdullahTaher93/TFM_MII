Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Unroll dough and separate into 4 rectangles; firmly press perforations to seal. Spread cheese dip over each rectangle to within 1/4 inch of edges. Sprinkle with bell pepper and onions. Starting with 1 short side, roll up each rectangle; press edge to seal. With serrated knife, cut each roll into 6 slices; place cut side down on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 13 to 17 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Immediately remove from cookie sheet. Serve warm.
