Arrange haddock fillets in a large baking dish. Season with salt-free seasoning blend. Pour orange juice over fish and cover with plastic wrap, reserve orange zest. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Stir panko bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, buttery spread, parsley, thyme, and reserved orange zest in a bowl until well mixed. Press crumb mixture over haddock. Bake in the preheated oven until fish is easily flaked with a fork and topping is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow fish to rest 5 minutes before serving.
