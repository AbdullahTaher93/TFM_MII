Mix garlic, grated onion, grated ginger, toasted sesame oil, brown sugar together in a mixing bowl. Stir in grated pear, soy sauce, and chile flakes. Transfer meat to marinade and toss to coat on all sides. Cover and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours. Season meat with salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil. Toss. Brush a cast iron skillet with a little vegetable oil and place over high heat. When skillet is very hot, add beef in a single layer and cook until meat begins to caramelize around the edges and moisture begins to evaporate, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve over hot rice and top with green onion slices.
