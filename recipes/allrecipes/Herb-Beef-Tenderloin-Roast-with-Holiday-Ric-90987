Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Combine olive oil, garlic, basil, black pepper, and rosemary; press onto beef roast. Place roast on rack in shallow roasting pan. Insert ovenproof meat thermometer so tip is centered in thickest part of beef, not resting in fat. Do not add water or cover. Roast 35 to 40 minutes for medium rare; 45 to 50 minutes for medium doneness. Remove roast when meat thermometer registers 135 degrees F for medium rare; 150 degrees F for medium. Tent with foil. Let stand 15 minutes. (Temperature will continue to rise about 10 degrees F to reach 145 degrees F for medium rare; 160 degrees F for medium.) Heat butter in large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, bell pepper and garlic; cook and stir 5 minutes or until tender. Add beans; cook and stir 2 minutes. Stir in rice and almonds; heat through. Carve roast; season with salt. Serve with rice.
