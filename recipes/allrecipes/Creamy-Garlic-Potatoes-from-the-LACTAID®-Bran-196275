Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Peel, slice and salt potatoes. Place flour in a large bowl and dredge potatoes in flour. Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Carefully place potatoes in hot oil. Fry on both sides until golden brown. Place a single layer of fried potatoes in a 9x9 inch baking dish. Sprinkle minced garlic over the potatoes. Layer the remaining potatoes on top of the garlic. Pour LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk over the potatoes. Bake in preheated oven 35-45 minutes or until lightly browned and bubbling. Sprinkle with parsley just before serving.
