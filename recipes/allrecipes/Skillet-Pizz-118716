In a skillet, saute onion and green pepper in 1 teaspoon oil until almost tender. Add mushrooms; cook 2-3 minutes longer. Remove and keep warm. In the same skillet, lightly brown one tortilla in 1/2 teaspoon oil. Turn over; top with half of the pepperoni, tomatoes, onion mixture and cheese. Cover and cook until cheese is melted, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with pepper flakes if desired. Repeat for second pizza.
