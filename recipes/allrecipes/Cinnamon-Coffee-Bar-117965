In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and brown sugar. Add egg; beat well. Beat in coffee. Combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture. Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts. Spread into a well-greased 8-in. square baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. In a small bowl, combine the confectioners' sugar, vanilla and enough milk to achieve a glaze consistency. Drizzle over warm bars. Cool completely on a wire rack before cutting.
