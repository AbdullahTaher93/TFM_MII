Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Arrange monkfish fillets in a rectangular glass baking dish without overlapping. Season with lemon-pepper seasoning and sea salt on both sides. Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice. Pour over monkfish. Combine bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in the same saucepan. Spoon bread crumb mixture over the fish, coating evenly. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until monkfish is flaky and tender, 30 to 40 minutes.
