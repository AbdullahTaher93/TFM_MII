Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine the chicken, celery, almonds and green onion in a large bowl and mix well. In a separate bowl combine mayonnaise, lemon juice, salt and pepper and mix until creamy. Combine this mixture with the chicken mixture and stir all together. Place mixture in a 9x13 inch baking dish and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes, or until bubbly. Remove from oven, cover with potato chip crumbs and cheese, and return to oven. Heat until cheese completely melts.
