Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Place yams in a large pot of lightly salted, boiling water and cook for about 10 minutes, or until tender. Drain. Arrange the yams in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Cut a slit down the middle of each one and dab 1 tablespoon of butter in each. Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 10 minutes, or until golden. Spoon 1 teaspoon honey into each yam, sprinkle each with sugar and serve.
