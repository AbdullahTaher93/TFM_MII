Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and reserve. Meanwhile, in a medium sauce pan combine water, mushrooms, beans, red or green bell pepper, garlic, and ground black pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 4 minutes or until vegetables are tender; do not drain. In a small bowl, combine milk and cornstarch; stir into vegetable mixture. Stir and cook over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 1 minute more; add cheese and stir until melted. Pour sauce over pasta and garnish with tomato wedges. Serve.
