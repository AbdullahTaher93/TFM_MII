Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Lightly coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off excess, and brown in oil on both sides. Stir in cointreau, oranges, and heavy cream. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer until liquid has reduced by half. Remove chicken from pan when not longer pink in center, and allow the sauce to reduce another 5 minutes. Stir in chives, season to taste with salt and pepper.
