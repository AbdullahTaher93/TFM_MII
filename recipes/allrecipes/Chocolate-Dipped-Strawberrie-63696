Combine the chocolate and the whipping cream in a glass measuring cup or bowl. Microwave at medium power for 1 minute or until the chocolate melts, stirring after 30 seconds. Stir in the almond extract and cool slightly. Dip each strawberry into the melted chocolate, allowing the excess to drip off. Place on a waxed paper-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate or freeze for approximately 15 minutes until the chocolate is set.
