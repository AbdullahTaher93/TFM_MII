In a 8-in. nonstick skillet, saute mushrooms and zucchini in 2 tablespoons butter until tender; remove and keep warm. In the same skillet, melt remaining butter. In a bowl, beat eggs, water, salt and pepper. Pour into the skillet, cook over medium heat. As eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. When eggs are nearly set, spoon vegetable mixture over half of the omelet; sprinkle with cheese. Fold the omelet in half over filling. Cover and cook for 1-2 minutes or until cheese is melted. Meanwhile, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add remaining sauce ingredients; cook and stir for 5 minutes or until heated through. Serve over the omelet.
