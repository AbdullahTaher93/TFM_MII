Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Sprinkle the filets with salt and pepper. In a small saucepan over low heat, melt 1/4 cup of butter; gently stir in the crab meat, and simmer while you broil the filets. Broil the filets until they reach the desired stage of doneness; for medium (slightly pink in the center), broil 10 to 12 minutes on the first side and 6 minutes on the second side. Set the filets aside to rest. Place a steamer insert into a skillet, and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Cover, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add the asparagus, recover, and steam until just tender, 2 to 6 minutes depending on thickness. Whisk Bearnaise sauce mix with milk in a saucepan. Add 1/2 cup of butter, and bring the sauce to a boil over medium heat, whisking constantly; reduce heat to a simmer, and whisk until sauce has thickened, about 1 minute. To assemble, top each broiled filet with crab meat, then half the asparagus; spoon Bearnaise sauce to taste over the asparagus.
