Heat the olive oil in a large pot over high heat, then add the butter. Stir in chicken and season with Worcestershire sauce, garlic salt, and pepper. Cook the chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center, then stir in the garlic. Place chicken onto a plate and set aside. Cook the chorizo until it becomes a dark golden brown, breaking up the large pieces, using the same pot over medium-high heat. Stir in the chicken stock, tomatoes, and reserved chicken with juices. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes. Stir in heavy cream and simmer for another 5 minutes. Season with salt. Serve soup garnished with Monterey Jack cheese, Parmesan cheese, and a dollop of sour cream.
