Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf pans with cooking spray. Combine water and flaxseed meal in a small bowl. Let stand until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir flaxseed mixture, applesauce, brown sugar, vegetable oil, and almond milk together in a bowl. Add pumpkin puree. Mix whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, cardamom, cloves, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Blend in applesauce mixture. Divide batter between loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack.
