Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Wash and pat chicken dry with paper towels. Using fingers or end of wooden spoon, separate skin from meat on both sides, being careful not to tear skin. Brush bottom of chicken with 1/4 cup of the dressing. Tuck wings under chicken; carefully place, breast-side up, on rack in roasting pan. Brush or pour 1/2 cup of the dressing under the skin and on outside surface of chicken; set aside. Mix carrots and celery with remaining 1/4 cup dressing; spoon into cavity of chicken. Bake 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 hours or until cooked through (180 degrees F). Let stand 10 min. before serving to let juices settle. Remove vegetables from cavity. Serve with the chicken.
