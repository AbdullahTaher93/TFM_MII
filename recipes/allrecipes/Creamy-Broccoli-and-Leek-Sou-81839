Thoroughly rinse the leeks. Cut off the majority of the green tops. Slice leek lengthwise and rinse again to be sure all the sand is rinsed out from between the leaves. Slice thinly. Generally 1-2 leeks will yield the 2 cups. Chop the broccoli fairly small if the soup is to be served chunky style. In a soup pot over high heat, bring the chicken stock to a boil. Add the broccoli, leeks, oregano and vermouth. Once it returns to the boil for a full minute, reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Transfer about 1/2 of the vegetables to a food processor or blender and puree. (Or puree all of it). Return puree to the pot. Add cream and stir in thoroughly. Taste and add salt and pepper as desired. Ladle into individual soup bowls and garnish with an ounce of grated Swiss cheese on top of each. Serve at once.
