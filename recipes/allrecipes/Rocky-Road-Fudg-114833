In a large microwave-safe bowl, melt chocolate chips on high for 1-1/2 minutes; stir. Microwave 30-40 seconds longer or until smooth. Blend in marshmallows, cereal and walnuts. If desired, add butterscotch chips, coconut or raisins. Spread into a buttered foil-lined 8-in. square pan. Chill until firm. Lift out of the pan and remove the foil; cut into squares.
