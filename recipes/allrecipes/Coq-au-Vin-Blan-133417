Heat 2 tablespoons of the EVOO, 2 turns of the pan, in a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, dredge in flour and add to the pan in a single layer; do not crowd the meat. Cook the chicken until browned, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side. While the chicken is working, heat a large Dutch oven or deep skillet over medium-high heat with the remaining EVOO, 1 turn of the pan. When the olive oil is hot, add the bacon and cook until crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Pour off a little of the bacon fat, leaving a thin, even layer in the Dutch oven. Add the onions, mushrooms, bay leaf and thyme (the leaves will fall off the sprigs and into the sauce during cooking). Cook until the onions have a little color and the mushrooms are tender, about 7 to 8 minutes. Add the 2 tablespoons of flour to the Dutch oven and cook for 2 minutes. Deglaze with the chicken broth, scraping up all the brown bits from the bottom of the pan, and cook for 5 minutes. Preheat the broiler. Over high heat, add the wine to the cooked chicken in the skillet and scrape up all the brown bits. Reduce the liquid for about 5 minutes, then add the chicken and wine to the broth and vegetables in the Dutch oven; stir to combine. Stir in the cream, lower the heat to a simmer and reduce the sauce for about 5 minutes. Arrange the bread on the broiler pan or a baking sheet and toast on both sides. Rub the garlic across the hot toast and butter the toast lightly. Cut the slices of toast in half from corner to corner. Remove the bay leaf and thyme stems from the chicken and sauce. To serve, fan 4 toast triangles across each dinner plate, lining up the points, and then top with the chicken and sauce. Finish each plate with the bacon and parsley.
