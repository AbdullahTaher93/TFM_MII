Scrub potatoes and halve lengthwise; do not peel. Spray baking pan with nonstick cooking spray. Place potatoes, cut side down, in pan. Bake in a preheated 400-degree oven 30 to 40 minutes or until almost tender. Stir together cherry juice concentrate, brown sugar, butter and ginger. Turn potatoes cut-side up and brush with cherry mixture. Bake 5 to 10 minutes, or until tender. Sprinkle with green onion. Serve immediately.
