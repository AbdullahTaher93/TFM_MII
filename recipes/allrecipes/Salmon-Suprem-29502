Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place salmon fillets in a piece of foil large enough create a sealed packet, and layer with squash, zucchini, tomato, carrot and mushrooms. Drizzle with Creole-style hot pepper marinade, and top each fillet with a lemon slice. Seal foil tightly around salmon and vegetables. Place packet on a medium baking sheet. Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until vegetables are tender and fish is easily flaked with a fork.
