In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine corn, onion, carrot and 1 can chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 10 to 15 minutes or until onion is tender. Stir in remaining chicken broth, wild rice, green chili peppers, chili powder, cumin, oregano and cayenne pepper. Simmer, uncovered, about 5 minutes or until heated through. Top each bowl with fresh tomato salsa, sprinkle with cilantro and serve.
