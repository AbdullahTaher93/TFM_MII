Heat a grill to high heat. Place the flank steak on a sheet of heavy duty foil and fill the pocket of the flank steak with chili and diced chilies. Secure the opening of the flank steak with a skewer. Rub the surface of the steak with a thin film of oil (about 2 teaspoons) and season with the chili powder. Clean the grill grate with a metal brush and rub with oil. Put the steak on the grill, cover, and grill to medium-rare, about 8 minutes, turning once halfway through. Coat the flank steak with barbecue sauce and grill another minute on each side. Remove skewer, and cut flank steak in thin slices against the grain and serve.
