Bring the wine, vegetable stock, ginger, and garlic to boil in a skillet. Mix in the carrot and leek, and reduce heat to low. Simmer 5 minutes. Mix in scallops and prawns. Stir in the butter cubes. Continue cooking until butter is melted and scallops and prawns are opaque. Sprinkle with chives, and season with salt and pepper to serve.
