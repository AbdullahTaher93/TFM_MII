Melt margarine in a large pot; cook and stir beef chuck until browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in onion, red bell pepper, and green bell pepper. Continue to cook and stir until vegetables are golden, about 10 minutes more. Add 1 1/4 cup water, tomato paste, paprika, and garlic salt. Simmer until beef is almost tender, about 1 hour. Stir 5 cups water and beef bouillon into beef and onion soup; continue to simmer until beef is tender, about 30 minutes more. Mix 3 tablespoons cold water with cornstarch in a bowl; pour mixture into soup. Bring soup to a boil, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Season with Worcestershire sauce, marjoram, and hot pepper sauce.
