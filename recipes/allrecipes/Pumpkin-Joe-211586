Brown the ground beef with the onion in a large skillet over medium heat, breaking up the meat as it cooks, until the beef is crumbly and starting to brown, about 10 minutes. Drain the fat from the beef, and stir in the pumpkin pie spice, thyme, rosemary, salt, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, tomato soup, celery soup, and pumpkin. Mix in the pumpkin, and stir until all ingredients are well combined. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the flavors have blended and the mixture is thickened, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
