Light a grill. Bring a medium pot of water fitted with a steamer insert to a boil. Cut the heads of broccoli lengthwise into quarters, leaving the florets attached to the long stem. Peel the stems. Steam the broccoli until bright green, about 5 minutes. Transfer the broccoli to a large bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. In a blender or a mini processor, combine the anchovies, lemon juice and rosemary and puree until smooth. With the blender on, slowly pour in the remaining 1/2 cup of olive oil. Season the anchovy sauce with salt and pepper. Grill the broccoli over high heat, turning, until lightly charred all over, about 5 minutes. Transfer the broccoli to a platter and drizzle with some of the dressing. Serve the remaining dressing on the side.
