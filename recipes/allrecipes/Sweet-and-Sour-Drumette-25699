Dip chicken in egg beat, then flour. Fry in a large skillet until crispy, about 15 minutes. Drain and place in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). To Make Sauce: In a small bowl combine the soy sauce, water, sugar and vinegar. Mix together and pour over chicken. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until cooked through and juices run clear.
