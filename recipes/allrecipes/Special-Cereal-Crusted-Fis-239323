Season each cod fillet with 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Squeeze one lime half over each fillet. Spread the crushed cereal into a wide, shallow bowl. Gently press cod fillets into the cereal to coat and shake gently to remove loose, excess crumbs. Place breaded fillets onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Fry coated in the hot oil until the bottom is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip the fillets, reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking until golden brown and the fish flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 7 minutes more.
