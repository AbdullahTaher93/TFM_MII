Preheat toaster oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place spaghetti squash halves on a compact baking sheet. Place 5 pieces of butter into each half. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons brown sugar and 1 tablespoon cinnamon over each half. Bake in the preheated oven until soft, about 1 hour. Remove squash from oven and scrape insides with a fork into a loose pile of strands. Return to the oven and bake until flavors combine, about 10 minutes more. Let cool before serving, about 10 minutes.
