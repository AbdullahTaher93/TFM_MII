Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Place crust in 9-inch pie pan. Crimp or flute edge; set aside. Combine corn syrup, sugar, butter, eggs and salt in small bowl. Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until well mixed. Stir in 1 cup pecans and 1/2 cup chocolate chips by hand. Pour into prepared pie crust. Cover pie loosely with aluminum foil. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove aluminum foil; continue baking for 10 to 15 minutes or until filling is set. (If browning too quickly, recover with aluminum foil.) Cool; refrigerate at least 4 hours or until serving time. Dip additional pecan halves halfway into melted chocolate chips; if desired. Cover; refrigerate until set. Serve pie with sweetened whipped cream and garnish with dipped pecan halves, if desired.
