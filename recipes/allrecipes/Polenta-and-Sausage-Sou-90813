Remove sausage casings and discard. Crumble sausage into a 4- to 5-quart pan over medium heat and stir often until well browned, about 20 minutes. Pour off and discard any drippings in pan. Add broth, 2 cups water, and the polenta to pan. Bring mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat and simmer, stirring often, until polenta is creamy to bite, 7 to 10 minutes. Ladle soup into 4 bowls; top equally with cheese, then basil and pepper, if desired.
