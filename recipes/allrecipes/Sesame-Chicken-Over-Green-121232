In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the first six ingredients; mix well. Add chicken; seal bag and turn to coat. Refrigerate for several hours or overnight. Drain and discard marinade. Grill chicken, uncovered, over medium heat for 5-7 minutes on each side or until juices run clear. On four serving plates, divide the greens, red pepper, carrot, onions and olives. Thinly slice chicken and arrange over salad. Drizzle with ranch dressing; sprinkle with sesame seeds.
