Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line muffin tins with paper liners. In large bowl whisk LACTAID(R) Fat Free Milk, eggs, vanilla and margarine together. In separate bowl, whisk together flour, 6 tablespoons of sugar, baking powder, nutmeg and salt. Stir in cherries. Gradually add flour mixture to milk mixture. Do not overmix. Divide batter evenly among the lined muffin tins, filling each about 3/4 full. Sprinkle tops of muffins with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake until golden brown, firm to the touch and tests clean with a toothpick, about 20 minutes. Cool on a rack to cool slightly. Serve warm or at room temperature.
