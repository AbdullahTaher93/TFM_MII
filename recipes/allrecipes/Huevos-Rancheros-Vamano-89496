Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a casserole dish with cooking spray and lay the tortillas around the bottom like a four-leaf clover. Crack the eggs right on top. Sprinkle the beans right around not on the yolks. Pour the salsa verde over the beans. Sprinkle the cheese over the salsa verde. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until the egg whites are firm and the yolks are still a bit soft.
