Add the microwaved vegetables to the pot. Add minced sweet onion, celery, and ketchup. Add juice cocktail, vegetable broth, chicken broth, and tomatoes. Fill each can with water, and add the water to the mixture. Cover, and bring to a boil. Continue boiling for 30 minutes. Reduce heat to simmer and cook for 2 to 3 hours. Serve with slices of a French baguette. Have salt, black pepper, and Tabasco available to season to taste at the table.
