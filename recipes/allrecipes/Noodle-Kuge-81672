Boil the noodles according to the directions on the packet except reduce the time by about 2 minutes. Low carb noodles are awful when they are overcooked and you'll be baking the kugel so you want the noodles still firm. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Beat the egg thoroughly. Add the Splenda and stir. Then add the ricotta, sour cream, cream cheese, cinnamon, cardamom, vanilla extract and molasses and blend well until very creamy. Gently fold the noodles into the mixture. Pour into a greased 8x8 casserole dish. Bake at 350 degrees F for about 35 minutes. Serve warm.
