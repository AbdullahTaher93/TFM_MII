Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Season flour, eggs, and bread crumbs with salt and pepper. Mix cayenne pepper into the flour only. Dip each breast into flour, then into the beaten eggs, and then into the bread crumbs, coating evenly. Place onto a greased cookie sheet. Bake for 15 minutes on each side or until brown and crispy. While chicken bakes, heat oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and Brussels sprouts and stir until garlic releases its fragrance and sprouts are heated through, about 2 minutes. Stir in the flour. Then add the water, lemon juice, drained beans, and sugar. Stir over medium heat until sauce thickens, about 8 minutes. Add additional water if sauce is too thick. Remove from the heat and stir in remaining butter, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper. Place each piece of chicken onto a serving plate. Spoon the sauce over it and garnish with chopped parsley and remaining Parmesan cheese.
