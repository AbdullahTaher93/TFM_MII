Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray 12 regular-size muffin cups with cooking spray. In food processor, place granulated sugar and almonds; process about 30 seconds or until almonds are finely ground. Add cream cheese, vanilla, almond extract and egg yolk; process about 10 seconds or until combined. On lightly floured surface, unroll dough into 1 large rectangle. With floured rolling pin or fingers, roll or press dough into 12x9-inch rectangle, firmly pressing perforations to seal. Spread cream cheese mixture evenly over dough. Starting with 1 long side of dough rectangle, roll up dough into log (filling will be soft). With serrated knife, cut log into 12 slices; place slices, cut side up, in sprayed muffin cups. Bake at 375 degrees F for 11 to 15 minutes or until light golden brown. Remove from oven. With handle of wooden spoon, make indentation in center of each roll. Spoon 1 teaspoon preserves into each indentation. Return to oven; bake an additional 2 to 4 minutes or until golden brown. Run knife around edge of muffin cups to loosen; remove rolls from cups and place on wire racks. In small bowl, blend powdered sugar and water until smooth; drizzle over warm rolls. Serve warm or at room temperature. Store in refrigerator.
