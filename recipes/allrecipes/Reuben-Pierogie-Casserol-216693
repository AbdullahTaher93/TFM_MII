Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with the softened butter. Arrange the frozen pierogies into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the sauerkraut over top, then layer with the corned beef and Swiss cheese. Spread the salad dressing over the Swiss cheese, and sprinkle evenly with the bread crumbs. Wrap the dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove the aluminum foil, and continue baking until hot and bubbly, 10 to 20 minutes more.
