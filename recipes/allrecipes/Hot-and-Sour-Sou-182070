Measure out 1/2 cup chicken broth and set aside. In 4-quart saucepan bring the chicken broth to a boil. Add chicken, tofu, ham, bamboo shoots, and mushrooms. Lower heat and simmer 2 minutes. Stir in vinegar, soy sauce, sesame seed oil and white pepper. Bring to a boil. Blend cornstarch with reserved 1/2 cup broth. Gradually add cornstarch mixture, stirring constantly until soup thickens and boils. Slowly drizzle beaten eggs into soup, a little at a time, through the tines of a fork or whisk. Reduce heat. Garnish each portion with green onions and serve.
