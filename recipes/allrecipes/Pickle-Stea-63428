Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. Place one pickle spear and an equal amount of halved onion slices on one side of each piece of steak. Roll, and secure with toothpicks. Heat the oil in skillet over medium heat. Place the flour and eggs in two separate bowls. Dip rolled steak first in the eggs, then in the flour to coat. Fry coated steaks in the skillet until browned on all sides. Transfer to the baking dish. Pour cream of mushroom soup into the skillet, and scrape up browned bits. Pour evenly over the steaks in the baking dish. Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, to a minimum temperature of 160 degrees F (72 degrees F).
