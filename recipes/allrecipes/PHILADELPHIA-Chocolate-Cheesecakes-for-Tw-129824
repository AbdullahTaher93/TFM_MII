Beat cream cheese, sugar and chocolate in medium bowl with wire whisk until well blended. Add whipped topping; mix well. Place 1 cookie on bottom of each of 2 paper-lined medium muffin cups; fill evenly with cream cheese mixture. Refrigerate 2 hours or overnight. (Or, if you are in a hurry, place in the freezer for 1 hour.)
