Combine first four ingredients and mix until smooth, add more cream if needed. Lightly brush the baguette slices with melted butter and Italian herbs and brown in a flat pan, on stovetop, low heat. Once lightly browned, remove bread slices from the pan and place onto cutting board for assembly. Assembly: Spread the cheese mixture evenly over each piece of browned baguette. Place a rolled slice of turkey on each piece. Top with a dollop of cheese spread and chutney and serve. Garnish optional.
