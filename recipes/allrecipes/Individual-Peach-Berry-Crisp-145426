Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix peaches, blueberries, sugar, lemon juice, cornstarch, lemon zest, salt, and cinnamon in medium bowl. Let stand 10 minutes. Combine graham cracker crumbs, oats, butter, and pecans in small bowl and stir until mixture comes together. Coat 2 (6-ounce) ramekins with cooking spray. Divide peach mixture evenly between dishes. Top each with half of graham cracker mixture. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until topping is golden and peaches are heated through.
