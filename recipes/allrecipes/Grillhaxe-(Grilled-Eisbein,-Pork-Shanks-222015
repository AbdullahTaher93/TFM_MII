Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk olive oil, marjoram, basil, rosemary, thyme, sea salt, paprika, black pepper, and vegetable bouillon powder together in a bowl. Rub pork shanks with herb rub and arrange on a large baking pan. Roast in preheated oven until shanks are tender and outer skin is crispy, about 3 hours.
