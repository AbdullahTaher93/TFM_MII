Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Coat each chicken tender with taco seasoning mix. Separate dough into 8 triangles. Place 1 chicken tender on short side of each triangle. Starting with shortest side of triangle, roll dough around each chicken tender; place point side down on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 16 to 19 minutes or until wraps are deep golden brown and chicken is no longer pink in center. Serve with salsa for dipping.
