Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside to cool. Toss sweet potatoes in olive oil on a baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven until tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside to cool. Mix broccoli, yellow pepper, red pepper, and cucumber in a large bowl; stir in quinoa and sweet potatoes. Whisk extra-virgin olive oil, maple syrup, lemon juice, lime juice, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Mix dressing into salad; garnish with cilantro.
