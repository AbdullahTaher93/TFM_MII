Arrange chicken, onions, and asparagus in 2 large, shallow pans. Brush with oil. Sprinkle with tarragon, then salt and pepper to taste. Lay onions on a barbecue grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Turn onions over then add chicken to grill. Brown chicken on underside, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn onions and chicken over, then add asparagus. Cook, turning foods often, until chicken is no longer pink in thickest part (cut to test), and vegetables are tender-crisp, 3 to 5 minutes more. Serve the chicken and asparagus on a platter, sprinkled with crumbled blue cheese.
