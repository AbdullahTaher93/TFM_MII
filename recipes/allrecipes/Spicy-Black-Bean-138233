In a medium saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic and red-pepper flakes; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add black beans and 1 cup water. Bring to a simmer; cook, covered, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes. (Add more water for a thinner consistency if necessary.) Season with coarse salt, and garnish with cilantro leaves, if desired. Serve immediately.
