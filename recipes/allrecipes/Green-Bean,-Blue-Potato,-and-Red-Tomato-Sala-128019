Lightly coat a clean grill with cooking oil spray and preheat to medium-high. Grill tomatoes until lightly charred, about 3 minutes each side. Transfer to a plate and discard skins, if desired. Season tomatoes with salt and pepper. Remove the seeds from 1 tomato half and place in a blender along with the oil, shallot, vinegar, and mustard. Blend until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring the potatoes and enough cold salted water to cover to a boil and simmer until tender when pierced with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes and when cool enough to handle, cut into 1/2 inch-thick pieces. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the tomato dressing. Steam or boil the green beans until just tender and still bright green, about 4 minutes. Drain in colander; rinse under cold water. Drain well; stir into potatoes. Just before serving, stir in tomatoes and parsley; season to taste with salt and pepper.
