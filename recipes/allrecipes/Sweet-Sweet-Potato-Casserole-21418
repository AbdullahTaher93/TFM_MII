Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. Boil the sweet potatoes in a large saucepan approximately 10 minutes, or until tender. In a large bowl, mix together the sweet potatoes, brown sugar, milk, butter and flour. Transfer the mixture to the baking dish. Sprinkle with pecans and coconut. Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven.
