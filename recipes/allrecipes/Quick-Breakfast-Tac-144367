Top tortillas with salsa and cheese. Heat in the microwave until the cheese is melted, about 30 seconds. Meanwhile coat a small nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Heat over medium heat, add egg substitute and cook, stirring, until the eggs are cooked through, about 90 seconds. Divide the scrambled egg between the tacos.
