Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Saute the leeks and onion in the butter for 5 minutes, or until tender. Pour in the broth and the milk and mix well. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the potato flakes, salt, celery salt and parsley. Allow to thicken and heat through.
