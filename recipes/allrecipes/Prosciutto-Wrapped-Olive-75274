Cut the cheese into small (1/4-inch) pieces; stuff one piece into each olive. Cut prosciutto into 3 x 1/2-inch strips. Fold each strip lengthwise once to form 3 x 1/4-inch strips. Wrap a strip around each olive; secure with a pick and place on a lettuce lined serving plate. Cover and chill up to 24 hours before serving. Serve cold or at room temperature.
