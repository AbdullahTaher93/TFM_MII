Place tofu slices on a plate. Combine hemp seeds, flax seeds, wheat germ, walnuts, oregano, and thyme on a separate plate. Beat egg in a large bowl. Dip tofu slices in the egg, allowing excess to drip back into the bowl. Press coated tofu in the seed-nut mixture, coating both sides. Arrange coated tofu in 1 layer on a plate. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry tofu in the hot oil until browned, about 5 minutes per side.
