Cook bacon in heavy large skillet over medium heat until crisp. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels to drain. Pour off all but 1 1/2 teaspoons fat from skillet. Add sage, corn and shallots and saute. Add the water and increase the heat to medium-high and bring to boil. Gradually whisk in polenta. Reduce heat to low; cook until polenta begins to thicken, stirring frequently, about 20 minutes. Stir in the half & half, cheese, and bacon. Season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
