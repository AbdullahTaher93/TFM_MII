Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 8-inch square cake pans with wax paper; grease and flour them. Prepare the cake mix according to the package directions. Stir the SNICKERS(R) Bars into the batter before dividing it evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Transfer to a wire rack; cool about 10 minutes. Invert and let cool completely. To make the ribbon pieces, soften STARBURST(R) in the microwave about 3 to 5 seconds. Then roll the softened candy into an 8 x 6-inch rectangle between two sheets of wax paper. Cut the candy lengthwise into two strips, each 1-1/2 inches wide. Fold the two strips in half, making loops of a bow. Notch the bottoms of the two remaining strips, making the bow's ribbons. Set aside. Place one cake layer on a serving platter. Spread 3/4 of the frosting. Place the remaining cake layer on top and cover with the remaining frosting. Arrange the MILKY WAY(R) Bars around the base of the cake. Mark the top of the cake with an "X", dividing it evenly between four equal squares. Arrange M&M'S(R) in three rows over the marks, on top and down the sides of the cake. Arrange the bow pieces in the cake's center.
