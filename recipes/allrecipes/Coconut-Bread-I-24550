Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, beat together sugar and vegetable oil. Beat in eggs and coconut extract. In a separate bowl, sift together flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture alternately with buttermilk and coconut. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean.
