Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a 13 inch X 9 inch baking dish and a baking sheet with cooking spray. Place the squash, cut side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 30 minutes, or until tender. With a fork, scrape the squash strands into a large bowl. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, onion, and basil and cook for 4 minutes, or until soft. Add the tomatoes and cook for 3 minutes, or until the mixture is dry. To the bowl with the squash, add the cottage cheese, mozzarella, parsley, salt, and the tomato mixture. Toss to coat. Place in the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with the Parmesan and bread crumbs. Bake for 30 minutes, or until hot and bubbly.
