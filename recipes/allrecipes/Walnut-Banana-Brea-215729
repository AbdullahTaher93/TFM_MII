Preheat oven to 325 degrees F degrees. Grease one 9 x 5 x 3-inch loaf pan and set aside. Soak raisins in 1 cup water for 10-15 minutes until raisins are plumped. Meanwhile, grind flax seed in a coffee or herb grinder until powdery. Drain raisins, reserving liquid. Mix this liquid into flax seed powder, stir until mixture thickens slightly. In a medium mixing bowl, mix mashed bananas and flax seed mixture. Let sit. In a separate bowl, beat egg with canola oil. Add sugars, beat until smooth. Add vanilla yogurt. Set aside. In a third bowl, sift together flours, oat bran, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Add alternately banana mixture and egg mixture, stirring until batter is just mixed. Gently fold in raisins and walnuts. Spoon batter evenly into bread pan. Bake for 45 minutes then tent lightly with foil. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes more or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
