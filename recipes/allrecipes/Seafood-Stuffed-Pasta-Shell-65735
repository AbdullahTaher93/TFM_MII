Thoroughly combine cheese, egg, green onions, half of parsley, lemon peel and salt. Gently stir in shrimp; set aside. Blend sweet & sour sauce, sugar and water; spread 1/4 cup mixture over bottom of 13 x 9-inch non-metal baking dish. Stuff shells with cheese mixture; place, filled side up, in single layer on sauce in pan. Pour remaining sweet & sour sauce mixture evenly over shells. Cover baking pan tightly with foil. Bake in 350 degrees F oven 35 minutes, or until hot and bubbly. Just before serving, sprinkle remaining half of parsley over shells.
