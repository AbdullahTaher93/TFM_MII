Mince the shallots and garlic, set aside. Slice the tomatoes and set aside. Measure out the Parmesan cheese and set aside. In a bowl, beat the eggs with the oregano, salt and pepper. Add the ricotta cheese and whip until mostly incorporated (no lumps bigger than a pea). Let sit for about a couple of minutes. Prepare broiler, set rack as close as it can go and preheat. In a skillet over medium heat, melt the butter and saute the asparagus, shallots and garlic for about 1 minute. Add the egg mixture and start scraping it up from the bottom and sides (just a bit more gently then you would for scrambled eggs). When it is about 1/2 way set, remove from heat, smooth out top with your spatula, distribute tomato slices on top and sprinkle the cheese evenly over the top. Put under the broiler with the skillet handle propping open the door. Broil until the cheese starts to turn brown. Be sure to use a towel or pot holder to remove the skillet. If you used a non-stick skillet it will slide out easily onto a plate where it can be cut into pie wedges to be served.
