Place white beans into a bowl and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain soaked beans. Place in a pot and cover with cold water about 1 inch above top of beans. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium and simmer until starting to soften, about 25 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Drain beans; transfer to clay (or ceramic) cooking pot. Add onion, lard, maple syrup, mustard, and pepper; mix well. Cover with boiling water; place a lid on top. Bake in preheated oven 2 hours. Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Remove lid from pot; continue baking beans until the top has browned, 10 to 15 more minutes.
