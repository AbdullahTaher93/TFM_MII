In a skillet or wok, cook the chicken and onions in oil until chicken juices run clear. In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch, orange juice, soy sauce and ginger until smooth. Pour over chicken mixture. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1 minute or until thickened. Serve over rice. Top with orange segments, walnuts and parsley.
