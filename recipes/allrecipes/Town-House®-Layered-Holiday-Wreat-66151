Preparation: For wreath base, arrange Town House Crackers in a circle on a cutting board or large platter. Top each cracker with a variety of different cheeses and meats. The cheeses can be cut in holiday shapes, such as trees, bells, or snowmen. Assembly: Continue layering crackers, cheeses and meats to create wreath. Top each new cracker with more cheese and meats. Garnish wreath with raspberries and place a bow in lower right-hand corner. Bring to room temperature before mounding on crackers to bake.
