Mix lime juice, olive oil, thyme, garlic, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a resealable plastic bag. Place trout fillets in bag, seal the bag, and marinate in refrigerator at least 30 minutes. Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove fillets from marinade and shake off excess; discard used marinade. Grill fish on preheated grill until the flesh flakes easily, 10 to 15 minutes, turning once.
