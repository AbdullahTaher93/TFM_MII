Place eggs (and water to cover) in a medium saucepan. Bring water to a boil, remove from heat and let cool. Peel eggs and remove yolks. Press yolks through a sieve and set aside. Cut the butter into small pieces. Add in the flour, sugar, egg yolks, hard-boiled egg yolks, lemon zest, cinnamon and salt in a mixing bowl. Mix with your hands until the dough holds together and all the ingredients are well blended. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours. Roll out the dough 1/4-inch thick on a lightly floured surface. Using a 2 1/2 - 3 inch heart-shaped cookie cutter, cut out as many hearts as possible. Gather the dough scraps, reroll, and cut out more hearts. Using a smaller heart-shaped cookie cutter, cut out the centers of half the cookies. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Spread each whole heart with a thin coating of raspberry jam. Top with the hearts with cut out centers. Repeat until all the dough has been used. Place the hearts 1 inch apart on the lined baking sheets. Beat the 2 eggs with water in a small bowl and brush lightly over the cookie frames. Bake the cookies just until light golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on wire racks and store in the freezer or in an airtight container until ready to serve.
