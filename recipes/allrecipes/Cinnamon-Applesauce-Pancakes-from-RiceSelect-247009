Combine cooked rice, milk, applesauce, egg, coconut oil, and vanilla in a medium-sized bowl. Whisk until well combined. Combine remaining pancake ingredients and stir into the brown rice mixture until well blended. Heat a large nonstick skillet (sprayed with vegetable spray) over medium heat. Pour batter into skillet, about 1/4 cup per pancake. Flip after 2-3 minutes or when edges start to turn golden and bubbles begin to appear on surface. Cook another 1-2 minutes on second side until golden. Top pancakes with butter mixture and cooked apples, if desired.
