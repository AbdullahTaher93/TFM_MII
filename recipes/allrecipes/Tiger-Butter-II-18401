In a pan, melt butterscotch chips and peanut butter. Stir in rice cereal when the peanut butter and chips have melted. Stir in peanuts if desired. Transfer mixture into an 8x8 inch casserole dish. In the top of a double boiler, melt the chocolate chips. Pour the melted chocolate over the top of the candy in the dish and swirl with a fork. Chill and cut into squares to serve.
