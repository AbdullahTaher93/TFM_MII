In a blender or food processor, combine the orange juice, rum and habanero chile pepper and puree until smooth; set aside. In a large skillet over medium high heat, saute the pork chops in the oil for 5 minutes per side, or until well browned. Pour in the orange juice mixture, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Flip chops over and simmer for 30 more minutes.
