Bring rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Let rice cool for at least 30 minutes, stirring several times as it cools. Transfer to a large salad bowl. Mix vegetable oil, lemon juice, wine vinegar, sugar, chives, tarragon, and salt together in a bowl until the sugar and salt have dissolved. Pour dressing over the cooled rice and stir to combine. Mix your choice of slivered almonds, raisins, mandarin orange segments, onion, celery, bell pepper, and peas into the rice mixture and lightly toss to combine. Cover salad and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.
