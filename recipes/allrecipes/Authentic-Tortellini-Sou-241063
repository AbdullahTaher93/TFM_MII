Pour 1 can broth into a small saucepan and add tortellini; bring to a boil. Cook tortellini until tender yet firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium heat; cook and stir sausage, onion, garlic, and Italian seasoning until sausage is browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Add tortellini-broth mixture, remaining can of broth, tomato puree, and spinach to sausage mixture; cover stockpot and simmer until flavors blend, about 30 minutes.
