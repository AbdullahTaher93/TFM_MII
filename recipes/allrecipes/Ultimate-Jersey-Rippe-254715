Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Wrap each hot dog with a slice of bacon, securing ends with toothpicks. Fry hot dogs 2 at a time in hot oil until they float to the surface, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Pour onions into a small pot over low heat. Stir until heated through, about 5 minutes. Arrange fried hot dogs in rolls. Garnish with onions and crushed corn chips.
