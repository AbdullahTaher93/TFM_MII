Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Form refrigerated cookie dough into cups, using about 1/2 cup dough to form about a 3-inch tall cup. Place cups on ungreased cookie sheet about 1-inch apart. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer cups to a wire cooling rack and allow to cool, 10 to 15 minute. Fill each cup with 1/2 cup ice cream and top with 1 tablespoon crushed chocolate sandwich cookies.
