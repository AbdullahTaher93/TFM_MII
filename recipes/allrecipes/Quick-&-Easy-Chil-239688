Cook the beef and onion in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until the beef is well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat. Stir in the beans, chili powder, cumin and soup and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 10 minutes. Serve with the cheese, sour cream, onions and cilantro.
