Combine chicken broth, chicken, onion, and garlic in a large pot over medium heat. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until onion is tender, about 10 minutes. Stir spinach and artichoke hearts into the pot. Bring broth back to a simmer. Drop in cream cheese in large spoonfuls, stirring continuously until melted, about 5 minutes.
