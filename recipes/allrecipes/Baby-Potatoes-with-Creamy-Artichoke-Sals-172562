Place rack in center of oven and preheat to 500 degrees F. Cut potatoes in half crosswise. Cut a small slice off each end so they sit flat. Place on baking sheet and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle with salt. Turn cut side down, spray and sprinkle with salt. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until soft when tested with a sharp knife. Cool slightly. Using a melon baller or tsp., scoop out insides, leaving a 1/4-in. shell. Place potato insides in a bowl. Stir in mayonnaise, salsa, artichokes, and mozzarella. Spoon into shells, mounding the tops. You may have a little left over. Before serving, sprinkle tops with parmesan. In a 450 degrees F oven, bake for 5 to 10 minutes or until heated through. Serve warm or at room temperature.
