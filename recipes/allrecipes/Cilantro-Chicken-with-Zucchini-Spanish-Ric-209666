Combine 1/4 cup cilantro, 1 tablespoon olive oil and garlic in large bowl. Add chicken and toss to coat. Cover and marinate in refrigerator 15 minutes. Blend sour cream and remaining 1 tablespoon cilantro in a small bowl; set aside. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat and cook zucchini, stirring occasionally, 4 minutes or until crisp-tender. Stir in water and Knorr(R) Fiesta Sides(TM) - Spanish Rice and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer covered 7 minutes or until rice is tender. Remove from heat and let stand 2 minutes; stir. Meanwhile, cook chicken in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, 8 minutes or until chicken is thoroughly cooked. Arrange chicken next to zucchini rice on a serving platter. Serve with sour cream mixture and garnish, if desired, with fresh cilantro sprigs, sliced lime wedges and hot pepper sauce.
