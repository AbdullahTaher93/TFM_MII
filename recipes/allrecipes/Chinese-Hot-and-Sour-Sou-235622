Stir the cornstarch and water in a small bowl until the mixture is smooth. Heat the mushrooms, broth and bamboo shoots in a 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat to a boil. Add the cornstarch mixture and heat to a boil, stirring constantly with a whisk. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Stir in the pork and tofu and cook for 3 minutes or until the pork is cooked through. Stir in the egg. Cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally with a whisk. Sprinkle with the onion.
