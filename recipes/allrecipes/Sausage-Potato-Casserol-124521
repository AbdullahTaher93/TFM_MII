In a large skillet, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. In a bowl, combine the soup, milk, onion, salt and pepper. In an ungreased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish, layer half the potatoes, soup mixture and sausage; repeat layers. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours or until the potatoes are tender. Uncover and sprinkle with cheese. Bake 5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.
