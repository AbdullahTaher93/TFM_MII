In a medium saucepan, heat the milk and chocolate over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the chocolate is melted and the sauce is hot. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the reserved pear syrup. Let the sauce cool slightly before ladling over the ice cream. Spoon the pears over the sundaes. Garnish with mint sprigs, if desired.
