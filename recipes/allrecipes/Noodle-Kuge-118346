Cook noodles according to package directions; drain. Toss with butter; set aside. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs, sugar, sour cream and cottage cheese until well blended. Stir in the noodles. Transfer to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Combine the cracker crumbs and butter; sprinkle over top. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 50-55 minutes or until a thermometer reads 160 degrees F. Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting. Serve warm or cold.
