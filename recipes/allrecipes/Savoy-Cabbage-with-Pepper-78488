In a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add caraway and mustard seeds and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in cabbage and jalapeno and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in chicken broth and cover the pan tightly. Reduce heat to low and simmer until the cabbage is tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in red peppers and season with salt and pepper. (The cabbage can be made up to 8 hours ahead and stored, covered, in the refrigerator. Reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave before serving.)
