In a food processor, whirl together flours, sugar, baking soda, salt, and 1 tablespoon of sesame seed until blended. Add butter and whirl until butter is incorporated and mixture resembles course cornmeal. With motor running, add buttermilk and whirl just until mixture is evenly moistened. With lightly floured hands, shape dough into 12 equal balls. Space evenly on an oiled 12- by 15-inch baking sheet. Pat each ball to flatten to about 1 inch. Sprinkle biscuits with remaining sesame seed. Bake biscuits in a 450 degrees F oven until deep golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Serve warm.
