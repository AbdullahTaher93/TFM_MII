Lobster should be at room temperature prior to cooking. Remove meat from shell. The easiest way to do this is by striking the tails lengthwise with a sharp cleaver and then breaking the tail apart. Cut the lobster meat into bite sized pieces. In a sauce pan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for a minute. Add the white wine, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, and paprika. Whisk together until well blended. Add a dash of salt and pepper and simmer for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, rinse well the spinach leaves. If leaves are large, cut them into smaller pieces. Bring your steamer to a boil but do not add the spinach until you are ready to cook the lobster. The spinach should be added to the steamer 1 minute after the lobster is added to the sauce pan Add lobster to the sauce pan and simmer for 3 minutes, stir occasionally. Do not over cook. Turn off the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Drain the spinach well. Divide between two plates. Spoon the lobster over the spinach with plenty of the juices. Serve immediately.
