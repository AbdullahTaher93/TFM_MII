Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the cabbage leaves and cook until just tender, about 2-3 minutes. Let cool. In a saute pan heat the olive oil. Add the onions and garlic and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the ground beef and cook for 5 minutes. Add the cloves and cook for 1 more minute. Add the sugar, Italian dressing, and rice. Simmer for 5 minutes. Let cool. Lay the cabbage leaves out flat. Spoon some of the beef mixture in the cabbage leaves, fold the sides in and roll up tight. Place in a baking dish and cover with the creamy marinara sauce. Cover with foil and place in a 350 degrees F oven and bake for 30 minutes. Serve.
