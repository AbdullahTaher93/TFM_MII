Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion until tender, about 5 minutes. Add rice and almonds, cooking and stirring until rice is lightly toasted, about 5 minutes more. Stir in water, bouillon, and parsley; cover and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until water is absorbed and rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and allow rice to rest for 5 minutes before serving.
