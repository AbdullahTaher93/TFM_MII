Place 1 cup M&M'S Brand Chocolate Candies for Halloween in the center of a cellophane square. Gather the sides up and around the candy, tie closed with ribbon. Cut off the excess cellophane. Trace and cut 8 cones and brims for the witches hats from craft foam. To make the hats, interlock and fit the slots of the cones, creating a cone shape, glue and secure with a paper clip while drying. In the meantime, glue decorations on the brim and set aside to dry. Once dry, slip the cone through the hole in the brim, fitting it snuggly near the base of the cone. Secure with a few dots of glue. Set aside to dry. Once dry, nestle one hat on top of each M&M'S Brand Chocolate Candies ball. Arrange them onto tops of brooms, as in the photo, or in the center of a table or tray.
