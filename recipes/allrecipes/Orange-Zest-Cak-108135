Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and line with parchment paper a 9x9 inch baking pan. In a medium bowl, stir together SPLENDA(R) and egg whites, then mix in applesauce. Stir in yogurt and orange zest. Combine the flour, baking powder and baking soda; stir into the mixture just until blended. Pour the batter into the greased and lined 9x9 inch baking pan. Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted into the cake comes out clean. Poke holes in the cake with a knife, and pour the juice from the oranges over the cake slowly until it has all been absorbed.
