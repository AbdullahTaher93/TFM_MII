Stir together beer, teriyaki sauce, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, water, liquid smoke, and ketchup in a large bowl. Stir in red pepper flakes, salt, onion salt, pepper, and garlic powder until blended. Cut the round steak into long strips about 1 inch wide by 1/4 inch thick. Toss the meat with the marinade until the strips are well coated. Tightly cover the bowl, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 6 hours.
