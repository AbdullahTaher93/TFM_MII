In a mixing bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups flour, sugar, yeast, salt, and baking powder. In a saucepan, heat orange juice and butter to 120 degrees F (49 degrees C). Add to dry ingredients; beat on low speed for 30 seconds. Beat on high for 3 minutes. Add orange peel. Stir in remaining flour (batter will be thick). Stir in raisins (do not knead). Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat an 8 x 4-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray and sprinkle with cornmeal; spoon batter into pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack.
