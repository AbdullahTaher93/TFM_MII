In a small nonstick skillet, saute onions and garlic in margarine for 1-2 minutes. Stir in the seasonings. Brush over cut sides of French bread; sprinkle with cheese. Wrap each piece of bread loosely in a large piece of heavy-duty foil; seal edges of foil. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until heated through and cheese is melted. Cut each piece into six slices. Serve warm.
