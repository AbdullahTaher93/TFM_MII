Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large baking dish with cooking spray. Combine canned fruit and onion in a food processor; blend until almost pureed. Mix in Szechuan sauce and sugar. Pour into a shallow bowl. Mix bread crumbs and Szechuan seasoning together in a shallow dish. Dredge pork chops in fruit mixture; coat with bread crumbs. Transfer to the baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
