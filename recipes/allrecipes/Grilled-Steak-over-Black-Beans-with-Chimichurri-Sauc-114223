In a medium saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over moderately low heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the beans, broth, tomatoes, pimentos, bay leaf, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Simmer until thickened, about 20 minutes. Remove the bay leaf. Light the grill or heat the broiler. Rub the steak with the remaining oil; sprinkle with the remaining salt and the pepper. Grill or broil for 4 minutes. Turn; cook to your taste, about 4 minutes longer for medium-rare. Cut into thin diagonal slices. Top the beans with the steak and sauce.
