For Panna Cotta: Grease four 6-ounce or six 4-ounce ramekins or custard cups. Place water in a small bowl; add gelatin and let stand to soften. Place evaporated milk, sugar and vanilla extract in a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes or until sugar is dissolved. Turn off heat. Add gelatin mixture; stir gently to dissolve gelatin. Pour into prepared ramekins; sprinkle with crushed Butterfinger. Refrigerate for 2 hours or until panna cottas are firm. For Nests: Place coconut in a resealable bag. Add green and yellow food coloring; seal bag and shake to thoroughly mix. If necessary, add 1 to 2 teaspoons of water to help color mix. Top panna cottas with coconut grass; top with 1 to 2 unwrapped Nestle NestEggs.
