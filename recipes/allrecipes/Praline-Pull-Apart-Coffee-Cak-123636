In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in 1/4 cup water; set aside. In a mixing bowl, combine milk powder, butter, salt and remaining sugar and water; mix well. Add 2-1/2 cups flour, eggs and yeast mixture; mix well. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, sprinkle pecans in two greased 9-in. round cake pans. Combine brown sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, vanilla and salt; sprinkle over pecans. Drizzle butter over top. Divide dough in half; shape each half into 16 balls. Place balls over topping. Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool for 1 minute; invert onto a serving platter.
