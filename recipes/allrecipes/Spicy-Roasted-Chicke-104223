Place chicken, skin side up, in a roasting pan. Brush the chicken with oil, then with juice from 1/2 of lemon. Sprinkle chicken with 1 teaspoon Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM). Divide minced garlic over chicken. Rub into skin to coat all sides; add shallots around chicken. Place pan in the oven and roast at 375 degrees F for about 30 minutes. Baste chicken pieces with pan juices occasionally. Continue to roast chicken until juices run clear (thermometer registers at 175 degrees F), about 20 minutes. Remove chicken pieces to platter; cover. Skim off grease from roasting pan and place pan on top of the stove. Add water to remaining juices; bring to boil while scraping bottom of pan vigorously with wooden spoon, loosening all the crisp bits in the bottom of the pan. Add juice from remaining one-half lemon and remaining 1/2 teaspoon Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM). Let reduce by half; adjust seasoning. Serve over chicken pieces.
