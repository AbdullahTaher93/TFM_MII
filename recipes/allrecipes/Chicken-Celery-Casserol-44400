Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic, and saute for a few minutes until tender. Add chicken pieces, and fry until lightly browned. Transfer the mixture to a 9x13 inch baking dish, and stir in the celery soup, celery, mushrooms, and carrots. Season with poultry seasoning, salt and pepper to taste. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Cover the dish, and bake for 2 hours. Serve over chicken flavored rice. Can be made the night before and reheated before serving.
