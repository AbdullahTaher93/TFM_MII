To make the sauce: Place the cornstarch in a cup. Add 2 tablespoons of the orange juice and stir until smooth. Place the remaining orange juice in a small saucepan. Add the lime juice and honey and cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat for 1 minute, or until the honey is dissolved. Add the cornstarch mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute, or until thickened. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving. To make the ricotta cream: In a food processor or blender, process the ricotta until smooth. Add the cream cheese, honey, lime peel, and vanilla extract. Process until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use. To make the pancakes: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine the oat bran, flour, baking powder, and baking soda. In a medium bowl, combine the egg whites and buttermilk. Add to the flour mixture and stir just until blended. Heat a large nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray over medium heat. For each pancake, spoon about 3 tablespoons batter into the skillet and spread to form a 3 inch pancake. Cook for 2 minutes, or until tiny bubbles appear on the surface and the edges begin to look dry. Flip and cook for 2 minutes, or until golden. Place the pancakes on the prepared baking sheet and place in the oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter to make a total of 8 pancakes. For each serving, spread a pancake with the ricotta cream and top with a second pancake. Drizzle with the sauce.
