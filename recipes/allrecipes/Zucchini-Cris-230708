Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix zucchini, white sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Pour mixture into baking dish. Combine brown sugar, oats, and flour in another bowl. Cut in margarine until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; sprinkle over zucchini. Bake in preheated oven until bubbly and zucchini is tender, 40 to 45 minutes.
