Preheat broiler. In medium bowl, stir together Queso Blanco cheese, mayonnaise, shrimp, onions, chipotle puree, chopped cilantro, lime zest and cumin. Season with salt and pepper. Spread about 1 tablespoon mixture onto each tortilla chip and place on a baking sheet. Broil until mixture begins to brown, about 1 minute. Sprinkle each with a generous teaspoon of Cotija cheese. To serve: put a cilantro leaf on each nacho and serve immediately.
