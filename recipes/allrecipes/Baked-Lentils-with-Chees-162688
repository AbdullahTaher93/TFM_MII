Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a 3 quart casserole, combine the water and lentils. Season with the bay leaf, salt, pepper, marjoram, sage and thyme. Stir in onions, garlic, and stewed tomatoes. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and stir in the carrots and celery. Cover and continue to bake until the lentils and vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven a third time, stir in the green bell pepper and sprinkle cheese over the top. Bake, uncovered, until cheese has melted, about 5 more minutes.
