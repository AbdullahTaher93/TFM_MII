Cook pasta in boiling water. While pasta is cooking, saute onion and garlic in oil for about 5 minutes. Remove to bowl. Add shrimp to remaining drippings, and cook for about 3 minutes. Stir in artichoke hearts, wine, lemon juice, lemon peel, salt, pepper, and cooked onion. Heat to boiling over high heat. Reduce heat to low; simmer, covered, for 4 to 5 minutes. Toss with pasta and parsley. Serve immediately.
