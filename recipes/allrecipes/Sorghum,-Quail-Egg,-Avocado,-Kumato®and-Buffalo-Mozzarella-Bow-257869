Bring water and sorghum to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until sorghum is tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 1 hour. Place eggs in a saucepan and fill with water; boil for 4 minutes. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit for 5 minutes. Mix sorghum, Sriracha salt, and cumin together in a bowl. Drizzle 1 tablespoon avocado oil and vinegar over sorghum mixture and mix well; divide between 2 bowls. Rinse quail eggs under cold water; peel and cut each egg in half. Set egg halves on top of sorghum mixture. Shred mozzarella cheese using your hands; divide between the 2 bowls of sorghum. Tear basil leaves and sprinkle over mozzarella cheese. Divide avocado, tomato, and radishes between the bowls.
