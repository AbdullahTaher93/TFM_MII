Cook pasta according to the package directions. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and cook until slightly browned (less than a minute). Add escarole; stirring occasionally until wilted, about 2 minutes. Add beans, tomatoes with their juice and wine. Simmer 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season to taste with salt and pepper; stir in basil and heat through. Drain pasta and toss with the sauce.
