Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with baking parchment. Mix oats, wheat germ, oat bran, almonds, flaxseed, pumpkin seeds, and salt together in a bowl. Beat maple syrup and egg white together in a separate bowl; pour into the oat mixture and stir to coat completely. Spread the mixture onto prepared baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven, rotating pans every 20 minutes, for 90 minutes. Increase heat to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) and continue baking until golden brown, about 30 minutes more. Transfer the oat mixture to a large bowl, add coconut and cranberries, and stir. Let granola cool to room temperature.
