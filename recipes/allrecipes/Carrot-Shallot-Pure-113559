In a medium saucepan, cover the carrots with water and simmer over moderate heat until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, reserving the liquid. In a skillet, saute the shallot in the oil over moderately low heat until softened, about 7 minutes. Transfer to a food processor with the carrots and 1/3 cup of the cooking liquid and process until smooth. Transfer to a bowl, season with salt and nutmeg and serve.
