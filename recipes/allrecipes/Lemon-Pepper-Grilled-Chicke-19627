In a small bowl, mix lemon pepper, dry mustard and crushed dried rosemary. Place chicken breast halves in a medium bowl. Rub with garlic. Introduce the lemon pepper mixture and rub it into the chicken. Pour in lemon juice and dry white wine. Cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours before grilling. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Cook marinated chicken breasts on the prepared grill until meat is no longer pink and juices run clear, or to desired doneness.
