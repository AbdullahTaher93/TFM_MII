Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place pizza crust onto a floured work surface and spread with pesto. Arrange artichoke heart pieces over pesto; scatter kalamata olives and pepperoncini slices over pizza. Top with feta cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is crisp on the bottom and feta cheese has melted, 10 to 12 minutes.
