Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Heat non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add roast beef hash, onions, and chili garlic sauce; cook and stir to break up the hash and until onions soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour in 5 beaten eggs and cook, stirring constantly, until eggs just begin to set but are still very loose. Remove skillet from heat. Stir in cilantro and tomatoes. Lightly flour a work surface. Roll out each empanada wrapper into a 6-inch circle. Scoop 1/3 cup hash filling onto center of each wrapper. Fold each wrapper in half to enclose the filling; crimp edges with times of a fork to seal. Cut 2 half-inch slits on top of each empanada. Transfer to prepared baking sheet. Whisk 2 eggs with 2 tablespoons water to make egg wash. Brush egg wash over the tops of the empanadas. Bake in preheated oven on middle rack until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
