Stir the Italian-style stewed tomatoes and tomato sauce in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the crushed garlic cloves in the hot oil until lightly browned; remove from the skillet and add to the tomato mixture. Cook and stir the onions in the oil remaining in the skillet until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir the cooked onions into the tomato mixture. Stir the basil leaves into the tomato mixture. Allow the tomato mixture to simmer until the onions partially dissolve into the sauce, at least 2 hours, stirring every 15 minutes. Remove and discard the basil leaves. Set aside 2 quarts of the sauce for use in this recipe. The rest can be frozen for later use. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the sliced potatoes in the hot oil until the slices begin to soften in the center, turning frequently to ensure even cooking, about 10 minutes; season with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper, and crushed red pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low. Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the potatoes, continuing to turn as you add the cheese, and continue cooking until the potatoes are cooked through. Layer the sliced mozzarella over the potatoes, reduce heat to low, and cover the skillet with a lid; simmer until the cheese melts entirely. Pour about 2 quarts of the tomato sauce over the potato and cheese mixture; again cover the skillet and allow to simmer another 5 minutes. Remove the skillet from heat entirely and allow to rest 2 to 3 minutes before serving.
