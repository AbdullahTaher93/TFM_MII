Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Cover and bring the water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until just tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Rinse broccoli under cold water until chilled; set aside. Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir pine nuts in the olive oil until lightly toasted, 2 to 3 minutes; remove from heat. Whisk rice vinegar, vegetable oil, garlic, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Transfer broccoli, pine nuts, and raisins to rice vinegar dressing; toss to coat.
