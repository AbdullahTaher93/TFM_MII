Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a large pot of salted water, cook penne according to package instructions. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot, then set pot over low heat. Meanwhile, in a large frying pan over medium-high heat, cook pancetta until browned and crisp, about 6 minutes. Remove from pan to a plate lined with a paper towel to drain. Add mushrooms to pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Add garlic; cook 2 minutes longer. Season with the salt and pepper to taste. Add spinach to pasta by handfuls, stirring so the heat from the pasta wilts the spinach. Add the mushroom mixture and crumbled pancetta, then the fontina and the half-and-half. Stir to combine. Transfer pasta to a buttered 9- by 13-inch ovenproof dish and sprinkle with parmesan. Bake, covered with a greased piece of foil, for 30 minutes. Uncover and continue baking until top is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes more.
