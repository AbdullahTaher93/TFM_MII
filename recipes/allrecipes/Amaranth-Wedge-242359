Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray an 8-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Combine water and amaranth in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Mix peanut butter, applesauce, honey, and egg together in a bowl. Add cooked amaranth, garbanzo bean flour, oats, sunflower seeds, chia seeds, baking powder, and cinnamon and mix well; spread into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cut into wedges and store in a container in the refrigerator.
