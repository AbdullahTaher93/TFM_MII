Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 13x9-inch baking dish. Mix hash brown potatoes, ham, Cheddar cheese, cream of potato soup, Alfredo sauce, frozen mixed vegetables, milk, and onion together in the prepared baking dish. Mix crushed crackers and melted butter together in a bowl, making sure the crackers are moistened completely; spread over the top of potato mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until cracker layer is browned and the liquid is bubbling, 30 to 45 minutes. Let casserole cool 15 minutes before serving.
