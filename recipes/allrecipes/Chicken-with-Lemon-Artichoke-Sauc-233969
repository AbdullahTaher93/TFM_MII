Season chicken breast halves with salt and pepper. Heat oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry chicken breasts in the hot skillet in batches until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side. Remove chicken from the skillet and keep warm. Stir white wine into the skillet, scraping any browned bits off the bottom. Whisk chicken broth, apple juice, lemon juice, Parmesan cheese, and parsley in wine; simmer until liquid is reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Add heavy cream and whisk until sauce is smooth. Stir artichoke hearts into cream sauce; continue to cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Serve sauce over chicken.
