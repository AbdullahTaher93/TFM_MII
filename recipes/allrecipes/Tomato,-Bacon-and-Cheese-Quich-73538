Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Allow pie crust to thaw; pierce bottom and sides with a fork. Parbake crust directly on rack in center of oven for 7 minutes; remove from oven. Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp. Remove bacon; drain on paper towels then crumble; set aside. Reserve 1 tablespoon drippings; drain remaining fat. Add onion to reserved drippings. Cook over medium-high heat until soft; set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs and cream. Blend in bacon, onion, drained tomatoes, cheese, and basil. Pour into pie shell; spread ingredients evenly. Bake about 55 minutes or until a knife inserted in center comes out clean. Allow to stand 10 minutes before serving.
