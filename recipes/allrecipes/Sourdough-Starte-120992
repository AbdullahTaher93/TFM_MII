In a 4-qt. non-metallic bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water; let stand for 5 minutes. Add flour; stir until smooth. Cover loosely with a clean towel. Let stand in a warm place (80 degrees F-90 degrees F) to ferment for 48 hours; stir several times daily (the mixture will become bubbly and rise, have "yeasty" sour aroma and a transparent yellow liquid will form on the top). Use starter for your favorite sourdough recipes. The starter will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Use and replenish or nourish at least every 2 weeks.
