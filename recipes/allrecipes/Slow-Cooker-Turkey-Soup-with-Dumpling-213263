Place the turkey, onion, celery, potatoes, carrots, corn, poultry seasoning, onion powder, and garlic powder into a slow cooker, and pour the chicken stock over the turkey and vegetables. Mix well and season to taste with salt and black pepper. Set the cooker on Low, cover, and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 6 hours. Whisk the flour, baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt together in a bowl, and mix in the melted butter. Stir the dumpling dough until it begins to firm up, 1 to 2 minutes. Drop the dough by tablespoon into the simmering soup. Replace lid; simmer about 15 minutes.
