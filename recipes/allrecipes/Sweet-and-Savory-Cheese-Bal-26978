Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. In a medium bowl, mix bacon, Cheddar cheese, green onions and mayonnaise. Adjust the amount of mayonnaise as needed, using just enough to make the mixture stick together. Mold the mixture into a ball. Spread ball with strawberry preserves. Chill in the refrigerator until serving.
