Caramelize garlic and onion in small dry skillet over medium-high heat 7 minutes. Transfer to blender. Add chiles, vinegar, orange juice, sugar, canola oil, and oregano. Puree until smooth. Reserve and chill 3 tablespoons of the marinade. Place pork in shallow dish and cover with remaining marinade. Chill overnight. Preheat grill to medium-high for indirect heat. If using gas grill, heat one side to high, the other to medium. If using charcoal, push coals to one side. Combine cumin, salt, and black pepper in small bowl. Remove tenderloin from marinade (discard marinade), blot dry with paper towel, and rub with spice mixture. Grill pork over high heat 10 minutes. Move to cooler section of grill and brush with reserved marinade. Cover and grill 10 minutes, basting often with marinade (thermometer should read 160 degrees F).
