Hit the chicken fillets with a tenderizing mallet until they are slightly thinned out. Put the orange juice, green onions and black pepper into a skillet over medium heat. Don't cook over high heat, or the juice will burn and go bitter. Poach the chicken in the juice mixture until it is firm and the juices run clear. This usually takes about 10 minutes, depending on the thickness of the filets. Place the chicken on a serving plate and pour some of the juice mixture on top. Serve.
