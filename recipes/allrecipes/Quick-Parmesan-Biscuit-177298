Separate biscuits and arrange about 2 inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet. In a small frying pan, melt butter over medium heat. Stir in paprika; remove from heat. Brush butter mixture over tops of biscuits. Sprinkle evenly with cheese. Bake in a 375 degrees F oven until biscuits are golden brown (12 to 15 minutes). Serve hot.
