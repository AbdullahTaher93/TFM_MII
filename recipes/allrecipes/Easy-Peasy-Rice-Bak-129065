Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch casserole dish. Bring rice and water to a boil in a pot. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 15 minutes. Stir 1 can chicken broth and the peas into rice. Cover, and continue cooking 5 minutes. Transfer to prepared casserole dish. Pour remaining broth over rice mixture. Sprinkle evenly with cheese and top with crushed crackers. Bake 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly and golden brown.
