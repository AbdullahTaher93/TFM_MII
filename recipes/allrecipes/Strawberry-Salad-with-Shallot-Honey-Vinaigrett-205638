Combine the lemon juice, honey, shallot, thyme, salt, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl; vigorously whisk the olive oil and vegetable oil into the lemon juice mixture. Set aside. Place a small skillet over medium-high heat; toss the almonds, sugar, and salt together in the hot skillet until the sugar caramelizes on the almonds, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat immediately. Place the salad mix in a large bowl. Drizzle the dressing over the salad mix and toss to coat. Top with the almonds and strawberries to serve.
