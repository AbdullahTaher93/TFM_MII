Cut sausage into 1/2-inch slices. Heat a 5 to 6-quart pan over medium-high heat for 3 minutes. Add sausage, onion, green pepper, celery and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, 5-6 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Stir in kidney beans, chicken broth, oregano, thyme and bay leaf. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium and cook 12-15 minutes or until slightly thickened. Add hot sauce to taste. Remove bay leaf and serve over hot cooked rice. Sprinkle with chopped parsley if desired.
