Combine flour, 2 1/2 teaspoons curry powder, salt and cayenne in a shallow pan. Dredge pork lightly in flour mixture. Discard any remaining flour mixture. Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork and cook until golden outside and faintly pink inside, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm. Add remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil to the pan. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add ginger beer (or ginger ale), prunes and remaining 1/2 teaspoon curry powder; bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits. Reduce heat to medium and cook until prunes are tender and liquid is reduced by half, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in sour cream and any accumulated juices from the pork. Gently heat through. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange pork on plates and spoon sauce over. Serve immediately.
