Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly spray large cookie sheet with cooking spray or grease with shortening. Sprinkle sesame seed onto sprayed cookie sheet. Unroll dough; place over seed. Cover with waxed paper. With rolling pin, roll dough into 16x13-inch rectangle; remove paper. Bake at 400 degrees F for 11 to 16 minutes or until lightly browned. Meanwhile, arrange Canadian bacon slices on large microwavable plate; cover with microwavable plastic wrap. Microwave on High for 30 seconds. Rearrange bacon; cover and microwave an additional 30 to 60 seconds or until thoroughly heated. If necessary, drain off any liquid. Remove partially baked crust from oven. Set oven to broil. Spread mustard over crust; sprinkle evenly with thyme. Layer bacon, apples and cheese over mustard, covering entire surface. Broil 5 to 6 inches from heat for 4 to 7 minutes or just until cheese begins to bubble and turns light brown. With pizza cutter, cut into 16 squares. Serve warm.
