Cover potatoes with water in 2-quart saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Drain and cool. Combine potatoes with remaining ingredients in large bowl. Season, if desired, with salt and ground black pepper. Garnish, if desired, with sliced hard cooked eggs and sliced black olives.
