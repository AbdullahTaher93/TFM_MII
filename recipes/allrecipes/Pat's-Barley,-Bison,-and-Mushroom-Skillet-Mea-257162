Place barley into a large bowl and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 24 hours. Drain. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir bison in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir soy sauce, garlic, thyme, oregano, and pepper into bison; reduce heat to medium-low. Add olive oil and stir. Mix mushrooms, barley, and Worcestershire sauce into bison mixture; stir gently. Pour wine over mixture just until barley is covered. Cover skillet, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Cook until barley is tender, stirring every 10 minutes, 30 to 35 minutes.
