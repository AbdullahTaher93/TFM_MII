To make the pesto, place the basil, broth, almonds, lemon juice, Parmesan, oil, salt, and ground pepper in a food processor. Turn the machine on, drop the garlic clove through the feed tube, and process until pureed. Place the pieces of salmon on a plate. Spoon 3 tablespoons (45 mL) of the pesto over the salmon and turn to coat both sides of each piece. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes. Reserve the remaining pesto at room temperature. Meanwhile, preheat the broiler. Spray a jelly-roll pan with nonstick spray. Place the salmon in the prepared pan. Spread any of the pesto remaining on the plate on top of each piece. Broil the salmon 4 to 5 inches (10 to 12 cm) from the heat for 6 to 8 minutes, or just until opaque in the center. (The cooking time will depend on the thickness of the fish.) Transfer the salmon pieces to 4 dinner plates and top each piece with some of the reserved pesto. Garnish with lemon wedges and basil sprigs, if desired.
