Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease baking sheets. Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg together into a bowl. Beat 1 1/2 cups sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition; blend in sour cream and lemon extract. Gradually stir flour mixture into creamed butter mixture until dough is combined. Drop dough by rounded tablespoons, about 3 inches apart, onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown around the edges, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon sugar over cookies; top with walnuts and raisins. Continue baking until bottoms of cookies begin to brown, 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
