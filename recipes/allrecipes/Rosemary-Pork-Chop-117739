In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the soy sauce, water, brown sugar and rosemary; add pork chops. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 3 hours. Drain and discard marinade. Place the chops in a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until juices run clear.
