Stir together soy sauce, lime juice, ginger, and sugar in a small bowl. Set aside. Choose four large lettuce leaves without any bruises or holes. Lay them flat. Arrange one-quarter of the broccoli sprouts down the center of one leaf. Top with two or three shrimp. Sprinkle with carrot and daikon and add a few mint or cilantro leaves. Repeat with all lettuce leaves. Loosely roll in sides of lettuce leaves, leaving ends open. Serve with soy-lime dipping sauce.
