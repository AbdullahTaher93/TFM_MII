Bake the pastry shells according to the package directions. Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add shrimp and scallops and cook until they're cooked through, stirring often. Remove the shrimp and scallops from the skillet. Heat the remaining butter in the skillet. Add the mushrooms and cook until they're tender. Stir in the soup, milk and cheese. Cook and stir until the cheese is melted. Return the shrimp and scallops to the skillet and cook until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Spoon the mixture into the pastry shells. Sprinkle with the parsley.
