Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Remove and reserve stems from mushrooms. Season mushroom caps with salt; set aside. Mince stems to yield 1/2 cup; discard remaining stems. Combine ground beef, minced stems, blue cheese, bread crumbs, 3 tablespoons chives, and steak seasoning. Spoon beef mixture evenly into mushrooms. Place stuffed mushrooms on rack in broiler pan. Bake in 375 degrees F oven 15 to 20 minutes. Sprinkle with additional chives, if desired.
