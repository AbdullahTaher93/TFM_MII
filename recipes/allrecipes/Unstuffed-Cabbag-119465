Place the cabbage in a greased 2-1/2-qt. baking dish. In a skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the rice, salt if desired and pepper; spoon over cabbage. Combine soup and water; pour over beef mixture. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 40-50 minutes or until rice and cabbage are tender. Uncover; sprinkle with cheese. Bake 5-10 minutes longer or until the cheese is melted.
