In a mixing bowl, cream butter, almonds, sugar and vanilla; add flour and cornstarch. Roll into 1-in. balls; shape into crescents and place on greased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool completely on wire racks. Melt chocolate and shortening in a microwave or double boiler; stir until smooth. Dip one end of each crescent into chocolate; cool on waxed paper. Refrigerate for about 30 minutes to firm the chocolate.
