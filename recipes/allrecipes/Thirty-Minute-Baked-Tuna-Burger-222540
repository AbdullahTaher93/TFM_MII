Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Mix tuna, egg, bread crumbs, garlic salt, and black pepper and fold in diced tomatoes and onion. Form the mixture into 4 patties and place onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until burgers are golden brown and crisp, about 10 minutes per side.
