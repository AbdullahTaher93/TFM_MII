Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 18 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. Whisk flour, brown sugar, white sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and cardamom together in a bowl. Beat cranberry sauce, milk, oil, egg, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into cranberry sauce mixture until batter is just-moistened; pour into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
