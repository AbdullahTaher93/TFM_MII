Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8-inch pie dish with 1 pastry crust; set the other crust aside. In a bowl, mix together the turkey, cream of chicken soup, seasoned salt and pepper, Cheddar cheese, and mixed vegetables. Pour the mixture into the prepared pie dish. Top the pie with the remaining pie crust, then pinch and fold the edges of the crusts together to seal. Cut a slit into the top of the pie crust with a sharp knife to vent the steam. Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling, about 40 minutes.
