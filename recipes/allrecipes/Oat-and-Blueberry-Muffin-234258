Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 12 muffin cups with cooking spray or use paper liners. Mix flour, oats, baking powder, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Stir sugar, applesauce, yogurt, egg, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into applesauce mixture until just combined. Fold blueberries into batter. Fill prepared muffin cups 2/3 full with batter. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 15 minutes.
