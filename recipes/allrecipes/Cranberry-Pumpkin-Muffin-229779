Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners. Beat eggs, sugar, pumpkin, corn oil, and orange zest in a small mixing bowl until smooth. Mix flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl with a fork. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour pumpkin mixture into the well; stir until the dry mixture is just moistened into a batter. Fold cranberries into the batter. Scoop batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 20 to 25 minutes.
