Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the green onions in the oil for 1 minute. Add the ham, eggs, and the peas and carrot blend to the oil. Cook and stir until the egg is completely cooked. Add the rice and bean sprouts to the egg mixture and stir continually until the rice is heated completely through. Remove from heat; season with salt, pepper, and soy sauce.
