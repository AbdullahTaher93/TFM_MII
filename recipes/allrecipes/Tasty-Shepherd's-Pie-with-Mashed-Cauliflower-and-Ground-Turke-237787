Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower; cover and steam until tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until softened, about 2 minutes. Blend cauliflower, garlic, Parmesan cheese, cream cheese, salt, and pepper in a blender until smooth. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground turkey in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir water, macaroni, peas, and soup mix into turkey; simmer until pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour pasta mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread cauliflower mixture over pasta mixture. Sprinkle paprika over the top. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
