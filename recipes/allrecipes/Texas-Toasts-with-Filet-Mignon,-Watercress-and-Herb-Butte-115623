Preheat grill to high. Mash butter in a small bowl with the back of a spoon until it's soft and creamy. Stir in 2 teaspoons oil until combined. Add chives (or shallot), capers, 1 teaspoon marjoram (or oregano), 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest, lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cover and place in the freezer to chill. Combine the remaining 1 teaspoon oil, remaining 2 teaspoons marjoram (or oregano), remaining 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper, rosemary and minced garlic in a small bowl. Rub on both sides of steak. Rub both sides of bread with the halved garlic clove; discard the garlic. Grill the steak 3 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Grill the bread until toasted, 30 seconds to 1 minute per side. Transfer the toasts to a large plate, place the steaks on top of the toasts and spread the herb butter on top of the steaks; let rest for 5 minutes. Divide watercress among 4 plates and top with the steak-topped toasts.
