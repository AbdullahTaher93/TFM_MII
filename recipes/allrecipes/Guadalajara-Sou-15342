Sort and wash the beans. In a large saucepan over medium heat, add the beans and enough water to be 2 inches above beans. Bring to a boil for 2 minutes and remove from heat. Cover, allow to soak for 1 hour and drain. In a large Dutch oven over medium high heat, saute the ribs in oil until browned. Remove ribs from Dutch oven and set aside. Add the onion and garlic and saute for 5 minutes, or until tender. Add the beans, ribs, broth, water, chili powder, oregano, cumin, salt, ground black pepper and fresh cilantro. Cover and simmer 1 1/2 hours, or until meat is tender. Remove the ribs, allow to cool and remove meat from the bones. Return meat to broth. Chill the broth until the fat rises to the surface and remove the fat. Bring back to a boil and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
