Make a lengthwise cut in each tomato, being careful not to cut them in half. Gently seed and drain. Before lighting the grill, coat the rack with nonstick spray. Grill the tomatoes about 6 inches away from the heat for 5 minutes. Turn, and grill another 2 minutes. In a shallow dish, combine the remaining ingredients except for the bread. Place the grilled tomatoes in the dish and spoon some marinade over them. Cover and marinate for at least an hour. Serve each tomato on a slice of French bread.
