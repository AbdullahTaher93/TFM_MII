In a shallow bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, salt, paprika and pepper. In another shallow bowl, beat egg whites and milk. Coat fish with cornmeal mixture, then dip into egg white mixture. Coat fish again in cornmeal mixture. In a 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan coated with nonstick cooking spray, arrange fish in a single layer. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
