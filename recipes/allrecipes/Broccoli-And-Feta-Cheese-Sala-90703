Loosely mound broccoli on a steamer rack over 1 inch of boiling water in a 2 1/2- to 3-quart pan. Cover and steam over high heat until broccoli is barely tender when pierced, about 5 minutes. Rinse broccoli with cold water, drain well, and pat dry with paper towels. While broccoli is cooking, prepare dressing. In a large bowl, combine olive oil, lemon juice, chives, garlic, and mustard; beat with a whisk until well blended. Season to taste with salt and pepper. To dressing add broccoli, red pepper, and half of the cheese; mix lightly to coat well with dressing. Sprinkle with sunflower kernels and remaining cheese. Serve immediately.
