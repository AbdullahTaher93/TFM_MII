Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 16 muffin cups with paper liners. Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Add blood orange zest and juice, butter, and eggs; mix with a wooden spoon until just combined. Fold pineapple into the batter. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
