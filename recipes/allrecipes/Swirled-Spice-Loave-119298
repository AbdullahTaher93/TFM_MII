In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Beat the eggs and cream; stir into dry ingredients just until combined. Remove 1-1/2 cups batter to another bowl; stir in the molasses, vanilla and pumpkin pie spice until blended. Spoon a fourth of the molasses batter into each of two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Top each with a fourth of the plain batter. Repeat layers; cut through batter with a knife to swirl. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
