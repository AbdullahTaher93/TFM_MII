Mix the grated carrot, watercress, and chives into the cream cheese. Season to taste with pepper. Spread the cheese mixture evenly over a side of each slice of rye bread. Halve the sardines lengthwise, then arrange them skin-side up on top of the cheese. Arrange the red onion slices over the sardines and top with a few long pieces of chive. Sprinkle with pepper and serve.
