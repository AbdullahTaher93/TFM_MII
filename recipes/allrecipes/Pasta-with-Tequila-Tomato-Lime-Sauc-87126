Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion, garlic, and jalapeno; cook until onion is soft and translucent. Stir in tomatoes, tequila, water, clam juice, and red pepper. Bring to a boil, then add macaroni. Cover, and simmer, stirring frequently, until pasta is tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in lime juice.
