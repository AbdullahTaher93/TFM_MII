Preheat oven to 225 degrees F. Beat egg whites and cream of tartar in medium bowl with electric mixer on high speed 5 min. or until soft peaks form. Gradually add granulated sugar, 1 Tbsp. at a time, beating on high speed until stiff peaks form. Spoon onto baking sheet covered with parchment paper. Using large spoon, make 10-inch circle of meringue, indenting slightly in the center of the circle to form a 'crust.' Bake 1-1/2 hours. Cool. Pour milk into large bowl. Add dry pudding mix. Beat with wire whisk 2 min. or until well blended. Gently stir in whipped topping. Refrigerate 15 min. or until slightly thickened. Place meringue on serving plate. Spoon pudding mixture over meringue, leaving a border of meringue showing around edge. Spoon raspberries over pudding; sprinkle with powdered sugar.
