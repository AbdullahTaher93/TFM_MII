Heat vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir rice and garlic until rice is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add water, chicken, tomato sauce, carrot, celery, chicken bouillon, cilantro, cumin, and black pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes before serving.
