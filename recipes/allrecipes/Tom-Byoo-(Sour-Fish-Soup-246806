Bring fish stock to a boil in a pot; add ginger, galangal, Thai chile peppers, kaffir lime leaves, lemon grass, and shallots. Reduce heat and simmer stock for 20 minutes. Mix trout, tomatoes, tamarind juice, and fish sauce into stock; simmer until trout is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Gently place trout in a bowl and pour soup over the fish; top with cilantro.
