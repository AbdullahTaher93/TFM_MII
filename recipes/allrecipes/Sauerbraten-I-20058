Line the bottom of a large Dutch oven or slow cooker with the gingersnaps. Place the roast on the cookies and cover with water. Place the potatoes, carrots, celery and onion on top of the meat, and crumble the bouillon cubes into the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 3 to 6 hours (or 8 hours on low in a slow cooker), until meat is tender.
