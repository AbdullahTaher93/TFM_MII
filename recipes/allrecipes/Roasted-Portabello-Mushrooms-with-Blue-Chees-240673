Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place mushroom caps, tops facing down, on a baking sheet. Drizzle balsamic vinegar on each cap and sprinkle black pepper over vinegar. Bake in the preheated oven until tender and fragrant, about 25 minutes. Sprinkle blue cheese, pine nuts, and garlic on each cap. Continue roasting until cheese melts, about 10 minutes more.
