Bring a large and small pot of water to a boil. In the smaller pot, boil Brussels sprouts for 8 minutes until cooked through. When cool enough to handle, slice. In a large skillet, heat olive oil and saute garlic until slightly yellow in color, 1-2 minutes. Add zucchini, squash and sliced Brussels sprouts; season with salt and pepper and saute for 5 additional minutes. In the large pot, cook pasta one minute less than package directions. Drain pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of the water. Toss pasta with sauce and cooking liquid. Stir in cheese and parsley before serving.
