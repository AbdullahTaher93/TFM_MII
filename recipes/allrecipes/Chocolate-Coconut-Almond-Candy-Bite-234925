Line a 15x10x1-inch baking pan with parchment paper, extending foil over the edges of the pan. Place 1 1/2 cups Ghirardelli(R) Dark Melting Wafers in a microwave-safe container. Microwave at half power or defrost setting for 30 seconds. Stir thoroughly (product keeps it original shape until stirred). If not completely melted, continue to microwave at 15 second intervals and stir until smooth. Overheating will cause wafers to burn. Pour melted wafers onto parchment paper and spread into a 8x11-inch rectangle about 1/8-inch thick. Let stand for 30 minutes or until firm. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, beat butter, powdered sugar, milk, and almond extract with an electric mixer on medium speed until combined. Stir in coconut and toasted sliced almonds. Spread coconut mixture evenly over the hardened bottom. Place remaining Ghirardelli(R) Dark Melting Wafers in a microwave-safe container. Microwave at half power or defrost setting for 30 seconds. Stir thoroughly. If not completely melted, continue to microwave at 15 second intervals and stir until smooth. Overheating will cause wafers to burn. Drizzle melted wafers over coconut mixture. Let stand for at least 30 minutes or until firm. After mixture sets, use paper to lift candy out of pan. Cut candy into bite-size squares.
