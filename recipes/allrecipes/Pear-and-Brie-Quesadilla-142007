Place slices of Brie cheese over a tortilla. Layer the cheese with pear slices. Sprinkle with nutmeg and salt as desired. Top with the second tortilla. Spray a skillet with cooking spray. Place the quesadilla in the skillet over medium heat, and cook until golden brown and Brie melts, about 3 minutes on each side. Cut into four or eight triangles, and serve immediately.
