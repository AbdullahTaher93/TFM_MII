In a shallow dish, mix the soy sauce, vegetable oil, and bourbon whiskey. Place the halibut fillets in the dish, and marinate 30 minutes in the refrigerator. Preheat the grill for high heat. Lightly oil the grill grate. Place halibut on the grill, and discard marinade. Cook 5 minutes on each side, until easily flaked with a fork.
