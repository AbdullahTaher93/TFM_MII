Wash rice well and soak in 2 1/2 cups salted water for 30 min. Heat oil in a heavy or nonstick pan. Add onions and fry till dark brown. Drain onions and set aside, but reserve the oil. In the same oil, stir fry cumin, peppercorns, and bay leaf for a few seconds. Drain rice reserving the water and add the rice to the frying pan. Add sugar, stir gently, fry till rice is light brown. Add clove-cinnamon powder, stir. Add salt water (previously drained) and bring to a boil. Simmer covered until rice is the cooked and the water evaporates. Rice should not be sticky when finished. Spoon the onions on top to serve.
