In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa, coffee granules, baking soda and salt. In another bowl, beat eggs, sour cream and butter until smooth. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in chocolate chips and pecans. Pour into a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-60 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
