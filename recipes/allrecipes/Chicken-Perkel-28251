In a large skillet over heat, heat oil and add chicken and onion. Season with bouillon, paprika and salt and pepper to taste. When chicken is almost cooked through, stir in the mushrooms. Cover the skillet and cook for 5 more minutes or until the mushrooms are tender and the chicken juices run clear. When chicken is done, stir in the sour cream and turn off the heat. Serve hot over rice or pasta.
