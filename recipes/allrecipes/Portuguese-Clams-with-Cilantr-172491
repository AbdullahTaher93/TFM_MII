In a 5- to 6-quart pan over medium-high heat, stir onion in oil until it begins to soften (about 3 minutes). Stir in garlic, then add wine. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil; add clams, 2 tablespoons of the cilantro, and the pepper. Cover and cook until clams pop open, 5 to 10 minutes; discard any clams that fail to open. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons cilantro. Spoon clams and broth into bowls. Offer lemon wedges, if desired, to squeeze onto clams to taste.
