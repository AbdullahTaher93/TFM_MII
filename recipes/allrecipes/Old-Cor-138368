Cook bacon in a large heavy skillet over medium heat until crispy, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Drain the bacon on a paper towel; discard fat. Heat oil in the same pan over high heat. Add corn and pepper and cook, stirring often, until the corn begins to brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Add milk and bring to a simmer, stirring to scrape up any browned bits. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until most of the milk has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add more milk to prevent sticking, a tablespoon at a time, if the liquid boils away before the corn is tender. Remove from the heat. Crumble the bacon into the corn; stir to combine. Serve immediately.
