Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place Brussels sprouts in a pot with enough lightly salted water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook 5 minutes, or until tender. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Place cucumbers in the skillet, and cook 5 minutes, until tender. Set aside cucumbers, and mix the flour into the butter to form a roux. Mix in the milk, bouillon, and pepper, and cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until thickened. In a baking dish, mix the Brussels sprouts and cucumbers. Drizzle with the butter sauce, and gently toss to coat. Cover, and bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven.
