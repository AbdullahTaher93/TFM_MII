Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Make Pecan Crust. Mix all ingredients except butter in medium bowl. Cut in butter, using pastry blender or crisscrossing 2 knives, until crumbly. Press firmly and evenly against bottom and side of ungreased 12-inch pizza pan. Bake 8 minutes. Cool completely. Cut each pear lengthwise in half and remove core. Place each pear half, cut side down, on cutting surface. Cut crosswise into thin slices. Lift each pear half with spatula and arrange on crust, separating and overlapping slices (retain pear shape) to cover surface of crust. Mix remaining ingredients; sprinkle over pears. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until crust is golden brown and pears are tender.
