Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly spray a baking pan with cooking spray. Rinse chicken and pat dry. Pour milk substitute into a shallow dish and combine breadcrumbs and rosemary in another shallow dish. Coat chicken with milk substitute, then dredge in the breadcrumb mixture. Discard any excess mixture. Arrange chicken in prepared pan and bake about 15 to 20 minutes until no longer pink inside, or until internal temperature is 170 degrees F.
