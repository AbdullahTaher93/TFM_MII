Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Arrange the tomatillos, onions, poblano peppers, and garlic on a baking sheet. Cook the vegetables under the broiler until the skins are charred on the side facing the heater elements; turn the vegetables and continue cooking until equally charred, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove and discard the root and outer skin from the onion and garlic; remove and discard the stem and seeds from the peppers. Working in batches, combine some of the tomatillos, onion, poblano peppers, garlic, chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, lager-style beer, cumin, salt, and pepper in a blender to about half full. Holding the lid in place, pulse a few times to get the mixture moving before leaving the blender on to puree to a smooth texture; pour into a slow cooker. Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Cook and stir the lamb cubes in the hot oil until browned on all side, about 5 minutes; transfer to the slow cooker. Cook on High for 4 hours.
