Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease cookie sheet with shortening or spray with cooking spray. In food processor, grind all bread ingredients except dough; set aside. On lightly floured surface, unroll dough into 1 large rectangle; press or roll into 14x10-inch rectangle, firmly pressing perforations to seal. Spread nut mixture evenly over dough to within 1/2 inch of long sides. Starting with one long side of rectangle, tightly roll up dough, carefully stretching roll until 17 inches long; press edge and ends to seal. Place on greased cookie sheet; loosely coil into spiral shape. Bake at 375 degrees F for 28 to 33 minutes or until deep golden brown. Cover loosely with foil if bread is browning too quickly. Cool 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in small bowl, blend powdered sugar, almond extract and enough milk for desired drizzling consistency until smooth. Drizzle icing over warm bread. Cut into wedges. Serve warm.
