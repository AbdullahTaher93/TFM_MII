In a large pot, cook the gnocchi according to the package directions. Drain, rinse and return them to the pot. In a 12" skillet, heat oil over medium heat and saute the snap peas and red peppers until tender, about 4 minutes. Toss into the pot with the reserved cooked gnocchi. In the same skillet, cook and crumble Italian sausage until cooked through about 8-10 minutes. Transfer sausage to the pot with the vegetables and pasta. Over med-low heat, stir to combine the pasta, vegetables and sausage mixture. Add the pesto and light cream; toss gently to coat all the ingredients. Heat through and serve with freshly grated parmesan cheese.
