Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, garlic, basil, oregano, and 1 teaspoon parsley until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add shrimp, beer, hot sauce, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until shrimp are pink and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Toss pasta and shrimp mixture together in a bowl; top with Parmesan cheese and a pinch of parsley.
