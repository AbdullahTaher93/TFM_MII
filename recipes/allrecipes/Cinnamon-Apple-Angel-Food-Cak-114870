In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites, cream of tartar and salt on medium speed until soft peaks form. Add sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time, beating well after each addition; beat until smooth and glossy and stiff peaks form. Add extracts on low speed. Combine confectioners' sugar and flour; gently fold into egg mixture. Pour into an ungreased 10-in. tub pan. Bake on the lowest rack at 375 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until top crust is golden brown and cracks feel dry. Immediately invert cake in pan to cool completely. Loosen sides of cake from pan and remove. For glaze, melt butter in a saucepan. Stir in the confectioners' sugar and cinnamon. Add apple juice slowly until glaze is thin enough to drizzle. Drizzle over cake.
