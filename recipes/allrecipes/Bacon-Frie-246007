Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Spray a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Wrap half a bacon slice around each French fry and place seam side-down on the baking sheet about 1-inch apart. Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is browned and crisp, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle with seasoned salt. Transfer to serving plate.
