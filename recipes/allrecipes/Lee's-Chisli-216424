Place the beef cubes into a large mixing bowl. Season with brown sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, ancho powder, chipotle powder, salt-free seasoning, liquid smoke, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper. Marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Cook the beef in batches in the hot oil until browned on all sides and cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 3 minutes for medium. Drain the beef cubes briefly on a paper towel-lined plate before serving. Allow the oil to become hot again before cooking the next batch of beef.
