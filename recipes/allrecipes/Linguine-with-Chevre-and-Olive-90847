In an 8- to 10-inch frying pan over medium heat, stir pine nuts often until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour from pan and set aside. Meanwhile, combine cream and broth in a 4- to 5-quart pan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil, stirring occasionally, until reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to low and whisk in goat cheese until smoothly melted. Stir in olives and 2 teaspoons of orange peel. Remove from heat and keep warm. While cream and broth are reducing, in a 5- to 6-quart pan, cook linguine in 3 quarts of boiling water until tender to bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain well, then return to pan. Add cream sauce and chopped chives; gently mix to coat pasta evenly. Transfer pasta to a large serving bowl. Sprinkle with pine nuts and remaining orange peel. If desired, garnish with whole chives. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
