Bring one inch of water in a medium saucepan to a boil. Add carrots and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. In the same pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the honey until dissolved. Add the cherries and simmer over low heat for one minute. Remove from heat and stir in carrots until completely coated.
