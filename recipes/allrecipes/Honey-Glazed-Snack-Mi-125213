In a large mixing bowl, combine cereal, pretzels and pecans; set aside. Melt butter in a small saucepan; stir in honey and blend well. Pour over cereal mixture and stir to coat evenly. Spread in a jelly roll pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12 to 15 minutes or until mixture is slightly glazed, stirring occasionally. Remove from oven and cool slightly. Spread on waxed paper to cool completely.
