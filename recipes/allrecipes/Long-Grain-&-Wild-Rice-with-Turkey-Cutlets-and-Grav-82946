Prepare rice according to package directions. Place bread crumbs on a plate. Place flour on a plate. Put eggs in a shallow bowl. Dredge cutlets in flour, and then dip in egg and then in bread crumbs. Repeat this process until all cutlets are breaded. Using medium heat, brown the cutlets on each side, about 3-4 minutes per side. Keep cutlets warm on a plate. Combine the gravy mix with the water, milk and sage. Heat until gravy thickens. Place rice on a serving dish, arrange cutlets on rice and top with gravy.
