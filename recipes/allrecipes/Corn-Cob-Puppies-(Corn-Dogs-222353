Place hot dogs into a large pot of simmering water and keep hot. Heat vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Whisk flour, corn meal, buttermilk, eggs, sugar, bacon drippings, salt, baking powder, and garlic powder in a large bowl until moistened; beat batter until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove a hot dog from the water and blot completely dry with paper towels; skewer the hot dog lengthwise with a bamboo skewer. Using the skewer end as a handle, roll the hot dog in the batter to thoroughly coat. Roll the corn dog in the hot oil with the same continuous rolling motion, setting the batter; continue to roll the corn dog in the hot oil until deep golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Alternately, lay corn dog into hot oil after initial rolling to finish cooking the batter, about 1 minute per side. Drain corn dogs on paper towels to blot excess oil.
