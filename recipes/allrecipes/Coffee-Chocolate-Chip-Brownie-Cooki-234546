Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Using an electric mixer, combine butter, water, Irish cream, eggs, coffee, brownie mix, and flour in a medium bowl. Blend on low speed until just blended together. Fold in sandwich cookies and chocolate morsels. Do not overmix. Scoop dough by tablespoons, spaced 2 inches apart, onto prepared baking sheets. Bake for 12 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes on baking sheet, then transfer to wire racks.
