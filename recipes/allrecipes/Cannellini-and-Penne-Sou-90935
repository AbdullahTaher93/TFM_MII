In a 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat, break sausage meat into chunks with a spoon. Add onion and garlic and stir often until onion is limp, about 5 minutes. Add broth, tomato sauce, wine, oregano, pasta, and 2 cups water. Stirring often, bring mixture to a boil and cook until pasta is just tender to bite, about 10 minutes. Rinse and drain arugula; trim off and discard any tough stem ends. Coarsely chop arugula and add to pasta mixture along with beans. Stir occasionally until soup is boiling, about 3 minutes. If soup seems dry, add more broth to taste. Ladle soup into bowls and add cheese and pepper to taste.
