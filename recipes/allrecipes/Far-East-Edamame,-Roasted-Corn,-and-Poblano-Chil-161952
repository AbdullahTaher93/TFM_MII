Place pepper on a foil-lined baking sheet; broil 10 minutes or until blackened, turning occasionally. Place in a heavy-duty plastic zip top bag; seal, let stand 15 minutes. Peel pepper and cut in half lengthwise. Discard seeds and chop. Meanwhile, place corn kernels and edamame on baking sheet. Roast in 400 degree oven 5 minutes until slightly browned. Remove from oven and let cool slightly. In a large salad bowl, combine roasted peppers, corn, edamame, chopped spinach, tomatoes, and jicama. In small bowl, combine sugar and remaining 3 dressing ingredients. Drizzle over salad and toss to coat. Cover and chill. Add salt to taste.
