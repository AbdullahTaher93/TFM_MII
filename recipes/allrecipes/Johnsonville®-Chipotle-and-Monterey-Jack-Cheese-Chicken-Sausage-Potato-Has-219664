Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, onion and bell pepper. Add the oil, salt and pepper; toss to coat. Transfer to a greased shallow baking pan. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until potatoes are tender and lightly browned, stirring occasionally. Arrange sausage over vegetables. Bake 5-10 minutes longer or until sausage is heated through.
