In a large skillet over medium high heat, warm olive oil. Add carrot and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. Add turkey, mushroom, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, chicken broth, ketchup, and soy sauce, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat a broiler. Position a broiler pan 3 to 4 in. from heating element. Split buns and place open-faced on broiler pan. Toast the buns until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add cornstarch mixture to Sloppy Joe mixture, stirring until sauce thickens, 30 to 60 seconds. To serve, place two bun halves on each plate, open faced. Top buns with Sloppy Joe mixture, dividing evenly. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, if using, and serve.
