In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, honey, ginger and pepper flakes. Place 3 tablespoons in a large resealable plastic bag; add the pork. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade. Combine the cornstarch, orange juice, vinegar and reserved marinade; stir until blended and set aside. Drain and discard marinade from pork. In a large nonstick skillet or wok, stir-fry pork in oil for 4-5 minutes or until no longer pink. Remove pork and keep warm. In the same pan, stir-fry snow peas for 2-3 minutes or until crisp-tender. Stir in garlic and orange peel. Stir cornstarch mixture and stir into pan. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until thickened. Return pork to the pan; heat through.
