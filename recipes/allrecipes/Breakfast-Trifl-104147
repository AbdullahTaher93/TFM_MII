Blend 1/2 cup of SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, plain yogurt and vanilla together in a medium mixing bowl. Set aside. Cut bread into rectangles. Mix together raspberries and 2 tablespoons SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener gently. Do not drain raspberries. To assemble trifle: Pour 1/2 cup of yogurt mixture in the bottom of the glass bowl. Place 1/3 of the sliced bread on top of the yogurt mixture. Top bread with 1/3 of the peaches, 1/3 of the cherries and 1/3 of the raspberries. Drizzle about 1/3 of the raspberry juice onto the bread. Place 1/3 of the thinly sliced banana on top of the raspberries. Pour 1/3 of the yogurt mixture over the bread and fruit. Repeat steps 4-7 two more times, ending by pouring the remaining yogurt over the fruit. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight, allowing the bread to fully absorb the fruit juices.
