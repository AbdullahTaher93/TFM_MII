Place meat in large, non-metal bowl. In separate bowl, combine red wine vinegar, 1 cup water, lemon juice, onion, bay leaves, cloves, salt and pepper. Pour over meat. Cover and refrigerate 48 hours. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Remove meat from marinade and brown in oil on all sides, 1 to 2 minutes a side. Remove bay leaves and cloves from marinade. Pour in 1 cup water and pour marinade into pan with meat. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 3 hours, or until tender. Remove meat from pan. Increase heat and sprinkle flour, a little at a time, over juices, cooking until mixture thickens to form gravy. Return meat to pan with tomato wedges, heat through and serve.
