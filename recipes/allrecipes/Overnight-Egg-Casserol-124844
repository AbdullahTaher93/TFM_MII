Place bread cubes in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with cheese; set aside. In a skillet, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Crumble sausage over the cheese and bread. Beat the eggs, milk, mustard, soup and broth; pour over sausage. Cover and refrigerate overnight or at least 2-3 hours before baking. Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or just until set. Let stand for 5 minutes before cutting.
