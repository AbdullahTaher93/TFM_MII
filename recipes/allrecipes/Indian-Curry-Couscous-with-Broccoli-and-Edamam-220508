Bring the vegetable broth to a boil in a saucepan. Add couscous and reduce heat to medium; simmer until broth is absorbed and couscous is tender, about 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Heat canola oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add ajowan seeds. When seeds begin to sputter, stir in garlic and reduce heat to medium. Stir turmeric, curry powder, hing powder, chili powder, and cinnamon into the garlic mixture until garlic is browned, about 3 minutes. Cook and stir edamame and broccoli in the spice mixture until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. Drizzle sesame oil atop vegetables. Spoon vegetables over couscous to serve.
