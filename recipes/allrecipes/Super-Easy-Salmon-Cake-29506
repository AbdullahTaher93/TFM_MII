Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together salmon, egg, olive oil, green onions, and 2/3 cup cracker crumbs. Season with lemon pepper. Form mixture into 8 patties. Coat patties with remaining cracker crumbs, and arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake 10 minutes in the preheated oven, turning once, or until golden brown on both sides.
