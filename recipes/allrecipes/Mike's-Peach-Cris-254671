Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix peaches and cornstarch together in a bowl until peaches are covered. Arrange peaches evenly in a 8x8-inch baking pan. Combine oats, flour, brown sugar, pecans, ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg, and salt in a bowl. Cut in butter with a fork until ingredients are combined and butter is broken into crumbles. Sprinkle over peaches. Bake in the preheated oven until topping is lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
