Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Arrange Tater Tots(R) on a large rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake as package directs until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, combine chili and corn in a medium saucepan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until very hot, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle cheese over hot Tater Tots(R) immediately out of the oven; slide parchment from baking sheet onto a flat platter or tray. Spoon the chili mixture evenly over Tater Tots(R) and sprinkle with tomatoes and cilantro. Serve onto individual serving plates with desired toppings.
