In a bowl, combine garlic, cayenne, coriander, and turmeric. Rinse meat, pat dry, and cut into 1/4-inch-thick bite-size pieces. Add to bowl and mix well. Pour oil into a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan or a 14-inch wok over high heat. When hot, add beef mixture, bell peppers, and onion. Stir until meat is no longer pink on surface, about 4 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, blend cornstarch and broth until smooth. Add to pan and stir until boiling. Pour stir-fry into a serving bowl. Add salt to taste.
