Make a simple syrup by bringing sugar and 3/4 cup water to a boil over high heat in a saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves completely. Add remaining 3 1/2 cups water and sprinkle with gelatin evenly; let stand 5 minutes for gelatin to soften. Heat, stirring, over low heat until gelatin is dissolved. Let cool to room temperature. Add lemon juice. Lightly coat a 7- or 8-cup gelatin ring mold with oil. Pour in gelatin and cover. Refrigerate 2 to 3 hours, until partially set. Carefully drop in fruit, cover, and chill until completely set, another 3 to 4 hours. To unmold, carefully submerge bottom of mold in warm water for about 10 seconds. Invert onto a platter or elevated cake plate and serve.
