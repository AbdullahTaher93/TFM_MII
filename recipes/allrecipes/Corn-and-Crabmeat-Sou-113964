In a blender or food processor, combine the corn kernels and 2 cups of the broth. Pulse to a coarse puree. In a large pot, melt the butter over moderately low heat. Add the chopped onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the corn puree, the wine, the remaining 2 cups of broth, and the salt to the pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the corn is tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the milk and bring just to a simmer. Stir in the crabmeat and chives.
