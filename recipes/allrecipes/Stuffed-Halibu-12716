Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a cookie sheet with foil. In a small bowl, mix together cream cheese and shrimp. Season to taste with basil, salt and pepper. Make a pocket in each of the fillets, making sure you do not cut through on three sides. Divide the cream cheese mixture into 6 parts, and stuff each fillet. Place on foil lined pan. Squeeze lemon juice over fish. Bake for 20 minutes, or until fish is thoroughly done.
