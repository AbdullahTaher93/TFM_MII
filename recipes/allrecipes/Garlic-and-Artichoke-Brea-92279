On a floured board, roll dough into a 12- by 18-inch rectangle (let rest 5 minutes if springy). Brush 1/2 the marinade over dough; sprinkle with artichokes, 1 cup cheese, garlic, basil, and oregano. From a long edge, roll dough into a snug log; pinch seam to seal. On a greased 12- by 15-inch baking sheet, shape log into a ring; pinch ends together to seal. Brush ring with remaining marinade. Lightly cover with plastic wrap; let stand in a warm place until puffy, about 30 minutes. Bake uncovered in a 375 degrees F oven for 15 minutes; sprinkle top with remaining cheese. Bake until bread is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes longer; transfer to a rack. Serve hot or let cool. Store cooled loaf airtight up to 2 days; freeze to store longer.
