Pour the whole box of pasta into a large skillet (approximately 12 inches in diameter). Pour 2 cups of cold water into the pan ensuring that the water covers the pasta. Add onions and beer. Turn on the burner to high and set your timer to 10 minutes (optional: add 1/2 teaspoon salt to taste). Cook on high, stirring regularly. After 4 minutes add bratwurst. After 8 minutes add mustard, cook remaining 2 minutes until most of the water and beer are absorbed about 10 minutes but may vary by stove. Remove skillet from the heat, sauce should be creamy. Serve immediately.
