Melt the butter in a large pot over high heat. Cook the garlic and bok choy in the butter until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the corn, clams, clam juice, diced tomatoes, water, vegetable bouillon, and couscous. Bring to a boil, lower heat to medium-low, and add the crabmeat, cream, lime juice, red wine, garlic salt, and black pepper. Allow the mixture to simmer together until heated through, about 30 minutes.
