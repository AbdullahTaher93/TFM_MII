Heat the butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the corn and onion and cook for 3 minutes or until browned, stirring occasionally. Add the rice and cook and stir until the rice is lightly browned. Stir the garlic and broth in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 25 minutes or until the rice is tender. Season to taste.
