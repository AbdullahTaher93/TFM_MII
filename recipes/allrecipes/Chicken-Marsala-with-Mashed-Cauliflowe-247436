Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, shallots, and garlic. Cook and stir until mushrooms begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Push to the side of the skillet. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Place chicken halves into the skillet and brown, about 2 minutes per side. Scoop mushrooms, shallots, and garlic over the chicken. Slowly pour in Marsala wine. Add oregano and basil. Reduce heat to medium to medium-low and simmer until chicken is cooked through and wine is reduced by about half, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir occasionally. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the cauliflower and peeled garlic glove. Simmer until tender and a fork pushes through the cauliflower easily, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain. Place cauliflower and garlic into a large bowl. Mash with a fork. Stir in cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the chicken Marsala on top of the mashed cauliflower and you are ready to eat!
