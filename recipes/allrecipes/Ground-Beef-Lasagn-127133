In skillet, brown beef; drain. Stir in oregano. Add tomato sauce, paste, and spaghetti sauce mix to beef. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Cover; simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions, adding olive oil to boiling water. Drain. In a small bowl, stir together cottage cheese and egg. To assemble lasagna, in a greased 13x9x2-inch (3-quart rectangular) baking dish, layer half each of the lasagna noodles, sauce, mozzarella, cottage cheese mixture, and Parmesan. Repeat layers using remaining ingredients. Bake, uncovered, in a 375 degree F oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until mixture is heated through. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
