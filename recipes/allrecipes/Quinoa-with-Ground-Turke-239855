Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and red bell pepper in the hot oil until tender and starting to brown, about 10 minutes; season with salt. Generously season ground turkey with salt and pepper; add to onion mixture and increase temperature to medium-high. Cook and stir turkey mixture until almost browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain excess grease and reduce heat to medium-low. Add garlic, sage, and rosemary to turkey mixture; cook and stir until fragrant and turkey is browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. Mix quinoa into turkey mixture and cook until quinoa is heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add Mizithra cheese to quinoa and turkey and remove skillet from heat; season with salt and pepper.
