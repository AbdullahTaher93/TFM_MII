Peel and quarter sweet potatoes. Cook potatoes, covered, in a small amount of boiling lightly salted water for 25 to 35 minutes or until tender. Drain well. Meanwhile, melt margarine or butter in a medium skillet. Add pears; cook, covered, over medium heat until very tender, stirring occasionally. Combine potatoes, pear mixture, and cinnamon in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer on low speed. Cool slightly. With electric mixer running on low speed, beat egg into cooled mixture. Using a decorating bag with a large star tip, pipe mixture into 12 rounds (about 1/3 cup each) onto a greased 15x10x1-inch baking pan, building up edges slightly. (Or, spoon into 12 rounds on baking pan, using back of a tablespoon to make a slight indentation in center of each.) Cover and chill overnight, if desired. To serve, drop a scant teaspoon of Praline Topping on each round. Bake in a 375 degree F oven about 15 minutes or until potatoes are light brown and heated through. Praline Topping: Stir together 3 tablespoons brown sugar, 2 tablespoons melted butter, and 1 tablespoon half-and-half or light cream in a small mixing bowl. Stir in 1/3 cup broken pecans.
