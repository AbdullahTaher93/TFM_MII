In a skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Saute scallions until softened. Add broth and oregano and bring to a boil. Add orzo and reduce heat. Cover. Simmer for 6 minutes, stirring. Add chicken. Cook 6 minutes until orzo and chicken are fully cooked. Stir in spinach and heat until just wilted. Crumble goat cheese over top and serve.
