Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and cook and stir the chopped onion until browned, about 8 minutes. Stir in the rice, tomatoes, cilantro, and chicken broth, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the rice is cooked and most of the liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes.
