Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Heat olive oil in a skillet and cook garlic, onions and beef until meat is browned; drain fat. Add tomatoes, pepper and oregano. Stir and cook about 5 minutes. Sprinkle in 1/2 of the Parmesan cheese. Lightly coat a casserole or baking dish with olive oil and spread 1/2 the cooked pasta in it. Add the meat sauce and cover with the remaining pasta. Melt butter in a saucepan and blend in flour. Slowly add milk, stirring almost to boiling. In a bowl, blend remaining parmesan cheese and egg yolk and slowly add to the milk sauce, stirring constantly. Pour sauce over macaroni and bake for 30 minutes. Top should be golden and a little crispy.
