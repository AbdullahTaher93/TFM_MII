Line a 9-inch (23-cm) springform pan with foil. Warm a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Crumble sausage into skillet. Add onions and garlic. Cook, stirring often, until sausage is browned and onions are tender. Add tomatoes, 1/2 teaspoon (2 mL) of oregano and pepper, stirring to break up tomatoes. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Combine ricotta, egg substitute, parsley, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of Parmesan, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon (2 mL) oregano in a bowl. Cut 1 lasagna noodle into small pieces. Arrange 2 whole noodles and half of cut noodle in bottom of springform pan. Spoon half of sausage mixture over sausage layer. Top with remaining noodles. Spread remaining sausage mixture over noodles. Cover pan with foil. Finish cooking or refrigerate until next day. To Finish Cooking: Bake, covered, at 375 degrees F (190C) for 45 minutes. Remove foil. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of Parmesan. Bake uncovered, until hot throughout, about 10 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes. Remove pan side. Cut into 6 wedges.
