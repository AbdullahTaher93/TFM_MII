Thoroughly rub pork shoulder roast with black pepper, cayenne pepper and barbeque sauce. Place on a medium baking sheet. Chill uncovered in the refrigerator 8 hours, or overnight. Preheat an outdoor smoker to a temperature of 225 degrees F (110 degrees C) to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place onions, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, burgundy wine, black pepper and cayenne pepper in the water pan of the smoker. Cover with enough water to make approximately a gallon of liquid in the pan. Place pan in the smoker. Center pork over water pan in the prepared smoker. Smoke 6 hours, or until the internal temperature of the pork has reached 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
