Preheat grill to high. Blend tamarind concentrate, dates, agave syrup, ginger, cumin, 1/4 teaspoon salt and cayenne (if using) in a blender until smooth. Cut each block of tofu crosswise into eight 1/2-inch-thick slices. Lightly brush each slice with oil and season on both sides with a light sprinkle of curry powder, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper. Oil the grill rack (see Tip). Grill the tofu slices until golden and heated through, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Serve hot with the tamarind chutney for dipping.
