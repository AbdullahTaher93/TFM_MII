Cook and stir the sesame seeds in a large skillet over medium heat until the seeds smell toasted and begin to pop, about 7 minutes. While toasting the sesame seeds, cook the walnuts in the microwave until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Allow the sesame seeds and walnuts to cool to room temperature. Once cool, place the sesame seeds and walnuts into a blender. Blend until finely ground. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
