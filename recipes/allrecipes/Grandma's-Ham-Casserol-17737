Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a 9x13 inch baking dish, combine the ham, potatoes, carrots and mushrooms. In a medium bowl, combine the soup with the water. Mix well and pour over the mixture in the baking dish, stirring to coat. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until carrots are tender.
