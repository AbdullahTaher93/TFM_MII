Season pheasant with salt and pepper. Dredge in flour, and shake off excess. Melt butter in a large, heavy skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear pheasant pieces until well browned. Stir in garlic, and cook for a few seconds until fragrant. Pour in lemon juice, beef broth, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the pheasant is tender, about 1 hour.
