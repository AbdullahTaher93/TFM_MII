Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Trim all but a thin layer, 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch, of fat from the roast. Allow roast to sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Rub garlic over entire surface of the roast Arrange roast, fat side up, on a rack in a roasting pan. Sprinkle pepper over top of roast. In a bowl, stir together the salt and water until the mixture forms a stiff paste resembling wet snow. Coat the roast completely with the mixture, patting it on about 1/4 inch thick. Roast the beef in the middle of pre heated oven for two hours (about 22 minutes per pound), or until it registers 130 degrees F. on a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the thickest part of the roast for medium-rare meat. Transfer the meat to a cutting board and let stand for 20 minutes. Remove the crust and carve the meat.
