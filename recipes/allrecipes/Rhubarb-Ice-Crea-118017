Place rhubarb in an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish; sprinkle with sugar; toss to coat. Cover and bake at 375 degrees F for 30-40 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Cool slightly. Process in batches in a blender or food processor. Transfer to a bow; cover and refrigerate until chilled. Stir in lemon juice. In a mixing bowl, beat cream until stiff peaks form. Gradually fold into rhubarb mixture. Transfer to a shallow 2-qt. freezer container. Freeze, uncovered, for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes. Cover and freeze overnight.
