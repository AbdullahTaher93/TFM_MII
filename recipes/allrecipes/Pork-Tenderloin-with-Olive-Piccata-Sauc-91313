Cut pork crosswise into 1-inch thick slices. Place slices between sheets of waxed paper or plastic wrap; pound (or use the heel of your hand) to flatten into 1/2-inch thick medallions. Sprinkle thyme, salt and pepper over medallions. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. Add medallions; cook 4 minutes per side or until no longer pink in center. Transfer to a serving plate; keep warm. Add garlic to drippings in skillet; cook and stir 30 seconds. Add broth and lemon juice; boil gently over medium-high heat 3 minutes or until reduced by half. Stir in olives; heat through. Spoon sauce over medallions; top with parsley.
