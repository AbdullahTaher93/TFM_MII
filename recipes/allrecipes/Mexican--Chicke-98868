Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, sprinkle chicken with 1 tablespoon chile powder, salt and pepper. Add chicken to pan and cook until no longer pink, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate, cover and set aside. To the hot skillet add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, bell pepper and onion; saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, remaining 1 tablespoon chile powder and hot pepper sauce. Simmer to blend flavors, about 5 minutes. Add chicken and simmer until heated through, about 3 to 4 minutes longer.
