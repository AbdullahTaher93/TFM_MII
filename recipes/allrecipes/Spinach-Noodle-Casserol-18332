Cook noodles in a large pot of salted boiling water until barely tender. Drain and rinse with cold water. Toss with vegetable oil. While noodles are cooking, combine sour cream and flour in a large bowl. Mix well, then stir in cottage cheese, green onions, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, and garlic salt. Stir noodles into mixture. Generously grease the inside of a slow cooker and pour in noodle mixture. Cover and cook on high for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
