Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; cook cauliflower in the boiling water until slightly tender, about 10 minutes. Carefully remove cauliflower and place, stem-side down, on a baking sheet. Cut cauliflower in half through the stem; lay cut-side down on the baking sheet. Combine mayonnaise and curry powder together in a bowl; spread over the cauliflower halves. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese-Monterey Jack cheese over curry-mayonnaise layer. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 10 minutes.
