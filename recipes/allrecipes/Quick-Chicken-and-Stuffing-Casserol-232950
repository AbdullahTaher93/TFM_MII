Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking pan. Mix stuffing, chicken, broccoli, chicken gravy, and half the Cheddar cheese in a large bowl. Spread into the prepared baking pan; sprinkle with remaining Cheddar cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and Cheddar cheese is melted, 20 to 25 minutes.
