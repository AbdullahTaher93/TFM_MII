Season the chicken with the paprika. Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until well browned, stirring occasionally. Add the sausage and cook until it's well browned, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic to the skillet and cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in the wine, soup and thyme and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook until the chicken is cooked through, stirring occasionally. Serve the chicken mixture with the rice.
