Adjust oven rack to low position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Toss onions with oil, sugar, salt and pepper in medium bowl. Transfer to a cookie sheet with rim in a single layer. Roast onions until golden brown, about 30 minutes, stirring at 20 minutes and again at 25 minutes, adding garlic at this point. Meanwhile, bring vinegar to boil; simmer over medium-high heat, about 10 minutes, until reduced to 1/3 cup - it should be a thin syrup. Put onions into a bowl, add reduced vinegar and parsley; toss to coat. Serve hot, warm or at room temperature.
