Place a steamer basket in a saucepan with 1/2 inch of water. Place the potatoes in the steamer. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 20 minutes, or until tender. Rinse briefly under cold running water and drain. Place in a large serving bowl. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, for 8 minutes, or until the onion is very soft. Add the vinegar, apple juice, mustard, parsley, and salt. Cook for 2 minutes, or until heated through. Pour over the potatoes. Toss to coat well. Let stand for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.
