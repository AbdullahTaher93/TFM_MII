In a deep skillet over medium heat, cook spareribs in water to cover until meat begins to fall from the bone, 1 hour. Drain. In a large pot over medium heat, combine tomatoes, potato, carrot, onion, salt and 5 cups water. Place the ribs in the pot, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes, until vegetables are soft.
