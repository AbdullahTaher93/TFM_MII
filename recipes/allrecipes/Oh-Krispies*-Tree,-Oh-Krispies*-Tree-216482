Grease two 11 x 17-inch (45 x 29 cm) rimmed baking sheets; set aside. Prepare the Kellogg's* Rice Krispies* Squares recipe according to preferred method (in batches as needed). Firmly press 1 1/2 batches of the mixture onto each prepared baking sheet; chill sheets until firm. Cut a 20 cm (8-inch) square and an 18 cm (7-inch) square from one sheet. Cut a 15 cm (6-inch) square, two 12 cm (5-inch) squares, two 10 cm (4-inch) squares, two 8 cm (3-inch) squares, one 5 cm (2-inch) square from the second sheet. Use a cookie cutter to cut a star from the excess treats. Reserve any excess treats for another use. Arrange the squares, largest to smallest, alternating angles so points stick out, on a cake stand, platter or cake board. Secure the star vertically on top of the tree with a skewer. Use frosting as desired to decorate and secure the M&M'S(R) chocolate candies onto the tree in a decorative pattern. Makes: 1 (25 cm/10-inch) Christmas tree
