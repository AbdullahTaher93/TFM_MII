Whisk teriyaki sauce, sesame oil, paprika, and garlic powder together in a bowl. Heat olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add Brussels sprouts to garlic; sprinkle with pepper. Arrange Brussels sprouts cut-side down and brush about 1/3 the teriyaki mixture over sprouts. Cook and stir Brussels sprouts, brushing with teriyaki sauce 2 more times, until Brussels sprouts are golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes.
