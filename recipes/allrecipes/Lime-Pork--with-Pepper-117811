Finely grate lime peel, reserving 2 tablespoons peel. Juice the limes. In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, garlic, oregano, thyme, cayenne, parsley, lime juice and reserved lime peel. Pour 1/2 cup marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add the pork and bay leaf. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade. Drain and discard marinade. Discard bay leaf. In a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add sugar; stir until bubbly. Add the meat; cook and stir for 3-4 minutes or until browned. Reduce heat; add the onions, peppers and the reserved lime mixture. Cook, uncovered, for 10-15 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Add the tomatoes; cook 1 minute longer.
