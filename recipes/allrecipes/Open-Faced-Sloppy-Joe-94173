Saute celery and green pepper in 2 tablespoons butter until tender. Remove papers from tamales; slice tamales into bite-size pieces. In medium saucepan, combine tamales, chili, celery, and green pepper; cook until hot, stirring occasionally. Halve bread lengthwise, then cut into sections; spread with butter and toast lightly. Place bread, cut side up, on oven-proof serving plates or on a baking sheet. Spoon chili mixture over bread; sprinkle with cheese. Broil until cheese melts. Garnish with green onions.
