Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the onion in the hot oil until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the bacon to the onions; continue cooking and stirring until the bacon fat begins to render, about 5 minutes more. Mix the garlic into the bacon and onion mixture, reduce heat to medium, and continue cooking until the garlic is fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir the undrained navy beans into the mixture; bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low. Fold the spinach into the mixture until the leaves are evenly coated. Place a cover on the saucepan; simmer to allow the flavors to blend, about 1 hour. Squeeze the half lemon over the dish and stir to serve.
