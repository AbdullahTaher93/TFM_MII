MAKE THE TOPPING: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a food processor, combine the flour with the oats, granola and sugar and pulse until coarsely ground. Add the chilled butter and pulse until the mixture resembles fine meal. MAKE THE FILLING: In a large bowl, toss the sugar with the lemon zest, cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg. Add the blackberries, blueberries and raspberries and toss well. Carefully spread the berries in a 9-by-13-inch glass or ceramic baking dish and dot with the butter. Spoon the crumble topping over the berries and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until the fruit is bubbling and the topping is browned. Let the crumble cool slightly and serve warm with the Devonshire Cream.
