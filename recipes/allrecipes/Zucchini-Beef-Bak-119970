In a large saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add the zucchini. Return to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 3 minutes or just until tender. Drain and immediately place zucchini in ice water. Drain and pat dry. In a skillet, cook the beef, onion and garlic over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the rice, tomato sauce, cottage cheese, egg, oregano, basil and salt. Arrange half of the zucchini in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Top with meat mixture. Arrange remaining zucchini over top; sprinkle with cheddar cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until bubbly and cheese is melted.
