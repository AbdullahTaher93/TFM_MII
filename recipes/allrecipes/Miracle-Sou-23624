In a large pot, heat oil over medium heat. Stir in ginger and garlic and cook 3 minutes, until tender. Stir together 1 cup broth with cornstarch. Pour cornstarch mixture into pot with mushrooms, bamboo, soy, vinegar, fructose, crushed red pepper and remaining broth. Bring to a boil and cook until thickened. Stir in frozen mixed vegetables, frozen shrimp and cilantro. Simmer until shrimp is opaque, about 10 minutes. Stir in spinach until just wilted, 2 minutes. Serve at once.
