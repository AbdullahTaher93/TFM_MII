Combine olive oil, lime juice, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, oregano, parsley, and pepper in a gallon-size resealable plastic bag. Add chicken drumsticks; turn to coat evenly. Seal bag, squeezing out all the air. Let chicken marinate in the refrigerator, at least 2 hours and preferably overnight. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Let chicken come to room temperature, about 25 minutes. Arrange on the baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven until browned, about 25 minutes. Flip chicken and baste with juices; continue cooking until browned on the second side, 10 to 15 minutes more. Cover chicken with aluminum foil. Let stand before serving, about 5 minutes.
