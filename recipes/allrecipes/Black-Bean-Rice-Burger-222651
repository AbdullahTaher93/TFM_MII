Mash beans with a fork in a large bowl. Stir in rice, onion, egg, bread crumbs, and 2 tablespoons salsa; mix well. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat; drop bean mixture by 1/2-cupfuls into skillet and flatten to 1/2-inch thickness. Cook until each side is firm and browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Combine sour cream and 4 tablespoons salsa in a small bowl. Place a bean burger on bun with a lettuce leaf, 1 slice Cheddar cheese, and top with salsa mixture. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
