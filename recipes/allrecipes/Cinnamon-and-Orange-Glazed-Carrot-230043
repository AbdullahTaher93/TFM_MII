Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place carrots into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Drain. Whisk butter, orange juice, brown sugar, white sugar, and cinnamon together in a large bowl until sugars are dissolved. Add carrots to the glaze mixture; toss to coat. Transfer carrots and glaze to a 1-quart baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until carrots are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
