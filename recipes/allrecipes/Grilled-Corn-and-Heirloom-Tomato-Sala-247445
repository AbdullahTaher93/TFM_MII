Preheat grill to medium heat and place a 12x12-inch piece of Reynolds Wrap(R) Non-Stick Foil on the grill. Brush corn with olive oil, then sprinkle with salt, pepper, garlic powder and Italian seasoning. Place corn on foil and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, turning occasionally until kernels begin to char. Remove from heat and slice kernels off of the cob. Toss together corn, tomatoes, onions and basil in a medium bowl. Whisk together all dressing ingredients in a small bowl. Add to corn salad and toss to coat. Serve immediately.
