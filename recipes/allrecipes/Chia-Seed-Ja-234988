Soak chia seeds in water until mixture has a jelly-like texture, about 5 minutes. Heat raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, and honey in a saucepan over medium heat until berries are soft, about 15 minutes. Lightly crush berries with a fork or masher. Stir chia seed mixture into berry mixture. Remove from heat and let cool for at least 10 minutes.
