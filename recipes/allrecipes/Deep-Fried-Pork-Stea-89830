Heat oil in a deep fat fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the flour, garlic powder, seasoned salt, chili powder, cinnamon, coriander, basil, cumin, ground turmeric, paprika, and salt. Place pork steaks in the bag one at a time; seal, and shake to coat. One at a time, place pork steak into hot oil, and cook until it turns deep brown and floats. Remove to paper towels. Repeat process with remaining pork steaks.
