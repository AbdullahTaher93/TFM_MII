Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In large microwave-safe bowl, combine cream cheese, shredded Cheddar, mozzarella, habanero Cheddar cheese, cooking sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne. Cook for 2 minutes at 50% power. Stir. Continue to cook at 50% power in 1 minute intervals, stirring each time, until cheeses are fully melted, combined, and thick. Place jalapeno halves, cut sides up, in a medium baking dish. Fill each jalapeno half with cheese mixture. Cook for 25 minutes or until jalapenos have softened and cheese has started to brown.
