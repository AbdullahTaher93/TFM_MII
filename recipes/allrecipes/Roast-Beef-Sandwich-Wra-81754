Rinse a large lettuce leaf and pat dry with a paper towel. The stem end may need to be trimmed off if it is large and stiff. Lay the lettuce flat and layer the roast beef slices across the lettuce. Then apply the mayonnaise and pepper. Then layer on the cheese, followed by the tomato placed in the middle. To roll up, start at one edge and roll so that the stem end is tightly wrapped and the leafy tip is more loosely wrapped forming a cone. With just a little bit of practice this will become very fast and simple.
