Cook steaks in hot oil in large skillet over medium-high heat 2 minutes on each side, or until lightly browned on both sides. Add potatoes, tomato sauce and gravy; mix well. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to low. Cook 15 minutes, or until potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally. Garnish with sour cream and parsley, if desired.
