In a food processor, combine wafer crumbs, sugar and butter; pulse until blended. Add egg white; pulse until moistened. Press mixture onto the bottom and up the sides of a 9-in. pie plate. Bake at 375 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool completely before filling. In a bowl, whisk milk powder and water until blended. Add pudding mix; whisk for 2 minutes or until slightly thickened. Fold in 1/4 cup whipped topping, almonds and 1/2 teaspoon extract. Pour into prepared crust; refrigerate for 15 minutes. Combine remaining whipped topping and extract; spread over filling. Sprinkle with coconut and chocolate chips; refrigerate until serving.
