Heat oil in a soup pot over low heat while chopping the vegetables. Increase heat to medium-high and stir in onion and green pepper. Saute until tender; about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cumin and saute until fragrant; about 1 minute. Stir in beans and 2 1/2 cups chicken broth. Season with salt and pepper and simmer for 15 minutes. Pour black bean mixture into a blender. Making sure to remove canister cap for steam to escape, puree until smooth; about 30 seconds. Return soup to pot, stir in remaining broth and heat through. Ladle a portion of soup into each bowl. Garnish with sour cream and salsa and serve.
