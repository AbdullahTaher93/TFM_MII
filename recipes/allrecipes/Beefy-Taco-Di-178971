Cook the beef and chili powder in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until the beef is well browned, stirring often. Pour off any fat. Stir the salsa, cream cheese and Cheddar cheese in the skillet. Cook and stir until the cheese is melted. Sprinkle with the assorted toppings and top with the sour cream, if desired. Serve with the tortilla chips.
