Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking dish. Arrange the salmon fillets in the baking dish. Make small incisions in each fillet, and stuff with equal amounts of the herbed goat cheese. Spread equal amounts prepared Dijon mustard mayonnaise blend over each fillet. Season with salt and pepper. Bake salmon 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until easily flaked with a fork.
