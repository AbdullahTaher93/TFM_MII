Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot oil until soft. Stir black beans, diced tomatoes, chicken, chili seasoning, cumin, salt, and pepper through the onion, breaking up large pieces of chicken until shredded; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium low, and cook at a simmer until hot, about 15 minutes.
