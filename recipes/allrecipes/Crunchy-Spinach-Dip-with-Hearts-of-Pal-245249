Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Combine spinach, garlic, salt, and pepper in skillet; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant and spinach is warmed through, about 5 minutes. Combine hearts of palm, cream cheese, sour cream, water chestnuts, and half of the mozzarella cheese together in a separate bowl. Add spinach mixture and stir to distribute ingredients evenly. Pour mixture into prepared baking dish; top with remaining mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese. Bake in preheated oven until golden and bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes.
