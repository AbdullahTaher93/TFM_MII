Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 10 muffin cups with paper muffin liners. In a large bowl, combine self-rising flour and sugar. Stir in milk and mayonnaise until a smooth dough is formed. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown and doubled in size.
