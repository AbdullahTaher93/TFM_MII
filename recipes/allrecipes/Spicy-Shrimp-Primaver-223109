Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir green bell pepper, red bell pepper, onion, jalapeno pepper, mushrooms, and 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Season with 1 teaspoon paprika and 1/2 teaspoon chili powder. Transfer bell pepper mixture to a large saucepan. Add diced tomatoes, tomato paste, fresh tomato, water, 1 1/2 teaspoon paprika, 1 teaspoon chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic, salt, oregano, and black pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain. Stir shrimp into tomato sauce until heated through, about 5 minutes. Serve sauce over angel hair pasta.
