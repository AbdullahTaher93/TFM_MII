In a heavy saucepan, heat milk over low until hot but not boiling. Stir in sugar and salt until dissolved. Gradually stir a quarter of the hot mixture into eggs, mixing constantly. Return all to the saucepan, stirring constantly. Continue to cook and stir for 10-12 minutes or until mixture coats the back of a metal spoon. Remove from the heat; cool. Chill for at least 2 hours or overnight. In a large bowl, combine the cream, fruit, vanilla and almond extract if desired. Add the chilled milk mixture, stirring well. Pour into a chilled freezer can of a 1-gallon ice cream freezer. Freeze according to manufacturer's instructions.
