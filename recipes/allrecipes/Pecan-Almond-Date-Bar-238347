Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread pecans and almonds onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until nuts are toasted and fragrant, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove baking sheet from oven and decrease oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Combine flour, flax seeds, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a food processor; pulse a few times. Add pecans and almonds to flour mixture; pulse until nuts are coarsely chopped. Add oats and dates to flour-nut mixture; pulse just until combined. Whisk maple syrup and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth; pour over oat mixture and pulse just until combined. Spread oat mixture into an 8-inch square pan. Bake in the preheated oven lightly browned, about 25 minutes; cool to room temperature.
