Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8-inch square metal baking dish with margarine. Mix almond milk and vinegar together in a cup. Mix rice flour, brown sugar, amaranth flour, soy flour, flax seed meal, baking powder, baking soda, and sea salt together in a large mixing bowl. Beat bananas, almond milk mixture, egg, and coconut oil together in a separate bowl; add to rice flour mixture and stir until dry ingredients are completely moistened. Spread the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes.
