Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet over medium heat, saute the ground beef, onion and garlic for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain excess fat. Stir in the tomato paste, water, tomatoes, parsley, thyme, oregano and basil. Set aside. Slice eggplant into 1/4-inch rounds. Place a layer of eggplant into the bottom of a lightly greased 9x12-inch glass baking dish. Then place a layer of the ground beef mixture over the eggplant, followed by a layer of sliced onion. Top this with 1/2 the breadcrumbs and cheese. Then repeat the layers: eggplant, ground beef mixture, sliced onion and remaining breadcrumbs and cheese. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour, remove foil and bake for 20 more minutes.
