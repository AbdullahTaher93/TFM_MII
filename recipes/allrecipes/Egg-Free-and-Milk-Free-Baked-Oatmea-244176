Lightly grease a pie pan. Beat applesauce and white sugar together in a bowl. Add oats, soy milk, 1 tablespoon plus 1/4 teaspoon baking powder, vegetable oil, and sea salt; mix well. Fold raisins into oat mixture; pour into prepared pie pan and top with brown sugar and cinnamon. Refrigerate 8 hours to overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven until oatmeal is firm, 35 to 50 minutes.
