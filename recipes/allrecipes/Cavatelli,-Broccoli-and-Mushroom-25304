Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Place broccoli in a microwave safe dish with about 3 tablespoons of water. Microwave for 3 minutes, or until tender. Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Saute garlic and mushrooms until garlic becomes aromatic. Combine with pasta, broccoli and Parmesan cheese; transfer to a 2 quart baking dish. Cover and bake in preheated oven for about 20 minutes, or until heated throughout.
