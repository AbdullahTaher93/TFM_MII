Preheat the grill for high heat. Place bell peppers and zucchinis in a medium bowl. Drizzle with 3 tablespoons oil and season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Place onion slices on a plate; coat with remaining tablespoon of oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place vegetables on hot grill, cover and cook, turning once until vegetables have grill marks and are tender crisp, about 6-8 minutes. (The onions may take longer. If so, let them grill along with the bread.) Remove vegetables from grill and set aside. In a small bowl, mix the mayonnaise, garlic, lemon juice and oregano. Spread a portion of the mixture over the cut sides of the bread and sprinkle each one with feta cheese. Reduce heat to low and place bread, cheese side up, on hot grill; cover and cook until crisp on the bottom and warmed through, about 2 minutes. Remove from grill. Arrange a portion of vegetables on each slice of toasted focaccia bread, beginning with onions, then zucchinis and finally bell peppers. Serve open-face.
