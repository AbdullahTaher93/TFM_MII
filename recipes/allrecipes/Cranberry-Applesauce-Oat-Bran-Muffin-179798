Spray 2 1/2-inch muffin cups with vegetable oil spray; set aside. In a large bowl, stir together flour, oat bran, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, apple pie spice, and salt until well combined. Then mix in cranberries. In another bowl, beat egg, milk, oil, applesauce, and vanilla until smoothly blended. Add milk mixture to flour mixture and stir just until dry ingredients are evenly moistened. Spoon batter evenly into prepared muffin pan. Bake in a 375 degrees oven until muffin tops are richly browned and spring back when touched (18 to 20 minutes). Serve warm or at room temperature.
