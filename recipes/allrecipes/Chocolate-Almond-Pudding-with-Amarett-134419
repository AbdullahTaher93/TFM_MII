In medium saucepan, sift together sugar, cocoa, and cornstarch. Gradually stir in milk until cornstarch dissolves. Bring to a boil over medium-low heat, stirring gently. Cook, stirring, 6 minutes or until thickened and smooth. Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla and almond extracts. Spoon half of mixture into four 4-ounce ramekins, wineglasses, or parfait glasses. Sprinkle with half of the cookies. Top with remaining pudding and cookies and serve.
