Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine melted butter and lemon juice in a small bowl. Brush 2 tablespoons of this mixture on a piece of foil placed on the broiler pan. Mix together garlic salt, parsley, paprika and white pepper. Sprinkle spice mixture on both sides of fillets. Bake fillets until meat flakes, about 10 minutes. Brush fillets again with lemon butter and spread with mayonnaise. Sprinkle with paprika before serving.
