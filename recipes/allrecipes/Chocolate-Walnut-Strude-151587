Thaw pastry sheet at room temperature 40 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Mix egg and water. Place chocolate, milk and butter in large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on HIGH for 1 1/2 minutes or until chocolate is almost melted, stirring halfway through heating. Stir until smooth. Unfold pastry on lightly floured surface. Roll into 16x12-inch rectangle. Spread chocolate mixture on pastry to within 1 1/2 inches of edges. Sprinkle walnuts over chocolate. Starting at short side, roll up like a jelly roll. Place seam-side down on baking sheet. Tuck ends under to seal. Brush with egg mixture. Bake 35 minutes or until golden. Cool on baking sheet on wire rack at least 30 minutes. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Slice and serve warm.
