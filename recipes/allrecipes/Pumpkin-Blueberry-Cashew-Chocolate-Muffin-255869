Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners. Combine cashew butter, pumpkin puree, almond flour, banana, egg whites, walnut oil, honey, vanilla extract, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon in a food processor; blend well. Fold blueberries and chocolate chips gently into the batter. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin tin. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before removing from the muffin tin.
