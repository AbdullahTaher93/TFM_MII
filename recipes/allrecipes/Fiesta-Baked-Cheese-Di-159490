Beat cream cheese in large mixing bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until softened. Reserve 1/4 cup shredded cheese for garnish. Add remaining shredded cheese, chilies, 1/2 cup of the sour cream and ground red pepper to cream cheese; mix well. Spoon into 10-inch pie plate or quiche dish. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes or until lightly browned around edge. Spread remaining 3/4 cup sour cream over baked cheese spread. Sprinkle with reserved 1/4 cup shredded cheese. Garnish with bell pepper cut-outs, if desired. Serve with tortilla chips.
