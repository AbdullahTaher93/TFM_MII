In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add 1 tablespoon sugar; let stand for 5 minutes. Add buttermilk, oil, salt, baking soda, 3 cups flour and remaining sugar; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Punch dough down. Turn onto a floured surface; divide in half. Roll each portion into a 15-in. x 9-in. rectangle. For filling, in a small bowl, beat cream cheese and butter. Add the brown sugar, flour and vanilla; beat well. Stir in nuts and poppy seeds. Spread over rectangles. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch seams to seal. Cut into 1-in. pieces. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise for 30 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12-15 minutes. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool. Combine icing ingredients; drizzle over rolls.
