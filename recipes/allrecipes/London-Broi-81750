With a knife or fork pierce both sides of the steak. Place meat in a zip-lock baggie along with the marinade, barbeque sauce, seasonings and water. Seal and squish around to blend and distribute. Refrigerate for 2-3 hours (or overnight). Discard marinade and grill over medium heat or broil about 5 inches from the element. This is best cooked rare to medium rare 130 degrees F to 140 degrees F. For a 1/2 inch thick steak, about 3 minutes per side; 1 inch thick, about 6 minutes per side; and a 1 1/2inch thick steak, about 10 minutes per side. Allow to rest for 5 minutes before slicing at an angle against the grain.
