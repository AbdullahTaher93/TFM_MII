Pour peaches, pears, cherries, and all syrups from the canned fruit into a large pot. Stir in prunes, raisins, mandarin orange peels, and cinnamon sticks; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until slightly thick, about 2 hours. Serve warm. Remove orange peels and cinnamon sticks before serving.
