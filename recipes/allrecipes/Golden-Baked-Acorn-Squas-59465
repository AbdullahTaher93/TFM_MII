Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Coat pan evenly with melted butter. In a saucepan, mix the remaining butter, brown sugar, frozen orange juice concentrate, and brandy . Bring to a boil, and remove from heat. Place squash halves cut side down in the baking dish, and bake 30 minutes, or until easily pierced with a knife. Turn squash over, and drizzle with the sauce. Continue baking 15 minutes. Cool slightly before serving.
