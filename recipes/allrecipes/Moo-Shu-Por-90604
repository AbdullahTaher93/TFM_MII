Spray a large skillet, preferably non-stick, with cooking spray. Saute pork over high heat for 1 minute. Add about 2 1/2 cups coleslaw mix and saute for 2 to 3 minutes or until pork is almost cooked through. Stir in Stir Fry Sauce and remaining coleslaw and saute for 1 minute. To assemble, spread Plum Sauce on each tortilla, if using. Top with pork mixture and green onions and roll up.
