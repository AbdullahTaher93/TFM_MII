Bring the coconut milk to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat to medium-low to maintain a simmer. Cook the taro root in the simmering coconut milk until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add the white sugar, palm sugar, and salt to the mixture; stir until the sugars are entirely dissolved into the mixture. Stir the coconut cream through the mixture; continue cooking just until hot. Ladle into individual bowls to serve.
