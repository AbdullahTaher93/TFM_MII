Follow the recipe for Creamy Macaroni and Cheese. Heat a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Cook sausage, breaking it up as it fries, until it loses its raw color, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onion and pepper slices, and saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Add basil, then stir mixture into macaroni. Serve hot.
