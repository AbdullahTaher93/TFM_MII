Place the beans in a bowl. Add water to cover by 2 inches, and let stand overnight. Drain and rinse the beans. Place the soaked beans in a medium saucepan. Add water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil over high heat. Skim off the foam and stir in the thyme. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 1/4 hours, or until tender. Drain the beans, return to the pot, and set aside. (This may be done 1 to 3 days ahead. Store in the refrigerator.) Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, onion, bell pepper, and chile pepper (if using) and cook, stirring occasionally, for 6 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Stir in the broth, sweet potato, beans, ginger, turmeric, paprika, coriander, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, partially cover, and simmer for 25 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are tender. Stir in the corn, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes longer, or until tender. Remove from the heat and stir in the pineapple (with juice). Ladle the stew into bowls and serve with lime wedges, if using.
