Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add carrots and broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, about 20 minutes. Place carrots, broccoli, breast milk, and water in a blender or food processor and blend until creamy. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps. Spread carrot-broccoli mixture into an ice cube tray, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze until solid, 2 to 3 hours. Transfer frozen cubes to a resealable plastic bag and store in the freezer. To serve, heat cubes in the microwave until warm but not hot, about 30 seconds. Stir thoroughly.
