To Make the Brine: In a medium bowl, combine curing mixture, sugar, pepper, 2 tablespoons onion powder, 2 tablespoons garlic powder and water. Mix until the salt and sugar are dissolved in the water. Pour brine over pork. Allow pork to soak in brine for one week in the refrigerator. Remove pork from brine, then discard brine. Rinse and pat dry the pork. Preheat an outdoor smoker for 200 to 225 degrees F (95 to 110 degrees C). To Make the Rub: In a medium bowl, mix together the mace, 1/4 cup garlic powder, 1/4 cup onion powder, paprika, sage, thyme and honey. Evenly coat the pork with the rub and work it in with your fingers. Place a roasting rack in a drip pan and lay the meat on the rack. Smoke at 200 to 225 degrees F (95 to 110 degrees C) for 12 hours.
