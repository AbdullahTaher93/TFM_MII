Season the chicken with the salt and black pepper. Heat the oil in a 6-quart saucepot over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for 6 minutes or until browned on both sides. Remove the chicken from the saucepot. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion and pepper strips to the saucepot and cook for 5 minutes or until the vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and cook and stir for 30 seconds. Increase the heat to medium-high. Add the wine to the saucepot and heat to a boil, stirring to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the saucepot. Cook for 1 minute or until the wine is reduced by half. Stir in the tomatoes and soup. Return the chicken to the saucepot and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 25 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Serve the chicken and sauce over the rice. Sprinkle with the parsley.
