In a pressure cooker, brown chicken in oil over medium-high heat; drain. Remove chicken to a 30-in. x 18-in. piece of heavy-duty foil. Top with onion, peppers, garlic and orange peel. Wrap tightly. Place on a rack in pressure cooker; add water. Close over securely; place pressure regulator on vent pipe. Bring cooker to full pressure over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-high; cook for 12 minutes. (Pressure regulator should maintain a slow steady rocking motion; adjust heat if needed.) Immediately cool according to manufacturer's directions until pressure is completely reduced. In a small saucepan, combine cornstarch and orange juice until smooth. Stir in the sherry or broth, teriyaki sauce, brown sugar, butter and ginger. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1 minute or until thickened. Remove chicken and vegetables to a serving platter. Top with sauce; sprinkle with almonds.
