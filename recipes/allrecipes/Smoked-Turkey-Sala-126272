Place the eggs in their shells in a small saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 1 minute. Remove from the heat, cover, and let stand for 10 minutes. Drain and run cold water into the pan. Let the eggs cool, then shell and slice. In a large serving bowl, whisk together the apple juice concentrate, olive oil, flaxseed oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, and cinnamon. Add the spinach, nectarines, turkey, and onion and toss to coat well. Top with the eggs and almonds.
