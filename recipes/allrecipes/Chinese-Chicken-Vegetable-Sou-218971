Heat the vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven or soup pot over medium-high heat, and cook and stir the chicken thigh and breast meat until the chicken is no longer pink inside, about 3 minutes. When the chicken is cooked, stir in the water, chicken bouillon cube, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Bring the soup to a boil, and reduce heat to a simmer. Stir in the baby corn, water chestnuts, carrots, broccoli florets, napa cabbage, red bell pepper, green onions, celery, zucchini, and snow peas, and simmer until the carrots start to softened, and the broccoli and snow peas turn bright green, 1 to 2 minutes. Mix in the mushrooms, and simmer for 5 more minutes.
