In a small bowl, whisk together juice, honey, vinegar, and 1/8 teaspoon chipotle. Gradually whisk in the oil. Mix in the onion. Add the romaine to a large bowl and toss with dressing. Season with salt, pepper, and an additional 1/8 teaspoon chipotle if desired. Divide between two plates and sprinkle half of the cheese over each.
