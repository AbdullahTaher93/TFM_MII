In a large salad bowl, gently toss together the watermelon, cantaloupe, pineapple, strawberries, peaches, grapes, and kiwi until thoroughly combined. Combine the water and orange juice, limeade, and lemonade concentrates in a small bowl. Pour the dressing over the fruit salad. Gently toss, and sprinkle the salad with toasted pecans. Serve salad scooped on lettuce leaves.
