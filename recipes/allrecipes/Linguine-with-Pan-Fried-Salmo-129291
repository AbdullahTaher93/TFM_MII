Cut the salmon into chunks and place in a dish. Add the lemon zest and juice and the dill. Turn the chunks of salmon to coat them evenly. If time permits, cover and marinate in the refrigerator at least 10 minutes. Cook the linguine in boiling water until al dente, 10 to 12 minutes, or according to package directions. Add the carrots to the pasta after 8 minutes cooking, then add the zucchini 1 minute later. Meanwhile, brush a nonstick or heavy-bottomed skillet with the oil and heat thoroughly. Drain the salmon, reserving the lemon juice marinade. Add the salmon to the hot pan and fry until the fish is firm and just cooked, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the reserved marinade and nonfat sour cream to the salmon, and stir a few seconds. Remove from the heat and stir in seasoning to taste. Drain the pasta and vegetables, and transfer them to a serving dish or to individual plates. Add the salmon mixture, garnish with fresh dill (optional). Serve with lemon wedges.
