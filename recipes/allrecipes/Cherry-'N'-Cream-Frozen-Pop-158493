Stir together yogurt, cherries, juice and honey in small bowl. For easier chopping, chop cherries while still frozen. Spoon yogurt mixture into 2-ounce freezer pop molds and insert handles. (If using paper cups, spoon mixture into cups and cover each with foil. Cut a small hole in center of each foil top and insert a pop stick.) Freeze about 6 hours or until firm.
