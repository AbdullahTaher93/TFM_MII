In a mixing bowl, cream butter and confectioners' sugar. Combine flour and cornstarch; add to creamed mixture and mix well. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls 3 in. apart onto ungreased baking sheets (cookies will spread). Sprinkle with colored sugar if desired. Bake at 325 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until edges are lightly browned and tops are set. Cool for 2 minutes before carefully removing to wire racks.
