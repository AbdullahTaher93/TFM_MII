In a medium bowl, combine cabbage and 1 teaspoon salt. Toss to combine. Let stand, at room temperature, for about 1 hour. Squeeze liquid from cabbage, and transfer to a large bowl. Add pork, chives, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, sesame oil, rice wine, ginger, cornstarch, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Combine thoroughly using your hands or a wooden spoon. The mixture should be thick and rather sticky. Lightly dust a baking sheet with cornstarch. Place about 1 1/2 teaspoons of filling in the center of a dumpling skin. Use your finger or a pastry brush to moisten edge of dumpling skin with water. Fold skin over filling to form a half-moon shape. Press edges to seal. Place on prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining filling and dumpling skins. To make the dipping sauce: In a small bowl, combine 1/4 cup water, remaining and 1/2 cup soy sauce. If desired, add a little sesame oil; set aside. In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of safflower oil over medium-high heat. Add half of the dumplings, folded edge down, placing close together so they stand up, and cook until golden, about 2 minutes. Add 1 cup water. Cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a moderate boil, and cook until skins are translucent and filling is cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Uncover, and allow liquid to evaporate. Loosen dumplings from pan with a spatula, adding a small amount of safflower oil, if necessary. Continue cooking until bottoms of dumplings re-crisp, about 1 minute more. Turn out onto a serving platter. Repeat with
