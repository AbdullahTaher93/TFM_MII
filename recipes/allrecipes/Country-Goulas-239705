Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Season beef with paprika, black pepper, and seasoned salt. Stir tomato sauce and tomato paste into the beef mixture until smooth. Pour water over the beef; add macaroni and stir. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer mixture, adding water as needed to maintain your desired consistency, until the macaroni is tender yet firm to the bit, about 20 minutes. Adjust seasoning before serving.
