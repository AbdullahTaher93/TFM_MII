Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place the chicken breasts in the prepared dish. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cook in preheated oven until no longer pink, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together the mai tai drink, pineapple, and sweet and sour mix in a bowl until evenly blended. Remove chicken from oven, and top with half of the pineapple mixture. Return to oven, and cook chicken until juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. Serve with remaining pineapple mixture.
