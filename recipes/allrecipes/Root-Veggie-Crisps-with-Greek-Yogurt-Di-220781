Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C). Carefully fry beet, sweet potato, turnip, parsnip, and golden beet slices in the hot oil, working in batches, until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove vegetable chips with a slotted spoon and transfer to paper towels to drain. Allow to dry and cool. Season chips with sea salt, cracked black pepper, and malt vinegar to taste. Combine yogurt, parsley, mint, garlic, and green onions together in a bowl. Stir lemon juice, salt, and white pepper into yogurt mixture to your taste preference.
