Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter two cookie sheets. Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl. Use a pastry blender to cut in the butter until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Stir in the granulated sugar, lemon zest and juice, and egg yolks to form a stiff dough. Press the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Use a 3-inch fluted cookie cutter to cut out the cookies. Use a 1-inch star-shaped cookie cutter to cut out the centers from half the cookies. Gather the dough scraps, re-roll, and continue cutting out cookies until all the dough is used. Use a spatula to transfer the cookies to the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 6-8 minutes, or until golden brown, rotating the sheets halfway through for even baking. Cool on the sheets until the cookies firm slightly. Transfer to racks to finish cooling. Spread the cooled whole cookies with the lemon curd and place the cookies with holes on top. Dust with the confectioners' sugar.
