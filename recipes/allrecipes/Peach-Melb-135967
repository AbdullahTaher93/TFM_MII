Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Place sugar and flour in small bowl. Using a pastry blender, cut in margarine until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Set aside for topping. Place lightly toasted waffles on baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Spoon peaches evenly over each waffle reserving half for garnish. Sprinkle with topping. Bake 10 minutes or until lightly browned. Serve warm. Top with ice cream and garnish with remaining peaches.
