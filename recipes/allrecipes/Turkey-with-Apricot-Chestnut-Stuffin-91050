Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spread bread cubes onto bottom of large shallow baking pan. Bake 15 minutes, or until lightly toasted, stirring once. Set aside. Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat. Add almonds; cook and stir 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Remove with slotted spoon; set aside. Add onion and celery to remaining butter; cook and stir 5 minutes, or until vegetables are crisp-tender. Stir in poultry seasoning and salt.

Remove neck and giblets from body and neck cavities of turkey; refrigerate for another use or discard. Drain juices from turkey; dry turkey with paper towels. Fill neck cavity with part of the stuffing. Turn wings back to hold neck skin against back of turkey. Fill body cavity with remaining stuffing. Place turkey, breast up, on flat roasting rack in shallow roasting pan. Spray turkey with cooking spray. Place small pieces of aluminum foil over skin of neck cavity and over stuffing at body cavity opening to prevent overbrowning during roasting. Roast turkey 4-1/2 hours, or until meat thermometer reaches 160 degrees F when inserted in center of stuffing and reaches 180 degrees F when inserted deep in thigh, covering breast and top of drumsticks with aluminum foil after 3 hours to prevent overcooking of the breast. Let turkey stand 15 minutes before removing stuffing and carving.
