Marinate the pork in juice of one lime while you prepare a medium-hot fire (5 to 8 minutes). Grill chops over indirect heat, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Warm coconut milk over low heat; season with salt and a pinch of cayenne. Add juice of second lime to sauce. Transfer chops to platter when done. Spoon sauce over chops. Garnish with scallions (and cilantro) and sprinkle with juice from third lime. Serve with rice and remaining sauce.
