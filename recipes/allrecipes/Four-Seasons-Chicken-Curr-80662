Heat the oil in a wok over medium heat, and cook the onion until lightly browned. Mix in garlic, ginger, cinnamon, bay leaves, brown sugar, coriander, fenugreek, cloves, cardamom, red pepper, and peppercorns. Cook and stir about 3 minutes. Place chicken in the wok, and cook until lightly browned. Mix in curry powder. Pour in water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 30 minutes. Add more water as necessary to keep chicken covered. Mix in lemon juice, season with salt and pepper, and continue cooking at least 15 minutes. Stir in cream and remove cinnamon stick and bay leaves before serving.
