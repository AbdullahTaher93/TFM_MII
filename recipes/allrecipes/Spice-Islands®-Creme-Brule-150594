Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Scald cream using a double boiler, if available. Whisk eggs, white sugar and vanilla in a separate bowl. Temper the eggs by mixing 2 tablespoons of hot cream into the yolk mixture. Stir the tempered yolks into the cream. Strain cream and evenly divide the mixture between 5 porcelain ramekins. Place ramekins in a 1-inch water bath. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes. Remove ramekins from water bath and cool on wire rack 10 minutes. Refrigerate a minimum of one hour. Just before serving, sprinkle 2 teaspoons brown sugar evenly over each ramekin. Broil ramekins for 2 to 5 minutes until sugar is melted. Serve immediately.
