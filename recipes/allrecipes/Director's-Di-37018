DRAIN artichoke hearts well; chop. Combine goat cheese, cream cheese, mayonnaise, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese in a mixing bowl; beat at low speed with an electric mixer until smooth. Stir in artichokes, pecans, green onions, and Italian seasoning. Spoon into an ungreased shallow 1 1/2-quart baking dish. COMBINE remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, breadcrumbs, and melted butter; toss gently. Sprinkle over dip. BAKE, uncovered, at 350 degrees for 20 minutes or until dip is thoroughly heated and topping is browned. Garnish, if desired. Serve hot with bagel chips.
