Line 13x9-inch baking pan with foil, with ends of foil extending over sides of pan. Mix graham crumbs, butter and 3 Tbsp. sugar; press onto bottom of prepared pan. Refrigerate while preparing filling. Beat cream cheese and 3/4 cup sugar in large bowl with electric mixer until well blended. Add drained berries; beat on low speed just until blended. Gently stir in whipped topping. Spoon over crust; cover. Refrigerate 4 hours or until firm. Use foil handles to remove cheesecake from pan before cutting to serve. Store leftovers in refrigerator.
