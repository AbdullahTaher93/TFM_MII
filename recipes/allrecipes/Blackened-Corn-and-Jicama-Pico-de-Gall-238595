Heat a large skillet over high heat. Cook corn kernels in the hot skillet, turning frequently, until beginning to blacken slightly, about 5 minutes. Mix corn, jicama, red onion, white onion, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, olive oil, white vinegar, salt, cumin, black pepper, red wine vinegar, and chili powder together in a large bowl. Add cilantro, tomatoes, lime zest, and lime juice to the corn mixture; gently stir to incorporate.
