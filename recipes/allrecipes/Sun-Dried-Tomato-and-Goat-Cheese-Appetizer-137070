Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Separate dough into 10 biscuits; separate each evenly into 2 layers, making 20 dough rounds. Press each in ungreased miniature muffin cup. In small bowl, mix mayonnaise, goat cheese, tomatoes, onion flakes and pesto seasoning. Spoon about 1 1/2 teaspoons mayonnaise mixture into each dough-lined cup. Sprinkle each with Parmesan cheese. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10 to 16 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from muffin cups. Cool 5 minutes before serving.
