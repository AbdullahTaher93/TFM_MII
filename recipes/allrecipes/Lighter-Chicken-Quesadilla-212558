Heat the oven to 425 degrees F. Stir the soup, chili powder, cheese and chicken in a medium bowl. Place the tortillas onto 2 baking sheets. Spread about 1/4 cup soup mixture on half of each tortilla to within 1/2 inch of the edge. Brush the edges of the tortillas with water. Fold the tortillas over the filling and press the edges to seal. Bake for 10 minutes or until the filling is hot.
