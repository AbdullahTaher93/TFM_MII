Season the pork with salt and black pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork in batches and cook for 6 minutes or until browned on both sides. Remove the pork from the skillet. Add the onion to the skillet and cook for 5 minutes or until tender-crisp, stirring occasionally. Stir in the honey, mustard and soup and heat to a boil. Return the pork to the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes or until the pork is cooked through. Serve the pork and soup mixture with the potatoes.
