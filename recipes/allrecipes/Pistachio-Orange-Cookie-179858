Place pistachios on a baking sheet. In a 350 degrees F oven, bake for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and toasted. Set aside. In a food processor with metal knife or in a bowl with an electric mixer, mix butter and sugar until fluffy. Mix in milk, vanilla, and liqueur. Add flour and salt and mix until incorporated. Stir in cooled pistachios and orange peel. Remove to a sheet of waxed paper or plastic wrap. Shape into a 2-inch-diameter log. Wrap in paper and refrigerate until firm, several hours or overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Slice log into 1/4- to 1/3-inch-thick rounds. Place on lightly greased baking sheets. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until pale golden. (If baking 2 sheets in one oven, rotate their positions halfway through the baking time.) Cookies will be very soft, but will firm up as they cool. Immediately remove to racks to cool.
