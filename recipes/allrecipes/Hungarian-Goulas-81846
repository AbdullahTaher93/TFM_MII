Steaks should be about 1 inch think. Cut into strips about 1/4 inch thick, by cutting across the grain. Place a non-stick skillet on medium-high heat. (If not non-stick then add a dab of butter). When hot, add the meat and stir fry until browned. Don't crowd the meat, so you will probably need to do a few batches. Each will take about 3 minutes. Transfer beef to a bowl, leaving the fat in the skillet. Add the mushrooms to the skillet and stir fry until browned (about 3 more minutes). Transfer mushrooms to the bowl with the beef. Add the onions to the skillet and stir fry until lightly brown (about 2 minutes). Add red bell peppers and stir. Reduce heat to medium, add the paprika to the onions & peppers and stir. Add the stock and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and return the beef and mushrooms to the skillet, plus any accumulated juices. Stir occasionally cooking for 10 minutes. Add the sour cream, stir until well mixed and then remove from heat. Transfer to a serving bowl (or individual soup bowls) and garnish with the chopped parsley. Serve.
