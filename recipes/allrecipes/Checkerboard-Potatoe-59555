Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a 9x13 inch baking dish, alternate the sweet potato and red potato slices in overlapping rows to create a checkerboard effect. Pour the cream evenly over the potatoes. Dot with pieces of butter, and sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake uncovered for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until the potatoes are fork tender, and slightly brown around the edges. Remove from the oven and let stand for 15 minutes before serving.
