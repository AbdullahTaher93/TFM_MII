Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat a baking sheet with nonstick spray. Place bread crumbs on a plate. Coat both sides of tomato slices with nonstick spray. Dip tomato slices in bread crumbs to coat well. Place tomato slices on the prepared baking sheet. In a large bowl, combine crabmeat, cheese, olives, mushrooms, parsley, garlic, oregano, and basil. Spoon crab mixture evenly onto tomato slices. Bake 15 minutes, or until hot.
