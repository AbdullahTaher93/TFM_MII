Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir sweet onion and celery in hot oil until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add chicken, granulated garlic, and seasoned salt; continue cooking until chicken is warmed, about 3 minutes. Stir cream cheese, chicken broth, and processed cheese food into the chicken mixture. Reduce heat to low, place a cover on the saucepan, and cook until the cheeses are melted, about 5 minutes. Stir blue cheese salad dressing, chile-garlic sauce, and ranch dressing mix into the cheese mixture; cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over the mixture; cook until melted, 1 to 2 minutes more.
