Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking pan. In a large mixing bowl, combine corn, reserved liquid, eggs, corn bread mix and sour cream; stir until blended. Pour batter into prepared pan; sprinkle with cheese. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, until golden brown.
