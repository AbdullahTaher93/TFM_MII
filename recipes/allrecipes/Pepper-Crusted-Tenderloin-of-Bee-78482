Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan. Immerse the onions in the boiling water for about 2 minutes, then shock them with cold water. Cut off the root tip of each onion and squeeze it out of the skin. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the shallots and saute for about 2 minutes or until tender. Rub the beef with olive oil. Combine the pepper, salt, garlic, rosemary, and orange zest and pat the mixture on the beef. Increase the heat to high and sear the beef in the pan on all sides. Add the pearl onions and place the skillet directly in the oven. Roast until a thermometer reads 145 degrees for medium rare.
