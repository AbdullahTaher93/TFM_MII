Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Measure 1/2 cup of the chow mein noodles and set aside. Combine the remaining noodles, tuna, cashews, celery mushroom soup, and water in a 1 1/2 quart baking dish. Top with the 1/2 cup of noodles you set aside. Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 30 minutes.
