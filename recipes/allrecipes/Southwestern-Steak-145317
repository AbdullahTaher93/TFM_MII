Heat grill. Place steaks, salad dressing and peppers in resealable food-safe plastic bag. Seal and turn bag several times to coat the steaks. Remove steak from marinade; discard marinade. Place steaks on grill over medium-high heat. Cover and cook 10 to 14 minutes, turning once, until desired doneness.
