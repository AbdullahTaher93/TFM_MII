Toast the bread slices to your desired darkness. When done, spread lightly with butter or margarine. Place a slice of tomato on the buttered side of one slice, and top with a slice of cheese. Season to taste with salt and pepper and place a slice of lettuce on if desired. Top with the remaining slice of bread. Enjoy!
