Stir salt, poultry seasoning, onion powder, and black pepper together in a large stockpot. Pour vegetable broth, tomato juice, and water into the stockpot and stir to dissolve the salt mixture; add sun-dried tomatoes and basil leaves. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and cook the brine, stirring occasionally, until the seasonings are completely dissolved, about 20 minutes.
