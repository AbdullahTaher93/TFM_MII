Prepare the noodles according to package directions in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add the cauliflower after 6 minutes; add the peas just before draining. Reserve in the strainer. Meanwhile, set the pot over medium heat. Add the oil; saute the onion with the curry paste, salt and pepper until softened. Stir in the tuna, yogurt, tomato and mayonnaise until combined. Add the noodles, cauliflower and peas. Cook, stirring, until warmed through. Remove from heat and stir in the coriander (if using).
