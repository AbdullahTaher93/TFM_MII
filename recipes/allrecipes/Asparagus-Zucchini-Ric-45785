In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and saute the onion for about 2 minutes. Stir in asparagus and zucchini, and saute 5 minutes, or until tender. Season with oregano, basil, thyme, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until vegetables are coated with the seasonings. Pour water into the vegetable mixture, and stir in rice. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer 20 minutes, until the rice is tender.
