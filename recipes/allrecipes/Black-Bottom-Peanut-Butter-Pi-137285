Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Make pie crust as directed on box for One-Crust Baked Shell using 9-inch glass pie plate. Cool on wire rack 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in 1-quart heavy saucepan, mix all fudge layer ingredients. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until chips are melted. Remove from heat; stir until smooth. Reserve 1/4 cup fudge mixture in small microwavable bowl for drizzle; set remaining mixture aside to cool. In large bowl, beat milk, yogurt and pudding mix with electric mixer on high speed about 3 minutes or until smooth and thickened. Set aside. In another small microwavable bowl, microwave 3 tablespoons butter and the peanut butter chips on High 45 seconds. Stir; if necessary, continue to microwave in 10-second increments, stirring after each, until chips are melted and mixture is smooth. On low speed, gradually beat peanut butter mixture into pudding mixture until combined; beat on high speed until filling is smooth and fluffy, scraping side of bowl occasionally. Spread cooled fudge layer mixture evenly in bottom of cooled baked shell. Carefully spoon and spread filling over fudge layer. Sprinkle crushed granola bars evenly over top. Refrigerate until set, 3 to 4 hours. To serve, microwave reserved fudge mixture on High 15 to 20 seconds or until drizzling consistency. Drizzle over top of pie. Cut into wedges to serve. Store in refrigerator.
