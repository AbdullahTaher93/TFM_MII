In a large bowl, combine flour and sugars; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Set aside 1/2 cup for topping. To the remaining crumb mixture, add baking soda and salt. Beat egg, buttermilk and vanilla; add to the crumb mixture and mix well. Pour into a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Combine candy bars, pecans and reserved crumb mixture; sprinkle over the top. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.
