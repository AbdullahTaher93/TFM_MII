In a gallon-size plastic bag, crush crackers into fine crumbs with rolling pin or mallet. Pour crumbs into a shallow dish or plate. In a second shallow dish or plate, beat egg and water. In a third shallow dish or plate, stir together flour, salt and pepper. Dust each pork chop in seasoned flour, then dip in egg mixture, allowing excess to drip off. Then coat in cracker crumbs. Heat vegetable oil in large, nonstick skillet over medium heat until a crumb of coating sizzles when dropped in. Cooking in 2 batches, add chops at least an inch apart and cook 5 minutes, turning once, until crispy golden brown, and no longer pink inside. Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with additional salt while hot, if desired. Serve on buns with toppings as desired.
