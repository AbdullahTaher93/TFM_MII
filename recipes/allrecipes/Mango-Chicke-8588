In a large skillet, brown the chicken breasts in oil till crispy and juices run clear. Add the red onion to the chicken. Saute for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring often. Add the orange juice, and bring to a boil. When the juice boils, add the mango slices. Turn down heat, and simmer for 2 minutes. Dissolve the cornstarch in hot water; stir into sauce. Stir till sauce thickens slightly.
