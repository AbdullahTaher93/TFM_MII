Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Stir the bread crumbs and butter in a small bowl. Stir the farfalle, tuna, peas, tomatoes, Italian seasoning and sauce in a 2-quart round casserole. Sprinkle with the bread crumb mixture. Bake for 30 minutes or until the tuna mixture is hot and bubbling and the bread crumb mixture is golden brown.
