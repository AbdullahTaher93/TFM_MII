Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place sausage links on a baking sheet and bake 25 minutes, or until cooked through. Slice into 1/2 inch slices. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Saute onions until translucent; add garlic and cook 1 minute. Stir in broth, water and potatoes; simmer 15 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add sausage, kale and cream; simmer until heated through and serve.
