Mix ground beef, ketchup, hamburger seasoning and Worcestershire sauce in a bowl. Shape into four patties. Grill patties over medium heat 4-6 minutes per side or until burgers reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees F. Add cheese slices to each burger one minute before cooking is completed, and toast buns on the grill, open side down, about 30 seconds. Serve burgers with bacon slices on toasted buns, and garnish with desired toppings and condiments.
