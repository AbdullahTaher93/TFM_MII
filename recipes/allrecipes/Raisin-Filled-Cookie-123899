In a mixing bowl, cream sugars and butter. Add eggs, beating well after each addition, and vanilla. Combine dry ingredients; add alternately with buttermilk to creamed mixture. Mix well. Chill. For filling, combine cornstarch, flour and brown sugar in a saucepan. Add water, stirring constantly. Add raisins; stir and cook until mixture comes to a boil and is thickened, about 3 minutes. Cool. On a floured surface, roll dough and cut into 3-in. circles. Spoon 2 teaspoons filling on a circle and top with another circle. Pinch edges together and cut slit in top. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Place on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-13 minutes or until lightly browned.
