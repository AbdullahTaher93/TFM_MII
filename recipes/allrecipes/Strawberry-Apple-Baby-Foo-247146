Place apples in a microwave-safe container; cover and cook in the microwave until tender, about 2 minutes. Add strawberries; cover and cook in the microwave for 1 minute more. Transfer apples and strawberries to a blender; pulse until smooth and mixture reaches a consistency similar to yogurt or applesauce.
