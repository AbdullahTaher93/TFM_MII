Heat olive oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat until it begins to smoke. Stir in garlic, onion, ginger, and red pepper flakes. Quickly cook until the onion softens and just begins to brown. Stir in bell pepper, zucchini, and mushrooms; continue cooking until the zucchini softens, about 4 minutes. Stir cornstarch into honey until smooth, then add to vegetables, and simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes. Add shrimp, and cook until they turn pink, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.
