Remove beef pot roast from package; set aside. Measure 3/4 cup of the gravy and place in large skillet; discard any remaining gravy or reserve for other use. Add chili beans, corn, salsa, 1 tablespoon chopped oregano and cinnamon to gravy in skillet; bring to a boil. Meanwhile cut pot roast into 1/4-inch thick slices. Add to skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer 8 to 10 minutes or until beef is heated through, stirring occasionally. Serve pot roast with sauce. Garnish with chopped oregano and oregano sprigs, if desired.
