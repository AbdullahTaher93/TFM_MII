Beat the sour cream and cream cheese together in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Spoon the mixture in an even layer across the bottom of an 8x8-inch pan. Spread the salsa over the cream cheese mixture in one layer. Follow with layers of shrimp and Cheddar cheese. Sprinkle top with chopped tomato, black olives, and green onions. Refrigerate for 2 hours to chill and blend flavors before serving.
