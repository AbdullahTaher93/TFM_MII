In a bowl, whisk 4 tablespoons oil, vinegar, sugar, celery seed and salt until sugar is dissolved; set aside. In a large skillet, saute the vegetables in remaining oil until crisp-tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in vinegar-oil mixture and corned beef. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes or until heated through.
