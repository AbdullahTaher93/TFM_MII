Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place flour in a shallow dish. Gently press veal into flour, shaking off excess. Heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat; pan-fry veal in batches until just browned, 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Transfer veal to a large baking dish. Pour tomatoes and Marsala wine over veal and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, basil, and garlic. Bake in preheated oven until veal is no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes.
