Heat butter and oil in a large skillet over low heat. Season tilapia with salt and pepper, and dredge in flour. Increase heat to medium-high. When wisps of smoke start to rise from the pan, add fish. Cook until well browned on one side, about 3 minutes. Turn fish, and continue cooking until golden brown and cooked though, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer fish to plates or a platter. Pour orange and lemon juices into the skillet. Boil until reduced by about half, 1 to 2 minutes. Drizzle sauce over each fillet, and serve.
