In a small mixing bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm milk. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. In a large bowl, combine the yeast mixture with sunflower seeds, flour and salt; mix well. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Form the dough into a loaf and place it into the prepared pan. Brush the top with almond oil and cover with a damp cloth. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Let cool on a wire rack 20 minutes before slicing.
