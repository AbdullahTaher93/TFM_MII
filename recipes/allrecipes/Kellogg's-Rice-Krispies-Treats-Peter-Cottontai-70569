In a large microwave-safe bowl, heat margarine and marshmallows at HIGH for 3 minutes, stirring after 2 minutes. Stir in KELLOGG S RICE KRISPIES cereal until well coated. Using spatula sprayed with cooking spray or waxed paper, press mixture into a 15 1/2 x 10 1/2 x 1-inch pan coated with cooking spray. To make 7-inch high bunny, shape 3 1/2 cups of mixture for body and 2 cups of mixture for head. Join head and body with toothpicks to create a bunny. Shape remaining mixture into a ball for the cottontail; roll in coconut and attach to the body with a toothpick. Make ears with colored paper. Cut two slits in head to attach ears. Create eyes, nose and buttons with miniature marshmallows and gumdrop halves. Use paper for whiskers.
