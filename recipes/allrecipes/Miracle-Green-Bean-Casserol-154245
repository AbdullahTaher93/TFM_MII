Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix together the soup, sour cream, salad dressing, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Gently stir in the French-cut green beans and the other green beans one can at a time. Fold in 1 cup of the fried onions. Pour the mixture into a casserole dish; cover with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven 35 minutes. Remove the foil and stir the casserole. Top with the remaining cup of the fried onions and bake uncovered for an additional 5 minutes.
