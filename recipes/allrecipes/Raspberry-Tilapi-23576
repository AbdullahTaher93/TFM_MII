Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 11x7 inch baking dish. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the olive oil, raspberry vinegar, honey, mustard and dill weed. Arrange the tilapia filets in a single layer in the prepared baking dish. Pour mixture over the fish filets, coating the filets evenly. Bake in a preheated oven, uncovered for 20 minutes or until fish is flaky with a fork.
