Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice the top off of each bun, saving the tops. Hollow out each bun, leaving a shell. In a medium bowl combine chicken, cream cheese, Pepper Jack cheese, Parmesan cheese, garlic and spinach. Spoon mixture into each bun, packing it tightly; cap with bun tops. Wrap each bun tightly in foil. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes.
