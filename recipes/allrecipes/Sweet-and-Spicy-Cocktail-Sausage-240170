Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with bread slices. Toss bacon in a bowl with brown sugar and red pepper flakes until well-coated. Wrap each cocktail sausage in bacon and place, seam-side down, onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Flip each sausage and continue baking until bacon crisps, 5 to 15 minutes more.
