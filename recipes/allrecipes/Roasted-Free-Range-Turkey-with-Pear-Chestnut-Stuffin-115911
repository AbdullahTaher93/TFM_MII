Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Make stuffing: In a large skillet, melt 4 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add celery and onions; cook, stirring, until translucent, about 10 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons thyme, and sage, parsley, chestnuts, and bread. Add stock, 1/2 cup at a time, until bread becomes moist. Stir in pears; remove from heat. Place remaining 1 stick butter, remaining 2 tablespoons thyme, and 1 teaspoon salt in food processor. Pulse until well combined; set aside. Wash turkey, and pat dry. Place, breast side up, on a roasting rack set in a large roasting pan. Season turkey cavity with remaining 2 teaspoons salt. Fill cavity loosely with stuffing. Tie legs together with kitchen string. Fold neck flap over; secure with skewers. Rub thyme-butter mixture all over turkey. Roast for 2 1/2 hours, basting often. Continue baking 30 to 45 minutes more, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 180 degrees F. If turkey becomes too brown, tent it with aluminum foil. Let cool for 20 to 30 minutes before removing the stuffing and carving.
