Warm oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook 5 minutes on each side, or until browned. Remove to a plate. Reduce heat to medium and add onion and garlic to the same skillet. Cook 5 minutes, or until onion is tender. Stir in mushrooms. Cook 10 minutes, or until mushrooms render their juices. Add wine, artichokes, tomatoes, olives, lemon-pepper seasoning, honey, salt, oregano, cinnamon, and chicken. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook 15 minutes. Uncover and cook 5 minutes, or until sauce thickens slightly and a thermometer inserted in the thickest part registers 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) and juices run clear. Sprinkle with cheese. Serve with lemon for squeezing.
