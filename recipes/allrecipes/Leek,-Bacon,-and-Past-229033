Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Fry diced bacon in a large skillet until browned, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon into a bowl with a slotted spoon, leaving drippings in skillet. Cook and stir leek and cremini mushrooms in the hot bacon drippings until mushrooms are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Return bacon to skillet and stir in bow-tie pasta. Gently mix in sour cream and season with black pepper and parsley. Top with Parmesan cheese to serve.
