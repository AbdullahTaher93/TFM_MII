In a large nonstick frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over moderately low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Increase the heat to moderately high and add another tablespoon of the oil to the pan. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to moderate. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the pan. Stir in the eggplant and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add the salt, cayenne, thyme, tomatoes, and broth. Bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the eggplant is very tender, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the linguine until just done, about 12 minutes. Drain; toss with the sauce.
