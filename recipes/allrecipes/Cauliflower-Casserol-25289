Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring 2 inches of water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add cauliflower, cover, and cook for about 10 minutes. Drain, and place in a 2 quart casserole dish. In a small bowl mix together butter, Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, salt, and red pepper flakes. Sprinkle mixture over cauliflower, and top with Cheddar cheese. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
