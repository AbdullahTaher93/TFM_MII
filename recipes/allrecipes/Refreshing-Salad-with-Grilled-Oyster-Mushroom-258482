Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Toss mushrooms with 2 tablespoons olive oil and a pinch of salt in a bowl. Place in an oven-safe pan. Broil in the preheated oven, checking often, until crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Combine cucumber, tomatoes, onion, green bell pepper, carrots, and avocado in a large serving bowl; toss gently. Pour remaining olive oil and lemon juice over salad; sprinkle salt to taste. Toss to combine. Place mushrooms on top of salad; toss again.
