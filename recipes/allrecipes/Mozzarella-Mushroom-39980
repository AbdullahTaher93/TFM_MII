Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Dip each slice of mushroom in the salad dressing, then into the bread crumbs. Layer the coated mushroom slices into a 2 quart casserole dish. Pour in any remaining dressing (or even more if you like), and sprinkle with any remaining breadcrumbs. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the top. Bake, uncovered, for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
