Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Combine the broth, cream of chicken soup, mushroom soup and soy sauce in a large saucepan and bring to a boil; add chicken, rice and 3/4 cup cashews. Mix well and pour mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup cashews on top. Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 20 to 25 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside.
