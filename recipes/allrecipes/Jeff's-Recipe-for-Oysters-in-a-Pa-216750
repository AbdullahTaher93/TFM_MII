Melt the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the onions, bell pepper, garlic, green onions, and celery in the melted butter until tender, about 10 minutes. Add the oysters to the vegetable mixture and cook until the oysters are cooked through, about 10 minutes more. Stir the Creole seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, and hot pepper sauce into the oysters and vegetables to combine. Scatter the flour over the mixture and stir until thickened. Slowly pour the chicken stock into the mixture, stirring as you add it. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook and stir until the liquid reaches a desired thickness, 10 to 15 minutes.
