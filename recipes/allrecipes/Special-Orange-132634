Trim the stem ends and bottoms off of the oranges, and slice each one into thin rings. Cut a small notch in the peel of each slice so that the slices can be peeled and eaten more easily. Arrange the orange slices in a single layer on serving platters. Drizzle olive oil over each slice and use your fingers to rub it into the oranges. Garnish with a light dusting of paprika and season each slice with a little salt and pepper.
