Melt 1/4 cup butter with olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in hot butter mixture until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir shrimp, wine, diced tomatoes, and seafood seasoning with the onion mixture; cook until shrimp turns pink, about 5 minutes. Stir 1/2 cup butter and lemon juice with the shrimp mixture; cook until the butter melts completely, 1 to 2 minutes. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. Add the zucchini and cook until tender, about 5 minutes more. Top with Parmesan cheese.
