Place cauliflower in a food processor and pulse until chopped into rice-shaped pieces. Combine cauliflower, mushrooms, and olive oil in a skillet over high heat; cook and stir until mushrooms are soft, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix nutritional yeast, black pepper, garlic powder, and minced onion into cauliflower mixture; cook and stir over low heat until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.
