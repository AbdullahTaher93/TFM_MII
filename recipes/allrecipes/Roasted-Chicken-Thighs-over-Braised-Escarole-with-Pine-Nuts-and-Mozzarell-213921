Combine paprika, thyme, garlic powder and pepper. Rub 2 teaspoons oil over chicken. Sprinkle paprika mixture over chicken; place on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F oven 25 to 30 minutes or until chicken is cooked through, basting chicken with pan juices after 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil in a large deep skillet over medium heat. Add garlic; saute 1 minute. Add broth and escarole; simmer, uncovered, 10 to 12 minutes or until escarole is tender and broth is reduced, stirring frequently. Transfer escarole to four shallow bowls; top with 1 cup cheese and chicken. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup cheese and pine nuts over chicken.
