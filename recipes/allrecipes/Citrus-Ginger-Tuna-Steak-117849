In a bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. Pour 1/2 cup marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add tuna steaks. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 2-4 hours. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade. Drain and discard marinade from tuna. Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting grill. Grill tuna, uncovered, for 5-7 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Serve with the reserved marinade.
