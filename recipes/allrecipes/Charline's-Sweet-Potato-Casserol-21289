Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prepare a 9x13 inch baking dish with butter. In a large bowl, mash the sweet potatoes. Mix together with sugar, eggs, 3/4 cup margarine, evaporated milk, nutmeg, cinnamon, marshmallows and coconut. Scoop the mixture into the baking dish. Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until sweet potatoes are tender. In a small bowl, mix the crushed cornflakes, brown sugar, pecans and remaining 3/4 cup margarine. Spread the topping over the baked casserole. Return the casserole to the 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) oven and bake an additional 10 minutes.
