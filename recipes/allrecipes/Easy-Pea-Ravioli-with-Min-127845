Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add shallot; cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic; cook until soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Add peas, wine, 1 cup water, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt; season with pepper. Simmer until liquid has almost evaporated and peas are tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool slightly. Puree pea mixture in a food processor. Brush edges of 10 wrappers with egg. Place 1 tablespoon puree in centers. Top with a dry wrapper; seal edges. Trim using a 3-inch round cutter. Repeat with remaining wrappers and puree. Working in batches, cook ravioli in salted simmering water until they are soft and rise to the surface, about 2 minutes. Meanwhile, melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat; add ravioli to skillet, and cook until butter is frothy and ravioli is coated, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle with mint. Serve immediately (as a first course).
