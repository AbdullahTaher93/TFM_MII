Heat a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir pork in the hot skillet until cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Bring a pot of water to a boil; add prawns and cook until meat is pink. Drain water and slice prawns in half lengthwise. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in vermicelli and return to a boil. Cook until vermicelli is tender yet firm to the bite, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain. Fill a large shallow bowl with warm water. Dip a rice wrapper into the warm water until softened, 3 to 5 seconds. Place rice wrapper on a work surface. Let the rice paper soften for about 30 seconds. Arrange pork, a prawn half, vermicelli noodles, cilantro, spring onions, mint leaves, and romaine lettuce on the bottom third of the wrapper; roll it up halfway, tuck in the sides, and finish rolling the rest of the way. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.
