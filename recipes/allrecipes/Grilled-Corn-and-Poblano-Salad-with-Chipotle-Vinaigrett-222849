Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Cook corn on preheated grill until kernels are cooked through, turning regularly, 10 to 20 minutes; set aside to cool. Cut kernels from the cob and place in a large bowl. Cook poblano chile pepper on the preheated grill until the skin blackens, turning regularly, 5 to 10 minutes; set aside to cool. Peel and seed the poblano. Cut poblano into 1/2-inch pieces; add to the bowl with the corn. Whisk olive oil, lime juice, chipotle pepper, and salt together in a bowl; pour over corn and poblano mixture. Add avocado, cilantro, and red onion to the mixture and gently toss to coat.
