Place the bread cubes into a greased 2-quart shallow baking dish. Beat the soup, milk, eggs and cheese in a medium bowl with a fork or whisk. Pour the milk mixture over the bread cubes. Stir and press the bread cubes into the milk mixture to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. Uncover the baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
