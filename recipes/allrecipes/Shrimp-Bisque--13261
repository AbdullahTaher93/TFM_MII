To make roux: melt 2 cups butter in saucepan over moderate heat. Add 4 cups flour all at ounce, stirring constantly over low heat, for approximately 5 minutes, until roux is a very pale ivory color. Set aside. Using a large stock pot, melt clarified butter and saute shrimp shells until color changes. (To make clarified butter: slowly melt unsalted butter in a saucepan, being careful not to burn. Once thoroughly melted skim off surface of butter, removing milk solids.) Add onion and garlic, cooking until tender, adding more butter if needed. Add paprika, cooking for 10 to 15 minutes. Once paprika is dissolved add tomato paste and mix well. Deglaze pan with brandy; add fish stock and simmer. Thicken soup by adding small amounts of roux, each time mixing thoroughly. Strain soup, pressing shells to extract all liquid. In separate saute pan, saute shrimp in butter and add to soup mixture. Add heated heavy cream, sherry and season to taste using; hot pepper sauce, Worcestershire and seafood seasoning. Stirring well and serve.
