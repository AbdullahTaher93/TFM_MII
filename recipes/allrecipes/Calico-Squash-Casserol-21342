Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large saucepan combine yellow squash, zucchini, onion, green onion, water and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cover and cook over medium heat about 6 minutes. Drain well and set aside. In a medium bowl combine cracker crumbs and butter. Mix well and spread half of the mixture into the bottom of a 9x13 inch casserole dish. In a large bowl combine soup, water chestnuts, carrots, mayonnaise, pimentos, sage, pepper and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Fold in squash mixture and spoon over crumb crust. Sprinkle cheese on top, and then the remaining cracker crumbs. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until firm and heated through.
