Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange bread slices in a single layer on a baking sheet and brush tops with 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil. Bake in preheated oven until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Combine artichoke hearts, olives, tomato, onion, 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese together in a bowl. Spoon artichoke mixture onto the toasted bread slices. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Return bread slices to the oven; bake until artichoke mixture is heated through and Parmesan cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes.
