Place potatoes in a large saucepan with enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Boil 15 minutes, until tender but firm. Drain and mash. Lightly toast bread, and tear into cubes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. In a large bowl, mix mashed potatoes, toasted bread, celery, onion, butter, turkey stock, sage, and savory. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer potato mixture to the prepared baking dish. Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly browned.
