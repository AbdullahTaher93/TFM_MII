In a large nonstick skillet, cook green pepper, onion, salad dressing and Italian seasoning for 5 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Stir in the tomatoes; add fillets. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 10 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Serve with a slotted spoon.
