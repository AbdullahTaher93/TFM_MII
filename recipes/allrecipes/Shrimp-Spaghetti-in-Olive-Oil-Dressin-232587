Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and return spaghetti to the pot. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir spinach, zucchini, squash, pine nuts, and garlic in hot oil until vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer mixture to a bowl. Heat another 1 tablespoon olive oil in the same skillet over medium heat; cook and stir shrimp and 2 teaspoons lemon juice until shrimp are bright pink and centers are opaque, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Combine remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 teaspoons lemon juice, parsley, and red pepper flakes in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Stir vegetable mixture, shrimp, and olive oil mixture into spaghetti until combined.
