Preheat barbecue grill. In a bowl, mix apricot nectar, orange juice, honey, mustard, and horseradish. Rinse meat and place in a plastic food bag; ad 1/3 cup of the apricot sauce. Seal bag and let stand for about 15 minutes, turning occasionally. Set remaining apricot sauce aside. Meanwhile, cut apricots in half and discard pits. Lift steaks from bag; discard marinade. Place steaks on grid over a solid bed of hot coals (you can hold your hand at grill level for only 2 to 3 seconds) or over high heat on a gas grill. Place apricot halves on grill, brushing with some of the reserved apricot sauce. Close lid on gas grill. cook steak, turning once, until done to your liking and red to pink in center; cut to test (8 to 10 minutes-rare). cook apricots, turning once, until hot and lightly browned (about 5 minutes); as apricots are cooked, transfer to a platter and keep warm. Heat remaining apricot sauce in a microwave-safe bowl or pitcher in a microwave oven on high power (100%) or in a pan over medium-high heat just until boiling. Season steaks to taste with salt and pepper, then serve with hot grilled apricots and sauce.
