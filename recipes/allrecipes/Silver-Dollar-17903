Preheat an outdoor grill for medium high heat. Place a leaf of cabbage on a piece of tin foil. Form ground beef into four equal patties and place a patty on the leaf of cabbage. Top with onion, carrot and potato and season with salt and pepper to taste. Place a second cabbage leaf over the potatoes. Top with another sheet of foil and seal all the edges. Repeat this with the 3 other patties. Grill over medium high heat for 25 to 35 minutes, or to desired doneness.
