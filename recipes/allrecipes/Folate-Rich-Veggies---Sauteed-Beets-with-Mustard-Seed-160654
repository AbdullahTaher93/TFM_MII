Cover beets with water in medium pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer 20 minutes or until just tender. Drain, cool, peel, and chop beets into 1/2-inch cubes (quarter baby beets, if using). Heat oil in large skillet over high heat. When it begins to smoke, add mustard seeds and cover pan with lid or splatter screen. When they have stopped sputtering, stir in peppers. Add beets and salt. Toss, cover, reduce heat to low, and cook another 6 to 8 minutes to allow flavors to blend. Toss with cilantro and lemon juice (to taste).
