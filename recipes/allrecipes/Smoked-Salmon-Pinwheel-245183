Mix cream cheese and dill together in a bowl. Spread about 1/4 cup cream cheese mixture onto each tortilla. Sprinkle 1/4 cup salmon over cream cheese layer. Arrange 3 to 4 spinach leaves and 4 red bell pepper strips over salmon layer. Roll tortilla tightly around filling and wrap securely in plastic wrap; refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours. Remove plastic wrap and cut rolls into 1-inch pieces.
