Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Combine ground beef, ground pork, onion soup mix, barbecue sauce, chopped onion, and garlic salt in a large bowl. Lightly form mixture into 9 patties. Cook on preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 5 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (72 degrees C).
