Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Combine oats, honey, wheat germ, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Spread oat mixture on a large rimmed baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven, turning once, until lightly toasted, about 20 minutes. Stir in coconut and dried fruit. Continue baking until coconut is lightly toasted, about 10 minutes. Cool completely before transferring to an airtight container, about 15 minutes.
