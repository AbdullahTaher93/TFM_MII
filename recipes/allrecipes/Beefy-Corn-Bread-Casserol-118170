In a large skillet, cook the beef, onion and peppers over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain and set aside. In a small bowl, combine the corn bread mix, salt, baking soda, corn, milk, oil and eggs. Pour half in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Layer with half of the cheese and all of the beef mixture. Top with remaining cheese. Carefully spread remaining batter over top. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.
