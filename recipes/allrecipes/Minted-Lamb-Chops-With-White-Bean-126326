Coat a broiler-pan rack with cooking spray. Preheat the broiler. On a cutting board, finely chop the anchovies. Sprinkle with the oil, 1 tablespoon of the fresh mint or 1 teaspoon dried, and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper, then mash to a paste with the flat side of a chef's knife or a fork. Place the chops on the prepared rack and rub the anchovy paste over both sides of the chops. Let stand at room temperature Meanwhile, in a medium nonstick skillet, combine the tomatoes and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, over medium-high heat for 2 minutes, or until the tomatoes begin to give up their juices. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 3 minutes, or until the tomatoes are very soft. Stir in the beans, broth, salt, 2 tablespoons of the remaining fresh mint or 2 teaspoons dried, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes to blend the flavors. While the beans are simmering, broil the lamb chops 4 inches from the heat for 8 minutes per side, or until a thermometer inserted in the center registers 145 degrees F for medium-rare. To serve, evenly divide the bean mixture among 4 plates and top each with a lamb chop. Garnish with the mint, if using.
