Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl combine the cream of mushroom soup, cream of chicken soup, chile peppers, milk and sour cream; mix until well blended. Place a layer of tortilla strips in the bottom of a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Layer as follows: 1/2 of the soup mixture, 1/2 of the chicken, 1/2 of the shredded cheese. Repeat until ingredients are all used, ending with a layer of shredded cheese. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes covered, then remove cover and bake an additional 15 minutes.
