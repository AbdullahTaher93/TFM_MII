Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Spread beets onto a sheet of aluminum foil. Drizzle olive oil over beets and season with salt. Fold foil over beets, sealing the edges together to create a packet. Cook on the preheated grill, turning once, until beets are tender, about 30 minutes. Carefully open packet and top beets with feta cheese and chives. Close packet again and grill until cheese melts, about 5 minutes.
