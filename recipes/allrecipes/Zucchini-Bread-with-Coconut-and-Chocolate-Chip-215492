Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Beat the eggs in a large bowl until frothy. Stir the vegetable oil, sugar, and zucchini into the eggs. Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl; stir into the zucchini mixture until combined. Fold the coconut and chocolate chips into the resulting mixture; pour into the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
