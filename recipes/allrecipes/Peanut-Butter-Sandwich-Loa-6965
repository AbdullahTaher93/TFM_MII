Preheat oven to 350 degree F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9 x 5 inch loaf pan with vegetable cooking spray. Combine flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a bowl. Add the peanut butter, and mix in with a pastry blender. Add milk to beaten egg, and pour this mixture into the flour mixture. Stir until thoroughly combined; do not beat. Spread batter into prepared pan. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes. Cool before slicing.
