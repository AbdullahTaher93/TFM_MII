Mix cream cheese, sour cream and mayonnaise together. Spread the mixture onto the bottom of a 12-inch round pizza pan. Sprinkle the shrimp on top of the cream cheese mixture, and then evenly pour the seafood cocktail sauce over the shrimp. Sprinkle cheese, chopped pepper, green onions and tomatoes to finish. Refrigerate until you are ready to serve.
