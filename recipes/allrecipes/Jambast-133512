Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt, then add the pasta, cook until al dente and drain. While the pasta works, heat a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add the EVOO, 2 turns of the pan, and the sausage and brown for about 4 minutes to render the fat and crisp the sausage. Transfer the sausage to a plate with a slotted spoon. Add the butter, garlic, chile, bell pepper, celery and onion to the skillet and cook for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, add the flour and cook for 2 minutes, then whisk in the beer and cook until it evaporates, about 2 minutes. Add the broth, tomatoes, hot sauce and thyme. Bring the liquid to a bubble and stir in the chicken and shrimp. Cover and cook for 7 minutes, until the chicken is cooked and the shrimp are opaque and firm. Stir in the cream and add the pasta. Ladle up the jambasta and top with the scallions and the reserved crispy andouille sausage.
