In food processor or blender, combine roasted peppers and vinegar; whirl until pureed. Stir in cilantro, then add chili to taste. Set aside (if made ahead, cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days). Oil and preheat barbecue grill. Season ground beef to taste with salt and pepper; shape into 4 equal patties, each about 3/4 inch thick. Arrange patties on greased grill 4 to 6 inches above a solid bed of hot coals (you can hold your hand at grill level for only 2 to 3 seconds) or over high heat on a gas grill. Close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning once, until patties are well browned and cooked to your taste (8 to 10 minutes for medium); cut to test. When patties are almost done, toast rolls on grill, cut sides down, for 1 to 2 minutes. Top each patty with a slice of cheese. Place cheese-topped patties on rolls; add red pepper sauce and onions to taste.
