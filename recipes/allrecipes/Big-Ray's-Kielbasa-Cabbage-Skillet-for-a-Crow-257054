Place potatoes in a microwave-safe bowl; cook in microwave until partially tender, about 8 minutes. Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a Dutch oven or large cast iron skillet over medium heat; cook and stir sausage and onions until browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer sausage and onions to a bowl. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the same Dutch oven; cook and stir cabbage until tender, about 5 minutes. Combine tomatoes, sugar, and paprika in a bowl; pour over cabbage and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and add potatoes and sausage-onion mixture. Cover Dutch oven and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 40 minutes.
