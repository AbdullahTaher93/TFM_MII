Season pork chops with seasoned salt and lemon-pepper seasoning. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add seasoned pork chops; cook until golden, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Pour 1/2 cup wine and water over the pork chops; bring to a simmer. Cook until chops are no longer pink in the center and most of the liquid has evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer chops to serving plates. Stir oyster mushrooms, green bell pepper, onion, and garlic into the skillet. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring often, until onion softens and all the liquid evaporates, 3 to 5 minutes. Add remaining 1/2 cup wine, tomatoes, and butter. Cook and stir until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve mushroom and tomato mixture over pork chops.
