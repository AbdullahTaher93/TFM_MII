Make a batch of Basic Brownies. Do not cut and let cool completely before adding the next layer. Second Layer: Zap the cream cheese in the microwave for about 30 seconds to soften it. Add the Splenda, mint extract and vanilla extract. If you want it to be a bit green add a couple of drops of green food color. Careful, a little goes a long way. Evenly spread the cream cheese over the brownies. Pop in the freezer while you make the top layer. Third layer. In a microwave safe bowl add 1 chocolate square and 1/2 Tbsp butter. Zap for 30 seconds and stir for 30 seconds. Zap for 30 seconds and stir for 30 seconds. Continue until melted. The pauses are important so that the chocolate does not get too hot and burn. Mix together the milk, extract and Splenda. Add to the chocolate. Stir well. It resists at first put then stirs in just fine. You may need to zap it again if it is too thick. Pour evenly over the cream cheese layer tipping the pan to spread evenly. Cover and refrigerate for 3 hours. These are best when they are served quite cold. They are just so-so when eaten before they are fully chilled. Cut into 16 brownies.
