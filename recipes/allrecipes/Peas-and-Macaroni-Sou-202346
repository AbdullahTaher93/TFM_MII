Heat the olive oil in a soup pot over medium-low heat. Stir in the minced garlic and onion; cook and stir until soft, about 5 minutes. Turn heat to medium; stir in canned peas, chicken broth, Italian seasoning, parsley, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer. Cook for 40 minutes with the lid slightly ajar. Stir pasta into soup; cook at a strong simmer until pasta is tender, about 12 minutes.
