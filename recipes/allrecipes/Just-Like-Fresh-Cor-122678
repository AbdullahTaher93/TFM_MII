Place butter in a roasting pan; place in a 325 degrees F oven until melted. Stir in corn and cream. Bake, uncovered, for 75 minutes or until the corn is tender, stirring occasionally. Immediately place the roaster in ice water to cool quickly, stirring frequently. Transfer corn to heavy-duty plastic freezer bags; freeze. May be frozen for up to 1 month. To serve, reheat in a microwave or on the stove.
