Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place potato sticks in a large bowl; pour olive oil over potatoes. Crush chervil, dill, rosemary, onion powder, and garlic powder together with a mortar and pestle; sprinkle herb mixture over potatoes and toss to coat completely. Spread potatoes on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until tender and browned, about 45 minutes.
