Pour kidney beans with liquid, crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, vegetarian beef crumbles, and garlic into a slow cooker. Grind vegetarian bacon bits into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle or food processor. Blend onion, lime, and serrano pepper together in a blender until a paste forms. Stir paste and ground bacon bits into kidney bean mixture. Cook on Low until heated through, about 1 hour. Add chili powder, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, oregano, curry powder, and salt. Cook on Low for 4 hours.
