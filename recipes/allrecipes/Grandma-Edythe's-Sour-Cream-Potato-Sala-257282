Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 25 minutes. Drain. Cool until easily handled, about 10 minutes. Peel and cut into bite-size pieces. Combine potatoes, pickles, and chopped onions in a large bowl. Mix mayonnaise, sour cream, and pickle juice together in a small mixing bowl. Pour over potatoes. Gently toss until potatoes are coated with dressing. Add chopped eggs; gently mix. Season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate 8 hours or overnight for best flavor.
