Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Take 1 slice of bread and spread 1 teaspoon of butter on one side. Turn the bread over and place a slice of cheese on the bread. Place a frankfurter diagonally on the cheese. Fold bread corner to corner around the frankfurter. Insert a toothpick to hold together. Repeat steps for the remaining frankfurters. Bake in a preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes or until golden brown.
