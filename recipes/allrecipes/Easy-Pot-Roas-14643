Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Score roast on top and sides, and place in a medium sized oven bag. Combine water, soup mix, and Worcestershire sauce; pour over roast. Arrange vegetables around meat. Place oven bag on a roasting pan. Place roast in oven, and immediately reduce heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Bake for 1 1/2 hours for medium well done, or adjust time for desired doneness.
