Spoon sour cream into a 1-quart resealable plastic freezer bag; press to seal and chill. Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, medium-high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above cooking grate only 3 to 4 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). While grill heats, cut peppers in half lengthwise through stems. Scoop out seeds and veins. In a bowl, mix cheese, tomatoes, onion, cilantro, and salt. Spoon mixture evenly into pepper halves, pressing it into hollows. Place peppers, cheese side up, on cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook until blistered and slightly charred on the bottoms, 3 to 5 minutes. With a wide spatula and tongs, transfer peppers to a clean platter. Snip off a corner of the chilled sour cream bag to make a 3/4-in. opening; squeeze sour cream equally over the hot peppers. Serve immediately.
