Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F for glass dish). In large bowl, combine flour, oats, brown sugar, and butter; mix well. (Mixture will be crumbly.) Reserve 1/2 cup oat mixture and press remainder on bottom of 13x9-inch baking pan. Bake 10 minutes. Pour sweetened condensed milk evenly over crust. Sprinkle with nuts and chocolate chips; top with reserved oat mixture; press down firmly. Bake 25 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool. Cut into bars. Store leftovers covered at room temperature.
