PREHEAT oven to 350 degrees F. COMBINE sugar and water in medium, heavy-duty saucepan; cook over low heat, stirring constantly, for 3 to 4 minutes or until dissolved. Increase heat to medium-high; boil, without stirring, for about 15 minutes or until caramel colored. Quickly pour over bottom and sides of 12 six-ounce custard cups (if syrup hardens, soften over low heat). PLACE evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, cream cheese, butter, eggs and vanilla extract in blender; cover. Blend until smooth. Pour mixture into prepared custard cups.

Cool in pan(s) on wire rack(s) for 20 minutes. Chill for several hours or overnight. Run knife around rims; gently shake to loosen. Invert onto serving dishes.
