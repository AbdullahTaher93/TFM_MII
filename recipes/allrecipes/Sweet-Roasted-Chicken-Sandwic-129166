Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Mix the mustard and honey together and season to taste. Enlarge the hollow left by the bone in each chicken thigh, cutting to open them out; press to flatten them a little. Place the thighs, smooth side up, in a lightly oiled baking dish or small roasting pan. Set aside about 2 tablespoons of the honey and mustard mixture, and spread the remainder over the top of the chicken thighs. Roast until the juices run clear when a thigh is pierced with a knife, 12 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, split open the buns and toast them. Place a lettuce leaf on the bottom half of each bun, top with the mango slices and sprinkle with the scallions, if using. Spread the reserved honey and mustard mixture over the underside of the top halves. Put the roasted chicken thighs on top of the mango and scallions, then top with the remaining lettuce. Put the tops of the buns on and press the sandwiches gently together.
