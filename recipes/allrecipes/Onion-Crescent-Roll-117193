In a large mixing bowl, cream 1/2 cup butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Dissolve yeast in warm milk; add to creamed mixture. Add the onion, salt and 1 cup flour; beat until blended. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Roll each portion into a 12-in. circle; cut each circle into 12 wedges. Roll up wedges from the wide end and place point side down 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Curve ends down to form crescents. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 400 degrees F for 9-11 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from pans to wire racks. Melt remaining butter; brush over warm rolls.
