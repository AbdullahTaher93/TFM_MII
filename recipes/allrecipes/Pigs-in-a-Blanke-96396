Heat oven to 350 degrees. Cook sausage according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda; mix well. Add buttermilk, melted butter and eggs; mix just until dry ingredients are moistened. Heat a nonstick griddle or large skillet over medium heat until hot. (If griddle is not nonstick, coat with cooking spray or a thin film of vegetable oil.) Drop batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto hot griddle. Cook until some of the bubbles that appear on the pancake surface have popped and bottom is golden brown. Turn; continue cooking until bottom is golden brown. Transfer pancakes as they are cooked to a wire cooling rack. Coat a 13 x 9-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Roll up cooked sausage link in each pancake; place seam side down in prepared dish. Cover with foil; bake about 15 minutes or until heated through. Place powdered sugar in a sifter or strainer; shake evenly over pancake rolls. Serve immediately with syrup.
