In a saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch and salt. Stir in water, corn syrup and raisins. Cook and stir until bubbly; cook and stir 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat; stir in lemon juice and butter. Pour filling into a pastry-lined pie plate. (Filling will be thin.) Cover with the top crust; seal and flute edges. Cut slits in the top. Bake at 425 degrees F for 10 minutes. Reduce temperature to 375 degrees F; bake 20 minutes more or until crust is golden. Serve with whipped cream if desired.
