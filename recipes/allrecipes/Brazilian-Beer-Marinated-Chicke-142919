In a shallow dish, mix the garlic, ginger, onion, paprika, salt, black pepper, caraway seeds, green pepper, mustard, beer and oil. Add the chicken, cover and refrigerate for 4 hours, turning a few times. Light a grill. Remove the chicken from the marinade and grill over high heat until nicely browned and just cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to a platter and brush with the melted butter. Scatter the cilantro over the top and serve with lime wedges.
