Place 2 cups of crushed Chips Deluxe Cookies into a mixing bowl and add melted margarine. Toss to coat thoroughly. Place mixture into a 9-inch pie dish and form a crust by pressing it onto the bottom and sides of the pan. Set aside. In a medium size mixing bowl, combine the pie filling, ice cream and 1 cup Chips Deluxe pieces. Mix well. Spread mixture into pie crust. Top with whipped topping and freeze until ready to serve. Place additional cookie halves on top of pie as decoration.
