Place garlic clove on a cutting board and sprinkle with salt. Mash with the side of a chef's knife into a smooth paste. Transfer to a blender. Reserving 1/2 cup of cucumbers for garnish, add the remaining cucumbers to the blender along with buttermilk, mint leaves, vinegar and ice cubes; blend until smooth. Taste and adjust seasonings with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls and garnish with the reserved cucumbers and mint sprigs.
