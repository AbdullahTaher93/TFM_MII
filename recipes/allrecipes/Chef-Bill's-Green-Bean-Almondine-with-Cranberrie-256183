Heat butter in a small skillet over medium heat until it starts to brown and smell nutty, 3 to 5 minutes. Add green beans, garlic powder, and salt; cook and stir until tender, about 2 minutes. Add almonds and cranberries; toss lightly to combine. Pour orange juice over green beans and season with white pepper.
