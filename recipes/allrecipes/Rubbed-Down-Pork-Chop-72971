In a bowl, mix the garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Rub pork chops on both sides with the garlic powder mixture and the minced garlic. In a skillet over medium heat, mix the Worcestershire sauce and 1/4 cup water. Place pork chops in the skillet, and cook 10 minutes. Turn chops in the skillet, and pour in remaining 1/4 cup water. Mix in the onion and mushrooms, and continue cooking 10 minutes, or to desired doneness.
