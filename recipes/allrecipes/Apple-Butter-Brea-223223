Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 8x4x2-inch loaf pan. Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, and cloves in a bowl. Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl until smooth. Add the egg and apple butter; continue beating until smooth. Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the raisins and walnuts; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour into prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
