Heat oil in a large nonstick pot over medium heat. Add garlic; cook and stir until golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Add ground chicken; cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir flour and curry powder into the pot, mixing until well-blended with the chicken. Add pumpkin, onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and carrot. Stir in water, chicken broth powder, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce; mix until curry is well-combined. Cover pot. Reduce heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until curry is thick and stew-like, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
