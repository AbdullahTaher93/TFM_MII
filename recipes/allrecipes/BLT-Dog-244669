Mix tomato, bacon, pickles, mayonnaise, and sour cream together in a bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for flavors to blend, about 4 hours. Bring a pot of water to a boil and cook hot dogs until warmed through, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain. Place a hot dog in each bun and top each with tomato-bacon mixture. Garnish each with lettuce and green onion.
