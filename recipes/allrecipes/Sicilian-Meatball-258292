Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Coat the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish with pasta sauce. Place ground sirloin, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, crushed crackers, egg, garlic, parsley, allspice, oregano, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix by hand until combined. Form mixture into meatballs slightly larger than golf balls. Arrange meatballs over sauce in the baking dish. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until juices run clear, about 30 minutes. Uncover and continue baking until meatballs start to brown, 5 to 7 minutes.
