Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lay the pancetta on a baking sheet, cover with parchment paper and place another baking sheet on top. Bake for 15 minutes, or until browned. Blot dry. Meanwhile, add the eggs to a sauce-pan of boiling water; cook for exactly 6 minutes. Transfer to an ice water bath for 10 minutes, then peel. Scoop the soft-cooked yolk out of 1 egg and transfer to a blender. Add the vinegar, water and mustard and puree. With the machine on, slowly add the two oils and blend. Season with salt and pepper. In a small skillet, cook the bacon over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until just crisp. Drain on paper towels. In a bowl, toss the romaine with 1/2 cup of the dressing, season with salt and pepper and mound on 4 plates. Arrange the avocados, tomatoes and chicken on the plates; drizzle with 1/4 cup of the dressing. Scatter the bacon and blue cheese on top. Carefully slice off 1 end of each of the remaining eggs to expose the yolks; set the eggs in the center of the salad. Top with the pancetta and serve with the remaining dressing.
