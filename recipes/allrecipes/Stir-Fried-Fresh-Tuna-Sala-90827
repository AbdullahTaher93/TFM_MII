In a small bowl, stir together mirin, vinegar, soy sauce, and horseradish; set aside. Rinse fish and pat dry. Cut fish into 1/2-inch by 3-inch strips; set aside. Mound lettuce equally on 4 dinner plates. In a wide frying pan or wok, stir sesame seeds over medium heat until golden (3 to 5 minutes). Pour seeds out of pan and set aside. Increase heat to high, then pour oil into pan and swirl to coat pan bottom. Add ginger and stir-fry until lightly browned (about 30 seconds). Add tuna and stir-fry just until fish becomes opaque, 2 to 3 minutes (cut to test). Add dressing and remove pan from heat. Spoon a fourth of the fish and dressing over lettuce on each plate. Sprinkle with green onions, radishes, and toasted sesame seeds.
