Coat a large, non-stick frying pan or griddle with cooking spray. Chutney: Combine all ingredients in a medium saucepan. Bring to boil, reduce heat to simmer, and cook uncovered for 30 minutes. Stir occasionally toward the end as sauce thickens. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. Burgers: Combine all burger ingredients in a large mixing bowl and stir until well-blended. Form into 6 four-ounce patties 1/2 inch thick. Heat frying pan or griddle over medium heat until hot. Add patties and cook approximately 5 minutes per side or until no longer pink in the middle. Serve with 1/4 cup Super Fruit Chutney.
