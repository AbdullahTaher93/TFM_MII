Heat the Melt(R) over medium-low heat in a large stock pot. Add the carrots, celery, onion, garlic and peppers and cook until softened but not browned, about 7 minutes. Add the white wine and saute until the liquid cooks off down to about a 1/4 of a cup. Stir in the tomatoes, lentils, broth, water and all of the spices. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer 45 minutes. Stir in the balsamic vinegar and add the chard, cooking until the greens are wilted but still bright in color.
