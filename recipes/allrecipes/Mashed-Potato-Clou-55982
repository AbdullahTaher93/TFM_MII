In an 8- to 10-quart pan over high heat, bring 1 1/2 quarts water to a boil. Peel potatoes and cut into 1-inch chunks. Add potatoes and garlic to boiling water; cover and return to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and simmer until potatoes mash easily, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain and pour into the bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer fitted with a wire whisk, or return to pan. Add butter and 1/2 cup cream. Beat with electric mixer on medium speed, or by hand with a heavy-duty whisk (Berger's technique), just until smooth. If mixture is stiffer than you like, beat in more cream until potatoes reach desired consistency. Add salt and pepper to taste. Scrape into a serving bowl.
