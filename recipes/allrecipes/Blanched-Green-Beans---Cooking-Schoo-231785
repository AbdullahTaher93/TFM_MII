Bring water to a boil in a large pot; add salt. Cook green beans in boiling water until bright green and slightly tender, about 30 seconds. Immediately transfer beans to an ice-water bath for 2 to 3 minutes until cold to stop the cooking process and chill completely. Transfer beans to a baking sheet lined with paper towels and pat dry.
