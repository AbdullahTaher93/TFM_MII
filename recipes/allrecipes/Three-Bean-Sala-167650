Put a large saucepan of lightly salted water on to boil. Fill a large bowl half full with cold water. Whisk vinegar, corn syrup, mustard, oil, salt and pepper in a large bowl until blended. Add onion and black-eyed peas (or chickpeas); toss to coat. Cook lima beans (or edamame) in the boiling water until tender, about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and refresh in the cold water. Pat dry and add to the onion mixture. Cook green beans in the boiling water until just tender, 3 to 6 minutes. Drain and refresh in the cold water. Pat dry and add to the salad along with parsley; toss well. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
