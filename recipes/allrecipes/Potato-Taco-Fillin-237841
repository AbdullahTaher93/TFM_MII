Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until some of the fat renders, 1 to 2 minutes; add potatoes, vinegar, garlic, and thyme. Continue to cook the beef mixture, stirring frequently, until the beef is completely browned and crumbly and the potato is soft, 12 to 15 minutes more.
