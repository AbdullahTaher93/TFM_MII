Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line 2 baking sheets with aluminum foil. Place 2 sheets of lavash on each baking sheet. Spread 1 1/2 teaspoon tomato paste over each sheet of lavash. Lay about 6 slices of salami over the tomato paste. Scatter cherry tomatoes, red onion, and black olives on top. Cover with mozzarella cheese. Broil lavash in batches in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes.
