Place the chipotles in a bowl and cover with very hot water. Allow to soak for 3 minutes; drain. Remove the stems and seeds from the peppers and discard. Cut the peppers into thin strips. Heat the oil in a large skillet over low heat. Cook the garlic in the oil until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the peppers and the lime juice; simmer 5 minutes; season with the salt. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and allow to cool. Store in the refrigerator in an airtight container.
