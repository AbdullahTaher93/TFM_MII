Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Boil lamb in a pot of water, breaking into small chunks with a spoon, until fully cooked, 5 to 10 minutes. Skim fat from water using a spoon and drain water from meat. Mix cooked lamb, cabbage, onion, egg, allspice, cardamom, turmeric, sumac, salt, and pepper together in bowl; roll into 1 1/2-inch balls. Arrange meatballs on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are cooked through and browned on the outside, 25 to 30 minutes.
