Place the chicken breasts into a slow cooker. Whisk the cream of chicken soup, cream of mushroom soup, sherry, garlic, celery flakes, and paprika in a mixing bowl. Stir in the Parmesan cheese and mushroom pieces; pour over the chicken. Cook on Low for 8 hours until the chicken is tender, and the sauce has reduced slightly.
