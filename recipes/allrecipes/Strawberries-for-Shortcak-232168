Combine strawberries with dark corn syrup in a saucepan over medium heat, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Stir until mixture simmers and strawberries give up their juice, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in sugar and lemon juice until sugar has dissolved. Let cool to room temperature and chill before serving.
