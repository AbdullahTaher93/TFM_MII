Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray large cookie sheet with cooking spray. Stir together crabmeat, cream cheese, onions and garlic salt. Unroll both cans of dough and separate into 16 triangles. Cut each triangle in half lengthwise to make 32 triangles. Place 1 teaspoon crab mixture on center of each triangle about 1 inch from short side of triangle. Fold short ends of each triangle over filling; pinch sides to seal. Roll up. Place on cookie sheet. Stir together egg yolk and water. Brush egg mixture over snacks. Sprinkle with sesame seed. Discard any remaining egg mixture. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm snacks with sweet-and-sour sauce.
