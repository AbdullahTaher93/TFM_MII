Combine butter and onion in a 2-quart, microwave-safe casserole. Cover, and microwave on High for 2 minutes. Stir in flour until well blended, then stir in mushrooms, wine, salt, pepper, scallops, bay leaf, and lemon juice. Recover, and microwave on High for 6 minutes, or until the scallops turn opaque. Remove and discard the bay leaf. In a small bowl, stir together the milk and egg yolk until combined. Stir the hot liquid from the scallops, about 1 tablespoon at a time into the milk mixture. When combined, stir the sauce back into the scallops. Cover, and microwave on High for 2 minutes, then stir, and microwave for another 3 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley before serving.
