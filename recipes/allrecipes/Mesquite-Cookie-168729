Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Whisk together the mesquite flour, all-purpose flour, and cinnamon; set aside. Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a bowl until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
