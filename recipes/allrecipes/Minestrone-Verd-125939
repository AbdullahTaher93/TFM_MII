Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the leeks, celery, minced garlic, oregano, pepper, and salt. Cook, stirring frequently, for 4 minutes, or until the vegetables begin to soften. Add the water, broth, Swiss chard, lima beans, and pasta. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 8 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and the pasta is al dente. Meanwhile, coarsely chop the remaining garlic clove, then mince it together with the parsley. Stir the garlic-parsley mixture and the peas into the soup. Cover and cook for 5 minutes, or until the peas are heated through. Ladle the soup into 4 bowls and top each with 1 teaspoon of the cheese.
