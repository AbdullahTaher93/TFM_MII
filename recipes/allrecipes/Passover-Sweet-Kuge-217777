Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 9x13 baking dish. Moisten the matzo farfel by placing in a large bowl, stirring in enough cold water to cover, and rinsing immediately in a colander set in the sink. Mix in beaten eggs, sugar, salt, and margarine until thoroughly combined, and lightly mix in the apples, bananas, and 1/4 cup of ground walnuts. Spoon the kugel into the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup of ground walnuts. Bake in the preheated oven until the kugel is browned and set in the center, about 1 hour. A toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean.
