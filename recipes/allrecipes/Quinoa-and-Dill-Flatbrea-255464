Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9-inch round pans with cooking spray. Pulse quinoa in a food processor until ground into flour, 3 to 5 minutes. Combine quinoa flour, water, olive oil, dill, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Whisk, adding more water if needed, until combined. Divide dough evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven until tops are golden, about 20 minutes. Cut into wedges.
