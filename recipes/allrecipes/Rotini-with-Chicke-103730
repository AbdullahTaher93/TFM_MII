In an 8-quart pot, cook rotini according to package directions. Drain and rinse with hot water; keep warm. Heat olive oil in the same pot used for pasta. Add chicken, onion, garlic and salt. Saute over high heat 4 minutes, stirring frequently. Add Nakano(R) Seasoned Rice Vinegar -- Roasted Garlic and basil. Continue to cook on high 2-3 minutes or until most of the vinegar has evaporated. Stir in stewed tomatoes; heat through. Chicken should be very juicy. Serve over rotini. If desired, sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh-ground black pepper.
