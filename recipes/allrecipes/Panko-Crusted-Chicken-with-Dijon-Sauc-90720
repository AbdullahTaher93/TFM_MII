In a medium-size shallow bowl, blend 2 tablespoons of the mustard with vinegar and garlic. In another shallow bowl, stir together panko, cheese, and parsley. Rinse chicken and pat dry. Turn each piece in mustard mixture to coat; then roll in panko mixture, pressing firmly to coat chicken well on all sides. Arrange chicken in a single layer in a lightly oiled 9- by 13-inch baking pan; drizzle evenly with butter. Bake in a 500 degrees F oven until coating is golden and meat in thickest part is no longer pink; cut to test (about 15 minutes). To make sauce: In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, remaining mustard, and mustard seeds. Serve chicken pieces whole or cut crosswise into thick slices. Accompany with sauce.
