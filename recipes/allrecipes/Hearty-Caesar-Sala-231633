Blend mayonnaise, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, egg, black pepper, and seasoned salt in a blender until smooth. Refrigerate for flavors to blend. Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels and crumble. Mix romaine lettuce, bacon, onion, mushrooms, and croutons in a large bowl. Pour dressing over salad; toss to coat.
