Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease or spray 2 large baking sheets. In a mixing bowl with electric mixer, beat sugar and butter on moderately high speed until light and fluffy. Add vanilla and eggs and mix until blended. The mixture will look curdled. Add flour, cinnamon, salt and orange juice and mix until incorporated. Mix in dates, raisins and walnuts. Divide dough into 4 portions. Shape each into 12 x 2 x 1/2-inch logs. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until lightly browned. Logs will feel soft in the center, but will firm up as they cool. Cool 15 minutes. Slice diagonally into 3/4-inch bars. Dust with powdered sugar.
