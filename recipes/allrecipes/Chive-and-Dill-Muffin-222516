Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups. Whisk flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, salt, baking soda, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Stir in chives and dill. Whisk yogurt, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl; add to the dry ingredients and stir until just blended into a batter. Pour 1/3 cup batter into each prepared muffin cup. Bake in preheated oven until golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing. Serve warm.
