Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Wrap each chicken breast in 2 strips of bacon and place in a glass 9x13 inch baking dish. In a small bowl, mix the sour cream and soup. Cover the chicken with the sour cream/soup mixture and bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 40 to 50 minutes or until slightly brown on top. Let cool and serve on top of hot, cooked rice if desired.
