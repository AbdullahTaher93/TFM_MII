Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, and set aside. Lightly toast bread, and place individual slices on serving plates. Arrange lettuce leaves on top of each slice, followed by a chicken breast. Drizzle an 1/8 of a cup of Roquefort dressing over each open sandwich, and top with 2 slices of bacon.
