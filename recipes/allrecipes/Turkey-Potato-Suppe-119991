In a large saucepan, bring the water, butter and salt to a boil. Remove from the heat; stir in potato flakes. Let stand for 30 seconds. Whip with a fork. Stir in eggs. Spoon the potatoes onto the bottom and up the sides of a greased 8-in. square baking dish, forming a shell. In a bowl, combine soup, mayonnaise, lemon juice and curry. Stir in turkey and broccoli. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes. Sprinkle with almonds if desired. Bake 15-20 minutes longer or until potato edges are golden brown and filling is heated through. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
