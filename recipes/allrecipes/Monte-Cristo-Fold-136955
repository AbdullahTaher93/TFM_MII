Heat oven to 375 degrees F. In medium bowl, mix ham, turkey and cheese. Separate dough into 8 biscuits. Press or roll each to form 6- to 7-inch round. Place slightly less than 1/3 cup ham mixture on one side of each biscuit round. Fold dough over filling; press edges to seal. Place on ungreased cookie sheet. In small bowl, beat egg, milk, cinnamon and nutmeg. Brush over tops of filled biscuits. Bake 12 to 19 minutes or until golden brown. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Serve with jam.
