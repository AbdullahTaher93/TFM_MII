Place the cucumber chunks and slices in a large bowl with the tomato and onion. Whisk together the champagne vinegar, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, agave nectar, salt, and pepper in a small bowl until frothy. Pour dressing over the vegetables. Gently toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.
