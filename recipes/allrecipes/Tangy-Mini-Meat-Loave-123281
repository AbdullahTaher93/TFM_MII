Shape beef into four small loaves, 1/4 to 1/2 in. thick. Cook in a skillet over medium-high heat for 3-4 minutes on each side or until no longer pink. Remove to a serving plate and keep warm. Drain all but 1 tablespoon drippings; saute onion in drippings until tender. Add corn syrup, steak sauce and mustard; bring to a boil. Pour over meat loaves and serve immediately.
