In a large, deep skillet, heat the EVOO, 4 turns of the pan, over medium-low heat. Add the scallops in a single layer, season with salt and pepper and cook, turning once, 2 minutes on each side. Transfer to a plate. Add the garlic, anchovies and crushed red pepper to the skillet and cook until the anchovies dissolve. Add the sherry to the skillet and reduce slightly. Add the tomato sauce and stock; bring to a boil. Season the shrimp and fish with salt and pepper, add to the sauce and simmer until opaque, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir in the scallops, basil and lemon peel. Serve the stoup in shallow bowls with the bread.
