Whisk 2 cups coconut oil, cocoa powder, 1/2 cup honey, and stevia powder together in a bowl until smooth. Blend strawberries, 1/4 cup coconut oil, sunflower seed butter, 2 tablespoons honey, lemon juice, vanilla bean seeds, and rock salt in a food processor until smooth; transfer to a bowl and refrigerate. Pour 1/2 the chocolate mixture into the bottoms of truffle molds or ice cube trays; freeze until partially hardened, about 10 minutes. Keep the remaining chocolate at room temperature. Spoon 1 1/2 teaspoons to 1 tablespoon strawberry filling over frozen chocolate; top each with remaining chocolate, filling molds to the top. Freeze truffles until set, about 15 minutes more.
