Combine soy sauce, red wine, ginger, and black pepper in a large, resealable plastic bag. Seal, and shake vigorously to mix ingredients. Add salmon steaks, squeeze out excess air, and seal. Refrigerate, turning frequently to keep all sides in contact with the liquid, for no less than 2 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium high heat. Cook on a hot grill for about 5 minutes per side, basting freely with extra marinade. Serve with parsley garnish and lemon slices.
