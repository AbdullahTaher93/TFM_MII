Heat a large nonstick skillet over low heat while coating pork slices with oil and seasoning with salt and pepper. Increase heat under skillet to high and turn on exhaust fan. When skillet is hot, add medallions and sear, until crusty brown, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Meanwhile mix wine, broth, tomatoes, olives, garlic and rosemary in a small bowl. Transfer medallions to 4 dinner plates and let rest. Add sauce to empty skillet and simmer to blend flavors and reduce slightly, about 2 to 3 minutes. Pour over pork and serve.
