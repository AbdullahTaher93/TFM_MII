Place seeded and chopped tomatoes in a fine strainer in the sink; sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Heat oil in a wide frying pan over high heat. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring often, until mushrooms are soft and liquid has evaporated (about 5 minutes). Add drained tomatoes and stir until heated through (about 1 minute). With a spoon, make 8 depressions in tomato mixture; carefully break an egg into each. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until eggs are done to your liking (3 to 4 minutes for firm whites and soft yolks). Sprinkle with cheese and chives and serve at once with toasted slices of bread.
