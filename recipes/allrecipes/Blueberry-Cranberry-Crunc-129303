Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F and set out a shallow baking pan with sides, about 10 x 15 x 1 inches. In a large bowl combine the granola, dried cranberries and blueberries, almonds, sugar, and the sunflower and sesame seeds. In a measuring cup whisk together the orange juice, maple syrup, and oil. Drizzle this mixture over the dry ingredients. Toss well. Spread in a single layer in the pan. Bake until slightly crisp and lightly browned, about 25 minutes. Stir every 10 minutes to ensure even browning. Remove from the oven and let cool. Serve with low-fat vanilla yogurt or nonfat milk. This can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.
