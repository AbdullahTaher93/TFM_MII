Make a T-shape cut in the side of each pepper; remove seeds. For filling, combine shredded cheese, cream cheese, and cumin until blended. Pack about 2 teaspoons of the filling into each pepper. For batter, in a bowl combine flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt. Add beer or milk. Beat until smooth. In a heavy saucepan or deep-fat fryer heat 2 inches cooking oil or melted shortening to 375 degrees F. Dip stuffed peppers into batter. Fry several peppers at a time in hot fat, about 2 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Drain; keep warm in a 300 degree F oven while frying remaining peppers. Serve with sour cream sprinkled with chives, if desired.
