In a large, deep skillet or soup pot, heat the EVOO, 3 turns of the pan, over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, curry, saffron and citrus peels and cook for 2 minutes. Add the onion and fennel slices and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Pour in the vermouth, then add the tomatoes and broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Season all of the seafood with salt and pepper. Add the cod and shrimp, then the mussels and squid, to the pan. Cover tightly and simmer until cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Uncover and carefully stir the stoup. Ladle into shallow bowls and top with the basil and fennel fronds. Serve the crusty bread for dunking.
