Put the bulgur wheat in a mixing bowl, pour enough boiling water to cover over, and stir well; leave to soak 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the dressing. Whisk together the cumin, garlic, and lemon juice in a small bowl, then whisk in the olive oil. Drain the bulgur wheat in a sieve, pressing out excess water, then return it to the bowl. Add the bell pepper, tomatoes, onion, cucumber, carrot, parsley, cilantro, and mint, plus the chile, if using. Pour the dressing over the top and season with salt and pepper to taste. Fold gently to mix well. Arrange the lettuce leaves on 4 plates or a serving platter. Pile the bulgur salad on the leaves and sprinkle the goat cheese over the top. Garnish with the radishes.
