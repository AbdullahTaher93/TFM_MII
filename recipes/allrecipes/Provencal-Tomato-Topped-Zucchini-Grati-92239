Peel zucchini, if desired, then cut off and discard ends and stems. Cut lengthwise into quarters, and slice about 1/2 inch thick. Coat a 2 1/2- to 3-quart terra cotta or glass baking dish (2 to 2 1/2 inches deep) with cooking spray. Spread zucchini in prepared baking dish; sprinkle with salt. Bake zucchini, uncovered, in a 350 degrees F oven for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a bowl, beat together eggs, milk, cream, pepper, and nutmeg; set aside. Remove baking dish from oven and increase baking temperature to 400 degrees F. Lightly mix rice into zucchini. Pour egg mixture over zucchini and rice, then arrange tomato slices in a single layer over top. Sprinkle evenly with cheese. Return to oven and bake until custard is almost set and cheese is lightly browned (35 to 40 minutes). Serve hot.
