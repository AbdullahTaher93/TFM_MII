In a large bowl, combine the popcorn, peanuts and raisins. In a large saucepan over low heat, melt butter. Stir in the marshmallows and chips until melted and smooth. Pour over popcorn mixture and stir until evenly coated. Immediately pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. pan and press down evenly. Cool before cutting.
