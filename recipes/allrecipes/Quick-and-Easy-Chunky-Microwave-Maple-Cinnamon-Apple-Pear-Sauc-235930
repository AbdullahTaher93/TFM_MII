Combine Cortland apples, Golden Delicious apples, and Bartlett pears together in a large, microwave-safe bowl. Add water, cinnamon, and nutmeg to the apple-pear mixture and toss to coat. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and cut a 1-inch slot in the center of the plastic wrap to allow steam to escape. Cook apple mixture in the microwave on high for 10 minutes. Carefully remove and discard plastic wrap. Stir apple mixture. Cook in the microwave on high until fruit is hot and tender, another 6 minutes. Stir maple syrup into fruit mixture. Cool completely before refrigerating.
