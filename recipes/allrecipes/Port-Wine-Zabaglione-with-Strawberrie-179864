In a small bowl, whip cream until it holds soft peaks. Spoon whipped cream equally into 4 stemmed glasses (about 1/2-cup size). Set 3 or 4 strawberries, hulled end down, in each glass. In a 2 1/2- to 3-quart round-bottomed zabaglione pan or in the top of a double boiler, combine egg yolks, sugar, and port. Whisk until frothy. Place zabaglione pan directly over medium-high gas heat or high electric heat, or place double boiler top over simmering water. Whisk vigorously just until mixture holds a slight peak when whisk is lifted and no liquid remains in pan bottom (3 to 5 minutes). Immediately pour warm zabaglione over berries in glasses (it continues to thicken). Garnish with lemon peel, if desired, and serve.
