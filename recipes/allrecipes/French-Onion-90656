In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan, combine onion, butter, and sugar. Stir often over medium-high heat until onion is lightly browned, about 12 minutes. Add and mix well. Remove pan from heat; stir in broth and milk. Stir over high heat until boiling. Continue to boil, stirring constantly, until liquid is almost evaporated, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in Swiss cheese and parmesan cheese. Add salt and pepper to taste. Use hot.
