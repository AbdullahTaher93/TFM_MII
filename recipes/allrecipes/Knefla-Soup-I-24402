In a medium bowl, combine flour, egg, 1/2 cup water and salt to form a dough. Cut into thin strips or small pieces. Bring a large pot of water to boil. Stir in dough, potatoes and onion. Cook 20 minutes, until potatoes are tender. Drain. While pasta and potatoes are cooking, cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp. Save drippings. Return pasta and potato mixture to large pot over medium-low heat, and combine with bacon, a teaspoon of bacon grease, milk, cream and salt and pepper. Adjust bacon grease to taste and milk or cream to cover. Simmer 20 minutes, without boiling. Serve hot.
