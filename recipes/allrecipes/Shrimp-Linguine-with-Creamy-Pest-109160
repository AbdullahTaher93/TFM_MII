Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add linguine pasta, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain. Combine milk and broth in a microwaveable bowl; heat at FULL power for 2 minutes or until piping hot. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour, then hot broth mixture to form a smooth sauce. Stir in cheese, shrimp and pesto sauce; simmer until shrimp cook through and turn pink, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour sauce over pasta; toss to coat. Serve with extra cheese passed separately.
