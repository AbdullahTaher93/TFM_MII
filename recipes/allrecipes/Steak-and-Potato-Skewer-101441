In large resealable plastic bag, pour 3/4 cup Lawry's(R) Steak & Chop Marinade With Garlic & Cracked Black Pepper over beef; turn to coat. Close bag and marinate in refrigerator 30 minutes, turning occasionally. Meanwhile, steam potatoes 8 minutes or until slightly firm. Soak 6 wooden skewers in water 15 minutes. Remove beef from Marinade, discarding Marinade. On wooden skewers, alternately thread beef, potatoes, onion and red peppers. Grill or broil, turning once and brushing with remaining 1/2 cup Marinade, until desired doneness.
