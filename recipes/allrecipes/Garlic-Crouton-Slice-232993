Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper. Stir olive oil, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper together in a large mixing bowl; add bread slices and toss to coat. Arrange bread onto prepared baking sheet. Bake until crispy and no longer soft, about 8 minutes.
