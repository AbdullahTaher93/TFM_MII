Mix all ingredients, except steak, in small bowl. Place steaks in large resealable plastic bag or glass dish. Add marinade; turn to coat well. Refrigerate 30 minutes or longer for extra flavor. Remove steaks from marinade. Discard any remaining marinade. Broil or grill over medium-high heat 6 to 8 minutes per side or until desired doneness. Sprinkle with additional Worcestershire Pepper, if desired.
