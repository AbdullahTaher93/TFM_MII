Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly spray a baking sheet with nonstick spray; set aside. For the shortcake, in a large bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, lemon zest, and salt. Make a well in the center. In a large measuring cup, combine the buttermilk, oil, egg, and vanilla. Pour the buttermilk mixture into the well in the dry ingredients and stir with a fork just until the dough comes together. Gather the dough with your hands and place it on the prepared baking sheet. Pat the dough gently into a 7 1/2-inch (19-cm) circle about 1/2 inch (1 cm) thick. Score the circle into 8 wedges (do not score all the way through). If desired, sprinkle the top of the dough with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of sugar. Bake the shortcake for about 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool for about 5 minutes. While the shortcake is baking, make the plum and ricotta fillings. In a small bowl, combine the plums, lemon juice, sugar, and cinnamon; set aside. In another small bowl, combine the ricotta, honey, and almond extract; set aside. When the shortcake has cooled, separate it into wedges, then slice each wedge in half horizontally. Spread the ricotta filling on the bottom half of each wedge. Spoon the plum mixture over the ricotta, then place the remaining wedge half on top.
