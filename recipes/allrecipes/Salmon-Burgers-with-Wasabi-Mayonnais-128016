Make the burgers: Discard any bones in salmon; cut into 1-inch pieces. Place about a quarter of the salmon, along with the mustard and ginger, in a food processor fitted with a metal blade; finely chop (it will be nearly pureed). Scrape into a medium bowl. Finely chop remaining salmon into about 3/8-inch pieces by hand. Add to bowl with salmon mixture along with scallions, salt, and pepper. Form into eight 3-inch patties. Arrange on a large plate; cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate about 1 hour, or until well chilled and firm. Make the mayonnaise: In a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise ingredients. Slice baguette lengthwise, then slice crosswise into 8 pieces. Pull soft bread from tops to hollow them out. Arrange, cut side up on a large baking sheet; toast in a 350 degree F oven until golden. Cover with a tea towel to keep warm. In a large nonstick skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat until hot. Saute patties in batches, 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until just cooked through. You can safely serve these burgers a little rare in the center. Transfer burgers to bread bottoms. Top with cucumber slices, pickled ginger, a dollop of mayonnaise, and micro greens. Finish with remaining bread tops.
