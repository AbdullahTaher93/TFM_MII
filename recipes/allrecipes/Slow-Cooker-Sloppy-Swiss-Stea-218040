Sprinkle both sides of the steak pieces with seasoned salt and paprika. Place the flour in a shallow dish, and thoroughly dredge both sides of the meat with the flour. Pound the meat on both sides with the tenderizing side of a meat mallet, pounding some of the flour into the meat. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and brown the steaks well on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Layer the steaks in a slow cooker with the green bell pepper and onion strips and carrot. Mix together the diced tomatoes with green chiles, sloppy joe sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and wine, and pour over the steak and vegetables. Cover the slow cooker, set the temperature to Low, and cook until the steaks are tender and the sauce is thickened and well blended, 8 to 10 hours.
