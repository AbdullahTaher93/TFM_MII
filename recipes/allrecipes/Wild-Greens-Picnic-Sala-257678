Toss Boston lettuce, chicory, dandelion leaves, apple, and violet petals together in a large bowl. Combine olive oil, raspberry jelly, vinegar, honey, pepper, and salt in a lidded container or jar. Seal and shake until well blended. Drizzle over the lettuce mixture in the bowl. Toss gently until all leaves are coated.
