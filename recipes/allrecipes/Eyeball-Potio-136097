Using a melon baller or small ice cream scoop, place 2 small scoops (about 2 Tbsp. each) of whipped topping into each of 12 dessert dishes for 'eyeballs.' Place a blueberry in each scoop for the 'pupil.' Freeze 30 minutes or until firm. Meanwhile, stir boiling water into gelatin in large bowl at least 2 minutes until completely dissolved. Add enough ice to cold water to measure 2-1/2 cups. Add to gelatin, stirring until slightly thickened. Remove any remaining ice. Spoon gelatin into prepared dishes around each eyeball, leaving the top of the eyeballs exposed. Refrigerate 1-1/2 hours or until firm.
