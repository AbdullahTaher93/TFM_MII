Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir sausage, onion, and garlic in hot oil until onion is slightly softened and browned, about 10 minutes. Stir vegetable broth, stewed tomatoes, carrots, tomato sauce, water, and seasoning blend into sausage mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes. Add bow-tie pasta and continue simmering until pasta is cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
