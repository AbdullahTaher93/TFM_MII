Cut off both ends of the lemon. Push fruit through center, leaving a tube of peel. Squeeze fruit core for juice (you'll need 1 tablespoon for the cocktail and more to moisten glass rim). Cut peel tube into 1/4-inch-wide strips. Set aside. Moisten rim of a pre-chilled cocktail glass with lemon juice. Dip rim into superfine sugar to coat. Set aside. Fill a cocktail shaker two-thirds full with ice. Add brandy, lemon juice, sweet and sour, and triple sec. Agitate contents together in an up-and-down motion for 5 to 10 seconds. Pour shaker contents through the strainer into sugar-rimmed glass. Twist one lemon strip over the drink, drop it in and stir.
