Trim fat from rib meat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Place in a Dutch oven and cover with water. Simmer for 2 hours. Drain. In a small bowl, combine the molasses, ketchup, lemon juice, dry mustard, chili powder and garlic powder. Mix thoroughly. Place the drained meat on a broiler rack. Brush molasses mixture over ribs. Broil on medium for 10 to 15 minutes, turning and basting with sauce often.
