In a large bowl, with a mixer on medium speed, beat butter and sugar until creamy. Beat in egg until well blended. In a medium bowl, mix flour, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt. Add to butter mixture alternately with buttermilk, beating thoroughly after each addition. Gather dough into a ball, wrap tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until firm, 2 to 3 hours, or up to 3 days. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. On a well-floured board, roll out dough, a portion at a time, to a thickness of about 1/8 inch (keep remaining portions refrigerated). Cut out with cookie cutters (about 2 1/2 inches in diameter) and place slightly apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake for about 10 minutes or until lightly browned. Transfer to racks and let cool. Store airtight.
