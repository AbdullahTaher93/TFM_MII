Place the bread cubes and cranberries in a greased 3-quart shallow baking dish. Beat the eggs, half-and-half and vanilla in a medium bowl with a fork or whisk. Pour over the bread cubes. Cover the dish and refrigerate for 1 hour or overnight. Uncover the dish. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes or until golden brown and set in the center. Sprinkle with the cinnamon-sugar. Serve with the butter and syrup.
