Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Slice the tops off the bread rolls and set aside. Scoop out most of the soft interior, leaving a shell about 1/2-inch thick. Make the scooped-out bread into crumbs, either by crumbling with your fingers or using a food processor. Spread 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs on a baking tray and toast in the oven until dry and crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside. Leave the oven on. In a medium bowl mix together the sour cream, mayonnaise, chili sauce, and lime juice. Add the tuna, corn, kidney beans, green pepper, cilantro, and dried bread crumbs. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir well, taking care not to break up the chunks of tuna too much. Spoon the tuna mixture into the hollowed-out rolls and replace the lids. Set on the baking tray and cover loosely with foil. Bake for 5 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 5 minutes to crisp the bread crust. The filling should be warm but not bubbling. Serve immediately.
