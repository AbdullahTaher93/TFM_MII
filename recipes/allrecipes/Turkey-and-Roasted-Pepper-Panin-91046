Top each of 4 of the bread slices with 2 turkey slices, 2 or 3 red pepper pieces, 2 tablespoons olives and 2 ounces cheese. Spread remaining 4 bread slices with dressing. Place, dressing-side down over cheese to make 4 sandwiches. Heat large skillet over medium heat. Spray outside of sandwiches with cooking spray. Cook sandwiches 4 minutes on each side, or until sandwiches are golden brown on both sides and cheese is melted.
