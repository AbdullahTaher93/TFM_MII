Add to graham mixture; stir just until moistened. Stir in 1 cup of the graham snacks. Spoon batter evenly into 12 medium muffin cups sprayed with cooking spray. Toss remaining 1/2 cup graham snacks with the marshmallows. Sprinkle evenly over batter; press lightly into batter. Bake 16 to 20 min. or until toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean. Let stand 5 min. in pan; remove from pan to wire racks. Cool slightly.
