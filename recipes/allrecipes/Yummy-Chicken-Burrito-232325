Place chicken, tomatoes with habanero peppers, green bell pepper, onion, jalapeno chile peppers, and 1 packet taco seasoning in a large pot; pour in enough water to just cover chicken. Bring chicken and vegetables to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink inside, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken from the pot and let cool. Pull chicken meat off the bones and cut into bite-sized pieces; discard carcass. Pour off about half the liquid from the pot, making sure all the vegetables stay. Return chicken meat to pot; add the remaining 1 packet taco seasoning. Simmer until flavors have blended, about 10 minutes. Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry tortillas, working in batches, in the hot oil until desired crispness is reached, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Spoon chicken mixture into each tortilla to serve.
