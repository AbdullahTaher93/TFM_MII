Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; brown ground venison with jalapeno pepper in the hot oil, stirring often, until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Stir ketchup, garlic, molasses, and yellow mustard into the venison mixture, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Simmer at least 10 minutes.
