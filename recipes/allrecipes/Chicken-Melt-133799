Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a mixing bowl, combine sweet onion, drained chicken, mozzarella, and mayonnaise. Mix thoroughly. Spread chicken mixture on 8 slices of bread, and top with remaining slices to form 8 sandwiches. Place sandwiches on a cookie sheet. Bake in a preheated oven for 10 minutes, until filling is hot and bubbly and bread is lightly toasted.
