Cook the rice without salt or butter according to the package directions. Cook the beef in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until the beef is well browned, stirring often. Pour off any fat. Stir 2 cups of the sauce and the rice into the skillet. Cut each pepper in half lengthwise. Discard the seeds and white membranes. Place the pepper shells in a 17x11-inch roasting pan. Spoon the beef mixture into the pepper shells. Pour the remaining sauce over the filled peppers. Cover. Bake at 400 degrees F for 45 minutes or until the peppers are tender. Top with the cheese. Let stand for 5 minutes or until the cheese melts.
