Place steak and 1/2 cup of the dressing in resealable plastic bag; seal bag. Turn bag over several times to evenly coat steak with dressing. Refrigerate 30 min. to marinate. Preheat grill or broiler to medium heat. Remove steak from marinade; discard marinade. Grill steak 5 to 10 min. on each side or until medium doneness (160 degrees F). Cut steak across the grain into thin slices. Toss greens with tomatoes, squash and remaining 1/2 cup dressing. Place on serving platter. Top with steak slices; sprinkle with cheese.
