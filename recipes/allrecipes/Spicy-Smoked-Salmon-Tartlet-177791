Bake, cool and remove the "tops" of the pastry shells according to the package directions. Stir the salmon, cream cheese, horseradish, 2 tablespoons chives, hot pepper sauce and lemon zest in a medium bowl. Spoon about 1 teaspoon salmon mixture into each pastry shell. Sprinkle with the remaining chives.
