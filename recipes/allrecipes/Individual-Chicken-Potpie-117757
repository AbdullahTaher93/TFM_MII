In a large saucepan, saute the onion and green pepper in butter until onion is tender. Add flour until blended. Stir in the broth, milk, broccoli, cauliflower, celery and carrot. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat. Stir in cheese. Divide chicken among four ungreased 1-1/2-cup baking dishes. Top with vegetable mixture. For pastry, combine the flour, salt and paprika in a bowl; cut in shortening until crumbly. Gradually add water, tossing with a fork until dough forms a ball. Divide into four portions; roll out each to 1/8-in. thickness. Place pastry over vegetable mixture. Trim pastry to 1/2 in. beyond edge of dish; flute edges. Cut slits in top. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-40 minutes or until golden brown.
