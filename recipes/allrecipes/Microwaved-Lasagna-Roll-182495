Cook turkey in skillet on medium-high heat 10 min. or until no longer pink, stirring frequently to break into small pieces. Remove from heat. Add ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning; mix well. Spread each lasagna noodle with about 1/2 cup of the turkey mixture; roll up tightly, starting at 1 of the short ends. Place, seam-sides down, in microwaveable baking dish; top with tomato sauce. Cover loosely with plastic wrap. Microwave on HIGH 12 min. or until heated through, rotating dish after 6 min.
