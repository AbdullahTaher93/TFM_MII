In a skillet, cook beef, onion, mushrooms and green pepper over medium heat until the meat is no longer pink; drain. In a greased 3-qt. baking dish, layer half of the pasta, half of the meat mixture, all of the tomato soup and 1 cup of cheese. Top with the remaining pasta and meat mixture. Spread with mushroom soup. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30-45 minutes or until heated through.
