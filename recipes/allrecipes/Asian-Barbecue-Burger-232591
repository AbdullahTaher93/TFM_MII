Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Mix ground beef, green onion, hoisin sauce, Sriracha sauce, sesame oil, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, ginger, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Divide meat mixture into quarters; form each portion into a patty. Grill on the preheated grill until meat is browned and no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes per side.
