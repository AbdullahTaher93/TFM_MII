Stir flour, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper together in a shallow dish. Press chicken tenders into the flour to coat on all sides; shake to remove excess flour. Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir chicken tenders in the melted butter until lightly browned on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove chicken from skillet to a plate and cover to keep warm. Melt remaining butter in the skillet. Cook onion slices in the melted butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir the mushrooms into the cooked onions; cook and stir until the mushrooms are browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. Return the chicken to the skillet. Whisk mushroom soup and Marsala wine together in a bowl; pour over the chicken mixture. Place a cover on the skillet, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes.
