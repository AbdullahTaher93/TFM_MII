Rinse cabbage; remove 4 to 6 outer leaves and set aside. Then core cabbage and finely shred to make 10 cups. Reserve any remaining cabbage for other uses. Combine shredded cabbage, onion, and cilantro. Stem and core bell pepper; cut into 2-inch slivers and add to cabbage mixture. Trim end on cucumber, then run a fork down the side, leaving markings that show white flesh. Cut into 1/4-inch rounds and then cut rounds into about 4 matchstick shapes each (total about 1 1/2 cups); add to cabbage mixture. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 4 hours. In a small nonstick frying pan, combine sesame seeds and oil. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until seeds begin to turn golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. Mix in vinegar, sugar (if using), lemon juice, and ginger; add salt and pepper to taste. Just before serving, pour dressing over cabbage mixture. Gently fold ingredients to evenly coat all. Line serving bowl or platter with reserved cabbage leaves, and spoon slaw onto leaves. Garnish with cilantro sprigs and serve.
