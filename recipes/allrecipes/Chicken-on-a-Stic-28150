Thread skewer sticks with pieces of onion, red and green bell pepper, cauliflower and dill pickle, alternating with cubes of chicken. Prepare tempura mix according to package directions. Transfer to a long dish for dipping skewers into. Heat 1 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). Dip threaded skewers into the batter, coating all sides. Fry in hot oil for about 5 to 8 minutes on each side, or until golden.
