In a bowl, beat eggs and pepper. In a skillet, heat oil. Add eggs. Cook until partially set. Lift the edges, letting the uncooked egg flow underneath. When eggs are completely set but still moist, remove from skillet. Cut into strips; return to pan. Add remaining ingredients; mix well. Gently cook and stir for 5 minutes or until heated through.
