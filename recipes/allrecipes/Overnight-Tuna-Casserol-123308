In a bowl, combine soup and milk until smooth. Add the tuna, macaroni, peas, onions and 3/4 cup cheese; mix well. Pour into a greased 2-qt. microwave-safe dish. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Microwave, covered, on high for 15-17 minutes or until bubbly. Uncover; sprinkle with remaining cheese and let stand for 5 minutes or until melted.
