In a mixing bowl, combine dry cake mix, nuts, oil and egg; mix until crumbly. Set aside 1-1/2 cups for topping. Press the remaining crumb mixture into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. In a saucepan, combine milk, chocolate chips and salt. Cook and stir over low heat until chips are melted. Stir in vanilla. Spread evenly in pan. Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool before cutting.
