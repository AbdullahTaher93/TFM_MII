Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8 inch skillet. In a large bowl, beat together sugar, salt, butter and vanilla until creamy. Stir in eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. In a separate bowl, mix together flour, baking powder and cornmeal. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture alternately with the milk. Beat well until blended. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve warm.
