Peel the ginger root with a sharp knife. Add the peels to the water used to steam the broccoli. Steam the broccoli to your desire of doneness (typically 3-4 minutes). Do not over-cook. Meanwhile, grate the ginger. Whisk together the ginger, oil, soy sauce and vinegar. When the broccoli is done, drizzle the ginger vinaigrette over the broccoli and serve.
