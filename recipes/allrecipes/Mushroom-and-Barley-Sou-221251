Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook onion, bell pepper, and garlic in hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Pour chicken broth over onion mixture; bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium low. Stir mixed greens, corn, pearl barley, cremini mushrooms, and carrot through the simmering stock. Cook until barley is tender, about 30 minutes.
