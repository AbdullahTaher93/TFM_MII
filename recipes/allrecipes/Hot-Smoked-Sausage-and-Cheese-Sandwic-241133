Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix mayonnaise, mustard, red pepper, black pepper and onion powder together. Liberally spread the creamy mustard sauce on each cut side of rolls. On bottom half of each roll, evenly layer sausage and two slices of cheese. Place the top slice of each roll onto the cheese, brush the rolls with butter, and wrap rolls in aluminum foil. Place wrapped rolls on a baking sheet. Bake until cheese has melted and sandwich is warm, about 20 minutes. Allow 2 to 3 minutes to cool before serving.
