Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 1 muffin tin with cooking spray. Combine milk, sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla extract in a bowl; mix until completely combined. Whisk all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon whole wheat flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl; fold into the milk mixture until batter is just combined. Fold in huckleberries to distribute them evenly. Pour batter into the greased muffin tin. Combine the remaining 1/4 cup whole wheat flour, oats, brown sugar, cold butter, and cinnamon in a bowl. Mix until crumbly and sprinkle over the muffins. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes.
