Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Spread bread onto baking sheet; drizzle with oil. Sprinkle with 1 Tbsp. cheese and crushed pepper. Bake 10 min. Meanwhile, cook and stir bacon in large saucepan on medium heat until crisp. Remove bacon from pan with slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. Discard all but 1 Tbsp. bacon drippings from pan. Add onions to pan; cook and stir 5 min. or until crisp-tender. Return bacon to pan along with the beans, tomatoes, broth and 1/4 cup of the remaining cheese; stir. Simmer on medium-low heat 20 min., stirring occasionally. Add kale; cook 10 min. Serve soup topped with croutons and remaining cheese.
