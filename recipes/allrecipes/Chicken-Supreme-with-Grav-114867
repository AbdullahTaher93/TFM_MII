In a Dutch oven, saute celery and onions in butter. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, add the bread, salt, baking powder and pepper; toss to coat. Stir in celery and onions. Beat eggs and milk; add to bread mixture. Divide half of the chicken in four 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. greased baking pans. Cover with half of the bread mixture. Repeat layers. Pour broth into each pan. Cover and bake at 300 degrees F for 1 hour and 45 minutes or until broth is absorbed; uncover and bake 15 minutes more. For gravy, in a Dutch oven, combine soup and water. Simmer about 10 minutes. Serve with the chicken.
