Season both sides of roast with salt and pepper. Brown meat in large heavy pot or Dutch oven on high heat in 1/4 cup of the dressing, turning to brown both sides. Add onions; stir to brown. Add remaining dressing, potatoes, carrots and enough water to come 3/4 way up meat (about 1-1/2 to 2 cups). Bring to boil; cover. Reduce heat to low. Simmer 2 hours or until meat and vegetables are tender. Remove meat from pan; slice meat thinly against the grain. Serve meat and vegetables topped with pan gravy. Sprinkle with chopped parsley just before serving.
