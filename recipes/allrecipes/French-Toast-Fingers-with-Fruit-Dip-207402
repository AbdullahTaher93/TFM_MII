For any dip: Mix the ingredients (except for the butter, if used) for any of the dips in a small bowl. Put 1/4 - cup dip aside for the French toast. Heat the remaining dip in a small saucepan or in the microwave oven until hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and mix in the butter, if using; keep warm. For the French toast fingers: In a flat, wide bowl mix the eggs, milk and 1/4 cup of one of the dips until smooth. Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat and coat with cooking spray oil or a small amount of butter. Dip the bread strips in the egg mixture just long enough to coat thoroughly. Cook the strips until browned on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Cool for 2 to 3 minutes before serving. Serve 5 French Toast Fingers (a hand) per person with a portion of the warm dip.
