Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Rub both sides of each lamb chop with the garlic clove and season with black pepper. Mash blue cheese and cream together in a bowl, forming a paste. Cook lamb chops under the broiler until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Spread the cheese paste evenly atop one side of each chop. Bake under the broiler until the cheese is browned and bubbling, 1 to 2 minutes more.
