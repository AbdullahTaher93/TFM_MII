Preheat barbecue grill. Combine glaze ingredients in small bowl. Combine salsa ingredients in medium bowl. Place beef roast on grid over medium, ash-covered coals. Grill, uncovered, 35 to 45 minutes for medium rare to medium doneness, turning occasionally. Brush with glaze during last 10 minutes. Remove roast when instant-read thermometer registers 140 degrees for medium rare; 155 degrees for medium. Tent loosely with aluminum foil; let stand 10 minutes. (Temperature will continue to rise to 145 degrees for medium rare; 160 degrees for medium.) Carve across the grain into thin slices. Serve with salsa.
