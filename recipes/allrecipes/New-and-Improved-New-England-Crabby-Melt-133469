Place the peppers in the bowl of a food processor and season with salt and pepper. Add the lemon juice and hot sauce, then put the lid in place and turn on the processor. Add the EVOO in a thin stream and process until smooth. Preheat the broiler. Using your fingers, check the crabmeat for pieces of shell. In a medium bowl, combine the crab and seafood seasoning. Add the celery, tarragon and scallions to the crab and toss with the red pepper dressing; adjust the seasoning to taste. Toast the English muffins under the hot broiler, then lightly butter them. Top each with a small handful of watercress, then with a scoop of the crab salad. Pat down the salad a bit, then top with a handful of cheese and return to the broiler to melt the cheese, about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove and serve immediately.
