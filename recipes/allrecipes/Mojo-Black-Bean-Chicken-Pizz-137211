Heat oven to 400 degrees F. In medium bowl, mix cilantro, marinade, onion, salt, pepper, beans and chicken. Let stand 10 to 15 minutes to marinate. Meanwhile, lightly spray large cookie sheet with cooking spray. Unroll dough on cookie sheet; starting in center, press into 15x11-inch rectangle. Bake 8 to 12 minutes or until light golden brown. Spread chicken mixture over partially baked crust to within 1/2 inch of edges. Sprinkle both cheeses over top. Bake 8 minutes longer or until cheese is melted and crust is golden brown around edges. Cut into 8 rectangles.
