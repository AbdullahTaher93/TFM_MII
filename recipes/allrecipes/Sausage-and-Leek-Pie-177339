On a floured board, cut pastry into four equal pieces. Roll each quarter until each cut side is about 8 inches long. Ease each piece into a round ramekin (about 1 1/2 inches deep and 4 inches wide); fold edges down into ramekin, flush with rim. Press pastry snugly against sides of ramekin to make evenly thick. Prick in several places with the tines of a fork. Bake in a 375 degrees F oven until lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, trim root end, coarse tops, and outer layer from each leek; cut leeks in half lengthwise. Hold under running water and flip layers to rinse well. Cut crosswise into 1/4-inch pieces. In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat, frequently stir leeks in butter until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons flour and stir until well blended; remove from heat. Smoothly blend in milk and half-and-half; add hot sauce to taste. Return to heat and stir until boiling; stir 1 minute longer. Remove from heat, add cheese, and stir until sauce is smooth. Pile sausage chunks equally into warm pastry-lined ramekins. Pour sauce evenly over sausages. Bake in a 375 degrees F oven until sauce bubbles, 18 to 25 minutes. Sprinkle pies with parsley.
