Place the diced onions and one tablespoon of the vegetable broth in a large stock pot over medium heat. Add the peas and carrots, cumin, coriander, garam masala, and turmeric. Stir to mix in spices. Heat through, about five minutes. Add remaining vegetable broth, diced tomatoes and juice, and tomato sauce. Heat to boiling, stirring occasionally. Once boiling, turn heat down to simmer. Add potatoes and garbanzo beans. Stir until potatoes are thoroughly incorporated. Simmer until heated through. Add baby spinach and stir until wilted. Serve immediately garnished with chopped parsley if desired.
