Mix cream cheese spread and crabmeat; spoon evenly onto won ton wrappers, adding about 1 tsp. of the crabmeat mixture to each wrapper. Moisten edges of each wrapper with water; fold in half to form triangle. Press edges together to seal. Heat oil in medium skillet or wok to 360 degrees F. Add won tons, in batches; cook 1 to 2 min. or until golden brown on both sides, turning once. Remove from skillet with slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. Serve hot with the sweet-and-sour sauce.
