Arrange bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels and crumble. Layer spinach, bacon, eggs, and onion in a large bowl. Sprinkle with almonds and sunflower seeds. Whisk vegetable oil, ketchup, vinegar, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a bowl; pour over spinach mixture and toss. Serve immediately.
