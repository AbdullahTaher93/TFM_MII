Remove gills from mushrooms with tip of small spoon; remove stems. With a pastry brush, gently coat mushroom cavities and tops with 1 tablespoon vinaigrette; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon Morton(R) Kosher Salt. Arrange mushrooms, stem sides up, on lightly greased baking pan. Cover and refrigerate 15 minutes. Combine cornbread stuffing with water; stir to moisten. In skillet, saute onion in 1 tablespoon vinaigrette over moderately high heat until onion is softened. Season with remaining 1/4 teaspoon Morton(R) Kosher Salt and garlic powder. Remove skillet from heat; stir in stuffing mixture and spinach souffle until thoroughly combined. Fill mushrooms evenly with spinach/cornbread stuffing mixture. Top with cheese and cherry tomatoes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15 to 20 minutes or until spinach is puffed and cooked through and cheese is bubbly.
