Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Blot any moisture from the butternut squash fries with paper towels, and place on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt, black pepper, and Cajun seasoning. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and tender, 15 to 20 minutes, turning once.
