Combine 1/2 cup water and wheat berries in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Cover saucepan, remove from heat, and set aside for wheat berries to soak, about 10 minutes. Melt butter in a 2-quart saucepan over low heat; cook and stir oats, pecans, and almonds in melted butter until golden and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Carefully pour boiling water into nut mixture; add wheat berries and dried apples. Cover saucepan and cook over low heat, without stirring, until wheat berries are tender, about 20 minutes; stir in sugar, cinnamon, and salt.
