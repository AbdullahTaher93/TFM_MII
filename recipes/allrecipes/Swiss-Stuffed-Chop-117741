In a bowl, combine the cheese, mushrooms and parsley. Cut a pocket in each pork chop by slicing almost to the bone. Stuff each with 1/2 cup cheese mixture; secure with toothpicks. In a shallow bowl, beat the egg. In another shallow bowl, combine the bread crumbs and pepper. Dip chops in egg, then coat with crumbs. In a large skillet, brown chops in oil on both sides. Add water. Cover and simmer for 40-45 minutes or until juices run clear. Remove chops and keep warm; discard toothpicks. Combine flour and cold water until smooth; stir into pan juices. Cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Spoon over pork chops.
