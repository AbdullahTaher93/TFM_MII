In a 2-quart (2-L) saucepan, whisk the cornstarch with 1/2 cup (125 mL) milk until smooth. Whisk in the remaining milk and honey. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture becomes syrupy. Remove from heat. Pour the egg substitute into a cup. Stir in several spoonfuls of the hot milk mixture. Whisk the egg mixture into the pan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture reaches a light-custard consistency. Stir in the vanilla. Divide the mixture among 6 custard cups. Cover each and chill thoroughly. Just before serving, top each custard with the strawberries and raspberries.
