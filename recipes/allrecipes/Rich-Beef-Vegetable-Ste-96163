Heat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Heat a large heavy-duty soup pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Toss beef cubes with oil and a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Working in small batches to avoid overcrowding the pan, add beef cubes to hot pot; brown all sides, about 10 to 12 minutes per batch. Transfer to a clean bowl as meat browns. Add or drain oil in skillet to equal 2 tablespoons. Add onions and herbs to the pot; saute until onions are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in flour, cook 2 minutes; followed by broth, wine, tomatoes and the beef cubes. Bring to a simmer. Cover pot and transfer to oven; slow-cook until meat is very tender, about 3 hours. Meanwhile, place celery, carrots, and potatoes in a steamer basket or a steamer rack set over a pan of 1 inch deep boiling water. Cover and steam until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir vegetables into the stew at the 2 hour mark to blend flavors; add peas to stew 10 minutes before serving.
