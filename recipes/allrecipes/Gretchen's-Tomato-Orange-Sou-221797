Place whole poblano peppers on the grate of a stove-top gas burner set to medium-high. Rotate peppers over the flame using a set of tongs until the outer skin blackens and blisters and is charred on all sides. Transfer peppers to a paper bag, tightly close the bag, and set aside for 20 minutes. Remove peppers from bag and peel off charred skin. Trim stems and seeds; discard. Chop peppers and set aside. Melt butter over medium-high heat in a large stockpot. Add onion; cook and stir until lightly browned around the edges, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour wine into the pot over onions; bring to a boil while scraping any browned bits off of the bottom of the pot. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until onions are well browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken stock, fresh tomatoes, canned tomatoes, poblano chiles, carrot, bay leaf, orange zest, thyme, paprika, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook until the vegetables are soft, about 30 minutes. Remove bay leaf and discard. Pour the mixture into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the mixture moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth. Strain soup through a fine mesh sieve back into the stockpot. Alternately, use a stick blender and puree the mixture right in the pot. Return pureed soup to a simmer; stir in cream. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Serve topped with a dollop of creme fraiche and chopped basil.
