Heat apple cider in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add orange zest, cinnamon sticks, allspice, cloves, and ginger to the cider. Reduce heat to low and slowly simmer for 20-30 minutes, but do not allow cider to boil. Strain cider through a fine-mesh sieve. Serve cider warm or cold. Garnish with a cinnamon stick, if you like.
