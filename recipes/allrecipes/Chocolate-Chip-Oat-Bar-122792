In a bowl, combine the flour, oats and brown sugar. Cut in the butter until crumbly. Press half of the mixture into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 8-10 minutes. Remove from the oven. Spread condensed milk evenly over the crust. Sprinkle with pecans and chocolate chips. Top with remaining oat mixture and pat lightly. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool in pan on a wire rack.
