Heat oil and garlic in a large skillet over low heat. Place chicken in a medium bowl; season with pepper, vinegar and soy; toss to coat. Increase heat under skillet to medium and cook garlic cloves until they turn golden brown. Remove garlic and add marinated chicken to the hot oil; cook, until well browned on both sides, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Add reserved marinade, water and bay leaves. Cover pan, reduce heat and simmer until chicken is fully cooked, about 8 minutes. Remove lid and continue to simmer about 2 minutes longer. Remove chicken to serving dish, top with sauce and serve.
