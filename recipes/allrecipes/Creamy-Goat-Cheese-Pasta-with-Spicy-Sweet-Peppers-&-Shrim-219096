Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for pasta. In a large saucepan, saute olive oil, garlic and Pepperazzi until golden, about 3 minutes. Add shrimp and saute for another 6 minutes until cooked through. Remove and discard garlic. Cook pasta for al dente texture, following package instructions. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of pasta water. With a slotted spoon, remove peppers and shrimp from saucepan. Set aside. Using the remaining liquid, raise the heat to high and add wine to deglaze the pan. Add chicken stock and cook to reduce by half. Slowly introduce goat cheese, stirring until melted and smooth, about 2 minutes. Stir in butter to melt. Return peppers and shrimp to the pan. Add spinach. Cook together until spinach is tender, about 3 minutes. Add hot pasta and toss to combine. Stir in pasta water to loosen sauce, if desired. Salt and pepper to taste.
