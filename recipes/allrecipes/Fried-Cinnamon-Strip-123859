In a large resealable plastic bag, combine sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg; set aside. Cut tortillas into 3-in. x 2-in. strips. Heat 1 in. of oil in a skillet or electric fry pan to 375 degrees F; fry 4-5 strips at a time for 30 seconds on each side or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. While still warm, place strips in bag with sugar mixture; shake gently to coat. Serve immediately or store in an airtight container.
