Combine shrimp, water, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a microwave-safe bowl; mix well with your hands. Rinse under cold running water. Pat shrimp dry with paper towels; return to the bowl. Whisk ketchup, chili bean paste, sake, vinegar, sugar, 1 teaspoon cornstarch, and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a bowl. Mix in scallion, garlic, and ginger. Pour ketchup mixture evenly over the shrimp. Cover bowl with microwave-safe plastic wrap. Microwave on 600W power until shrimp turn opaque, about 3 minutes.
