In a small bowl, whisk vinegar, oil, sugar, cilantro, basil, and tarragon until well blended. You may adjust these seasonings to your personal preference. In a separate bowl, toss together the beans, tomato, onion, and shrimp. Pour dressing over salad, and toss again to coat. Cover and refrigerate several hours, or overnight, to develop flavors.
