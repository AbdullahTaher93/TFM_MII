In a saucepan over low heat, melt butter and chocolate; cool for 10 minutes. In a mixing bowl, beat eggs, sugar, vanilla and salt. Stir in the chocolate mixture. Add flour and nuts; mix well. Pour into a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake at 325 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out with moist crumbs. Cool. Dust with confectioners' sugar if desired.
