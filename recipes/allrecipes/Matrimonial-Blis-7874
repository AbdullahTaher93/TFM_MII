Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 10-inch round cake pan. Place butter, brown sugar, flour, oatmeal, coconut, egg and baking soda in a bowl and mix well. Put 2/3 of the batter in the prepared pan then spread the rhubarb jam over it. Pat the remaining dough over the top. Bake in preheated oven until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes.
