Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the chops and fry until brown on both sides, turning them over once, about 5 minutes. In a small bowl, blend together the orange juice, honey, soy sauce, sherry, vinegar, mustard, and tomato paste. Pour over the chops, then leave to simmer until the chops are cooked through and tender, turning them once or twice, about 15 minutes longer. Meanwhile, make the pilaf. Put the rice in a sieve and rinse under cold running water until the water is clear; drain well. Heat the oil in a saucepan. Add the onion and garlic and saute until soft and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle in the pine nuts and raisins and cook, stirring, until the nuts turn golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the rice and stir well to mix. Pour in the stock and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and all the stock is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Season to taste. To serve, spoon the pilaf onto warm plates and arrange the chops with some of the sauce alongside.
