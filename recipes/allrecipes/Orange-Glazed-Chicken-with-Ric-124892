Place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Pour sauce over chicken. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes. Baste with sauce. Bake, uncovered, 45 minutes longer or until juices run clear. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, saute celery and onion in butter until crisp-tender. Add water; bring to a boil.
