Crumble beef into a 12-inch nonstick frying pan. Add chopped onion, chili powder, cumin, and oregano and cook over medium-high heat, stirring until meat is browned and onion is soft, about 10 minutes; pour off and discard excess fat. Stir in 2 tablespoons taco sauce and mix well. Place lettuce in a large salad bowl. Add meat mixture, green onions, cucumber, cheese, and tortilla chips; mix well. Immediately divide among 4 plates and garnish with tomato wedges. Offer sour cream and remaining taco sauce to add to taste.
