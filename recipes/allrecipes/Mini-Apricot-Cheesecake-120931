Place wafers flat side down in paper-or foil-lined muffin cups; set aside. In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Add the eggs, lemon juice and vanilla; beat well. Fill muffin cups three-fourths full. Place on a baking sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F for 17-20 minutes or until top is set. Cool on a wire rack for 20 minutes. Top each cheesecake with 2 teaspoons preserves. Refrigerate until serving.
