Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8x8 casserole dish (you can lightly dust it with whey powder if you have some handy). Chop the broccoli but not too small. Place in the casserole dish and sprinkle the cheese evenly over the broccoli. In a bowl, add the eggs, milk, mustard, chili powder and the salt & pepper. Beat the eggs well. Pour over the broccoli. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40 minutes. Let cool for about 5 to 10 minutes before cutting into 6 pieces.
