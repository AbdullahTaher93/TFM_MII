To make the dressing, puree all of the dressing ingredients, except for the parsley, in a blender or food processor until smooth; stir in the parsley. Boil the potatoes in a large pot of water until tender, about 15 minutes; drain. While still hot toss the potatoes, onion, celery and bacon and the dressing prepared before; set aside to cool.
