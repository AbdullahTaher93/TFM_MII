Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix sugar, flour, oil, cocoa powder, eggs, salt, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer for 3 minutes. Fold walnuts into batter. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the brownies comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.
