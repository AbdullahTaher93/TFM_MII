Spread cheese evenly over one side of each tortilla; top each with 1/4 cup shredded carrots and 1/4 cup Jack cheese. Layer lettuce and deli roast beef over carrots, leaving 1/2-inch border around edge. Roll up tightly; wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate 30 minutes before serving. To serve, cut each roll diagonally in half.
