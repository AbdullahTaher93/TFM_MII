In a bowl, combine pie filling, lemon juice and cinnamon; spoon into pastry shell. In another bowl, combine the flour and brown sugar; cut in butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in nuts, oats and coconut; sprinkle over pie filling. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until topping is golden brown, covering edge of pastry with foil to prevent overbrowning if needed. Cool on a wire rack before cutting.
