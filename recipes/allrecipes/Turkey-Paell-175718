Remove casings from sausage and crumble meat into a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan. Cook over medium-high heat until sausage is browned (7 to 9 minutes), stirring to break it into small chunks. Remove sausage from pan with a slotted spoon; set aside. Discard all but 1 tablespoon. of the drippings from pan. (If there are no drippings, add the olive oil instead.) To pan, add onion and garlic. Cook, stirring often, until onion is lightly browned (about 5 minutes). If pan appears dry, stir in water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Stir in broth, tomatoes and their liquid, saffron, artichokes, and parsley; then return sausage to pan. Bring to a boil; then reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add rice; cover and simmer until liquid has been absorbed and rice is tender to bite (about 5 more minutes). Garnish with lemon wedges.
