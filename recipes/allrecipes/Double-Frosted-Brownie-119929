Prepare brownie mix according to package directions. Spread the batter into a greased 13-in. x 9-in x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted 2 in from side of pan comes out clean. Cool completely on a wire rack. In a mixing bowl, beat butter, sugar and pudding mix until blended. Add enough milk to achieve spreading consistency. Frost brownies. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Spread with fudge frosting.
