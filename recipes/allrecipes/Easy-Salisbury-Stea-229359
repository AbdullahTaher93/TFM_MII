Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix ground beef, oats, egg, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, water, dried minced onion, salt, and pepper in a bowl until evenly combined; shape into 6 oval-shaped patties. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in hot skillet until browned completely, 2 minutes per side. Transfer browned patties to a baking dish. Top patties with onion rings. Stir mushroom soup and milk together in a bowl; pour over patties. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven until firm, hot, and grey in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
