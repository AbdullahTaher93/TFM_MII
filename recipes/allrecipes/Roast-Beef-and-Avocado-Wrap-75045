Mix the cream cheese, cumin, garlic, and chili flakes in a bowl until well blended. Spread a thin layer of the cream cheese mixture over each tortilla, dividing evenly. Place a lettuce leaf on each tortilla, and top with two roast beef slices. Sprinkle evenly with avocado, tomatoes, and cheese. Starting at one end, gently roll up each tortilla into a tight tube. Slice in half diagonally and place two pieces on 6 serving plates.
