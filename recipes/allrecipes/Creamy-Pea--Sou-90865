In a bowl, beat parmesan cheese, butter, lemon peel, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, and egg yolks until blended. Stir in cream. Meanwhile, in a 4- to 5-quart pan, combine broth and pasta. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Add peas, cover, reduce heat, and simmer until pasta is tender to bite, about 1 minute. Mix about 2 cups hot soup into cheese mixture, then stir cheese mixture back into pan. Remove from heat, ladle into bowls, and sprinkle with nutmeg before serving. Add salt to taste.
