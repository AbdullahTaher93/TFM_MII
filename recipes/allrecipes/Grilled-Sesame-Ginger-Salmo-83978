In large Ziploc(R) bag, combine 1 cup Sesame Ginger Marinade and fish; seal bag. Marinate in refrigerator for 30 minutes. Remove fish from bag, discarding used marinade. Lightly oil grill grates. Cook fish on grill, brushing often with remaining Marinade, about 5 to 7 minutes per side, until fish is opaque and begins to flake easily. Grilling time will depend on the thickness of the fish.
