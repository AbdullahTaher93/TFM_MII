Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine cottage cheese, eggs, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl; beat until blended. Wet matzo crackers so they are moist but not soggy. Place a little tomato sauce in the bottom of an 8-inch square pan. Top with 1 sheet of matzo, 1/3 of the cottage cheese mixture, 1/3 of the tomato sauce, and a 1/3 of the Muenster cheese. Repeat layers twice more, ending with Muenster cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and golden, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove lasagna from oven and let stand for 5 minutes before cutting.
