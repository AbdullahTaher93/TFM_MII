In a food processor, grind the almonds to a coarse powder. Transfer to a medium saucepan. Add the milk, 1 tablespoon of the honey and the cardamom. Warm over moderate heat. Off the heat, cover and let stand for 20 minutes, then strain. Discard the solids. In a medium nonstick skillet, warm the remaining 3 tablespoons of honey. Add the bananas and cook over moderately high heat, stirring, for 2 minutes. Scrape into bowls, pour in the warm almond milk and serve with spoons.
