Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Beat butter, brown sugar, white sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in the egg until completely incorporated. Gradually beat flour mixture into butter mixture until combined. Fold in cinnamon chips and cinnamon candies, mixing just enough to evenly combine. Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 8 to 11 minutes. Cool on the pans for 2 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
