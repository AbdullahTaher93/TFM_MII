Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add angel hair pasta and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until al dente; drain. In a small bowl, whisk together the chicken broth, soy sauce, and cornstarch. Heat the oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Stir in the celery, mushrooms, peppers, and onion, and cook about 3 minutes. Add the broth mixture, bean sprouts, and snow peas. Continue to cook and stir about 5 minutes, until vegetables are tender but crisp. In a large bowl, toss together the cooked pasta and the vegetable mixture. Top with chow mein noodles to serve.
