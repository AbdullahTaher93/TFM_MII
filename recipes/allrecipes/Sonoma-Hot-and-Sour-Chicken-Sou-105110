In a large saucepan cook mushrooms, ginger, and garlic in hot oil for 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in broth, vinegar, soy sauce, and red pepper; bring to boiling. Stir in chicken and cabbage. Return to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. In a small bowl stir together water and cornstarch. Stir into soup; simmer about 2 minutes or until slightly thickened. Remove from heat; stir in sesame oil and, if desired, lemon juice to taste. Ladle soup into bowls. Sprinkle with green onions.
