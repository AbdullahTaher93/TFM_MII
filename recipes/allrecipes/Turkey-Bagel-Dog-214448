Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Open package of Lit'l Smokies(R) and drain off any liquid. Unroll dough, separate at perforations, creating 12 strips. Cut each strip into thirds. Wrap one piece of dough around each sausage pressing at edges to seal. Place seam-side down on ungreased cookie sheet. Sprinkle with poppy or sesame seeds, if desired. Bake for 11-13 minutes or until lightly browned. Serve with mustard and ketchup, if desired.
