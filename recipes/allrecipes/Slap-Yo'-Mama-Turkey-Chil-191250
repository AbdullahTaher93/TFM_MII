Cook the turkey in a large, heavy pot over medium heat until completely browned. Stir the onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into the turkey and continue cooking until the onion becomes slightly translucent. Add the kidney beans, chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, chipotle pepper, salt, and pepper; stir. Mix the tomato paste into the turkey mixture until evenly distributed. Pour the tomatoes, beer, and chile-garlic sauce into the pot and stir. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer 2 hours. Check after 1 hour and adjust seasonings to taste.
