In a bowl, mix apples, sugar, flour, cinnamon and nutmeg. Line pie plate with bottom crust; brush well with apple cider. Add apple mixture; pour any remaining cider over all. Drizzle with butter. Top with second crust; flute edges to seal. Cut slits in top. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50 minutes. Meanwhile, for topping, melt butter in a small saucepan. Add brown sugar, cream and cider; slowly bring to a full rolling boil, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and stir in pecans. Remove pie from oven and place on a baking sheet; pour topping over pie. Return to the oven for 5-10 minutes or until topping bubbles. Cool at least 1 hour before serving.
