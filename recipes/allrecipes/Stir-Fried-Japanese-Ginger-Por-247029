Combine daikon radish, soy sauce, sake, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, and mirin in a large bowl. Add sliced pork; let marinate for 5 minutes. Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove pork from marinade and add to the wok; cook and stir until evenly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in remaining marinade; cover and cook until bubbling, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
