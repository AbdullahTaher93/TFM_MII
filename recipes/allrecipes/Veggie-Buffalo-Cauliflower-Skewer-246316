Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk together olive oil, salt and pepper in a mixing bowl large enough to hold the cauliflower. Add the cauliflower and toss until each piece is coated with the oil mixture. Skewer cauliflower pieces on pre-soaked skewers. Place skewers on a roasting rack. Roast in pre-heated oven for 30 minutes. While cauliflower is roasting, mix dressing and hot sauce together in a small mixing bowl. After 30 minutes, remove cauliflower from the oven and immediately paint them with the hot sauce mixture. Top with the blue cheese and serve immediately.
