Heat the coconut oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir the onion, celery, and carrots in the hot oil until tender, about 7 minutes. Add the quinoa, chicken broth, Italian seasoning, and sage. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the liquid has been absorbed and the quinoa is tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in the chicken meat; season with salt and pepper.
