Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Combine sweet potatoes and olive oil together in a bowl; toss to coat potatoes completely. Spread sweet potatoes in an even layer on a baking sheet. Bake fries in the preheated oven, turning once, until cooked through and crisp, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer fries to a bowl and sprinkle Parmesan cheese and cilantro over the top; toss to coat. Season with sea salt and pepper to taste.
