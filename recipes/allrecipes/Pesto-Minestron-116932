In a large saucepan, saute onion and garlic in oil until tender. Stir in water, mixed vegetables, broth, oregano, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 3 minutes. Add the tortellini, zucchini and pesto. Simmer, uncovered, 6-8 minutes longer or until pasta and vegetables are tender.
