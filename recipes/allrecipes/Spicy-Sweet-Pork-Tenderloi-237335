Mix soy sauce, ginger, and garlic in a small bowl. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Arrange pork slices in a single layer in the skillet. Spoon soy sauce mixture over the pork. Cook pork until completely browned and just slightly pink in the center, about 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove pork to a plate, retaining juices in the skillet. Stir salsa and raspberry preserves into the drippings in the skillet; cook and stir until slightly thickened, about 30 seconds. Spoon sauce over pork slices and top with cilantro.
