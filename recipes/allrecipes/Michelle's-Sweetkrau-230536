Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Empty sauerkraut and turnip greens into a colander and rinse lightly; drain. Spread sauerkraut, turnip greens, and onions in an even layer in a large baking dish and season with salt and black pepper. Whisk apple juice concentrate, water, and brown sugar in a bowl, dissolving the sugar. Pour juice mixture over vegetables. Arrange pieces of kielbasa sausage into dish atop vegetables. Bake in the preheated oven until most of the liquid has evaporated and the kielbasa is browned, about 2 hours, stirring every 20 minutes.
