In a large resealable plastic bag or shallow glass container, combine the first seven ingredients; mix well. Add steak and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight, turning occasionally. Drain and discard marinade. Grill, covered, over medium-hot heat for 6-8 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F).
