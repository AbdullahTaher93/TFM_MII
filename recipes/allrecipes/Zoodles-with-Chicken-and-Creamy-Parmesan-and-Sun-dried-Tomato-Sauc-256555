Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Cut zucchini into noodles using a spiralizer or vegetable peeler. Spread on the baking sheet; cover with another layer of paper towels. Bake zucchini noodles in the preheated oven until dried out, about 30 minutes. Season chicken with poultry seasoning. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken; cook and stir until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; stir in sun-dried tomatoes, oil, and garlic. Cook until garlic is fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir evaporated skim milk, Parmesan cheese, and vegan cream cheese into the skillet until melted and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt, red pepper flakes, and basil. Stir in zucchini noodles until evenly coated with sauce.
