Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. In a medium bowl combine 1 clove garlic, beef, pork, bread, 1/2 cup cheese, parsley, season with salt and pepper. Combine the mixture, until everything is incorporated. Shape mixture into small, evenly sized balls; bake on rimmed sheet for 10-15 minutes or until slightly browned and cooked through. Meanwhile, in a large skillet cook the remaining garlic clove in olive oil for 1 to 2 minutes or until slightly yellow in color. Add tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Add cream, season with salt and pepper. Gently toss the meatballs in the sauce and heat through. Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain pasta and toss with the meatball sauce. Top with parsley and remaining cheese.
