To make chicken kabobs, place chicken chunks in large glass bowl. Halve mushrooms lengthwise and combine with chicken. Add 5 tablespoons salad dressing. Stir gently but well. Cover and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours, stirring once or twice. Thread 8 skewers, alternating 3 chicken chunks and 2 mushroom halves (If using wooden skewers soak in cold water for 30 minutes before using). Place kabobs on heated grill. Grill for 5 minutes or until bottom side of chicken is golden brown. Brush kabobs with remaining 1 tablespoon salad dressing. Turn over and grill for 3 to 5 minutes or until chicken is well browned and cooked through. Cooking time will vary. To test, cut into a chicken chunk to make sure it's not raw in the center.
