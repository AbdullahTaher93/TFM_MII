Mix chickpea flour, cinnamon, baking powder, stevia powder, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk milk, egg whites, and vegetable oil together in a separate bowl. Pour over the chickpea flour mixture; whisk until batter is just combined. Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Pour 1/2 cup portions onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
