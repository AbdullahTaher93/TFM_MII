Heat the oven to 425 degrees F. Oil two 12-inch pizza pans or large baking sheets. Press the pizza dough into an approximately 12-inch round, or 9-by-13-inch rectangle, on each prepared pan. Bake until the dough begins to brown, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, line a strainer with several paper towels. Put the drained clams in the strainer and press gently to remove excess moisture. Spread the clams on the partially baked pizza crusts, sprinkle with the garlic, red-pepper flakes, and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and drizzle with 3 tablespoons of the oil. Bake the pizzas for 8 to 10 minutes. Do not overcook or the clams will toughen. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, toss the greens with the cherry tomatoes, the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, the vinegar, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and the black pepper. Remove the pizzas from the oven and top with the salad.
