Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Slowly cook and stir onions, garlic and rosemary until soft. In a food processor, blend the onion mixture, great northern beans, white wine vinegar, red pepper and salt until smooth. Transfer the mixture to a medium baking dish and garnish with paprika. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven 25 minutes, or until hot and bubbly.
