Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking dish with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Rub remaining olive oil over the fish fillets and place into the baking dish. Season fish with garlic powder, salt, and black pepper; top with minced garlic. Drizzle lime juice over the fish. Arrange lemon slices, tomato slices, onion slices, and bell pepper slices atop the fish. Cover baking dish tightly with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 30 to 40 minutes.
