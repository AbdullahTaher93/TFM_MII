Place shrimp, olive oil, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a resealable plastic bag. Coat shrimp with oil mixture, squeeze out excess air, and seal bag. Marinate in refrigerator for up to 4 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Cook shrimp on preheated grill until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 5 minutes per side. Peel shrimp. Serve with cocktail sauce and lemon wedges.
