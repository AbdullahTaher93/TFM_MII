Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a Dutch oven, saute the ground beef and onion for 5 to 10 minutes, or until beef is browned; drain excess fat. Stir in the bacon, baked beans, lima beans, kidney beans, ketchup, brown sugar and mustard. Mix all together well and cover. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 1 hour.
