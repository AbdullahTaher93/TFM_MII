Heat the oven to 425 degrees F. Spray a 17x11-inch roasting pan or shallow baking sheet with the cooking spray. Stir the potatoes, carrots, celery root, rutabaga, onions, parsnips, garlic, rosemary and oil in the prepared pan. Roast the vegetables for 30 minutes. Pour the broth over the vegetables and stir. Roast for 20 minutes more or until the vegetables are fork-tender.
