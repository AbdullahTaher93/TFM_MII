Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Melt 1/4 cup butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add brown sugar; cook 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low. Add pecans, walnuts, cinnamon, salt, honey and maple syrup; mix well. Cook 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat; stir in maple flavor. Cool 15 minutes. Sprinkle 3 teaspoons of the flour over work surface. Unroll dough onto floured surface; press perforations to seal. Sprinkle with remaining 2 teaspoons flour. Roll to form 18x12-inch rectangle. Carefully spoon and spread pecan mixture evenly over 1 long side of dough in 4-inch-wide strip, spreading to within 1/2 inch of edges. Starting with topped side, carefully roll up dough. (There may be small breaks in dough.) Spoon 1 tablespoon of the melted butter diagonally on ungreased large cookie sheet. Place filled roll, seam side down, over butter on cookie sheet. Pinch ends to seal. Gently flatten dough until 3 inches wide. Brush top and sides with remaining tablespoon melted butter. Sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar. Bake at 375 degrees F for 16 to 18 minutes or until golden brown. Cool 25 minutes. Cut lengthwise into 2 long pieces. Cut each half into 1-inch slices. Serve warm or cool.
