Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups. Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and ginger together in a bowl. Beat yogurt, pumpkin puree, sugar, and eggs together in a large mixing bowl until smooth. Fold sultana raisins into the yogurt mixture. Stir dry mixture into the wet mixture; pour into prepared muffin cups to about 3/4 full. Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in pans for 5 minutes before transferring to a serving platter.
