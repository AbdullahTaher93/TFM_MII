Rub tenderloin with 1-2 teaspoons of oil and the garlic. Combine the flour, salt and pepper; sprinkle over tenderloin and shake off excess. In a skillet, brown tenderloin on all sides in remaining oil. Remove and keep warm. In the same skillet, saute mushrooms until tender; remove and set aside. Wrap bacon around tenderloin, securing the ends with toothpicks. Return to skillet. Cook over medium heat until bacon is crisp and a thermometer inserted into tenderloin reads 160 degrees F, turning frequently. Remove and keep warm. In a small bowl, combine cornstarch and broth until smooth; add to skillet. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Add parsley and reserved mushrooms; cook and stir until heated through. Discard toothpicks from tenderloin; serve with mushroom sauce.
