Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Using a 12-cup muffin pan or two 6-cup muffin pans, line each cup with a wonton wrapper. Brush wonton wrappers with a little butter. Place a second wrapper diagonally on top of each of the first ones, making sure that the points of the wrappers make sides to the cup. Brush second wrapper with a little butter. Bake 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool. Remove from pan. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of all-fruit spread into each wonton shell. Place yogurt in a medium bowl. Fold in 1 cup berries. Spoon yogurt mixture evenly into wonton shells. Top with remaining 1/4 cup berries.
