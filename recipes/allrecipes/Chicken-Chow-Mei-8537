In a wok or skillet, melt butter or margarine over medium heat. Add mushrooms, celery, onions and garlic powder; cook until the onions have wilted. Add chicken broth and baby corn. Continue cooking until celery is cooked but still crisp. Stir in the green beans or bean sprouts and soy sauce. Mix cornstarch and water together in a small bowl. Slowly stir into vegetables. Sauce should start to thicken a little. Mix in chicken, and heat through.
