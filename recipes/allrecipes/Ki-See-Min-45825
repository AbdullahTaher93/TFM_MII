Melt butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Saute onion until soft and translucent, but don't brown. Stir in celery, frozen beans, and cabbage. Add ground sirloin, and cook until the meat is evenly browned. Add soup mix, enough water to barely cover and soy sauce. Reduce heat, and simmer for 15 minutes.
