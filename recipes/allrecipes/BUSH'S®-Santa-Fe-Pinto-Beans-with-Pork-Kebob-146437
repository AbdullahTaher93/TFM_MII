Slice pork into one-inch cubes, place 4-5 cubes on skewers and grill until pork is cooked to an internal temperature of 170 degrees F. In a large skillet, saute the green pepper, onion, and garlic in oil for 3 minutes. Stir in the broth and cumin. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Add black beans, pinto beans, tomatoes, corn and vinegar. Heat thoroughly. Serve with grilled pork tenderloin kebobs.
