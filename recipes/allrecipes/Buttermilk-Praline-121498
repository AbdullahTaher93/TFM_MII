In a heavy 3-qt. saucepan, combine sugar, buttermilk and baking soda. Cook and stir over medium heat until a candy thermometer reads 210 degrees F. Stir in butter and pecans; cook until thermometer reads 230 degrees F. Remove from the heat; add vanilla. Beat with a wooden spoon until mixture loses its gloss and begins to set, about 8 minutes. Quickly drop by teaspoonfuls onto foil-lined baking sheets. Cool.
