Place rice and water in a pot, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium casserole dish. Place gizzards in a pot with enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Cook 15 minutes. Drain, and dice. Heat olive oil in a skillet, and cook the onion, mushroom, garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes until tender. Mix in the cooked gizzards, and cook until lightly browned. Transfer mixture to the prepared casserole dish, and stir in the rice. Top with Parmesan cheese. Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly.
