Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Combine turkey, garlic, basil, oregano, lemon rind, egg and bread crumbs in a large bowl. Shape into 1 1/2-inch balls. Place on a lightly greased baking sheet. Bake 25 minutes. Always cook turkey to well-done, 165 degrees F as measured by a meat thermometer. Let meatballs stand 10 minutes. Toss meatballs and heated pasta sauce in a large bowl. Serve over pasta. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, if desired.
