Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Whisk 1/4 cup vanilla sugar, matzo cake meal and lemon zest in a medium bowl. Beat egg whites, salt and lemon juice in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until frothy. Increase speed to high and beat until soft peaks form. Add remaining 3/4 cup vanilla sugar 1 Tbsp. at a time, beating until glossy and stiff peaks form. Fold dry ingredients into beaten whites with a rubber spatula. Scrape batter into an ungreased 10-inch angel food cake pan. Run a spatula in a circle through batter to release air bubbles; smooth the top. Bake cake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until top springs back when touched lightly and a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean. (The top of the cake will be cracked.) Invert the cake to cool completely. (If the pan has no legs, invert it over the neck of a glass bottle.) With a knife, loosen edges of cake and invert onto a serving platter.
