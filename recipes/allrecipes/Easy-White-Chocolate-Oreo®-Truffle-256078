Line a large baking sheet with waxed paper. Place all of the sandwich cookies in a food processor; pulse into fine crumbs. Combine cookie crumbs and cream cheese in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until a soft dough forms. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beaters with a spatula to ensure even mixing. Roll dough mixture into 1-inch balls; set on the waxed paper. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Melt white chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 1-minute intervals, stirring after each interval, 3 to 4 minutes. Dip balls in melted white chocolate using 2 forks. Return to the waxed paper. Refrigerate until white chocolate is set, about 30 minutes.
