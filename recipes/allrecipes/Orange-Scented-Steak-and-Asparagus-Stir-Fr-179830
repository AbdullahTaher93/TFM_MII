Cut asparagus into 1 1/2-inch lengths. In a 12- to 14-inch frying pan, bring 2 cups of water to a simmer over high heat. Add asparagus stalks and simmer 2 minutes. Add asparagus tips and simmer until all asparagus is bright green and barely tender when pierced, about 2 minutes more. Drain asparagus; immediately rinse with cold water until cool. Drain again and set aside. Wipe pan clean. To pan, add half the sesame oil and place over medium-high heat. When pan is very hot, add orange peel and stir just until peel is fragrant, about 10 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. To same pan, add onion and stir until softened but not browned, about 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add remaining oil and beef strips to pan; stir just until browned, about 2 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside. In a small bowl, mix cornstarch with broth, soy sauce, sherry, garlic, and ginger until smooth. Pour into pan and stir until sauce thickens. Return asparagus, orange peel, onion, and beef to pan and stir just until heated through. Serve over rice.
