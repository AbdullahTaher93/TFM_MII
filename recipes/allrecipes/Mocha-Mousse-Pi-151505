Combine cream cheese and 1/2 cup mocha topping with an electric mixer about 2 minutes, until well blended. Add powdered sugar; mix. Fold in half of the whipped topping. Carefully spread the mixture onto prepared crust. Pour the remaining mocha topping over pie filling. Drag a knife through the filling to create a marbled effect. Spread remaining whipped topping over entire pie. Garnish with cocoa powder or chocolate curls. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
