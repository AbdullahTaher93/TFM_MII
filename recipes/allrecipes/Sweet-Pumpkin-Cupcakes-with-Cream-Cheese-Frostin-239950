Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or line 24 muffin cups with paper liners. Beat cake mix, eggs, water, and canola oil together in a bowl using a hand mixer on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add pumpkin and beat until batter is smooth; pour into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Place cupcakes on a wire rack to cool completely. Beat cream cheese and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth; add vanilla extract and beat until smooth. Beat confectioners' sugar, 1/4 cup at a time, into cream cheese mixture until frosting is smooth and creamy. Refrigerate frosting until chilled, at least 30 minutes. Spread frosting onto cupcakes and refrigerate frosted cupcakes until chilled, at least 1 hour.
