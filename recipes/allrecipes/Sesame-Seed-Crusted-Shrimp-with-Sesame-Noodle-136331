In a small bowl, whisk egg yolk with 1 tablespoon water, and set aside. In another small bowl, combine sesame seeds, flour, salt, pepper, and five-spice powder. Dip shrimp in the egg mixture then in the sesame-seed mixture to coat. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add shrimp; saute until cooked through and sesame-seed crust is golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Serve shrimp on a bed of sesame noodles.
