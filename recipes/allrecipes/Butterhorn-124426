In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. In another bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water; add to crumb mixture. Add milk; mix well. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Divide dough into four equal portions. On a lightly floured surface, roll one portion into a 12-in. circle. Brush with 1 tablespoon melted butter; cut into 12 pie-shaped wedges. Roll up, beginning with the wide end, and place on greased baking sheets. Repeat with remaining dough. Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks.
