In a 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat, bring 4 quarts water to a boil. While water heats, rinse crabs and fish and pat dry; cut fish into 1- to 1 1/2-inch pieces. Add butter and olive oil to a 12- to 14-inch frying pan (with at least 2 1/2-inch sides) or a 14-inch wok over medium-high heat; when butter is melted, add garlic and stir just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add fish and turn pieces occasionally until beginning to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in sherry and lemon juice, then gently add crabs and sprinkle with parsley. Cover and simmer until crabs are hot and fish is opaque in center (cut to test), about 5 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Meanwhile, add pasta to boiling water; cook, stirring occasionally, until barely tender to bite, about 3 minutes. Drain pasta well and spread in the bottom of a wide serving bowl. Pour crab mixture over pasta and garnish with lemon wedges. Serve with baguette slices to sop up sauce.
