If using white sesame seeds, in a small skillet, toast them over moderate heat until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool. In a small bowl, whisk together the miso paste, soy sauce, scallions, rice vinegar, lemon juice, sugar and chile. Whisk in the olive oil and stir in the cilantro; season with salt and pepper. Using a mandoline, cut the zucchini lengthwise into paper-thin slices. In a very large bowl, toss the zucchini with the dressing. Transfer to a platter. Scatter the nori and toasted sesame seeds on top and serve right away.
