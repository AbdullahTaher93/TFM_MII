In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add the eggs and extracts; mix well. Combine flour, baking powder and salt; add to creamed mixture and mix well. Cover and chill the dough for at least 2 hours. Divide dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll each half into a 12-in. x 9-in. rectangle. Combine jam, coconut and pecans; spread over rectangles. Carefully roll up, starting with the long end, into a tight jelly roll. Wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight or freeze for 2-3 hours. Cut into 1/4-in. slices; place on greased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool cookies on wire racks.
