Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, mix together the flour, seasoned salt, ground black pepper and garlic powder to taste. Cut the steak into 3x3 inch squares and coat with the flour mixture. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the steaks and saute until browned on both sides. Remove meat and set aside in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Add the soup, water, onion and bouillon to the skillet, allow to heat through and pour over the meat. In a separate small bowl, combine the stuffing mix, water and butter or margarine. Mix well and spread over the steaks and gravy. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for at least one hour, or until steak is tender.
