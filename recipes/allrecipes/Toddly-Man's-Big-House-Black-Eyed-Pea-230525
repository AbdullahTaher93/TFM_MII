Fill a large pot with water and soak black-eyed peas overnight. Pour out soaking liquid, cover black-eyed peas with fresh water, and drain. Add turkey wings to black-eyed peas. Set pot over medium heat and pour 14 cups turkey stock into peas; bring to a boil. Stir celery and red pepper flakes into peas; reduce heat to low. Simmer for 30 minutes. Remove turkey wings and set aside; chop turkey meat when cool. Pour 2 cups more turkey stock into peas as needed and stir chopped turkey wing meat, onions, and carrots into mixture. Bring back to a simmer and stir black pepper, salt, and garlic powder (if using) into black-eyed peas. Simmer for 1 1/2 more hours. Toss diced kielbasa into black-eyed peas, simmer until black-eyed peas and vegetables are tender, about 10 more minutes, and serve.
