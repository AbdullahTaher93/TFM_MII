Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; add spinach and turn using tongs, until coated with oil. Cook, while turning, until just wilted, about 4 minutes. Add chicken broth, golden raisins, garlic powder, black pepper, and Parmesan cheese. Cook and stir spinach mixture until cheese is melted and raisins are plump, 1 to 2 minutes.
