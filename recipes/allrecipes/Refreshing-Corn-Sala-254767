Fill a bowl with ice water. Stir sugar into a large pot filled with water; bring to a boil. Add corn; cook until kernels are softened, about 2 minutes. Drain and transfer corn to ice water until cooled; drain. Cut kernels from the cob with a sharp knife. Combine corn, Roma tomatoes, red bell pepper, and green onions in a bowl.
