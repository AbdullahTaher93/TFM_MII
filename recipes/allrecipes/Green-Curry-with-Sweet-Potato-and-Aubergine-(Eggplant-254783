Heat oil in a large wok or skillet over medium heat. Add onion and curry paste; cook and stir until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Stir in eggplant; cook until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour coconut milk and vegetable stock onto the eggplant mixture. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in sweet potato and lime leaves; cook and stir until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Mix in lime juice, lime zest, and brown sugar; stir until combined. Season with salt; garnish with shredded lime leaf and cilantro.
