In a 2-quart microwave-safe bowl, mix the turkey and bell pepper with the oil until good and greasy. Cover tightly with plastic wrap. Nuke for 4 to 6 minutes, stirring once, until the turkey is almost white in the middle. Mix in the rest of the ingredients. With the dish uncovered, nuke for 25 to 30 minutes-long in microwave time, but the stew needs to thicken-until the sauce is bubbly and not watery. (Stir a few times during cooking.)
