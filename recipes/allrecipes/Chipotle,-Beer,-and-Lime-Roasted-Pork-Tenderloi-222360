Stir beer, lime juice, chipotle peppers, garlic, olive oil, and Worcestershire sauce together in a bowl; let sit 1 hour. Place pork tenderloins in a baking dish; pour marinade over tenderloins. Refrigerate 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cook in preheated oven until pork is slightly pink in the center, about 90 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
