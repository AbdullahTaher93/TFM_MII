Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook onions and peppers 7-8 minutes or until they begin to richly brown on edges, stirring occasionally. Stir in the potatoes and corn, cook 3 minutes to heat through. Remove from heat, cover and let stand 3 minutes to absorb flavors. Stir before serving. Salt and pepper to taste, if desired.
