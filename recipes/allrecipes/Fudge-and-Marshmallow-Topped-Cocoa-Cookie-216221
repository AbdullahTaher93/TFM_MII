Make cookie dough as directed on package, adding cocoa. Drop dough with by tablespoonfuls about 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Flatten each cookie to 1/4-inch with a greased bottomed glass, dipped in 2 tablespoons sugar. Bake at 375 degrees F 7 to 9 minutes. Immediately top each cookie with 1 marshmallow. Return to oven; bake 2 minutes longer until marshmallow is soft. Lightly press each marshmallow to flatten. Cool; place cookies on cooling racks. Cool completely. Heat in saucepan, 1 cup sugar, 1/4 cup butter and milk over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture boils. Boil 1 minute. Remove from heat; cool 5 minutes. Stir in chocolate chips until melted. Stir in water until frosting is smooth and spreadable. (Frosting sets up quickly, so thin as necessary with additional water.) Swirl 1 tablespoon frosting on top of each cookie. Top with candy sprinkles. Let stand until frosting is set.
