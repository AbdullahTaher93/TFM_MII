In large saucepan melt butter over low heat. Add marshmallows and stir until completely melted. Remove from heat. To turn the mixture a fun color, stir in a few drops of food coloring, if desired. Add Kellogg's(R) Rice Krispies(R) cereal. Stir until well coated. Using 1/2 cup measuring cup coated with cooking spray divide warm cereal mixture into portions. Using buttered hands shape each portion into a circular shape. Decorate with frosting and/or candies. Best if served the same day.
