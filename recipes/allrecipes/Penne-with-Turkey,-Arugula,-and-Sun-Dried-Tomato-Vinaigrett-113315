In a blender, combine the sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper. Blend until a paste forms. With the machine running, add the 1/3 cup oil in a thin stream. Sprinkle the turkey with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon each of the salt and pepper. In a large frying pan, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil over moderate heat. Cook the turkey, in two batches if necessary, until just cooked through, about 3 minutes. Do not overcook. Transfer the turkey to a large bowl and add the arugula. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the penne until just done, about 13 minutes. Drain, toss with the turkey and arugula and the tomato vinaigrette, and serve warm.
