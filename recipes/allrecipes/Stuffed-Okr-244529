Combine mango powder, ginger, cumin, turmeric, chili powder, salt, and 1/2 teaspoon oil together in a bowl; set aside for flavors to blend for 2 hours. Heat vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Trim okra and make a slit lengthwise down the side of each okra, creating a pocket. Fill each pocket with the spice mixture. Place corn flour in a resealable plastic bag; add filled okra and shake to coat. Fry okra in the hot oil until golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer fried okra using a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate.
