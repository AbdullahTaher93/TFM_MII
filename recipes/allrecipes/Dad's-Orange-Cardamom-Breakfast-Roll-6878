Zest the orange; set zest aside. Peal and seed orange; cut orange fruit into chunks. Combine zest and fruit in a blender and puree. Pour orange pulp into bread machine pan. Add honey, oil, white flour, wheat flour, salt, and yeast to the orange pulp. Select dough setting, and start the bread machine. Adjust consistency with orange juice or flour as needed to achieve a soft pliable dough. When dough cycle is complete divide dough into 2 or 3 pieces. Roll out to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Sprinkle with brown sugar, cardamom, and dried cranberries. Roll up dough with goodies inside, and slice 1 to 2 inches thick. Place rolls in a baking pan coated with non-stick spray. Allow enough room between the rolls so that they rise properly. Let rise in a warm spot for approximately 1 hour. Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from pan, and place on wire rack. Serve warm.
