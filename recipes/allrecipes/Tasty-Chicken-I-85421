Preheat the oven broiler. Melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat, and mix in the lemon juice, salt, paprika, oregano, garlic powder, and pepper. Arrange chicken in a shallow baking dish. Pour the sauce evenly over the chicken. Cook 20 minutes in the preheated oven, turning and basting occasionally with the sauce, until chicken juices run clear.
