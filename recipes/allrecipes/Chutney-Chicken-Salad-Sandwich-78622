In a large bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, chutney, curry powder, lime zest, lime juice and salt. Add chicken and toss with the dressing until well coated. Add more mayonnaise to taste, if desired. Cover and refrigerate for 15 minutes, or until serving. Spoon about 1/2 cup of the salad onto 8 slices of bread. Top with pineapple slices, romaine lettuce leaves and remaining slices of bread.
