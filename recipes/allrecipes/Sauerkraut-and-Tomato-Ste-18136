In a large pot over medium heat, saute the onion and green bell pepper in the oil for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the onion is translucent. Pour in the tomatoes, water and rice. Raise heat to high and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Stir in the sauerkraut and sausage, stirring thoroughly, and let simmer for 20 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
