Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Put the whey powder and butter in a mixing bowl and blend (a pastry cutter is useful here but a big wooden spoon will do the trick too if the butter is soft enough.) Beat the eggs very well with a whisk or hand mixer. Add to the whey and butter, mixing well. Add the remaining ingredients and mix by hand. On a parchment paper lined cookie sheet, place 4 heaps of batter. The batter will be quite gooey and will want to spread. Try to heap the batter as high as possible (I prefer log shape) and get them into the preheated oven quickly. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10 minutes. The bottoms will brown some but the tops will be a light buttery color.
