Unroll crescent roll dough and separate into eight rectangles. Place on an ungreased baking sheet and press perforations together. Combine the remaining ingredients; spoon 1/4 cupful onto the center of each rectangle. Bring edges to the center; pinch to seal. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until golden.
