In the container of a blender, combine the eggs, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, a pinch of salt and a dash of hot sauce. Cover and pulse to mix. Start the blender on medium speed and let run while pouring in the olive oil, and then the vegetable oil, in a thin continuous stream until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon. Pour in the Worcestershire sauce and blend for about 10 seconds more. Taste and adjust salt if needed. Arrange the frozen beef on a serving plate in a semi-circle. Drizzle the sauce over the meat. Garnish with capers and freshly ground black pepper and squeeze a little lemon juice over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
