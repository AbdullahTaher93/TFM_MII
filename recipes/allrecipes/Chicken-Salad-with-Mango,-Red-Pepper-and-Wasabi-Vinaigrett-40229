Season chicken strips with Szechwan seasoning and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Heat vegetable oil over medium heat in a large, nonstick skillet. Saute chicken 7 minutes, or until done. Remove chicken and keep warm. Prepare vinaigrette by whisking together vinegar, olive oil, wasabi powder, honey, lime juice, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Combine chicken strips, cilantro, green onions, red bell pepper, and mango in a large bowl. Toss gently with wasabi vinaigrette. Place on chilled salad plates lined with bibb lettuce.
