For custard, in a heavy medium saucepan combine sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Stir in 2 cups LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk. Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture is thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Remove from heat. Gradually whisk about half of the hot mixture into the beaten egg yolks. Return all of the egg mixture to the saucepan. Cook and stir until bubbly. Reduce heat to low. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Remove from heat. Quickly cool the custard by placing the saucepan into a bowl half-filled with ice water for 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl. Stir in Marsala or vanilla and 2 tablespoons LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk. Cover the surface with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 2 to 24 hours. To serve, spoon berries into 6 dessert dishes. Top with custard.
