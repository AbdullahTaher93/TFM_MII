In a small saucepan, saute onion and garlic in butter until tender. Stir in vinegar, lime juice, sugar, curry powder, salt and cayenne pepper. Place chicken in a large resealable plastic bag or glass 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish; cover with sauce. Cover or close bag and refrigerate at least 2 hours. Drain, discarding marinade. Grill chicken, uncovered, over medium coals, turning once, for 10-15 minutes or until juices run clear.
