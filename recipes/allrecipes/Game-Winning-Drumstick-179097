Place the chicken in a single layer into a 15x10-inch disposable foil pan. Stir the stock and mustard in a small bowl. Pour the stock mixture over the chicken and turn to coat. Sprinkle the bread crumbs over the chicken. Cover the pan and refrigerate for 4 hours. Bake at 375 degrees F for 1 hour or until the chicken is cooked through. Serve hot or at room temperature.
