In a large bowl, combine flour, brown sugar, baking soda and salt. Add buttermilk, butter, vanilla and maple flavoring if desired, stirring until well mixed. Spread into six greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes. Cool. Break into pieces and process in batches in a food processor until pieces are small. Return to baking pans and bake at 250 degrees F for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes, or until light brown and crisp. Serve as a cereal with milk. Store in an airtight container.
