In a Dutch oven or large frying pan, cook and stir ground beef until brown. Add garlic, tomato sauce, gravy, cream, Parmesan cheese, oregano and basil. Simmer for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling water until al dente. Drain. Combine the cooked ziti and the sauce, and spread into a greased 9x13 baking dish. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 30 minutes, until bubbly.
