Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with butter. Combine sausage, pumpkin, onion, and sun-dried tomatoes in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until sausage is browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer sausage mixture to a large bowl. Mix in bread, heavy cream, Cheddar cheese, eggs, milk, Gruyere cheese, salt, and pepper. Spread mixture in the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and golden, 30 to 45 minutes.
