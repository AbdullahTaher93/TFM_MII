In a medium bowl, mix the ground beef, oats, milk, 2 tablespoons minced onion, salt, and pepper. Let stand for a few minutes until milk is absorbed, and shape into 8 patties. In a small bowl, thoroughly mix the Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, sugar, ketchup, and 1/4 cup chopped onion; set aside. Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat, and fry the patties until brown on both sides. Pour the sauce in with the patties, and reduce heat. Continue cooking about 15 minutes.
