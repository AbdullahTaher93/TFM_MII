Heat oil in a large pot or deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Combine gluten free pancake mix, onions, celery, coconut, gluten free crackers, lobster meat, seafood seasoning, baking powder, salt, and ground black pepper in a bowl. Combine eggs, evaporated milk, and butter in a separate bowl. Stir egg mixture into dry mixture to form a batter. Drop batter by rounded tablespoons into hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove and drain fritters on a rack.
