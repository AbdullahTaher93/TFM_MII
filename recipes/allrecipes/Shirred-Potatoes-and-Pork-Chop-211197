Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish. Whisk together the milk, flour, butter, salt, and pepper in a saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring until the mixture thickens, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove the white sauce from the heat. Heat a skillet over medium heat, and sear the pork chops on both sides in the hot skillet just until browned, about 5 minutes. Set the pork chops aside. Place about 2/3 of the shredded potatoes into the prepared baking dish. Potatoes should fill about 2/3 of the dish. Top with the seared pork chops, and top with the remaining shredded potatoes. Pour the white sauce over the casserole. Bake in the preheated oven for 3 hours.
