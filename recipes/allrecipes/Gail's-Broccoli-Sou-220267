Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot; cook and stir the onion in the hot oil until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour water and chicken bouillon cubes to the pot; cook and stir until the bouillon dissolves, about 4 minutes. Stir the potato and carrot into the mixture in the pot; cook another 4 minutes. Pour milk into the pot; add broccoli, garlic, chives, bay leaf, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper to the mixture, stir, and cook until warm, about 4 minutes. Stir the sliced processed cheese food into the soup, bring to a simmer, and cook and stir until the cheese food is melted completely into the soup, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking until the potatoes and carrots are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove and discard the bay leaf to serve.
