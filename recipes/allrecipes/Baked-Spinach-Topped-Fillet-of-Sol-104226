Rinse the fillets under cold water; pat dry with paper towel. Arrange fish in shallow baking dish. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 1 tablespoon chives; season with 1/2 teaspoon Morton(R) Kosher Salt. Reserve eight spinach leaves; coarsely chop remaining spinach. In large bowl, combine chopped spinach, rice, tomatoes, carrots and remaining 1/2 teaspoon Morton(R) Kosher Salt. Top each fillet evenly with layer of rice/spinach mixture; cover with reserved spinach leaves. Drizzle top with oil and remaining tablespoon lemon juice. Cover dish with foil; bake at 375 degrees F until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes. Serve with prepared Hollandaise sauce and additional snipped chives, if desired.
