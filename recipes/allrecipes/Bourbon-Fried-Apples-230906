Combine water, butter, and Bourbon in a large skillet over medium heat; stir until butter melts. Add apples, raisins, brown sugar, and cinnamon; stir to coat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring frequently, until apples have softened and liquid has reduced to a syrup, about 10 minutes. Stir lemon juice into apples and serve warm.
