For salmon burgers, in a food processor fitted with the metal blade, pulse the salmon until coarsely ground, scraping down the sides of the work bowl once or twice. (Be careful; its easy to go from chopped to a mashed paste in seconds!) Transfer the salmon to a medium bowl. Add the ginger, garlic, green onions, cilantro, salt, lemon juice and soy sauce. Using a rubber spatula, mix to combine. Mix in the cracker meal; add the eggs. Stir to combine. Dividing the salmon mixture evenly; form into four 1-inch-thick patties. Refrigerate for at least 20 minutes before cooking. (The patties can be prepared up to 8 hours ahead. Transfer to a covered container and refrigerate.) In a large, heavy skillet, preferably cast-iron, heat the oil over medium-high heat and swirl to coat the pan. (You can also use a grill pan.) Add the salmon patties and cook until golden brown on one side, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook until opaque throughout and golden brown on the other side, about 3 minutes longer. Top each burger with a slice of cheese. Serve the salmon burgers on the toasted buns with the lettuce and Green Onion and Soy Sauce Mayonnaise. For the Green Onion and Soy Sauce Mayonnaise, in a small bowl mix the mayonnaise, green onion, lemon juice and soy sauce until well blended. Cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day.
