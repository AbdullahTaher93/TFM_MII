Rub fish pieces with peanut oil. Sprinkle with pepper and set aside. In a 6- to 8-inch frying pan over medium-high heat, stir ginger in sesame oil until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in soy sauce, rice vinegar, sherry, sugar, lime juice, and garlic. In a medium bowl, mix peas, carrots, and cabbage. Add half the soy sauce mixture and toss until coated. Arrange equal portions of cabbage mixture and tomatoes on 4 plates. Place a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over high heat. When pan is hot, add salad oil and oiled fish. (Cook in batches if necessary.) Turn once or twice to brown and cook to your liking (cut to test). For the most succulent fish, remove from heat while still slightly translucent in the center, allowing about 3 minutes total for rare and 5 to 6 minutes total for even cooking. Turn on fan while cooking; drippings may scorch and smoke. Set cooked fish on plates with slaw and tomatoes. Spoon remaining soy sauce mixture over fish and vegetables.
