In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the butter and oil. Brown the chicken on both sides, remove and set aside (5 minutes per side). This should be done in two batches so as not to crowd the chicken slowing the browning process (unless your skillet is big enough). Set chicken aside. Reduce the heat to medium; add to the skillet the shallots, garlic and mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms are tender. Add the Marsala wine and cook for a full minute scraping up any of the delicious brown bits still clinging to the pan. Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil. Add the chicken and parsley. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 10-15 minutes. Serve immediately.
