Place the chicken in a greased or foil-lined 9-in. square baking pan. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine remaining ingredients; cook and stir over low heat until well blended and heated through. Pour over chicken. Bake, uncovered, 30-35 minutes longer or until chicken juices run clear. Baste before serving.
