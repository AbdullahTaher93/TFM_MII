In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the lime juice, oil, garlic, cumin, oregano and pepper; add pork. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate overnight. Drain and discard marinade. Grill pork, uncovered, over indirect medium heat for 6-7 minutes on each side or until juices run clear. In a bowl, combine the salsa ingredients. Serve with the pork.
