Bring the rice and water to boil in a pot. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 20 minutes. Heat the oil in a wok, and cook the onion, garlic, and green chile until tender. Mix in the carrot and celery. Stir in the rice, and mix in kecap manis, tomato sauce, and soy sauce. Continue cooking about 1 minute, until heated through. Transfer to bowls, and garnish with cucumber slices. Place eggs in the wok, and cook until set. Place in the bowls over the rice and vegetables.
