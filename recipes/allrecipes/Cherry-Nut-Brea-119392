In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add egg yolks and vanilla; mix well. Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt; add to the creamed mixture alternately with buttermilk just until blended (batter will be thick). In a small mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold into batter. Fold in cherries and pecans. Transfer to four greased and floured 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean and loaves are golden brown. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
