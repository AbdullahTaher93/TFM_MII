In a large bowl, combine the flour, bacon, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, whisk the egg, milk, oil and syrup until moistened. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire tack. Refrigerate leftovers.
