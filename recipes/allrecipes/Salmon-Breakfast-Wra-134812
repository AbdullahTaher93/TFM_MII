Coat the frying pan with nonstick cooking spray, heat it, then toss in the ingredients, except for the tortilla, and scramble. Arrange all ingredients in a line close to the center of the tortilla. Fold two opposite sides of the tortilla toward the center, so their edges meet (but don't overlap). Use your palms to compress into a tight mound under the tortilla. Fold one loose end into the center. The wrap will look like an overstuffed envelope. Press the contents down into the tortilla shell and fold the remaining loose end over the other.
