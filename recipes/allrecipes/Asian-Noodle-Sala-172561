Break up dry noodle bricks (discard seasoning packets). In a 3- to 4-quart pan, bring 2 quarts water to a boil over high heat. Add noodles; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain, rinse noodles under cool water, then drain again. In a large salad bowl, mix together vinegar, sugar, lime juice, oil, garlic, chili paste, and salt; stir until sugar dissolves. Add cooled noodles, cilantro, carrot, and peanuts. Lightly combine to coat noodles well. Serve.
