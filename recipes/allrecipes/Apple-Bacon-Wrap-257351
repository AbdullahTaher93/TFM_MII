Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Place a tortilla on a work surface and drizzle 1 tablespoon honey down the middle of the tortilla; top with 3 bacon pieces. Layer 2 tablespoons Cheddar cheese over bacon and top with 2 slices ham and 1/4 of the sliced apples. Roll tortilla around filling. Repeat to create 3 more wraps.
