Place quartered pickles in a clean 1-quart canning jar. Set aside. Combine remaining ingredients in a small saucepan. Simmer over low heat until salt dissolves. Pour hot pickling juice over pickles to fill jar. Cover tightly with lid and refrigerate 4-5 days before serving. Pickle flavor and sweetness intensity increase over time.
