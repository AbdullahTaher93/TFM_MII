Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly spray a rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray. Toss carrots in a bowl with the oil to coat. Transfer to a prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Roast in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Pour Swanson(R) Chicken Broth evenly over carrots; continue to cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Mix yogurt, honey, almond milk, and sriracha sauce together in a bowl to make a thin drizzling sauce. Transfer roasted carrots to a serving dish; drizzle with the honey-sriracha sauce.
