Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, mix salsa and mayonnaise; set aside. In a Dutch oven or deep skillet, heat oil over medium high heat until it reaches 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). While the oil heats up, whisk beer, flour and salt in a medium bowl until smooth. Using a fork, coat fish pieces in batter. Working in 2 batches, slide coated fish into hot oil. Fry until golden, about 4 minutes per batch. Lift out with a slotted spoon and drain briefly on paper towels; keep warm. In a dry hot skillet, warm corn tortillas individually for 1-2 minutes per side. Stack on top of each other and keep warm in the oven. To assemble, place 2 corn tortillas each on 4 individual plates. Put 1/2 cup of cabbage on each tortilla. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of the salsa mixture over each one. Evenly distribute fish pieces over the salsa and cabbage. Serve with lime wedges.
