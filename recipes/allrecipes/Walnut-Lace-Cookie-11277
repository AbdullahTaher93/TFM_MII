Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets. In a saucepan over low heat melt the butter with the cream, sugar and corn syrup. Add nuts and flour and bring mixture to a boil. Drop batter by tablespoonfuls onto buttered cookie sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until bubbly and golden, about 3 to 5 minutes. Let cool slightly before removing from baking sheet.
