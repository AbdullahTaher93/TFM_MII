Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a muffin pan with paper liners. In a bowl, lightly beat together the oil, milk, egg, and lemon juice. In a separate bowl, mix the lemon zest, all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, salt, baking powder, white sugar, and brown sugar. Mix strawberries into the flour mixture. Stir in the oil mixture just until moist. Fill muffin cups about 3/4 full with the batter. Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Allow to cool 10 minutes before removing from the muffin tin.
