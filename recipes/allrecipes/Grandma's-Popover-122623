In a bowl, combine flour and salt. Combine eggs and milk; whisk into dry ingredients just until blended. Using two 12-cup muffin tins, grease and flour five alternating cups of one tin and four cups of the second tin; fill two-thirds full with batter. Fill the empty cups two-thirds full with water. Bake at 450 degrees F for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (do not open oven door). Bake 15 minutes longer or until deep golden brown (do not underbake).
