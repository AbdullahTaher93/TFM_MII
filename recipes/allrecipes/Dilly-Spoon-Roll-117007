In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm milk. Stir in 1-1/2 cups flour, sugar, dill, salt, egg and oil. Beat until smooth. Beat in enough remaining flour to achieve a slightly sticky, thick batter. Do not knead. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Spoon batter into muffin cups coated with nonstick cooking spray. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 400 degrees F for 13-18 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks. Serve warm.
