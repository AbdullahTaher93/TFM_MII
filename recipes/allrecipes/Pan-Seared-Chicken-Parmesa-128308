Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). In a pie plate, combine flour, cornmeal, parsley, oregano, basil, and pepper. Coat chicken with mixture. Shake off excess. Coat a large nonstick skillet with nonstick spray. Warm over medium-high heat, then add chicken and brown for 3 minutes on each side. In a shallow baking dish, spread 1/2 cup (125 mL) tomato sauce. Place chicken in dish and top with remaining sauce. Sprinkle with Parmesan and mozzarella cheese. Bake until cheese is melted and chicken is no longer pink in the middle, about 20 minutes.
