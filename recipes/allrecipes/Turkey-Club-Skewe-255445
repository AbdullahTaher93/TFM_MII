Cook Bacon in a cold pan on low until crisp. While bacon is cooking, cut bread, D&W Originals Cheddar, D&W Originals Herbed Turkey, and lettuce into 2 inch squares. Cut slices of cooked bacon into thirds. On a 10- to 12-inch skewer, layer bread, lettuce, cheese, bacon and cherry tomato. Repeat once more, then top with last piece of bread. Serve with a side of D&W Hoagie Dressing for dipping.
