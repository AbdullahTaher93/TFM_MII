In a mortar or food processor, grind 1/4 cup walnuts to a paste. Turn out into a bowl and combine with oil, lemon juice, vinegar, garlic, and a pinch of salt. Whisk to blend. Let sit 30 minutes or up to 2 hours to allow flavors to blend. Fifteen minutes before serving, cook the beans in a covered saucepan in an inch of boiling water until just tender but still firm, about 5 to 7 minutes. Rinse with cold water, drain well, and place in a serving bowl. Whisk dressing vigorously; pour over beans, and toss. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt. Reserve 1 teaspoon cilantro; add remaining cilantro to beans and toss gently. Taste and adjust seasoning. Garnish with remaining walnuts and reserved cilantro. Serve warm or at room temperature.
