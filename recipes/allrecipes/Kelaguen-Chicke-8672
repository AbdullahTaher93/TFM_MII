Sprinkle chicken with salt and place pieces on a broiler pan. Broil for about 10 minutes, turn and broil for another 5 minutes or until chicken is cooked, but still moist. Bone, and finely chop cooked chicken pieces. In a medium bowl combine the chicken, lemon juice, coconut, and hot peppers. Chill for at least one hour and serve.
