Mix mascarpone cheese, whipping cream, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Melt chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Fold melted chocolate into the mascarpone cheese mixture. Refrigerate until set, 1 to 2 hours.
