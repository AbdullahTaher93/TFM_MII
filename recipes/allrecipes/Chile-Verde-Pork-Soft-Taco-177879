Combine pork, salt, onion, garlic, jalapeno, salsa verde, and 1 cup water in a slow-cooker set to High. Cook until pork is tender when pierced, about 4 to 5 hours. Skim any fat from surface, then remove meat from pot and coarsely shred. Return shredded meat to pot with sauce and stir in cilantro. Serve pork to spoon onto warm corn tortillas. Top with avocado and tomato (if desired) and wrap into a soft taco.
