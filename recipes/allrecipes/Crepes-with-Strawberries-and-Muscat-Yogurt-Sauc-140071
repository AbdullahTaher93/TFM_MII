In a small bowl, whisk the flour with the salt. Add the milk, egg and 1 tablespoon of oil and whisk until smooth. Cover and let rest for 20 minutes. In another small bowl, whisk the yogurt, honey, Muscat and zest. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat an 8-inch nonstick skillet. Rub the pan with an oiled paper towel. Add about 3 tablespoons of the crepe batter, swirling the pan to coat evenly; pour off any excess. Cook the crepe over moderate heat until the bottom is brown in spots and the sides are crisp, about 2 minutes. Flip the crepe and cook for 1 minute longer. Transfer to a baking sheet; repeat to make 7 more crepes. Fold the crepes into quarters and bake until hot, 4 minutes. Place 2 crepes on each plate. Top with the yogurt sauce and garnish with the strawberries. Dust with confectioners sugar and serve immediately.
