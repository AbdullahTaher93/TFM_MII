Toss together the green onion, daikon radish, and cucumber in a small bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, wasabi paste, and ground ginger. Lay to two tortillas onto a flat surface. Divide the rice and place in the center of each tortilla. Top each portion of rice with half of the salmon and half of the vegetable mixture. Drizzle half of the soy sauce mixture over each portion of vegetables. Sprinkle each with 1 teaspoon sesame seeds. Wrap the edges of the tortillas around the filling completely to serve.
