Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Rinse and pat dry the chicken. If you prefer to use fresh tarragon, the leaves can be simply stripped off the stems and left whole, but bruise them slightly to encourage their flavor. Cutting fresh tarragon makes them turn black and can give an off color to the dish. Use about 1 Tbsp worth. In a 9x9 baking dish, mix together the sour cream, sherry, mustard tarragon, salt and pepper. Add the chicken and turn them to coat well. Adjust the chicken so it forms just 1 layer. Cover and bake for 35 minutes. Serve immediately.
