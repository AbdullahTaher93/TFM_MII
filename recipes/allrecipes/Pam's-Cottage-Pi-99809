Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Heat oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions; saute until almost tender, about 3 minutes. Add beef and basil and continue to cook until beef loses its pink color, about 5 minutes. Add green beans, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard and Worcestershire; cook until heated through. Add salt and pepper to taste. Meanwhile, whisk egg into warmed mashed potatoes, then spread evenly over meat mixture. Bake in preheated oven until heated through and bubbly, about 20 minutes.
