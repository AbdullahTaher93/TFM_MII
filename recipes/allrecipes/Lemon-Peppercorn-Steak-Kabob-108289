If using wooden skewers, begin soaking in water. Rinse steaks and pat dry. Cut into 1 to 1 1/2inch chunks. Cut zucchini and yellow squash crosswise into 1/2inchthick rounds. Combine steak, squash, lemon peppercorn marinade, lemon peel, and dill in a heavy plastic food bag. Seal bag, turn to mix, and chill for at least 20 minutes or up to 24 hours. Add green onions to bag for the last 20 minutes. Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for direct heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is directly under the food). Drain marinade from bag and discard. Thread steak and squash alternately onto metal or soaked wooden skewers, weaving green onions through squash and steak pieces on the skewers as you go (the onions are easier to skewer if you firmly bend them first). Lay skewers on grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand just above grill level only 2 to 3 seconds). Keep charcoal grill uncovered; close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning once with tongs, until steak is as done as desired, 6 minutes for medium rare (pink in center; cut to test). Serve immediately, with lemon wedges to squeeze over meat and vegetables to taste.
