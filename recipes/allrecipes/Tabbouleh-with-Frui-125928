In a medium bowl, combine the orange juice and bulgur. Let stand for 30 minutes, or until tender and softened. Drain the bulgur and place in a large bowl. Add the tomato, cantaloupe, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, parsley, onion, mint, lemon juice, oil, cumin, cinnamon, salt, and pepper and toss to coat well. Let stand for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.
