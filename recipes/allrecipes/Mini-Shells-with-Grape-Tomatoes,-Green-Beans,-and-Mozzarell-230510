Bring a large pot of water to boil. Season water with salt to taste (optional). Marinate the mozzarella cheese with 2 tablespoons oil, a pinch of salt and black pepper, and fresh basil. Meanwhile, cook the garlic and remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until garlic turns slightly yellow. Add the tomatoes, season with salt and pepper and saute over high heat for 1 minute. Cook the pasta according to package directions, along with the green beans in the same pot. Drain and toss with the tomatoes. Stir in the marinated cheese mixture before serving.
