Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place beets in a roasting pan; drizzle with 1 teaspoon balsamic creme. Season with salt and black pepper. Roast beets in the preheated oven until tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Cut beets into bite-sized pieces; cool to room temperature. Combine spinach, walnuts, goat cheese, pickled red onion, and French-fried onions in a bowl. Whisk lemon juice, 1/4 cup balsamic creme, olive oil, salt, and black pepper in a bowl; pour over salad. Toss to coat.
