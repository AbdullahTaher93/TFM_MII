Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and return pasta to pot. Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat; add cream and garlic cloves. Simmer until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and discard garlic cloves. Stir cream sauce into bow-tie pasta; season with black pepper. Add Parmesan cheese; toss until cheese melts.
