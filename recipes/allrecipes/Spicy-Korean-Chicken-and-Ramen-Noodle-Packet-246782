Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Mix together the gochujang, soy sauce, water, sesame oil and sugar in a large bowl until combined. Place the sliced chicken, green onions, cabbage, mushrooms, zucchini and cooked ramen noodles into the large bowl with the gochujang mixture and toss until coated. Place a 1 1/2 to 2 feet long sheet of Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil on a table and place 1/4 of the ramen noodle mixture into the center of the foil. Fold up the ends and then the outside to create a foil packet. Repeat the process 3 more times and place the foil packets on a cookie sheet tray. Bake in the oven for 25 minutes or until chicken is cooked throughout.
