Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place broccoli in a bowl and drizzle with a little olive oil; top with 1 teaspoon lemon zest and season with salt and black pepper. Roast in the preheated oven until browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool until warm. Whisk lemon juice and garlic together in a small bowl; slowly drizzle in remaining olive oil while whisking rapidly until dressing reaches desired consistency. Season with salt and black pepper. Toss broccoli and dressing together in a bowl until coated.
