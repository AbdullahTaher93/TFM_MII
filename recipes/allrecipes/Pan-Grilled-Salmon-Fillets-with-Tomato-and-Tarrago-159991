Preheat a 12-inch ovenproof skillet (cast iron is fine) for 3 or 4 minutes over medium-high heat. Preheat the broiler, positioning the top rack about 4 inches from the heat. Place salmon fillets in the skillet, skin-side down, leaving the heat on medium-high. Sprinkle with pepper and cook, undisturbed, for about 6 minutes, or until the salmon flesh turns opaque about halfway up the fish. Transfer the skillet to the broiler and leave it there for 2 or 3 minutes, just until the salmon browns on top. The salmon should still be moist in the middle. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, heat wine over medium heat. Let it simmer for about 1 minute. Add chives, tarragon and butter and stir. When the butter has melted, add tomatoes and cook another 30 seconds. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper. Remove and discard the tarragon. Spoon the sauce over the salmon. Garnish with chives.
