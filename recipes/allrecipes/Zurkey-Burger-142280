Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-low heat and lightly oil grate. In a large bowl, combine turkey, zucchini, onion, egg, bread crumbs, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, salt and pepper. Mix until well incorporated. Form mixture into six evenly-sized patties and grill until no longer pink in the middle, about eight minutes per side.
