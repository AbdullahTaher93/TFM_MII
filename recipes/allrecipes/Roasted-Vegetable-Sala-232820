Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a large baking sheet. Spread eggplant, yellow squash, asparagus, red bell pepper, red onion, and garlic on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Transfer roasted vegetables to a serving bowl. Whisk olive oil, vinegar, parsley, lemon juice, oregano, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; pour over roasted vegetables. Toss to coat.
