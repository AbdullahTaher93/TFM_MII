Mix tapioca starch, salt, pepper, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and paprika together in a large bowl with a fork. Add chicken cubes; toss with your hands until coated on all sides. Heat coconut oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until melted and hot. Add some of the chicken cubes using tongs; cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels. Repeat with remaining chicken, heating up more coconut oil and butter as needed. Reduce heat to medium and whisk garlic and ginger into the grease in the skillet. Whisk in coconut aminos, honey, and sriracha sauce. Simmer over low heat until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken; cook until sauce thickens and coats chicken, 5 to 7 minutes. Garnish chicken with scallions and sesame oil; serve on toothpicks.
