Place the turkey legs, water, bouillon cubes, onion, celery, carrots, garlic, bay leaves, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, thyme, marjoram, and curry powder in a soup pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Stir in the wild rice. Simmer the soup at least 1 hour. Remove the turkey legs and strip the meat from the bones and tendons. Chop the meat and return it to the soup. Pour in the half-and-half and heat to just below a simmer; cook on low heat for about 30 more minutes.
