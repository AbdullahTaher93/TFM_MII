Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place flour in a bowl. Whisk eggs, 1 bottle hot sauce, and water in another bowl until smooth. Season chicken with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Dip each wing into the egg mixture, then toss with flour mixture to coat. Gently shake off excess flour and set aside. Repeat with remaining chicken. Fry chicken in the hot oil in batches until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and skin is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Drain in a large bowl lined with paper towels, then season with salt. Heat butter and remaining bottle hot sauce in a saucepan over medium-high heat until butter is melted. Whisk until smooth. Remove paper towels from bowl and pour butter sauce over chicken; toss to coat.
