Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Toast the walnuts until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Let cool. In a large frying pan, cook the bacon until it is crisp. Drain the bacon on paper towels and then crumble it. In a small glass or stainless-steel bowl, whisk the vinegar with the mustard, salt, and pepper. Whisk in the oil. In a large bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of the dressing with the chicken. Let sit for about 5 minutes so that the chicken absorbs the dressing. Add the walnuts, bacon, spinach, onion, apple, and the remaining dressing and toss.
