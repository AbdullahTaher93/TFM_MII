Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Lay three pieces of Reynolds Wrap(R) Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil on top of one another. Add the potatoes. 1/4 teaspoon salt, olive oil and the bacon. Seal the foil packet up tightly then grill for 45 minutes to 1 hour, flipping the packet every 15 minutes. Grill until the potatoes are tender and the bacon and potatoes are browned in parts. Let the potatoes cool for 10 minutes before adding them to a large bowl. Add the sour cream, coarse mustard, cider vinegar, and scallions (reserve some for garnish) and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Place the potato salad in a serving bowl then garnish with reserved scallions.
