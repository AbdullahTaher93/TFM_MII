Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Crumble and set aside. In a salad bowl, toss together broccoli, raisins and red onions. In a separate bowl, whisk together the white sugar, vinegar and mayonnaise. Pour over broccoli mixture and toss to coat. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Before serving, sprinkle with sunflower seeds and crumbled bacon. Toss and serve.
