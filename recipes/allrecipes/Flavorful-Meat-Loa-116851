In a large bowl, beat egg whites. Add milk and bread; let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in the onion, Worcestershire sauce and seasonings. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Shape into a loaf in an 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 35 minutes; drain. Spoon ketchup over loaf. Bake 10-20 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
