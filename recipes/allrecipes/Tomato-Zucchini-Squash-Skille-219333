Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the onion in the melted butter until translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the zucchini and yellow squash; cook until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Mix in the tomatoes and cook until they start to break down, about 5 more minutes. Season with kosher salt and black pepper.
