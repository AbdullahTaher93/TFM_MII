In a 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat, bring about 1 1/2 quarts water to a boil. Meanwhile, rinse asparagus and snap off and discard tough stem ends. Add asparagus to boiling water; cover and cook until barely tender to bite, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain. To serve at room temperature, immerse asparagus at once in ice water until cool; drain. Return hot or cool asparagus to unwashed pan. Add mint, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste; mix gently. Pour into a serving dish.
