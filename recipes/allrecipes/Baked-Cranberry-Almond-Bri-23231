Combine flour, butter and cream cheese in large bowl. Beat at low speed, scraping bowl often, until mixture leaves sides of bowl and forms a dough (2 to 3 minutes). Divide dough in half; wrap in plastic food wrap. Refrigerate until firm (1 hour). Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Roll each half of dough on lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut 8-inch circle from each half (save dough scraps for decoration). Place 1 circle onto ungreased baking sheet. Place Brie cheese on center of pastry circle. Spread cranberry sauce over top of cheese; sprinkle with toasted almonds. Top with remaining pastry circle. Pinch edges of pastry to seal. Flute edges as desired. Decorate top with small pastry cut-outs. Beat egg with water in small bowl; brush top and sides of pastry. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from baking sheet immediately. Let stand 30 minutes to allow cheese to set. To serve, cut into small wedges. Serve with apple slices, pear slices or crackers.
