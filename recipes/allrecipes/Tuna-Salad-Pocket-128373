To Make the Dressing: In a medium bowl, combine the vinegar, oil, mustard, Italian seasoning, and garlic. To Make the Sandwiches: Set a vegetable steamer in a medium saucepan filled with 2 inches (5 cm) of water. Cover and bring to a boil. Steam the potatoes and beans for 6 to 8 minutes, or until tender. Remove to a colander and rinse with cold water. Pat dry. Add the potatoes, beans, tuna, onion, egg whites, olives, and lettuce to the bowl with the dressing. Toss gently to combine. Cut each pita in half crosswise. Spoon the tuna mixture into each pocket. Drizzle lightly with any dressing left in the bowl.
