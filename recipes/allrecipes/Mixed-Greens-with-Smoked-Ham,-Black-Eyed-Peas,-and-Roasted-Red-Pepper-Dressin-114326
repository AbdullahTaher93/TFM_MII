Roast the pepper over a gas flame or grill or broil it, turning with tongs until charred all over, about 10 minutes. When the pepper is cool enough to handle, pull off the skin. Remove the stem, seeds, and ribs. Cut the pepper into pieces. In a blender, combine the roasted pepper, the garlic, vinegar, oil, salt, and black pepper. Puree until smooth. In a large bowl, combine the greens with the ham and black-eyed peas. Serve the salad with the dressing spooned over the top.
