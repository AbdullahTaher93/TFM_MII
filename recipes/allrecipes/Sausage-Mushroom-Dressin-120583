In a large skillet, cook bacon until crisp. Remove to paper towels to drain. Reserve 2 tablespoons drippings. Saute the mushrooms, onion, celery and garlic in the drippings and butter until tender. Stir in the sage, salt and pepper. In several large bowls, combine the mushroom mixture, bread cubes, sausage, broth and bacon; toss to coat. Transfer to two greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dishes. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes. Bake, uncovered, 10-15 minutes longer or until lightly browned.
