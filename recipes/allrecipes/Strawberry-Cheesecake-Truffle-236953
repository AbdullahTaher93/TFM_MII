Prepare the cupcake batter as requested and bake in a 9x13-inch pan for 27 to 30 minutes at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Set aside to cool. Prepare the frosting mix. Set aside 1/4 of the frosting. Add the remaining frosting to the cake and combine until dough is formed. Form the dough into 24 1-inch balls. Freeze for about 30 minutes or until firm. Melt the remaining 1/4 frosting. Place a small amount of frosting in your hand and roll the ball of dough, just enough to coat it. Roll into the add-in of your choice (Picture has coconut).
