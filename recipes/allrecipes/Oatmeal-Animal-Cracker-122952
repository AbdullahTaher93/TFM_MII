In a bowl, combine sugar, oats, baking soda and salt. Cut in shortening until crumbly. Add water and vanilla; stir until blended. Add enough flour to form a stiff dough. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut into rectangles or use cookie cutters dipped in flour. Using a floured spatula, transfer to greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on wire racks.
