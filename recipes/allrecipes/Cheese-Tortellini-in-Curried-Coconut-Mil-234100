Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; stir in tortellini and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain. Heat butter over medium heat in a saucepan; stir in shallot and saute until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add curry powder; cook and stir until a paste forms, about 1 minute. Pour vegetable broth into curry paste mixture. Stir until curry is dissolved, about 1 minute; bring to a boil. Slowly pour in coconut milk; adjust heat to return soup to a simmer. Stir tomato and jalapeno into soup, simmer 5 minutes more. Stir tortellini into soup; season with salt and pepper.
