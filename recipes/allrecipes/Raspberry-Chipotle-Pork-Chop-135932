Heat grill. Sprinkle pork chops with garlic salt. Mix 2 tablespoons chipotle sauce and raspberries; set aside. Place pork chops on grill over medium heat, brushing tops of chops with some of remaining sauce. Cover and cook 4 minutes. Turn chops and brush with remaining sauce. Cook an additional 4 to 5 minutes or until pork is no longer pink in center. Serve pork chops with reserved raspberries.
