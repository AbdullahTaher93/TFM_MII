In a small skillet, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain and cool completely. In a bowl, combine biscuit mix and cheese. Stir in the sausage, water and chilies. Shape into 1-in. balls. Place 2 in. apart on well-greased baking sheets. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until lightly browned. Refrigerate leftovers.
