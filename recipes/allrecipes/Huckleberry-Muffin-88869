Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 15 muffin cups, or line with muffin papers. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Mix in the egg, milk and vanilla until well blended. Combine 1 3/4 cups flour, baking powder and salt; stir into the batter until just moistened. Toss huckleberries with remaining flour to coat, then fold them into the batter. Spoon batter into muffin cups, filling at least 2/3 full. Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the tops spring back when lightly pressed.
