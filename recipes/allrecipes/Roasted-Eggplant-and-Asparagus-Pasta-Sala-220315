Place a baking rack in the top of the oven. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spread asparagus spears and eggplant slices on the baking sheet, and drizzle vegetables with 1/4 cup olive oil; sprinkle with garlic powder. Roast the asparagus and eggplant in the preheated oven until tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven and cool. When cool, roughly chop the vegetables; set aside. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through but is still slightly firm, about 9 minutes. Drain well. Transfer about 1/4 of the penne at a time into a large salad bowl, drizzling each batch with about 1 teaspoon of olive oil and a 1 teaspoon of Parmesan cheese. Stir between additions. Stir in roasted asparagus and eggplant, lemon juice, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, balsamic vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce until thoroughly combined. Sprinkle pasta salad with salt-free seasoning and black pepper. Cover the bowl and refrigerate the pasta salad until thoroughly chilled and the flavors have blended, at least 3 hours.
