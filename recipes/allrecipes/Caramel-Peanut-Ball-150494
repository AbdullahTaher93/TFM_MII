In heavy saucepan, combine peanuts, sweetened condensed milk and vanilla. Over medium heat, cook and stir 8 to 10 minutes or until mixture forms ball around spoon and pulls away from side of pan. Cool 10 minutes. Chill if desired. Shape into 1-inch balls. In small heavy saucepan, over low heat, melt confectioners' coating. With wooden toothpick, dip each ball into melted coating, covering half of ball. Place on wax paper lined baking sheets until firm. Store leftovers covered at room temperature or in refrigerator.
