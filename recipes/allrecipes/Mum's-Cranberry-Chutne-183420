Combine cranberries, water, sugar, cinnamon sticks, and salt in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cook until berries begin to burst, about 10 minutes. Stir in onion, raisins, apple, pear, and celery. Cook on medium heat 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat. Stir in the almonds and lemon zest to combine. Remove cinnamon sticks. Cool before serving, about 1 hour.
