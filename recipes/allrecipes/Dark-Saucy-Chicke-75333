In a bowl, mix the brown sugar and soy sauce. Stir in the cocoa, cilantro, sage, and almonds. Set aside. In a separate bowl, toss together the green bell pepper, red bell pepper, tomatoes, and Swiss cheese. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place chicken in the skillet, and cook 15 minutes, until juices run clear. Reduce heat to low, and stir in the brown sugar and soy sauce mixture until heated through. Top with the peppers, tomatoes, and cheese to serve.
