Rinse turkey and pat dry. Place each piece between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. With a heavy, flat-sided mallet, pound meat firmly but gently to a thickness of about 1/8 inch. Lightly sprinkle each slice with pepper; then lay a piece of prosciutto on each slice and top with a strip of cheese. Roll up turkey to enclose filling; secure each roll with a wooden pick, if necessary. Heat oil in a wide nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add turkey rolls and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides (about 10 minutes). Add broth, wine, sage, and mustard to pan. Cover and cook for 2 minutes. Lift turkey rolls from pan and transfer to a platter; keep warm. Bring sauce to a boil over high heat; then boil, uncovered, until large, shiny bubbles form (about 3 minutes). Pour over turkey. Sprinkle chopped parsley on top, if desired.
