Combine cornmeal, flour, salt, cayenne pepper and garlic powder. Coat farm-raised catfish with mixture, shaking off excess. Fill deep pot or 12-inch skillet half full with vegetable oil. Heat to 350 degrees F. Add catfish in single layer, and fry until golden brown, about 5 - 6 minutes, depending on size. Remove and drain on paper towels.
