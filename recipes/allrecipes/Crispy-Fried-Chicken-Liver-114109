In a food processor, process the panko until fine. Transfer to a pie plate. In another pie plate, season the flour with salt and pepper. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs with the milk. Working in batches, dredge a few livers at a time in the flour, then dip them into the egg mixture. Coat them with the panko and transfer to a large plate. In a large skillet, heat 1/4 inch of oil until shimmering. Add half of the livers and cook over moderately high heat, turning once, until browned and crisp, 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining livers. Transfer to plates and serve with lemon wedges.
