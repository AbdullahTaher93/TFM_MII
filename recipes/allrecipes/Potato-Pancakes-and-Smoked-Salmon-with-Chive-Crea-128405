Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Coat 2 large baking sheets with nonstick spray. In a small bowl, combine the sour cream and chives or scallions. Cover and refrigerate. In a food processor with the shredding disk or on a 4-sided vegetable grater, shred the potatoes and onion. Working in batches, squeeze out excess liquid and pat dry with paper towels. Place in a large bowl. Add the flour, egg yolk, and salt. Stir to mix. Place the egg whites in a medium bowl. With an electric mixer, beat until stiff peaks form. Fold into the potato mixture. Coat a large nonstick skillet or griddle with nonstick spray. Place over medium-high heat. Drop the batter in 1/4 cupfuls (50 mL) onto the pan or griddle. With the back of a spoon, spread each pancake into a 4-inch (10-cm) circle. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until browned on the bottom. Coat the tops with nonstick spray and turn over. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until browned on the bottom. Remove to one of the prepared baking sheets. Place in the oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter to make a total of 15 pancakes. Serve the pancakes topped with the salmon and a dollop of the chive cream.
