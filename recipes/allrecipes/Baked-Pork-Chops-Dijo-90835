Preheat oven to 475 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking pan with foil. Arrange chops in foil-lined pan in a single layer. In a small bowl, whisk together oil, vinegar, mustard, chives, and tarragon. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spread half of the oil mixture equally over chops. Bake for 10 minutes. Turn chops over and spread remaining oil mixture over them. Continue baking until chops are no longer pink in thickest part (cut to test), 8 to 10 minutes longer. Transfer to plates and serve.
