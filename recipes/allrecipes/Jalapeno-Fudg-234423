Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 9x12-inch baking dish. Beat eggs together in a bowl; stir Cheddar cheese and jalapeno peppers into the eggs. Pour mixture into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool and cut into squares.
