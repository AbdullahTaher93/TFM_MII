In a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over high heat, stir macadamias frequently until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour from pan and set aside. In a 2-quart saucepan over high heat, bring broth and 2 cups water to a boil. Add noodles, reduce heat slightly, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender to bite, 6 to 7 minutes. While noodles cook, heat a 12- to 14-inch nonstick frying pan over high heat. When pan is hot, add tuna and cook on each side, turning once, until browned on surface, 4 to 5 minutes total. Cut to test; tuna should be white to about 1/4 inch deep, and still red in center (see notes). When noodles are done, stir in lime juice, green onions, and chopped cilantro. Spoon noodle mixture equally onto 4 serving plates. Slice tuna steaks thinly, if desired. Top noodles with tuna or serve alongside. Mix together soy sauce and sesame oil and drizzle over each portion. Garnish with cilantro sprigs and lime wedges.
