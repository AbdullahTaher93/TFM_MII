In a bowl, combine flour and salt. Cut in shortening and butter until crumbly. Add water, tossing with a fork until a ball forms. Roll out pastry to fit an 18-oz. baking dish. Press onto the bottom and up the sides of the dish. Combine filling ingredients; mix well. Pour into pastry shell. Bake at 375 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
