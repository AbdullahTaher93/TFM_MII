Prepare the pineapples by washing and dividing them in half lengthwise; scooping out the pineapple and reserving the shells. Toss the chicken, pineapple, and strawberries in a large bowl and set aside. Caramelized Walnuts: mix jerk seasoning, stock, molasses and 3/4 cup of SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener together in a bowl. Pour in the walnuts, place them on a sheet pan, and bake them in the oven at 350 degrees F until golden brown and crispy. Cool the nuts and add to the chicken mixture. Tropical Dressing: mix all the dressing ingredients in a blender until smooth. Pour the dressing into the mixing bowl with the remaining together. Spoon the mixture inside the pineapple half shell, for presentation, and sprinkle with coconut shavings.
