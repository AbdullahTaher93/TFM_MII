Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In medium bowl, mix cream cheese, sour cream, thawed spinach and artichoke hearts until well blended, breaking up artichokes during stirring. Unroll dough into 1 large rectangle. Spread garlic mixture from box evenly over dough. Separate dough into 10 breadsticks. Reroll each breadstick, coiling dough into spiral shape with garlic mixture inside; place 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Starting at center, press out each coil into 3 1/2-inch round (edges will curl up slightly). Spoon and spread cream cheese mixture on top of each round. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 350 degrees F for 17 to 22 minutes or until cheese is melted and edges are golden brown. Immediately remove from cookie sheet. Serve warm.
