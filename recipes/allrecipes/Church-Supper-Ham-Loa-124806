In large mixing bowl, gently combine all ham loaf ingredients. Form into a loaf; place in shallow baking pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1 hour. Then, in small saucepan, combine all ingredients for basting sauce; bring to a boil. Immediately drain any drippings from ham loaf and pour basting sauce over it. Continue baking ham loaf, basting occasionally with pan juices, for 15-30 minutes or until lightly browned.
