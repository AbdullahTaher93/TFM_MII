In a large bowl, combine zucchini, eggs, onion, and garlic. Blend in baking mix, salt and pepper. Heat 1/2 inch of oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Drop batter by spoonfuls into hot oil, and fry until evenly brown and fluffy. Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt before serving.
