If making a ham, score the ham, and stud with the whole cloves. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the cranberry sauce, orange zest, brown sugar, red wine, and mustard. Stir to blend. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat and set aside. If using the sauce for turkey, mix the whole cloves into the sauce while cooking. To glaze meat, use half of the glaze before roasting, and use the remaining to baste during the last 30 minutes of cooking.
