Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Coat a 7 x 11-inch (18 x 29-cm) baking dish with nonstick spray. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, and cloves. Stir to mix well. In a large bowl, combine the sugar and margarine. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed until smooth and fluffy. Add the egg whites, molasses, and honey. Beat well. Add the water. Beat until the mixture is smooth. Gradually add the flour mixture and beat just until blended. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top with a rubber spatula. Bake in the center of the oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 33 to 37 minutes. Cool on a wire rack. Cut into pieces.
