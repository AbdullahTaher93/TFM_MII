Combine brown sugar, chile sauce, grape jelly, mustard, vinegar, soy sauce, honey, salt, and chipotle powder in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, whisking well until brown sugar and jelly are dissolved, about 5 minutes. Bring just to a boil; remove from heat. Add cornstarch; whisk sauce until smooth and thickened.
