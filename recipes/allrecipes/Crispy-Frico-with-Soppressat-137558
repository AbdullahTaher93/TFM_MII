Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, toss the montasio with the Piave. In the corner of a large nonstick baking sheet, sprinkle 1/4 cup of the grated cheese in a 4-inch round. Repeat to make 3 more rounds on the baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches between the rounds. Bake the frico in the oven for about 5 minutes, or until the cheese is slightly melted and golden brown. Let the frico cool on the sheet for 2 minutes to firm up. Using a metal spatula, transfer the frico to a platter to cool completely; theyll crisp as they cool. Repeat with the remaining cheese. Arrange the frico and soppressata on the platter and serve.
