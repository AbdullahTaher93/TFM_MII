Place shiitake mushrooms in a bowl; cover with warm water. Cover bowl and let stand until mushrooms have softened, about 20 minutes. Season hanger steak on each side with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook steak until browned, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Transfer steak to a slow cooker. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon ginger over steak. Add mushrooms with soaking liquid, carrots, cranberries, beef broth, and remaining ginger. Set slow cooker to High; cook 4 hours.
