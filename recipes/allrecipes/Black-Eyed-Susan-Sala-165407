Combine the black-eyed peas, corn, pimentos, celery, and onion in a mixing bowl; set aside. In a separate bowl, whisk together the vinegar, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic salt, and pepper. Slowly whisk in the vegetable oil until the dressing emulsifies. Stir the dressing into the vegetables until evenly coated. Refrigerate 4 hours to overnight before serving.
