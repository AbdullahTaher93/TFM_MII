Measure broth into a saucepan, and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Add tofu and green onions. Slowly drizzle in the beaten egg to make long strands of egg. Add mushrooms and cabbage, and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and season with chili sauce, vinegar and soy sauce. Stir in citric acid if using.
