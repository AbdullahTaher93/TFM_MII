Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch (23-cm) springform pan with nonstick spray. Sprinkle the bottom of the pan with the crumbs. In a large bowl, use an electric mixer set at medium speed to beat together the two types of cream cheese until they are light and fluffy. Add the egg substitute, sugar, milk, and egg, and beat until the mixture is smooth, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour 2 cups (500 ml) of the batter into a small bowl, and beat the melted chocolate into it. Pour the plain batter into the pan. Top with the chocolate batter. Using a knife, swirl the batters to create a marbled effect. Place the pan inside a larger one filled with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water). Bake the cake until its edges are lightly browned and the center is nearly set, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool the cake on a wire rack for 30 minutes, then refrigerate it overnight.
