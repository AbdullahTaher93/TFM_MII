Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, mix together the burger crumbles, onion soup mix and bread crumbs. Stir in oil and eggs, and season with garlic powder, salt and pepper. Mix well to blend in seasoning. Spread into the prepared loaf pan. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm.
