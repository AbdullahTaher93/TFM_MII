Bake, cool and remove the "tops" of the pastry shells according to the package directions. Heat the kielbasa, wine, brandy, brown sugar and mustard in a 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat to a boil. Cook and stir for 15 minutes or until the liquid is reduced to a syrup-like consistency. Divide the kielbasa mixture among the pastry shells. Sprinkle with the chives. Serve immediately.
