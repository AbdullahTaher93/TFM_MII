Cook apples and orange juice in a large heavy pot over medium heat, stirring frequently, until apples begin to soften, about 10 minutes. Stir white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, orange zest, lemon zest, nutmeg, and lemon juice into apples. Cook, stirring often, until applesauce is chunky and thickened, about 25 minutes. Serve warm or chilled.
