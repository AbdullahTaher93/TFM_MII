Place the squash and onion in a colander, sprinkle with salt, and drain about 30 minutes, until no longer moist. In a bowl, mix the squash and onion, flour, cornmeal, egg, and cheese. Season with pepper. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Drop squash mixture by heaping tablespoonfuls into the skillet, and cook 3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.
