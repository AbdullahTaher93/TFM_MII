Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove and discard the skin from the chicken. Wash parts and pat dry. Combine the garlic and ginger and rub over the chicken. Place the chicken parts in a 9x13 inch baking dish, cover with foil and set aside. Meanwhile, place the cilantro, cumin, jalapeno chile pepper and lemon juice in a blender and puree until smooth, adding some water if necessary. Set this aside for later. In a separate small bowl, combine the cashews with the cream. Mix well and pour over the chicken. Bake chicken at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes, or until chicken releases its juices. Then bake, uncovered for 15 more minutes, allowing the liquid in the dish to thicken slightly to a gravy. Remove from oven and combine the gravy in the dish with the reserved cilantro chutney. Mix this well and serve over the chicken.
