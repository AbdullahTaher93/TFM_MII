In a large skillet, brown pork chops in oil. Sprinkle with rosemary, salt and pepper. In a bowl, combine the rhubarb, bread cubes, brown sugar, flour, cinnamon and allspice. Place half of the rhubarb mixture in a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Top with chops and remaining rhubarb mixture. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes. Uncover; bake 10 minutes longer or until juices run clear.
