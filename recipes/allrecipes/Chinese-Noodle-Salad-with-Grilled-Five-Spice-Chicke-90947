In a covered 5- to 6-quart nonstick pan over high heat, bring 2 1/2 to 3 quarts water to a boil. While water heats, make dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together salad oil, rice vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, garlic, and five spice; set aside. When water boils, add noodles and cook just until tender to bite, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold water, then drain again. Place noodles in a large bowl; add 1/2 cup of dressing, the cilantro, and ginger. Mix well and set aside. Rinse chicken and pat dry. Place chicken on a lightly greased barbecue grill above a solid bed of medium-hot coals or medium-high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 3 to 4 seconds). Close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning once and basting several times with half the remaining dressing, until meat is no longer pink in center of thickest part (cut to test), 6 to 8 minutes total. Transfer chicken to a cutting board; cut into 1/2-inch-wide slices. Line 4 serving plates equally with spinach. Divide noodles and chicken among plates, arranging separately. Moisten with remaining dressing and sprinkle with onions.
