Steam broccoli until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Keep warm. While broccoli is cooking, coat a small, nonstick skillet with nonstick spray and heat over medium heat. Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Stir in lemon peel and rosemary, and cook for 1 minute. Add broth and lemon juice. Cook until liquid is reduced to 1 tablespoon (15 mL), about 30 seconds. Pour over broccoli and toss. Combine bread crumbs and parmesan. Sprinkle over broccoli.
