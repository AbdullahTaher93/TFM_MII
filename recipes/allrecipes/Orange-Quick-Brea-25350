Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, stir together baking mix, sugar and orange zest. Add orange juice, egg and vegetable oil; stir to combine. Fold in almonds and raisins. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of loaf comes out clean.
