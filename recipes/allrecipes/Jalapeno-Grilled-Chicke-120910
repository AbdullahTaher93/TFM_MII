In a bowl, combine the peppers, 1/3 cup lemon juice, parsley, garlic, rosemary and thyme. Gently stuff pepper mixture under the skin of each chicken breast. Place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Combine the broth, pepper, lemon peel and remaining lemon juice; pour over chicken. Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours. Drain and discard marinade. Place chicken skin side up on grill. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 45 minutes or until juices run clear, turning once.
