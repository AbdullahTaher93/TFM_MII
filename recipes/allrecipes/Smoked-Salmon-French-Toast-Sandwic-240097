Whisk eggs, milk, and herbes de Provence together in a shallow bowl. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, dip bread in egg mixture, turning once to coat bread completely. Transfer coated bread to prepared skillet and cook in hot butter until golden, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer toasted bread to a paper-towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining bread slices. Cook and stir spinach in the same skillet until slightly wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Spread cream cheese onto 2 slices of toasted bread. Top each with spinach and smoked salmon, and place remaining slices of bread on top.
