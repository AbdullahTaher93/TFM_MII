Heat oil in a large frying pan or wok over medium heat. Saute the chopped 1garlic and veggies in oil for 5-7 minutes until they soften just a bit. Then add the ingredients for the sauce to the veggies and stir to combine. After adding the sauce ingredients, lower the heat, and continue cooking until you the sauce has reached a creamy consistency and the veggies are perfectly crunchy and cooked to your liking. You may need to add more tahini or coconut milk to get a more saucy texture if you added more veggies or if the tahini you used was somewhat less oily. Play with the amounts to get the consistency you desire. While veggies are cooking, soak the rice noodles in a separate pot of boiling water for 3-5 minutes to soften. Drain and then add the softened rice noodles to the wok to soak in the sauce and veggies for just a minute to mix up the flavors and sauce. Just before removing from heat, add a handful of chopped fresh Thai basil, if desired. Then toss and serve immediately.
