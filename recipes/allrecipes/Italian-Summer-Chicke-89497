Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Dip the chicken in the flour, seasoned with salt and pepper. Cook the chicken in the pan, about two minutes per side. Add in the chicken broth, artichoke hearts and dill weed. Cover, reduce heat, and cook five minutes. Remove the lid, turn the breasts over, and add green beans and lemon juice. Turn the heat on high. Let the sauce reduce until thick, about 1 minute more. Serve with rice or pasta.
