Thinly slice 2 of the onion quarters; chop remaining onion. In a 4- to 5-quart pan over medium heat, combine 2 tablespoons of the oil, the chopped onion, and the potatoes, carrots, and pepper. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are soft and beginning to brown (8 to 10 minutes). Pour in broth, cover, and boil gently until potatoes are tender to bite (10 to 12 more minutes). Meanwhile, cut meat into 1-inch squares about 1/2 inch thick. Place a wide nonstick frying pan over high heat; add remaining 2 tablespoons oil. To hot oil, add one fourth of the beef and one fourth of the sliced onion. Stir-fry meat until browned (about 1 minute). With a slotted spoon, transfer mixture to 1 soup bowl. Repeat with remaining 3 portions of meat and sliced onion, spooning each into a separate bowl. After all meat and onions are cooked, remove pan from heat. Add vinegar to frying pan and stir into pan drippings. Stir vinegar mixture into broth, then add parsley. Ladle hot broth and vegetables evenly over steak in bowls. Garnish with basil, if desired.
