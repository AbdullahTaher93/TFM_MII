Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a wok or large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add eggs and cook, stirring, until scrambled. Transfer to a plate; set aside. Add remaining 2 teaspoons oil to wok. Add scallions and ginger. Stir-fry until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add rice and peas and stir-fry until hot and beginning to stick to pan, about 3 minutes. Add sprouts, stir-fry sauce (or oyster sauce) and reserved eggs. Toss well, breaking up eggs, until heated through, about 2 minutes. Serve immediately.
