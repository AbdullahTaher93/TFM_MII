In a bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, blend egg, milk and shortening; stir into dry ingredients. Pour into a greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pan. Bake at 425 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from the pan and serve warm.
