Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Mix garlic, salt, pepper, ginger, thyme, sage, add marjoram in a bowl. Stir soy sauce and vegetable oil into the garlic mixture until loosely paste-like; add the bay leaf. Cut slits into the lamb on all sides. Rub herb mixture over entire surface of lamb, massaging it into the slits. Put lamb in a roasting pan. Roast lamb until browned on the outside and red in the center, about 50 minutes for rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 125 degrees F (52 degrees C). Cover lamb loosely with aluminum foil and cool about 20 minutes before carving.
