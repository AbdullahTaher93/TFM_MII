Bring 1/2 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan; remove from heat and add 1/3 cup butter, stirring until butter melts. Let stand until mixture cools to at least 110 degrees (about 10 minutes). Combine yeast and 1/2 cup warm water in a glass measuring cup; let mixture stand 5 minutes. Beat egg substitute, SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, and salt at medium speed using a heavy-duty stand mixer. Add yeast mixture and butter mixture, beating on low speed until blended. Gradually add flour, beating on low speed until blended.

Combine SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend and cinnamon in a small bowl; set aside. Spray a 12-cup Bundt pan with vegetable cooking spray. Prepare sauce; pour sauce in bottom of prepared pan. Sprinkle with pecans. Punch dough down and roll into 1-inch balls. Dip each ball into melted butter and into SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend mixture. Place in pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees ), free from drafts, 45 minutes or until doubled in bulk. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F about 10 minutes prior to baking. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until done. Cool on a wire rack 5 minutes. Invert onto serving plate. Serve immediately. Combine butter, milk, SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend and cinnamon in a small saucepan.
