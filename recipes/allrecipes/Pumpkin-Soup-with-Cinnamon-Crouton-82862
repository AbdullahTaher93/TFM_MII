Preheat oven to 400 degrees F(200 degrees C). In a small bowl, mix together melted butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon. In a large bowl, toss bread cubes with melted butter mixture to coat. Spread bread cubes evenly over a baking sheet. Bake 8 to 10 minutes, or until bread is crisp and toasted. Set croutons aside. Saute onion in canola oil in a medium saucepan until tender. Stir in 1 can chicken broth. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat, and simmer 15 minutes. Transfer broth mixture into the container of a blender or processor. Process until smooth. Return mixture to saucepan. Add remaining can of broth, pumpkin, salt, ground cinnamon, ground ginger, and ground pepper; stir well. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in half-and-half, and heat through. Do not boil. Ladle into individual soup bowls. Top each serving with cinnamon croutons.
