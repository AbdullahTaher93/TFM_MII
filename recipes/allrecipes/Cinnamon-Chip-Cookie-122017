In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in egg yolk, orange peel and vanilla. Combine the flour, cinnamon, baking powder and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Stir in chocolate chips and nuts (dough will be very stiff). Roll into 1-1/2-in. balls. Roll in egg whites, then in sugar. Place 2 in. apart on greased and floured baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.
