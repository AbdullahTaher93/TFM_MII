While holding a pint canning jar at an angle, add ingredients to create a "sand art" look. The salt and cayenne may be divided into smaller portions and used to separate other spices. I found it simplest to use 7 cups--one with each spice in it--and add them to my jar with a spoon, as I want to create the special look.
