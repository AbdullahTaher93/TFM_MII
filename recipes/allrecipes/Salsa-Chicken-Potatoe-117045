Scrub and pierce potatoes; place on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 10-12 minutes or until tender, turning once. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the chicken, tomato sauce, salsa and brown sugar. Cover and microwave on high for 3 minutes or until heated through. Cut an X in the top of each potato; fluff pulp with a fork. Top with chicken mixture, sour cream and parsley.
