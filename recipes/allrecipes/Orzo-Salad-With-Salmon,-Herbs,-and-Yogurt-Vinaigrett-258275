Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orzo in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Whisk yogurt, lemon juice, olive oil, honey, lemon zest, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until vinaigrette is smooth. Mix tomatoes, cucumber, salmon, parsley, chives, and dill with the orzo; add vinaigrette and toss until coated.
