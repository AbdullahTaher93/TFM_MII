Heat oil in a 5-quart stockpot over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir great Northern beans, chicken broth, chicken, green chile peppers, cumin, chili powder, cayenne pepper, oregano, and cloves into the stockpot. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer until flavors combine, about 1 hour.
