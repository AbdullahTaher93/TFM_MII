In a bowl, combine corn bread mix, mustard, milk, oil and egg just until blended. Stir in the ham and onions. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups half full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Immediately sprinkle with cheese. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan. Serve warm.
