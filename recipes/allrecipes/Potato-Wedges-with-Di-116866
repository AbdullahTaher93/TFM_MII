Pierce potato and place on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave on high for 3 minutes or until still firm but almost tender. Cut into eight wedges; place on a baking sheet coated with nonstick cooking spray. Spritz wedges with olive oil-flavored spray; sprinkle with salt, garlic salt and cayenne. Bake at 425 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. In a small bowl, combine the dip ingredients. Serve with potato wedges.
