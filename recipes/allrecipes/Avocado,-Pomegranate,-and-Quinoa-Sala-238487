Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, about 12 to 15 minutes. Spread quinoa onto a baking sheet and cool to room temperature, at least 30 minutes. Transfer quinoa to a large bowl and gently fold in avocado and pomegranate seeds. Drizzle olive oil over quinoa mixture and toss to coat; mix in cilantro and lemon juice.
