Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). In a 10x15 inch baking dish, combine the meat, minestrone soup, tomato soup, water and onion soup mix. Mix well. Bake at 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) for 8 hours. (Note: If needed, you can bake for less time at a higher temperature; just make sure that the meat is completely cooked through.)
