In a bowl, combine the biscuit mix, sugar and ginger. Cut in margarine until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. With a fork, stir in yogurt and 1/4 cup egg substitute until mixture forms a ball. Turn onto a floured surface; knead 5-6 times. Roll out to 1/2-in. thickness; cut with a 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Brush tops with remaining egg substitute. Bake at 425 degrees for 14-16 minutes or until golden brown.
