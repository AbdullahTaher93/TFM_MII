Mix salad dressing, curry powder, onion soup mix, and strawberry jam in a large bowl until smooth. Place chicken breast into a 9x13 inch baking dish and pour the dressing mixture on top. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or at least 1 hour before baking. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Uncover the baking dish. Bake the chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 20 to 25 minutes.
