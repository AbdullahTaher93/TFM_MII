Heat oil in large, nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add chops and cook for 3 to 6 minutes, turning once. Remove chops from pan and cover to keep warm. Add onions and BBQ seasoning to pan. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until onions are softened. Add brown sugar and balsamic vinegar and cook an additional 3 to 5 minutes or until onions are very tender and beginning to brown. For each sandwich, place two chops on a sliced Kaiser roll, top with one slice of cheese and divide onions evenly among sandwiches.
