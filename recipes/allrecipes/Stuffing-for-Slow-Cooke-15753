In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Saute the celery, onion, parsley and mushrooms until onions are soft. In a large bowl, combine the bread cubes and vegetables. Add the poultry seasoning, thyme, sage, pepper, salt and marjoram. Toss together well. Add egg and enough broth to moisten. Lightly pack into slow cooker; cover and cook on high for 45 minutes. Reduce to low and cook for 4 to 8 hours.
