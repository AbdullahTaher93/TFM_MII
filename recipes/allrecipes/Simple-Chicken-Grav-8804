Add water to the chicken drippings to make about 1 1/2 cups of liquid in the bottom of the roaster. Whisk water into the flour until it is thick, but not pasty. Whisk the flour/water mixture into the drippings, and put the roaster on the stove over medium heat. Stir constantly until mixture is thickened and bubbly. Add salt and pepper to taste.
