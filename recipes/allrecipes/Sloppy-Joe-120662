In a large skillet, cook beef, onions and garlic over medium heat until the meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the ketchup, barbecue sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, mustard, Italian seasoning, onion powder and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Serve about 1/2 cup meat mixture on each bun. Or cool and freeze in freezer containers for up to 3 months. To use frozen sloppy joes: Thaw in the refrigerator; place in a saucepan and heat though. Serve on buns.
