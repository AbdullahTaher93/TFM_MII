In a 4-quart (4-L) pot, combine onion, celery, carrots, and oil. Cover the pot and cook over medium-low heat for 10 minutes, stirring often to prevent sticking. Process the tomatoes in a blender or food processor until smooth. Press them through a coarse sieve. Add to pot and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover the pot, and simmer for 20 minutes. Add rice and broth. Partially cover and simmer until thick, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, mince the parsley, basil, thyme, garlic, and orange peel. Ladle the soup into individual bowls. Stir a generous spoonful of the minced herbs into each bowl.
