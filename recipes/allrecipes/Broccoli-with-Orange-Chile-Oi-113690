In a heatproof bowl, combine the orange zest and sesame oil. In a saucepan, heat the vegetable oil over moderate heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until golden, about 3 minutes. Add the ginger, crushed red pepper and five-spice powder and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the orange juice and boil over moderately high heat until reduced by half, about 4 minutes. Stir the orange juice mixture into the zest and season with salt and pepper. In a saucepan, steam the broccoli until just tender, about 8 minutes. Transfer the steamed broccoli to a warmed platter, spoon the orange-chile oil on top and serve.
