Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork chops, cook and turn until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Reduce heat to low. In small bowl, stir together strawberry preserves, mustard and vinegar. Pour sauce over pork chops and cover the pan. Cook until sauce is thickened and pork chops are no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). To serve, spoon glaze over each chop.
