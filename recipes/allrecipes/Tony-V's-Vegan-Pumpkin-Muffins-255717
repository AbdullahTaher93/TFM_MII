Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease muffin tins with cooking spray. Mix fructose, flour, oat bran, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and pumpkin pie spice together in a large bowl. Whisk water and egg replacer together in another bowl until smooth. Stir in pumpkin puree and vegetable oil. Add fructose mixture; mix well to blend batter. Spoon batter into the greased muffin tins, filling each cup halfway. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
