Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a large bowl, cream together the shortening, brown sugar and peanut butter. Beat in the milk, egg and vanilla. Stir together the cocoa powder and hot water until cocoa is dissolved; stir into the peanut butter mixture. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the batter until well blended. Drop dough by heaping teaspoons 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Use a fork to make a criss-cross pattern on the top. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 2 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
