In a Dutch oven, cook salt pork over medium heat until fat melts. Cook rabbit in hot fat until well browned on all sides. Pour in enough sherry to cover meat. Simmer until sherry is absorbed for the most part and meat is very tender. Pour in remaining sherry, and simmer for just a few minutes (leave enough liquid in the pan for sauce).
