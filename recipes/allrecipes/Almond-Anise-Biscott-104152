Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray cookie sheet or jellyroll pan with nonstick cooking spray; set aside. Spread almonds in a shallow pan and toast 7 to 10 minutes. Remove almonds from the oven, cool and chop coarsely. Mix oil, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and sugar together in a large bowl. Add eggs and egg white, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Set aside. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, nonfat dry milk and anise seed in a medium bowl. Pour flour mixture into the oil and egg mixture and stir until blended. Add almonds and mix until just blended. Divide dough in half. Roll each half into a log approximately 3 1/2 inches wide by 12 inches long. Place the logs on the prepared sheet 2 inches apart. Bake 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven and cool for 5 minutes. Slice the loaves with a sharp knife into 48 slices, approximately 1/2 inch wide. Cool and store in airtight containers. Cookies will stay fresh up to 5 days.
