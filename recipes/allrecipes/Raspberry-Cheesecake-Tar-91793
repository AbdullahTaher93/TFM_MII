Let pie crust stand at room temperature according to package directions. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. On a floured surface, roll pie crust from center to edge, forming a circle about 13 inches in diameter. Ease pastry into 11-inch tart pan with removable bottom. Trim pastry even with rim of pan. Place pan on baking sheet. Bake crust 10 minutes or until lightly golden. In large bowl, beat cream cheese until fluffy. Gradually add sweetened condensed milk; mix until smooth. Add eggs, vanilla and lemon rind; mix well. DO NOT OVERMIX. Arrange raspberries on bottom of baked shell. Slowly pour filling over fruit. Bake 25 minutes or until center is almost set. Cool. Chill 1 hour. Store leftovers covered in refrigerator.
