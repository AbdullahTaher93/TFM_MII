Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8 inch square baking dish. In a medium bowl, stir together the tuna, peas and cream of chicken soup. Gently fold in the cereal. Transfer to the prepared baking dish. Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbling and lightly browned on top.
