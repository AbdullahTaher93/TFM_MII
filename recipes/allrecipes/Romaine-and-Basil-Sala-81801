Make the dressing first. With the skin still on the garlic cloves, drop them into a small pan of boiling water and cook for 6 minutes. Drain and let cool for a minute. Remove the skins (if they are still on) and smash the garlic in a small bowl, making a paste. Add the mustard, vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper. Blend well. Whisk in the olive oil. Set aside. To toast the pine nuts, add them to a large non-stick dry skillet over medium heat. Stir occasionally. Transfer to a paper towel as soon as some color starts to form. Carefully watch this process for they can go from doing nothing to being burnt in short order. Tear the lettuce into bite-sized pieces. Cut the basil into strips. In a salad bowl toss together the lettuce, basil, cheese and pine nuts. Whisk the dressing again and drizzle over salad and serve immediately.
