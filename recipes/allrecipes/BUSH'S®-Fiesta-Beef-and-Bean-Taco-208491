Heat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Place a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef and carrots and cook, breaking up the large pieces, until the meat is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain excess fat. While the meat is cooking, bake the taco shells according to package directions. When the meat is done, add the beans, cheese, salsa, cumin, chili powder, and garlic powder and stir to combine. Cook until the cheese melts and the mixture is heated through, about 2 minutes. Serve in the taco shells with *optional toppings as desired.
