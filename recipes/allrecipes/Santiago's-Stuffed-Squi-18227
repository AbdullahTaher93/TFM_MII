Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Clean squid, removing tentacles, spine and outer skin. Rinse well in cold water and let drain on paper towels. Coarsely chop shrimp. Flake orange roughy fillets and combine with shrimp, sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt Blot squid with paper towel to remove any excess water. Use a small spoon to pack each squid with fish/shrimp mixture leaving 1 inch unfilled at bottom. Secure open end with a toothpick and place in glass baking dish. Repeat until filling is gone. Any extra squid can be cut into rings and scattered over the stuffed squid. Place tomato, onion, olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, paprika, wine and bread in a blender or food processor and puree. Pour mixture over stuffed squid. Cover dish with aluminum foil and bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove foil and bake for another 30 minutes. Serve warm, garnished with lemon wedges.
