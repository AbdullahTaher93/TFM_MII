Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups. Mix bananas, 3/4 cup brown sugar, milk, butter, egg, and vanilla extract together with a stand mixer; add baking mix, pecans, xanthan gum, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt and mix on Low until just combined into a batter. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups. Sprinkle additional brown sugar over the batter. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before serving.
