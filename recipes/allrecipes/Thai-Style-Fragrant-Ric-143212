Rinse the rice under cold water. Combine the rice, water, coconut milk, ginger, soy sauce, lemongrass, and curry leaves in a saucepan and stir. Bring to a boil over medium heat; reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered until rice is tender, about 10 minutes. Fold the basil into the rice. Serve immediately.
