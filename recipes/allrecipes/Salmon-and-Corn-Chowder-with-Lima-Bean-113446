In a large pot, cook the bacon until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pot. Add the onion and cook over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the potatoes, broth, bacon, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt to the pot and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. Put the corn kernels in a food processor and pulse six to eight times to chop. Add the corn to the pot and cook, covered, until the potatoes and corn are just done, about 5 minutes longer. Add the salmon, lima beans, the remaining 1 1/4 teaspoons salt, and the pepper. Bring just back to a simmer; the fish should be just cooked through. Stir in the half-and-half and serve the chowder topped with the chives.
