Microwave potatoes on high power until just cooked, about 18 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, fry bacon in a large soup pot until crisp, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and pour off all but 4 tablespoons of the drippings. Whisk in flour, then slowly whisk in milk and broth and bring to a simmer, seasoning generously with salt and white pepper. While soup comes to a simmer, remove potatoes from the microwave and using a knife and fork to break the potatoes into large chunks (they fall apart quite naturally at this point). Add them, skins and all, to the soup, along with the cheese and green onions. Stir well and allow to heat through, about 5 to 10 minutes. Adjust seasonings before serving.
