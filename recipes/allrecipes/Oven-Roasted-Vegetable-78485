Heat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place the zucchini, squash, peppers, asparagus, and onion in a large roasting pan. Toss with the olive oil, salt, and pepper to mix and coat. Spread in a single layer in the pan. Roast for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are lightly browned and tender.
