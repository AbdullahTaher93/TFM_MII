In a soup kettle or Dutch oven, cook the beef, pork and sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Add the onions, celery, green pepper and garlic; cook for 8-10 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Stir in the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered for 1-1/2 hours. Discard bay leaves before serving.
