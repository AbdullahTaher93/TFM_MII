Heat the olive oil in a deep pot over medium-high heat. Stir in the onion, garlic, and bell peppers; cook until onions are transparent and peppers are soft, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with black pepper. Stir in the corn, salsa, chili powder, black beans, black-eyed peas, chicken stock, chicken bouillon cube, water, and rice. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and simmer at least 30 minutes until the rice is tender.
