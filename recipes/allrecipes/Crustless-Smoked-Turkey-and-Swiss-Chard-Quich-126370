Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter 9 inch quiche dish or deep pie plate. Spread grated cheese on bottom. Sprinkle green onions over. Spread a layer of smoked turkey on top. Rinse swiss chard and steam (with the moisture still clinging to it), covered, on high, in microwave until wilted about 2 - 5 minutes. Spread on top of turkey. In a bowl beat together milk, eggs, flour, butter, salt and pepper. Pour over layers. Bake until middle is set and knife blade inserted comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool 10 minutes before cutting into wedges.
