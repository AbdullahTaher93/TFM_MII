Mix together the ahi tuna, minced onion, green onion, ginger, seaweed, macadamia nuts, sesame oil, and red pepper in a mixing bowl. Cover and refrigerate at least one hour, for the flavors to come together. Arrange the lettuce leaves on a serving platter, spoon the ahi poke on top, and garnish with the cilantro.
