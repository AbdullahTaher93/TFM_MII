Prepare pie crust according to instructions on the package. Using a knife or large cookie cutter, cut heart shapes from dough. Place hearts on a lightly greased baking sheet and brush edges with egg wash. Collect the dough trimmings and form into two ropes. Twist the dough ropes and secure to edge of hearts with egg wash. Bake in 350 degrees F oven for 15-20 minutes, or until dough becomes golden brown. Remove from oven and let cool. In a large nonstick skillet or wok, stir-fry turkey and garlic in 2 tsp oil. Cook and stir until turkey is lightly browned and reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees F. Remove and keep warm. In the same pan, stir-fry the vegetables in 2 tsp of oil for 4-5 minutes or until heated through. Return turkey to the pan; mix well. Combine cornstarch and soy sauce until smooth; stir into turkey mixture. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1 minute or until thickened. Transfer heart baskets to serving plates. Spoon turkey vegetable mixture into center of the hearts and fill to top of twist; use a slotted spoon to minimize the liquid.
