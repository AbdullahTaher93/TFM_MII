In a large pot over medium high heat, saute the mushrooms and leeks in the butter or margarine and olive oil until tender. Add the sherry and reduce liquid by half. Then add the beef broth, water and ground black pepper. Bring to a boil and add the pasta. Boil gently for 10 minutes, or until the pasta is tender. Garnish with sliced mushrooms if desired.
