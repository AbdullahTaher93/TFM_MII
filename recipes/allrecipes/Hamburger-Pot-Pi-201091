Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix beef, onion soup mix, milk, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Evenly divide meat mixture into the pie crusts and top with hash browns. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Allow pies to rest for 10 minutes before serving.
