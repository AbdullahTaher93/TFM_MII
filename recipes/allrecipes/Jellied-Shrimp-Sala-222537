Bring the tomato bisque to a boil in a saucepan. Remove saucepan from heat and stir cream cheese into the bisque until the cheese melts. Dissolve gelatin in cold water; add to the bisque and stir. Set the mixture aside to cool. Stir shrimp, mayonnaise, celery, bell pepper, and onion into the cooled bisque mixture; pour into a bowl or gelatin mold and refrigerate until solidified, 2 to 3 hours.
