Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Pour 1/4 cup of the dressing over combined chicken and peppers in shallow dish or resealable plastic bag; seal bag. Refrigerate 10 min. to marinate. Remove chicken and peppers from marinade; discard marinade. Grill chicken and vegetables 12 to 15 min. or until chicken is cooked through (165 degrees F) and peppers are crisp-tender, turning and brushing occasionally with the remaining 1/4 cup dressing. Serve over the hot rice.
