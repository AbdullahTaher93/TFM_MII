Place chickpeas, banana pepper, artichoke hearts, baby arugula, olive oil, apple cider vinegar, tahini, cumin, bouquet garni, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper in a food processor. Pulse 3 or 4 times to start. Process for about 1 minute; scrape down sides of processor bowl. Continue to process until large pieces are finely chopped and hummus is to your desired consistency, 1 to 2 minutes. Thin with water, if too thick, adding a few teaspoons at a time.
