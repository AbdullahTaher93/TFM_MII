Pour boiling water over the hibiscus, cover and allow to steep for 30 minutes. During this time, make the orange blossom honey syrup: in a small saucepan, slowly bring honey and water to a boil. Remove from the heat and allow to cool (this can also be made ahead of time and refrigerated until use). Strain the hibiscus tea base into a 2-quart pitcher; add the orange blossom honey syrup, orange juice and cold water; stir until dissolved. To serve: Pour 10 ounces of the punch into a cocktail shaker half-filled with ice cubes and 2 to 3 mint leaves; close tightly and shake. Pour into a tall glass; garnish with orange peel and fresh mint leaves. Serve immediately.
