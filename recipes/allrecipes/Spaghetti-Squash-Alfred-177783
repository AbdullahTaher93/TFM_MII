Pierce squash with fork or skewer in several places. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50 minutes or until the squash is fork-tender. Cut in half, scoop out and discard seeds. Scrape the flesh with fork to separate the spaghetti-like strands. Stir the soup, water and milk in a 2-quart saucepan. Heat over medium heat to a boil. Stir in the Swiss cheese. Place the hot spaghetti squash in a 2-quart serving bowl. Pour the soup mixture over the squash. Toss to coat. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, parsley, and chives.
