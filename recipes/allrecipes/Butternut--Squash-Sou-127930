Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add onions, carrots, and ginger, and cook until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add squash, chicken stock, thyme, zest, and juice, and season with salt and pepper. Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce heat to low, and simmer until the squash is very tender, about 40 minutes. Puree the soup in small batches in a food processor until smooth. (Reserve some squash pieces to add to the soup if you like). Adjust the seasoning. Add more stock or water if the soup is too thick.
