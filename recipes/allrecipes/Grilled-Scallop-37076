Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil grate. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook onion and garlic until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in lemon juice and salt. Place scallops in a large bowl, and toss with butter mixture. Let stand for about 2 minutes. Thread scallops onto skewers, or use a wire grill basket. Cook on preheated grill for about 4 minutes per side. Return butter mixture to saucepan, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and keep warm while scallops cook. Toss with grilled scallops and serve.
