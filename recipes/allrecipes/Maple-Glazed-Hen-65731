Remove and discard giblets from hens; cut lengthwise in half and rinse under cold water. Drain well and pat dry with paper towels. Place halves, skin side down, on rack in shallow foil-lined baking pan. Combine teriyaki baste & glaze, syrup, onion powder and orange peel; brush hens with mixture. Bake in 375 degrees F oven 20 minutes. Turn hens over; brush thoroughly with remaining glaze mixture. Return to oven and bake 30 minutes longer, or until hens are tender.
