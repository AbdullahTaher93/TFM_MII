Spoon half of the softened ice cream into the pie crust. Place crust in freezer for five minutes. Remove crust and spread chocolate topping evenly across the ice cream; sprinkle praline nut crunch over topping and spoon remaining ice cream into pie shell, mounding it in the center. Freeze at least 2 hours or overnight. Remove pie from freezer and let stand for 10 minutes to soften prior to serving. Garnish with chocolate topping, whipped cream and cherry. Store leftovers in freezer.
