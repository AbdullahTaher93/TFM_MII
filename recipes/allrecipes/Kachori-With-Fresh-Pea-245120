Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat; add green chile peppers, jeera, and hing. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Add peas, sugar, and salt; cook and stir over low heat until peas are soft, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and cool pea mixture. Mix maida, 1 tablespoon oil, and salt together in a bowl; add enough water until a dough forms. Allow to rest for 2 to 3 minutes. Grind pea mixture into a coarse paste using a mortar and pestle; add coriander and lemon juice and mix well. Form dough into small balls and roll each into a flat circle using a rolling pin. Spoon pea mixture into the center of each circle. Roll dough around filling so it is completely enclosed. Heat oil for frying in a deep-fryer or large saucepan. Working in batches, fry filled dough balls until crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per batch. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
