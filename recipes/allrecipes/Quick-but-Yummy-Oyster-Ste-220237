Stir the evaporated milk and water together in a large pot over medium-low heat; bring to a gentle boil. Stir butter into the liquid. Season with salt and black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the butter melts completely, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir the oysters into the liquid; continue cooking at a simmer until the edges of the oysters begin to curl, about 15 minutes.
