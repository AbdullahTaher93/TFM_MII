Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix butternut squash, delicata squash, sweet potato, rutabaga, and red potato pieces, carrots, and onion in a large roasting pan. Mix rosemary, thyme, and oregano in a small bowl. Drizzle olive oil over the vegetables and sprinkle with herb mixture; toss to coat vegetables with oil and herbs. Scatter bay leaves over vegetables and drizzle lemon juice and red wine vinegar over the top. Roast in the preheated oven until vegetables are tender, about 1 hour and 30 minutes, stirring every 30 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
