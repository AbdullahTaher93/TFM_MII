Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil a 13x11-inch baking sheet. Set aside. Make Angel Bites. Place egg whites in a medium mixing bowl. Whip on high speed using an electric mixer or wire whisk until frothy. Add SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, vanilla and salt. Mix on high speed until medium-stiff peaks form (approx. 20-30 seconds with an electric mixer). Spoon rounded tablespoons of egg whites onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated 350 degree F oven 10-15 minutes or until firm and golden brown. Remove from pan. Cool. Make filling. Place egg substitute, LACTAID(R) Fat Free Milk, vanilla and light butter in a small saucepan. Blend SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and cornstarch together and add to ingredients in the saucepan. Stir well. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture begins to thicken and bubble (approx. 3-4 minutes). Remove filling from heat and add banana flavor. Stir until well mixed. For an extra creamy filling, pour into the bowl of a food processor or blender. Cover and process until very creamy (approx. 10 seconds). Pour filling into a bowl and refrigerate at least 20 minutes or until ready to serve. Assemble Angel Bites. Just before serving, sandwich Angel Bites with filling. Place three Angel Bites on a plate with the bottoms facing up. Top each with sliced banana and a spoonful of filling. Stack another Angel Bite on top. Repeat for each serving. Garnish with a dollop of whipped cream and chocolate shavings.
