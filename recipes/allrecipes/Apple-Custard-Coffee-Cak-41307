In a bowl, combine biscuit mix, 1/4 cup sugar, milk and vanilla; mix well. Stir in pecans. Pour into a greased 9-in. square baking dish. Toss apples with 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. Sprinkle over batter. In a bowl, combine eggs, cream and remaining sugar. Pour over the apples; sprinkle with remaining cinnamon. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees for 40-45 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.
