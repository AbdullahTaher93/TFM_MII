In a bowl, combine the first six ingredients and mix well by hand. Spread into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until brownies test done with a wooden pick. Meanwhile, in a small mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add egg, coffee and vanilla; mix well. Stir in walnuts and chocolate chips. Spread over brownies. Bake at 350 degrees F for 17 minutes. For icing, melt the chocolate chips and butter in a saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly. Whisk in coffee and enough milk to reach a drizzling consistency. Drizzle over warm brownies. Cool before cutting.
