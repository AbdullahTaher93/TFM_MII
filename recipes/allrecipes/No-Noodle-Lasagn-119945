In a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Add tomato paste and seasonings; mix well. In a bowl, combine the egg, cottage cheese and Parmesan. Roll out each tube of crescent dough between waxed paper into a 15-in. x 10-in. rectangle. Transfer one rectangle to a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Spread with half of the meat mixture to within 1 in. of edges; top with half of the cheese mixture. Repeat meat and cheese layers. Top with mozzarella. Carefully place second dough rectangle on top; press edges to seal. Brush with milk; sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.
