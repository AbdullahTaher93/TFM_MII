In a medium bowl, whisk together oil, honey, soy sauce, garlic and pepper. Add chicken pieces and stir to coat. Cover bowl and marinate chicken, refrigerated, for 1 hour. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Thread chicken, peppers and onions on skewers, alternating chicken with every 2 pieces of vegetable. Discard any remaining marinade. Place kabobs on hot grill; cover and cook, turning once, until grill marks form on both sides and chicken is cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes. Serve.
