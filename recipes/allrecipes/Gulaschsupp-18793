Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the green peppers and tomato paste. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes. Add beef to skillet, then stir in the cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic, salt, broth, lemon juice and caraway seeds. Simmer until the meat is tender, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Remove the goulash from the heat and let it cool slightly. Fold in the sour cream and adjust the seasoning to taste.
