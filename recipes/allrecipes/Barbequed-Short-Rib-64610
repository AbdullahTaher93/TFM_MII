Heat a large skillet over medium high heat and brown the short ribs on all side. Place the ribs in a slow cooker and top with the onions. In a medium bowl, combine the water, beef granules, barbecue sauce, brown sugar and Dijon mustard. Pour sauce over ribs, cover and cook on low for about 6-7 hours, or until tender. Add the cornstarch mixture and continue to cook until the sauce thickens, about 20 minutes.
