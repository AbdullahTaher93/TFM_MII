Melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat, then whisk in the flour to form a thick paste. Slowly whisk in the milk until the mixture resembles a thick sauce. Stir in the tomato soup, Cheddar cheese, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and paprika until heated through, about 10 minutes. Add more milk if the soup becomes too thick.
