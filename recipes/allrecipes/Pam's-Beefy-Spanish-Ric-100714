While chopping onion and bell pepper, cook ground beef in a small soup kettle or Dutch oven until it loses its raw color, about 5 minutes. Add onions and pepper to beef; cook until tender, about 5 minutes longer. Stir in tomatoes, water, rice, ketchup, cumin, Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon of salt and pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until rice is fully cooked, about 20 minutes. Stir in cilantro and serve.
