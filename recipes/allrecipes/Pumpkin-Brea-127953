Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs and add the honey, pumpkin, oil and water. Blend well. In a separate bowl, mix whole wheat flour, baking soda and spices. Pour the dry mixture into wet mixture, and blend thoroughly. Pour it all into two 9 by 5 inch loaf pans coated with nonstick spray. Bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes.
