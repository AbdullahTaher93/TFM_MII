Blend cream cheese with sun-dried tomatoes and provided seasoning mix. Gently crush the croutons so that they don't break through the Lavash when rolling. Combine DOLE Ultimate Caesar Blend in a bowl with croutons and Parmesan and Romano cheeses; toss with dressing. Cut Lavash into desired width (rectangular shape). Some have rounded edges; either will work. Spread Lavash with cream cheese filling then top with a thin layer of salad. Roll into a cylindrical shape. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Slice into pinwheels; place a toothpick into each piece to help hold its shape, and for easy serving. Alternately, cut in half on the diagonal and serve with a cup of soup, or any remaining salad.
