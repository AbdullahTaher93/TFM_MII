Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Toss kale in the skillet; cook and stir until reduced in size by about one-quarter, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove kale to a bowl; refrigerate for 1 hour. Beat mayonnaise, olive oil, mustard, Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and anchovy paste together in a bowl until you get a smooth salad dressing; refrigerate for 1 hour.
