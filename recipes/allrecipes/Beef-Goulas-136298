Heat 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over high heat. Season meat with salt and pepper to taste. Cook meat in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pot, and adding 1 tablespoon each of butter and oil as needed. Cook each batch of meat until well browned on all sides, about 3 to 5 minutes, and transfer to a plate while the next batch browns. Reduce heat to low, add onions, and cook, stirring occasionally until onions are translucent, about 15 to 20 minutes. Return meat to pot, and add paprika and stock. Stir well to combine. Cook, covered,over very low heat, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender and the sauce has thickened, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Adjust seasonings. Serve over egg noodles with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of chives.
