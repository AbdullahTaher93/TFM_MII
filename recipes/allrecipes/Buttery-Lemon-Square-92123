In a bowl with a mixer, beat butter or margarine with 1/2 cup powdered sugar until mixture is smoothly blended. Add 2 cups flour to butter mixture. Beat until well mixed. Pat dough into a ball. Press evenly into a buttered, floured 9- by 13-inch pan. Bake in a 350 degrees F oven until golden, about 20 minutes. While dough bakes, in a food processor or a bowl with a mixer, whirl granulated sugar, remaining 1/3 cup flour, baking powder, grated lemon peel, lemon juice, and eggs to blend. Pour onto hot crust. Bake until the lemon mixture is no longer runny in the center (cut to test), 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from oven and dust with remaining 2 tablespoons powdered sugar. Cool in pan on a rack. With a sharp knife, make cuts straight down to divide into 24 squares. Use a spatula to lift from pan. Serve, chill airtight up to 2 days, or freeze to store longer.
