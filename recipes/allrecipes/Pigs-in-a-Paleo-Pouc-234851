Stir salt, sage, black pepper, turmeric, and marjoram together in a bowl. Place pork in a separate bowl. Sprinkle salt mixture evenly over pork and stir to combine. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter eight 8-ounce ramekins. Divide sausage mixture into 8 balls. Press each ball into a ramekin, creating a well in the center of each. Crack an egg into each sausage well. Bake in the preheated oven until sausage is cooked through and eggs are set, 30 to 40 minutes.
