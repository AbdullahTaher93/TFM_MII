If cheese is stiff, set aside at room temperature to soften. Spread 2 to 4 tablespoons cheese in thin layer on each turkey or ham slice. (The amount of cheese needed depends on the size of the slices.) Roll up tightly from short end and wrap each roll, separately, in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 2 hours or until ready to serve. With sharp knife, trim ends of each roll, then cut into 1/2-inch slices. To serve, place basil or parsley leaves on crackers. Top each with one spiral.
