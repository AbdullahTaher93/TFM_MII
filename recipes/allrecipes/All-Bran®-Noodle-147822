In large bowl, combine Kellogg's(R) All-Bran(R) cereal, flours and salt. Mix in milk and egg whites, adding enough extra flour to make a stiff dough, if necessary. Roll dough on well-floured surface to 1/16-inch thickness. Let dry 1 hour. Cut dough into 3-inch strips. Flouring dough slightly, if necessary, layer 4 or 5 strips on top of each other. Cut each stack, crosswise into 1/4-inch noodles. Spread noodles loosely on floured surface. Let dry about 2 hours. Drop noodles into boiling water or chicken broth. Cook, uncovered about 10 minutes or until tender. Drain. Serve hot.
