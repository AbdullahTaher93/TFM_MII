In a heatproof bowl, cover the wakame with the boiling water and let stand until softened, about 15 minutes. Drain the wakame and press to remove any excess water. Toast the sesame seeds in a small skillet over moderate heat, stirring, for 3 minutes. In a medium bowl, whisk the rice vinegar with the soy sauce and ginger. Whisk in the peanut and sesame oils. Season with salt and cayenne. Add the tofu to the dressing and let stand for 5 minutes. Transfer the tofu to a small plate. Add the edamame, bean sprouts and wakame to the dressing and toss to coat. Fold in the tofu. Transfer to a serving bowl, sprinkle with the sesame seeds and serve.
