Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a 13 x 9-inch baking dish with oil. Season the fillets evenly with the sage. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place in the baking dish. Drizzle with oil. Pour the wine into the dish, being careful not to pour it directly on the fish. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the salmon is opaque in the center. Remove the fillets to a platter. Pour the pan juices into a saucepan. Boil for about 5 minutes or until reduced by at least half. Season with 1/8 teaspoon salt. Pour over the fillets.
