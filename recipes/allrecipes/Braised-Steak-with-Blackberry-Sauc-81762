Mince the shallots, celery and bell peppers. In a very large skillet, melt the butter over medium high heat and saute the shallots, celery and bell peppers for 3 or 4 minutes. Remove from skillet and reserve. Add the steaks and sear them for 3 minutes per side. Do not crowd the steaks, so if they are too large for your skillet, then do this in two batches. If too much juice accumulates in the pan, thereby inhibiting browning, then pour off the liquids into the bowl with the shallots. Return the steaks to the skillet; add the shallot mixture, thyme and the stock (or water). Reduce heat to medium low and simmer for 10 minutes per inch of thickness. Lightly cover with aluminum foil. Turn the steaks after 5 minutes. In a separate saucepan over medium heat, add the sherry and vinegar and bring to a boil. Add the blackberries; stir frequently smashing the fruit against the side of the pan. Once the berries have completely disintegrated, remove from heat. If you find the seed objectionable then simply pour the sauce through a strainer, forcing the pulp through with the back of a spoon. Once the steaks are cooked, remove them to a plate and cover with the foil. Add the blackberry sauce to the liquids in the skillet and bring to a slow boil. Taste test and add salt and pepper as desired. Pour 1/2 of the sauce onto 4 plates, add the steaks and then drizzle the remaining sauce over the steaks.
