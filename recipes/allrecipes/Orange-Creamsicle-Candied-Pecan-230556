Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Heavily butter a large metal baking sheet. Beat egg whites and water together in the bowl of a stand mixer until stiff peaks form. Add orange extract and vanilla extract; beat until incorporated, 1 minute. Mix sugar, cinnamon, salt, and black pepper together in a separate bowl; fold sugar mixture into egg white mixture until just incorporated. Fold in rosemary and tangerine zest until evenly mixed. Add pecans to the sugar-egg white mixture; toss to coat. Spread coated pecans in one layer onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven, turning the baking sheet and stirring the pecans with a metal spoon every 8 to 10 minutes, until crispy and golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer to a sheet of parchment paper to cool completely.
