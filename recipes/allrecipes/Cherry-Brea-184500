Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Whisk together the eggs, shortening, milk, cherry juice, and vanilla extract in a bowl until evenly blended; set aside. Stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a separate large bowl; make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour the cherry juice mixture into the well and stir just until combined. Fold in the cherries. Pour the batter into a loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the top springs back when lightly pressed, about 1 hour. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack before cutting to serve.
