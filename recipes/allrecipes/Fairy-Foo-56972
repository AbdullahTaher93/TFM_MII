In a large saucepan over medium heat, stir together the sugar, corn syrup and vinegar. Bring to a boil, and heat to the hard crack stage, 300 to 310 degrees F (149 to 154 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard, brittle threads. Do not stir once the mixture begins to boil. While you wait for the sugar to come up to temperature, grease a 7x11 inch baking dish. When the mixture reaches the hard crack stage, remove from heat, and quickly stir in the baking soda with a long handled spoon; it will become very foamy. Pour immediately into the prepared dish, and set aside to cool. Cut into little pieces when cool. If you wish to coat the candies with chocolate, melt the chocolate chips in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth. If the chocolate is too thick, some vegetable oil may be added. Dip pieces of candy in chocolate, and place on waxed paper until set.
