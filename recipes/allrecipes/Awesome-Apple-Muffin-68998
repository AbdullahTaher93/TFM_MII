Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 6 cup large muffin pan. In a bowl, whisk together the rice flour, steel cut oats, flax seed, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and arrowroot powder. In a separate bowl, mix the yogurt, egg, butter, apples, and cranberry juice. Thoroughly mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients to form a slightly runny batter. Spoon evenly into the prepared muffin tin cups. Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
