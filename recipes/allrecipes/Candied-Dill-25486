Remove and reserve half the pickles from their container. Pour approximately 1/2 the sugar over the pickles. Pour in 1 tablespoon pickling spice and 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon. Repeat with remaining pickles, sugar, pickling spice and cinnamon. Seal the jar and refrigerate. Turn approximately every six hours for 24 hours to help dissolve the sugar. Serve when the sugar has dissolved.
