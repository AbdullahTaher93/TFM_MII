Mix the oil with the garlic and ground coriander, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Brush this mixture over both sides of the swordfish steaks. Heat a ridged, cast-iron grill pan or nonstick skillet until hot. Fry the fish steaks until just cooked -- they should still be very slightly translucent in the middle, because swordfish becomes dry if overcooked -- 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Meanwhile, make the salad. Peel, seed, and chop the avocados. Mix the avocado chunks with the tomatoes, onion, chile, cilantro, and lime juice. Stir in the red kidney beans and season to taste. Serve the spicy swordfish steaks with the salad and a garnish of mixed salad leaves.
