Peel, core and dice the pear into small pieces. Transfer the pear to a small bowl and stir in sugar, cider vinegar, vanilla, cardamom, and cinnamon. Let mixture rest for 5 minutes to allow the pears to soak up the liquid. Fold in the cream cheese and parmesan cheese. Chop the prosciutto into small pieces and add to the pear and cheese mixture. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Scoop 2 teaspoons of the mixture in the center of a wonton. Using a pastry brush or a finger, wet the inside edges of each wonton with the egg mixture. Fold half of the wonton wrapper on top of each other to form a triangle. Press the edges to seal. In a frying pan, heat 4 tablespoons of vegetable oil on medium-high heat. Fry the wontons on each side for 2 to 3 minutes until golden brown. Transfer the wontons to a plate lined with a paper towel and allow them to cool for 5 minutes before serving.
