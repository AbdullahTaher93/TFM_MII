Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 10 inch pie pan. Combine zucchini, tomato, onion, and Parmesan cheese in prepared pie pan. In a small bowl, combine biscuit mix, milk, eggs, and salt and pepper. Beat until smooth, then pour over vegetable mixture. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.
