In a large pot, combine the chicken broth, onions, carrots, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and pepper, and simmer uncovered for 10 to 15 minutes, until the carrots are soft. Put the vegetables and broth into a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Add the canned pumpkin and evaporated milk, and simmer uncovered for 10 minutes. Serve topped with sour cream and bacon bits, if desired.
