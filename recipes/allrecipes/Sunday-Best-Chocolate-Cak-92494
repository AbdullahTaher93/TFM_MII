Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, beat sugar, canola oil, eggs and vanilla for 4 minutes. Sift together flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add flour mixture alternately with boiling water to the sugar mixture. Beat well after each addition. Pour into an oiled and floured 9 x 13 inch cake pan. Bake 40 minutes, or until cake springs back to the touch.
