In a shallow dish or bowl, combine 1/2 cup four, seasoned salt, thyme and ground black pepper. Mix together; coat chicken pieces in this mixture and fry in shortening in a large skillet until lightly browned on all sides. Sprinkle paprika and garlic salt over chicken. Add hot water to skillet and simmer for 30 minutes. Placed onion rings on top of chicken pieces and simmer for another 30 minutes. Remove chicken, with onions on top, to a serving platter and reserve. In a small bowl, blend 2 tablespoons flour with milk and add to liquid in skillet. Cook, stirring, until thickened. Pour thickened mixture over chicken and serve with hot cooked white rice or egg noodles, if desired.
