Pour the vegetable broth, chicken broth, and pineapple juice into a large saucepan, and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in the brown rice, raisins, turmeric, and cumin, bring back to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, about 10 minutes. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the onion, zucchini, mushrooms, red and yellow pepper for about 5 minutes, until the vegetables have softened. While the vegetables are cooking, stir together honey, 1 tablespoon of oil, lemon juice, ginger, and black pepper in a bowl. Stir honey mixture, cooked vegetables, and pineapple into the cooked rice, bring the mixture back to a boil, and serve hot.
