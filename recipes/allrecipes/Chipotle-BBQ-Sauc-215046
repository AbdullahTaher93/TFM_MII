Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the onion and garlic; cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the ketchup, beer, vinegar, jelly, brown sugar, mustard, cumin, chipotle pepper, paprika, and salt. Bring to a simmer, and cook a few minutes until slightly thickened.
