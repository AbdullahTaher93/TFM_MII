Butter a 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Layer eight sheets of phyllo dough in pan, brushing each with butter. In a bowl, combine nuts, chocolate chips, sugar, cinnamon and lemon peel. Sprinkle 2 cups over top layer of phyllo. Layer and brush four sheets of dough with butter. Top with 2 more cups nut mixture. Layer and brush four more sheets of dough with butter; top with remaining nut mixture. Top with the remaining dough, brushing each sheet with butter. Drizzle any remaining butter over top. Using a sharp knife, cut baklava into 1-1/2-in. diamonds. Bake at 325 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until golden brown. Meanwhile, combine the syrup ingredients in a saucepan; bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Pour over warm baklava. Cool completely in pan on a wire rack.
