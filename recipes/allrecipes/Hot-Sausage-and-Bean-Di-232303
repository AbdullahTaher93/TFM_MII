Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat a skillet over medium heat. Break sausage into small pieces and add to the skillet; cook and stir until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain excess grease from skillet. Stir bean with bacon soup and sour cream together in a bowl; pour over browned sausage and stir. Transfer mixture to a baking dish; top with Cheddar cheese. Bake in preheated oven until the cheese is bubbly and the dip is hot throughout, about 10 minutes. Serve immediately.
