Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef until no pink shows; drain. Mix in the ham, bell pepper, onions, pizza sauce and mushrooms. Lay pizza dough flat on cookie sheet. Distribute pepperoni slices over dough. Place a heaping pile of the sauce mixture on one side of dough (some may be left over). Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Fold dough over and pinch ends and sides together. Poke holes in the top and brush melted butter on it. Cook in a preheated oven for 30 minutes or until golden brown. Slice into individual sections to serve.
