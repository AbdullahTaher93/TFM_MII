Use a small paring knife to cut the peel, pith, and membrane from each orange, leaving just the flesh. Cut orange segments into small pieces; place in a large bowl. Stir in the mango, bell pepper, serrano chile, and lime juice. Season with the mint, dill, and salt. Serve immediately, or allow to flavors to blend in refrigerator, up to overnight.
