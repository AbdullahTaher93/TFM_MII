Preheat a grill for high heat. When the grill is hot, lightly oil the grate. In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, potato, garlic, blue cheese, seasoned salt, pepper, onion, Worcestershire sauce, eggs and bread crumbs. Form into 10 balls, and flatten into patties. Grill for 5 minutes per side, or until well done. Serve on buns with your favorite condiments.
