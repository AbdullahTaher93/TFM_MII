Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Use a knife to cut shallow slits into the surface of the roast. Using 3/4 cup of mustard, brush half over the roast, then completely cover it with 10 strips of bacon; brush bacon with remaining mustard. Cook in preheated oven for 60 minutes until bacon is browned, or until meat thermometer inserted into thickest part of the pork reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Meanwhile, cook halved bacon over medium heat in a skillet until crispy; drain on a paper towel. Crumble bacon into a small bowl and combine with the onion, chopped mushroom stems, and 3/4 cup of mustard. Spoon mixture into the mushroom caps. Place caps in a baking dish and bake for 30 minutes. Serve with sliced pork roast.
