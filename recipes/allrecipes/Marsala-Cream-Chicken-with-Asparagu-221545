Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook penne pasta at a boil until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir shallot in melted butter until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir mushrooms, asparagus, and sun-dried tomatoes into shallot and butter mixture; cook and stir until asparagus begins to soften, about 10 minutes more. Pour chicken broth and Marsala wine into the skillet; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and stir chicken and cream into mixture. Mix softened butter and flour into a paste in a bowl; stir into chicken mixture. Cook, stirring continually, until the flour is cooked and the liquid thickens, 1 to 2 minutes; ladle over the cooked penne pasta and top with Parmesan cheese to serve.
