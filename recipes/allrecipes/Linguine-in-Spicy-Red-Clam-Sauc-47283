Cook the linguine in a large pot of salted water until just tender to the bite. Drain well. Drain the anchovies, reserving 2 tablespoons of the packing oil and 3 or 4 of the anchovies. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat the reserved anchovy oil with the olive oil and cook the garlic over medium heat, stirring for 30 seconds. Add the pepper flakes, reserved anchovies, reserved clam juice, undrained tomatoes, olives, and wine or broth. Simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for 10-15 minutes until lightly reduced. (Sauce can be made a couple of hours before cooking pasta. Refrigerate, but reheat before continuing.) Add clams, scallions, and basil. Cook, stirring for 1 to 2 minutes, or until heated through. Toss sauce with hot pasta and serve.
