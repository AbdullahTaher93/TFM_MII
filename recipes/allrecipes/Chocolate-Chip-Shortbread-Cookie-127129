Pour sugar on a small plate; dip bottom of drinking glass in sugar and gently press down on each cookie to flatten. Press center of each cookie with a tip of a teaspoon (to create a small crescent-shaped indentation design). BAKE in a preheated 300 degree F oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until bottoms begin to brown. COOL for 5 minutes, remove to a wire rack to cool completely. Lightly sprinkle additional sugar on top of cookies while cooling, if desired.
