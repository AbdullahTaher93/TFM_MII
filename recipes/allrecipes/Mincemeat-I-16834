Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place meat in a roasting pan and cook until tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove meat when done, but do not turn off oven. While meat is cooking, place cranberries and water in a medium saucepan and simmer on low heat until cranberries begin to split open. When meat is done grind it together with chopped apples and set aside. Grind up orange and lemon, peel and all, and place them in a large ovenproof pan. Add cranberries, raisins, cherries, gooseberries, brandy, vinegar, sugar, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice. Combine thoroughly then stir in meat mixture. Cover pan with aluminum foil and place in oven. Heat mincemeat for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Sterilize enough canning jars and lids to fit all mincemeat. Place a wire rack in the bottom of a large stock pot and fill halfway with water. Bring water to a rolling boil. Pack mincemeat into sterilized jars, ensuring that there are no spaces or air bubbles. Fill jars all the way to the top and screw on lids. Carefully lower jars into boiling water using a holder. Make sure jars have at least 2 inches of space between them. Pour more boiling water over jars if necessary, so that they are covered by 2 inches of water. Cover pot and process for 30 minutes. Carefully lift jars out of water using a holder, and place on a wooden or cloth-covered surface, at least 2 inches apart. Allow to cool, then check seal by pressing on jar lid. A properly sealed lid will not move up or down at all. Mincemeat should be aged for 2 or 3 months before using.
