Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease muffin cups or line with paper liners. Combine oats, oat flour, cinnamon, allspice, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Add apples, yogurt, eggs, brown sugar, butter, and vanilla extract to oat mixture until batter is well mixed; fold in walnuts. Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.
