Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a loaf pan with cooking spray. Place tofu, eggs, onion soup mix, and soy sauce into a food processor or blender; process until combined. Add walnuts and puree until smooth. Transfer tofu mixture to a large bowl. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir mushrooms, onion, and celery in the hot oil until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Season with oregano, basil, and sage. Stir vegetables and bread crumbs into tofu mixture; press mixture into prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until loaf is golden brown, about 75 minutes. Allow loaf to cool slightly before slicing.
