Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Add artichoke hearts, tomatoes, vegetable broth, roasted bell peppers, basil, herbes de Provence, salt, and pepper; reduce heat and simmer, covered, until flavors combine, about 20 minutes. Transfer artichokes, tomatoes, and roasted bell peppers to a blender using a slotted spoon; puree until smooth. Stir half-and-half into the broth mixture in the pot. Add pureed artichoke mixture; stir slowly until blended. Stir in Parmesan cheese before serving.
