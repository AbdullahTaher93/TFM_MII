Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Lay chicken pieces in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a small microwave safe bowl mix together the mustard, honey and curry powder. Microwave on HIGH (full power) for 1 minute. Add all of the mushrooms, mix together, and pour mixture over chicken. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Turn chicken pieces after 1/2 hour of baking. When done, chicken will be a beautiful golden brown.
