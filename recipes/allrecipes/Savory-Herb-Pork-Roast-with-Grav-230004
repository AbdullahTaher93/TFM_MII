Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix sage, garlic salt, ginger and pepper in small bowl. Place roast on rack in foil-lined roasting pan. Brush pork with oil. Sprinkle seasoning mixture evenly over entire roast. Roast pork 1 1/2 hours or until desired doneness. Transfer pork to cutting board or serving platter. Cover loosely with foil. Pour any pan drippings from roasting pan and water into medium saucepan. Stir in Gravy Mixes. Stirring frequently, cook on medium heat until gravy comes to boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer 1 minute or until slightly thickened. (Gravy will thicken upon standing.) Serve with sliced pork.
