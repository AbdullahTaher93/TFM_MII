Halve onions through root ends. Cut each half into 4 wedges, each with a piece of root holding it together. Pierce steak all over with a fork. Combine onions, steak, and marinade in a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag; squeeze out as much air as possible and press to seal. Chill for at least 4 hours or up to 1 day. Discard marinade and let onions and steak come to room temperature. Trim ends off bread loaves. Cut each loaf crosswise into 4 pieces. Cut each piece almost in half horizontally, leaving one side of crust intact; gently unfold. Lay steak on a charcoal grill over a solid bed of medium-hot coals or medium-high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above grill level only 3 to 4 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Grill meat 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Lift steak to a board and cover with foil. Grill onions until tender and slightly charred, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Also grill sausages until heated through and slightly charred, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Grill bread open face down until lightly toasted, 30 to 60 seconds. Thinly slice steak on an angle across the grain. Arrange on a platter with sausages and onions. Set out bread, greens, avocados, and salsa for guests to build their own sandwiches.
