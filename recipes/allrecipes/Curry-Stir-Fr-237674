Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, salt, and pepper into the onion mixture. Add asparagus and broccoli to the skillet, pour water over the vegetables, and cook until slightly tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir shrimp into the vegetable mixture; cook and stir until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 5 minutes.
