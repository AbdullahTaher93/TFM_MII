Heat a skillet over medium heat. Butter one side of each slice of bread. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese onto the buttered sides. Place one slice buttered side down in the skillet, and place a slice of American cheese and a slice of Cheddar cheese on it. Top with the remaining slice of bread, butter side up. Fry until golden on each side.
