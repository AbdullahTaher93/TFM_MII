Combine flour, eggs, olive oil, salt and water in a medium bowl; stir until smooth. Heat a 7 inch skillet over medium-high heat and lightly brush with olive oil. Ladle enough batter into pan to cover the bottom. Cook until top is set and bottom is brown, about 30 seconds. Lift pancake onto parchment paper and repeat. Stuff with meat or cheese filling, top with tomato sauce and bake.
