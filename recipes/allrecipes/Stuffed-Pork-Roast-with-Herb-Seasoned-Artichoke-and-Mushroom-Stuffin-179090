Heat oil in large skillet. Add green onions and garlic and cook until tender. Add artichokes, mushrooms, parsley, butter and black pepper. Cook and stir until butter is melted. Add broth. Heat through. Place stuffing in large bowl. Add broth mixture. Mix lightly. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Sprinkle pork with black pepper. Spoon 3 cups stuffing mixture down the center of the pork. Fold the sides over the filling to form a roll. Tie the pork crosswise at 2-inch intervals with kitchen twine. (The remaining stuffing can be baked in a covered casserole during the last 15 minutes of roasting.) Sprinkle additional black pepper and garlic powder over pork. Place pork in roasting pan and bake for 45 minutes or until cooked through but slightly pink*. Let pork stand 10 minutes. Remove twine before slicing. Serves 12 to 16.
