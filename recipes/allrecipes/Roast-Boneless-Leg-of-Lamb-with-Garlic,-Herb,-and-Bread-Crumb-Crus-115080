Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees F. Meanwhile, in workbowl of food processor fitted with steel blade, process 1 teaspoon of olive oil with garlic, rosemary, thyme, and parsley until minced, scraping down bowl with rubber spatula as necessary, about 1 minute. Remove 1 1/2 tablespoons herb mixture to small bowl and reserve. Scrape remaining mixture into medium bowl; stir in cheese, bread crumbs, and 1 tablespoon olive oil, and set aside. Lay lamb with rough interior side (which was against bone) facing up on work surface; rub with two teaspoons olive oil, and season generously with salt and pepper. Spread reserved 1 1/2 tablespoons herb mixture evenly over meat, leaving 1-inch border around edge. Roll roast and tie. Season tied roast generously with salt and pepper, then rub with remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Place roasting rack on rimmed baking sheet. Heat 12-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat until very hot, about 3 minutes. Sear lamb until well browned on all sides, about 2 minutes per side; then, using tongs, stand roast on each end to sear, about 30 seconds per end. Transfer to rack and roast until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 120 degrees F, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer lamb to cutting board; remove and discard string. Brush lamb exterior with mustard, then, carefully press herb and bread crumb mixture onto top and sides of roast with hands, pressing firmly to form a solid, even coating that adheres to the meat. Return coated roast to rack; roast until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of roast registers 130 to 135 degrees F (medium-rare), 15 to 25 minutes longer. Transfer meat to cutting board, tent with foil, and let rest 10 to 15 minutes. Cut into 1/2-inch slices and serve.
