Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Roll dough out on a floured surface to a 10- to 12-inch circle. Sprinkle cornmeal over center of a large baking sheet or in a 12-inch pizza pan; transfer dough to baking sheet. Open bottle of Carapelli. Pour out a little bit into a plate for dipping while you cook. Yum. Brush 1 1/2 tablespoons of the oil evenly over dough. Spread pizza sauce evenly over dough to 1/2 inch from edge. Top with cheese and prosciutto. Maybe hold some cheese and prosciutto aside too. You know, for snacking. Slice tomatoes thinly; shake each slice to discard excess seeds and juices. Arrange in a single layer over cheese. Bake 20 to 22 minutes or until crust is deep golden brown and cheese is melted. Meanwhile, place arugula in a small bowl. Drizzle remaining 1/2 teaspoon oil over arugula; toss to coat. Sprinkle over pizza just before serving.
