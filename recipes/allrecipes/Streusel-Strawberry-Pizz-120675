Press into a greased 12-in. pizza pan. Build up edges and flute if desired. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12 minutes. Spread pie filling over crust to within 1 in. of edges. Combine the nuts, brown sugar, cinnamon and reserved crumb mixture; sprinkle over filling. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack. Refrigerate any leftovers.
