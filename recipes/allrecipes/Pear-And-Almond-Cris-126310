Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the pears, maple syrup, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and nutmeg in an 11 inch X 7 inch baking dish. In a medium bowl, combine the oats, almonds, brown sugar, flour, butter, and oil and mix with your fingers to form crumbs. Sprinkle the topping over the pear mixture. Bake for 40 minutes, or until the pears are tender and bubbly and the topping is lightly browned.
