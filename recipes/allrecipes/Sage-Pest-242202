Process walnuts, parsley, sage, and garlic together in a food processor until coarsely ground. With the food processor still running, slowly stream olive oil into the mixture until completely integrated into a smooth mixture. Add Pecorino Romano cheese, salt, and pepper; continue to process until the mixture has the consistency of a loose paste.
