Bake the potatoes at 400 degrees F for 45-55 minutes or until tender. Meanwhile remove papery outer skin from garlic (do not peel or separate cloves). Place garlic in a double thickness of heavy-duty foil. Frizzle with oil. Wrap foil around garlic. Bake at 400 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until softened. Cool for 10 minutes. Cut top off garlic head, leaving root end intact. Squeeze softened garlic into a small bowl; set aside. Cut a thin slice off the top of each potato and discard. Scoop out the pulp, leaving a thin shell. In a bowl, mash the pulp with butter. Stir in the milk, buttermilk, rosemary, salt, pepper and roasted garlic. Pipe or spoon into potato shells. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 425 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until heated through. Sprinkle with paprika.
