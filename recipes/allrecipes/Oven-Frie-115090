Set oven rack on the upper level and preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Coat a baking sheet lightly with nonstick cooking spray. Combine oil, salt, paprika and pepper in a large bowl. Add potato wedges and toss to coat. Spread the potatoes on the prepared baking sheet and roast for 20 minutes. Loosen and turn the potatoes; roast until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Serve immediately.
