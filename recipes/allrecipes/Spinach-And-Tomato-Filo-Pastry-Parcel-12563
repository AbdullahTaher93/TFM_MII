Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Thoroughly clean the spinach. Remove stems, and chop. Steam until wilted. Stir fry mushrooms in oil over high heat until browned. Cut all 4 pieces of phyllo in half. Brush each sheet with melted butter, and put in two piles. In the center of each stack, place first 1/2 of the spinach followed by 1/2 of the feta, mushrooms, and tomato sauce. Bring the sides of phyllo dough around, and to the top of the bundles. Place on baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
