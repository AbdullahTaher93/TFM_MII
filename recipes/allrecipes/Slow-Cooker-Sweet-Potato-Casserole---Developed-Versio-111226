Lightly grease a slow cooker. In a large bowl, blend sweet potatoes, 1/3 cup butter, 3 tablespoons SPLENDA(R) and 2 teaspoons molasses. Beat in orange juice, eggs and milk. Transfer this mixture to the prepared casserole dish. In a small bowl, combine pecans, 1/4 cup SPLENDA(R), flour and 2 tablespoons butter. Spread the mixture over the sweet potatoes. Cover the slow cooker and cook on HIGH for 3 to 4 hours.
