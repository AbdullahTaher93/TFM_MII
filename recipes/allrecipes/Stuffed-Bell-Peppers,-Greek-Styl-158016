Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the onion and ground lamb; cook and stir until the onion is tender, and the meat is no longer pink, about 7 minutes. Stir in the rice, salt, black pepper, and mint; cook 5 minutes longer. Add the water and parsley. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and continue cooking and stirring until the water has been completely absorbed by the rice, about 15 minutes. Stir the chicken broth and diced tomatoes together in an oven-proof dish that will just fit the peppers. Scoop the lamb mixture into the bell peppers, and place them into the dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the peppers are tender and the tomatoes are bubbly, about 45 minutes.
