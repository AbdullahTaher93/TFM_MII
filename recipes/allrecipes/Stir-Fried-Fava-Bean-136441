Fill a 4-quart saucepan with water and bring to a boil. Add beans, return to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes. Drain beans, discarding liquid, and let sit for 2 to 3 minutes. Heat oil in a wok or a large saute pan over medium-high heat, and add fava beans, salt, and fish sauce; stir-fry for about 2 minutes. Add scallions and stir-fry until the beans are tender, about 1 minute. Serve immediately
