Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Rinse chicken and dry inside and out with paper towels. Place the chicken in a bowl just slightly larger than the chicken. In a small bowl, mix together the white wine, minced garlic, and herbes de Provence. Pour marinade over the chicken. Marinate in the refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, turning the chicken every 5 or 10 minutes. Transfer chicken to a small roasting pan, put the basil leaves into the cavity. Pour the marinade over the chicken. Cover pan tightly with a lid or seal with foil. Place in oven and roast for 30 minutes. Uncover pan, baste chicken, and roast for another 45 to 50 minutes, basting frequently, until chicken is nicely browned and the juices run clear.
