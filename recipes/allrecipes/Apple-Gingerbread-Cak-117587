In a large mixing bowl, beat the cake mix, water and egg until combined. Add apple; stir to combine. Pour into a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Combine the pecans and brown sugar; sprinkle over the top. Bake at 350 degrees F for 23-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
