Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch baking dish. Layer the potatoes into the prepared baking dish. Mix together the soup, milk, and melted butter in a bowl until thoroughly combined; pour the mixture over the potatoes. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven on a lower rack until the potatoes are tender, about 1 hour.
