In a large pot cover the garbanzo beans with at least 12 cups water. Cook over medium heat for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until tender. Check occasionally, as you might need to add more water. Working in small batches, in a blender, on either the chop or blend setting, process garbanzo beans. Blend until the mixture is a paste. Add onions, thyme, salt and pepper to the mixture; mix well. Add bread cubes and egg; mix well. Form the garbanzo bean mixture into patties. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry patties until each side is golden brown.
