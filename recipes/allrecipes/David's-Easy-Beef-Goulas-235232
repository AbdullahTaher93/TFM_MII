Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Sear stew meat in hot skillet to brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Pour water into skillet. Stir tomato paste and onion soup mix into the water. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, place a cover on the skillet, and simmer until the beef is tender enough to easily cut with a fork, about 2 hours.
