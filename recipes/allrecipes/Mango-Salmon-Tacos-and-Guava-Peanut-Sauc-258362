Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a large piece of aluminum foil with cooking spray; place salmon on top. Lay mango pieces over salmon. Wrap up salmon and mango with aluminum foil; transfer to a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool until easily handled, about 5 minutes. Flake salmon into pieces and chop mango. Combine guava juice, soy sauce, peanut butter, and sugar in a blender; blend until smooth. Place corn tortillas on a microwave-safe plate and cover with a dampened paper towel. Heat in the microwave until warm, about 20 seconds. Stack 2 corn tortillas on each serving plate. Divide salmon, mango, carrot, and kale between each plate. Drizzle peanut sauce on top.
