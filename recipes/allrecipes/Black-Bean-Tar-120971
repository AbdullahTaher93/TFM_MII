In a bowl, combine the first five ingredients. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in enough water until mixture forms a ball. Press dough onto the bottom and up the sides of an ungreased 9-in. fluted tart pan with a removable bottom. Chill for 15 minutes. Line unpricked crust with a double thickness of heavy-duty foil. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes. Remove foil; bake 8-10 minutes longer or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. In a blender, combine 1 cup beans, sour cream and 1/2 teaspoon salt; cover and process until smooth. Spread over crust. In a skillet, saute corn in oil until tender. Remove from the heat; add red pepper, onions, cilantro, jalapenos, pepper and remaining salt. Add cheese and remaining beans. Mound over the pureed beans (pan will be full). Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until cheese is melted. Serve with sour cream if desired.
