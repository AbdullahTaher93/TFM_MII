Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large casserole dish. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir onions, garlic, oregano, and basil in the hot oil until onions are soft, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir chicken into onion mixture and cook, stirring often, until chicken is no longer pink on the outside, about 5 more minutes. Add diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and black beans. Bring mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring often. Stir mozzarella cheese into chicken mixture and pour into prepared casserole dish. Combine baking mix with Parmesan cheese, almond milk, butter, and egg in a bowl to make a batter. Pour batter over chicken mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling and crust has browned, 30 to 40 minutes.
