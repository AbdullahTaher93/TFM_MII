Sprinkle both sides of steaks with flour. In a large skillet, cook steaks in oil to desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F). Remove and keep warm. In the same skillet, saute the mushrooms, onions and garlic until tender, adding additional oil if necessary. Stir in wine. Bring to a boil; boil for 1 minute. Add the broth, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil; boil for 6 minutes or until sauce is reduced by half. For two people, serve two steaks with 1-1/2 cups sauce. Save the remaining steaks and sauce for Steak and Mushroom Soup and Steak and Mushroom Soup and Steak Hash (recipes on next page).
