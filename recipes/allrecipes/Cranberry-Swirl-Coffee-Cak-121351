Sprinkle walnuts into a greased 10-in. fluted tube pan. In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Stir in almond extract. Combine the dry ingredients; add to creamed mixture alternately with sour cream. Spread half of the batter over walnuts. Top with half of the cranberry sauce. Repeat layers. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely. In a small bowl, combine glaze ingredients until smooth; drizzle over cake.
