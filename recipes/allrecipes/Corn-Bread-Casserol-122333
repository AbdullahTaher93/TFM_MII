Prepare corn bread mixes according to package directions. Pour half of the batter into a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Combine corn and creamed corn; spread over batter. Top with chilies and cheese. Carefully spread with remaining corn bread batter. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Serve warm.
