If using wooden skewers, soak 8 heavy wood skewers in water. Combine brown sugar, pineapple juice, vinegar, soy sauce, and ginger in medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Continue cooking 30 minutes to reduce to 2 cups. Meanwhile, cut each onion into 8 wedges. Place in 13-inch by 9-inch glass dish. Remove seeds from peppers, cut each into 8 large pieces and add to dish. Then add pineapple pieces to dish. Stir lime juice into pineapple juice mixture and pour over onion, pepper and pineapple pieces. Cover dish and marinate in refrigerator 1 hour. Spray cold grill and utensils well with cooking spray. Position grill 3 to 4 inches from heat. Heat grill according to manufacturer's suggestion. Cut each smoked sausage piece into 4 pieces. To assemble each skewer, place 1 piece onion, red pepper, pineapple, sausage, onion, pepper and pineapple on metal or wooden skewer. Reserve remaining juice mixture to use as a glaze while grilling. Place skewers on medium heat grill for several minutes until they start to brown. Brush with reserved juice mixture. Turn each skewer over and brush again until skewer has been covered. Continue heating until sausage is hot, about 10 minutes total time.
