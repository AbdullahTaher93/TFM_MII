Stir the mango, tomato, cucumber, garbanzo beans, lime juice, lemon juice, jalapeno pepper, red pepper flakes, and lemon basil in a bowl; season with kosher salt. Set aside. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Season the cod with the paprika, salt, and pepper; brush with the canola oil. Cook the cod on the preheated grill until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes per side. Quickly warm the tortillas on the grill just before the cod is finished. Serve the cod in the warm tortillas topped with the mango salsa.
