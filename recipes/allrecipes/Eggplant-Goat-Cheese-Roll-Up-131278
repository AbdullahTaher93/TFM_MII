Preheat broiler. Cut eggplant lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. (Discard two outer slices.) Lightly spray both sides of each inner slice, then season with oregano, salt, and pepper. Place slices on rack of a broiler pan. Broil eggplant 2 minutes per side or until tender and lightly golden. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix the tomatoes, onion, and garlic. Spread each slice with one table-spoon goat cheese. Top each evenly with the tomato mixture and roll jelly-roll fashion, starting at the narrow end. Serve immediately.
