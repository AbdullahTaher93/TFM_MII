Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, onion, jalapeno peppers, chili powder, cayenne, salt, garlic, and black pepper together in the crock of a slow cooker; add ground beef and stir. Cook on High for 6 1/2 hours (or on Low for 10 hours).
