In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, scallions, and garlic; cook, stirring often, until mushrooms brown and soften, 6 to 8 minutes. Add flour and stir well. Cook about 2 to 3 minutes more. Pour in broth, stirring constantly. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring frequently, until soup is thick and mushrooms are fully cooked. Transfer half of soup to a blender (or use a hand blender in pot). Puree until smooth. Return puree to pot, stir thoroughly, and serve.
