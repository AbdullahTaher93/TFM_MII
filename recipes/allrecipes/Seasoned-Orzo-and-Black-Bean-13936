In a 4 quart saucepan, combine water and pasta. Cook over medium high heat until mixture comes to a full boil, 4 to 6 minutes. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until pasta is tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in frozen vegetables, cover, and reduce heat to medium low. Cook until vegetables are tender crisp, 2 to 4 minutes. Do not overcook. Drain. Stir in beans, butter or margarine, tarragon, and thyme. Continue cooking until heated through. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
