In a large salad bowl, whisk the lemon juice, yogurt, soy sauce and garlic until blended. Whisk in the olive oil in a thin stream and season the vinaigrette with salt and pepper. Add the escarole, parsley, chives, tarragon, mint, scallions and apples and toss until evenly coated. Sprinkle the pomegranate seeds on top and serve right away.
