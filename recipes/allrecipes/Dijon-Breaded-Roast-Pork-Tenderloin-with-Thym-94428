Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a lipped cookie sheet with foil; spray with vegetable cooking spray. Split each pork tenderloin lengthwise almost but not all the way through with a sharp knife. Open up each pork tenderloin and pound lightly with fist to flatten. Combine eggs, mustard, thyme, salt and pepper in a shallow pan. Mix breadcrumbs and olive oil in a separate shallow baking pan. Working one at a time, coat tenderloin completely in egg mixture then dredge in breadcrumbs, pressing to adhere. Set on prepared baking sheet. This dish can be prepared and refrigerated for 60 minutes prior to cooking. Bake until golden brown and cooked through (150 to 160 degrees F on a meat thermometer ), about 20 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes. While tenderloin is resting heat a skillet, add the apple cider and reduce by half. Slice tenderloin, spoon the sauce over and serve.
