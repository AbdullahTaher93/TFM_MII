Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix Kielbasa, potatoes, onion, baby carrots, and garlic in a roasting pan; season with salt and pepper. Drizzle olive oil over the mixture; stir to coat. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove aluminum foil and bake until potatoes are completely cooked, about 30 minutes more.
