Bring broth, zest, cinnamon stick, and bay leaf to a boil in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat. Cover and boil 5 minutes. Remove zest, cinnamon, and bay leaf with slotted spoon. Whisk together eggs, yolks, lemon juice, and cayenne in medium bowl. Remove pot from heat. Slowly add 1/2 cup broth to the egg mixture, whisking constantly. Continuing to whisk, slowly pour the egg mixture back into remaining broth. Cook, still whisking constantly, over low heat until thickened slightly, about 5 minutes. (Do not allow broth to boil, or eggs will scramble.) Fold in chicken and rice and cook, stirring constantly, until heated through. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve in bowls sprinkled with broccoli and parsley.
