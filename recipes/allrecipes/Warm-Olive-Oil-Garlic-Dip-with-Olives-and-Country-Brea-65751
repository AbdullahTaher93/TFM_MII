In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat oil and butter until bubbly. Add garlic. Reduce heat to low and cook until garlic is fragrant; do not allow garlic to brown. Add anchovies and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in chives and parsley. Season with pepper. Serve warm with olives and bread, for dipping.
