Pop favorite popcorn from yellow corn kernels over stove top or use favorite microwave popcorn brand. Spread on baking sheet and set aside. In a saucepan, melt vegan spread and stir in the agave, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt until dissolved. Take the pan off the heat and slowly whisk in the creamer until well combined. Return to heat, and continue to whisk for 10 minutes or until sauce reaches an amber color and thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Stir in coconut flakes and vanilla. Let cool slightly before drizzling over popcorn. Drizzle mixture over popcorn and blend in with a spatula. Serve immediately.
