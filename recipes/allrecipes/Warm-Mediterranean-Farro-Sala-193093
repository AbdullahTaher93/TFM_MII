Place farro, water, and salt in a 2-quart sauce pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to low, cover and simmer until liquid evaporates, about 20 minutes. While farro is cooking, place all remaining salad ingredients except dressing in a medium serving bowl. After farro is cooked, drain in a colander and let cool for 5 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent clumping. Place farro in serving bowl with other ingredients and stir to blend. Add dressing; stir to coat all ingredients. Serve warm.
