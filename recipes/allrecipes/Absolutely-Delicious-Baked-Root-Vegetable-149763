Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Toss potatoes, rutabaga, sweet potato, parsnips, and carrots with olive oil and chili sauce in a large bowl until coated. Season with onion powder, garlic powder, grill seasoning, and pepper. Toss again until evenly coated, then spread vegetables into a 9x13 inch roasting pan. Roast vegetables in preheated oven for 20 minutes, then stir, return to oven, and continue cooking until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes more.
