Preheat the oven's broiler. In a medium bowl, stir together the tuna, celery, green onion, mayonnaise, lemon juice and curry powder. Spoon equal amounts onto each English muffin half, and top with a slice of cheese. Place the sandwiches on a baking sheet. Broil for 2 to 3 minutes, or until cheese is melted and toasty. Serve hot.
