Heat a toaster oven to 400 degrees. Spray a pizza pan small enough to fit in toaster oven with cooking spray. Heat a large skillet over high heat and place tortilla into the hot skillet. Cook tortilla until heated through, about 5 minutes; spread with pizza sauce and scatter tomato and pineapple pieces over sauce. Sprinkle pizza with basil, oregano, and garlic powder. Arrange ham pieces onto pizza and top with mozzarella cheese. Continue to heat pizza until tortilla is browned and crisp, 3 to 5 more minutes. Transfer pizza to the prepared pizza pan. Cook in the preheated toaster oven until cheese begins to brown, about 10 minutes.
