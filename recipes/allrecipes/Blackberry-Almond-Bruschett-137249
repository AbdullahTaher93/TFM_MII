Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Bake French loaf as directed on can. Cool 5 minutes. Cut ends off loaf; cut loaf crosswise into 24 slices, about 1/2 inch thick. Arrange slices on ungreased cookie sheet. Spray each slice with cooking spray until lightly coated; sprinkle with granulated sugar. Return to oven; bake 8 to 10 minutes longer or until lightly toasted. Meanwhile, in small bowl, beat cream cheese, almond extract and 1/4 cup powdered sugar with electric mixer on low speed until well combined. Spread cheese mixture evenly onto toasted bread slices. Top each with 3 or 4 blackberries; sprinkle with almonds. With small strainer, sprinkle 3 tablespoons powdered sugar over bruschetta.
