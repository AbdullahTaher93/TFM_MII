Spread about 2 teaspoons pizza sauce on one side of each slice of bread. Top four slices with the salami, cheese and green pepper. Top with remaining bread; brush the outsides of bread with butter. Grill sandwiches on a hot griddle or in a skillet over medium heat until both sides are golden brown and cheese is melted.
