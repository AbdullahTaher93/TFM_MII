Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lay prosciutto onto a work surface. Place 1 fig on the end of each prosciutto slice. Spread a thin layer goat cheese onto each fig. Roll prosciutto around each fig; arrange on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until prosciutto is crisp, 3 to 4 minutes.
