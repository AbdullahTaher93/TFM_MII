Prepare brownies following directions on box using water, vegetable oil, and eggs. Pour batter on top of the Sandies Cookies crust. Evenly place dollops of cherry pie filling into brownie batter. Bake at 350 degrees F for 28 minutes or until toothpick inserted comes out clean. Remove from oven and cool.
