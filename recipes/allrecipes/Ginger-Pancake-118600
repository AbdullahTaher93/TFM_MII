In a bowl, combine biscuit mix, ginger, cinnamon and cloves. In a small bowl, whisk egg, milk and molasses until blended; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Pour batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto a lightly greased hot griddle. Turn when bubbles form on top; cook until second side is golden brown. Keep warm. For syrup, melt the butter in a small saucepan. Stir in the sugar, water, egg yolk and lemon juice. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat. Serve warm with pancakes.
