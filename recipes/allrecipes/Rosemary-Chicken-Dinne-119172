Cut each potato into four wedges. Place chicken and potatoes in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish or shallow roasting pan. Drizzle with oil. Combine salt, garlic powder and pepper; sprinkle over chicken and potatoes. Sprinkle rosemary over chicken. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 45 minutes; drain. Bake 15-20 minutes longer or until potatoes are tender and chicken juices run clear.
