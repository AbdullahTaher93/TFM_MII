In a 3-quart (3 L) saucepan, combine the milk, egg substitute, tapioca, and sugar; let stand for 5 minutes. Bring the tapioca mixture to a boil over medium heat. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Spoon the tapioca into four 6-ounce (175 mL) wine glasses or ramekins. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour, stirring once. To serve, spoon the preserves over the tapioca. Sprinkle with the fresh raspberries and garnish with the mint, if desired.
