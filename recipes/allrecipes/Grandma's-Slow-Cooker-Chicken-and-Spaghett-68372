Place chicken pieces in a slow cooker. Mix together tomato sauce and tomato paste and pour over the chicken. Add the diced tomatoes, onion, garlic cloves and minced garlic and seasonings, adjusting for your personal taste. Cover the slow cooker, set on low, and cook until chicken is done, 6 to 8 hours. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the spaghetti, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well. Ladle some sauce and a piece of chicken on each serving of spaghetti.
