Place the avocado, red onion, lime juice, grapefruit juice, rice wine vinegar, black pepper, and sea salt in a blender, and process until smooth, about 30 seconds. While the blender is running, drizzle in the olive oil; add honey, cilantro, mint, and basil leaves, and process for a few more seconds to leave the herbs visible as small flecks. Toss the arugula, kalamata olives, and cherry tomatoes in a salad bowl; sprinkle with shaved Parmesan cheese. Pour vinaigrette over the salad, and toss to serve.
