Heat a cast-iron skillet or non-stick pan over high heat until skillet is warm; reduce heat to medium. Arrange 2 bread slices in the hot skillet. Add 1 teaspoon butter under each slice in the skillet; flip bread so butter-side is face-up. Spread about 1 teaspoon mustard onto each bread slice; top with 1 slice Cheddar cheese, 1 slice Swiss cheese, tomato slices, and avocado slices. Top each avocado layer with 1 slice Cheddar cheese, 1 slice Swiss cheese, and 1 slice bread. Spread butter onto top piece of bread; flip sandwich and cook until cheeses are slightly melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer sandwiches to a microwave-safe plate and heat in microwave until cheeses are fully melted, no longer than 30 seconds.
