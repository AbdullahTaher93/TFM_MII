Place flour in a medium bowl. Season lamb with salt and pepper, and dredge in flour to evenly coat. Heat olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat, and cook the lamb until evenly browned. Scrape up the brown bits from the surface of the skillet. Mix in garlic, parsley, and red wine vinegar. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer approximately 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
