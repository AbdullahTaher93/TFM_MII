In a large bowl beat egg yolks. Add the butter, honey, almond extract, boiling water, coconut, and flour. Stir until just blended. In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until stiff with an electric mixer. Fold egg whites into muffin batter. Pour batter two-thirds of the way full into greased muffin tin. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven for 20 to 25 minutes.
