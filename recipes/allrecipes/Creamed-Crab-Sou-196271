Melt butter in a large pot over medium high heat. Add the onion and cook 2-3 minutes or until aromatic. Add potatoes, Old Bay(R) seasoning, mustard, and thyme. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring often, until the potatoes are just tender, about 15-20 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the flour, cayenne, salt and pepper. Mix well. Return to medium heat and stir constantly for 1-2 minutes to cook the flour. Remove from heat again and slowly pour in the LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, while stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Return to heat and cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently until thickened, about 5-6 minutes. Add the crabmeat and parsley. Simmer over low heat 5-8 minutes or until heated through. Stir in sherry, if desired, and top with chopped scallions just before serving.
