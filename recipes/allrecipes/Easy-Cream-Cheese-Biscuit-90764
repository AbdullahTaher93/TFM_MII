Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Mix flour with baking powder. With a pastry blender or two knives, cut in Philadelphia Cream Cheese Spread to form a crumbly mixture. Pour milk into the cream cheese/flour mixture and sprinkle on optional additions. Stir lightly with a fork until dough holds together. On a floured surface, pat dough to a thickness of 3/4 inch. Using the top of a glass or a round or square cookie cutter, cut out 10 to 12 biscuits, cutting straight down and not twisting the cutter. With a spatula, place the biscuits on a cookie sheet. Bake until light golden brown, for 12 to 15 minutes.
