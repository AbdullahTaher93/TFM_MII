In large bowl, mix beef, 3/4 cup of the cooking sauce, the bread crumbs and steak seasoning. Divide mixture into 6 equal portions. Divide each portion in half, to form a top and bottom patty. Form bottom half of patty, and add about 1 1/2 teaspoons bacon to center of patty. Seal with top half of patty. Continue until all 6 patties have been formed. Heat 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat; add patties to skillet. Cook 6 minutes; turn, and cook 7 to 8 minutes longer or until meat thermometer inserted in center of patties reads 160 degrees F. In small microwaveable bowl, heat remaining cooking sauce uncovered on High 1 minute. Top each burger with slightly less than a tablespoonful cooking sauce, and serve on buns.
