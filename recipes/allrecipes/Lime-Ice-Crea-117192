In a saucepan, combine milk and sugar. Cook over medium heat until sugar is dissolved and mixture reaches 175 degrees F. Cool to room temperature. Stir in the lime juice and peel. Freeze in an ice cream freezer according to manufacturer's directions. Transfer frozen lime mixture to a bowl; allow to soften slightly. In a small mixing bowl, beat whipping cream until stiff peaks form. Fold into softened lime mixture. Allow ice cream to firm up in your refrigerator freezer for 4 hours before serving.
