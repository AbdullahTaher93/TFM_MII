In a food processor or blender, combine the green onions, onion, jalapeno pepper, soy sauce, vinegar, vegetable oil, brown sugar, thyme, cloves, nutmeg and allspice. Mix for about 15 seconds. Place the chicken in a medium bowl, and coat with the marinade. Refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours, or overnight. Preheat grill for high heat. Remove chicken breasts from marinade, and discard leftover marinade. Lightly oil grill grate. Cook chicken on the preheated grill 6 to 8 minutes per side, until juices run clear. Cut chicken into thin strips. In a small bowl, mix together mayonnaise, lime juice, and black pepper; spread onto one side of each slice bread. Arrange chicken strips on 6 slices bread, and top with lettuce, tomato, cheese, and remaining bread to make 6 sandwiches.
