Dissolve 3 tablespoons salt in 8 cups of water in a bowl and brine lingcod at room temperature for 30 minutes. Drain brine and rinse and dry cod; season 1 side with salt and pepper. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut lemon in half; zest 1 half and cut the other half into wedges. Melt 1/4 cup of butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add cod; cook until fillets are golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer fillets into a baking pan; squeeze zested half of lemon over cod. Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, lemon pepper, and lemon zest in a bowl. Top fillets with bread crumb mixture. Cut remaining butter into pieces and dot top of fillets. Bake fillets in the preheated oven until bread crumb mixture is golden brown and cod flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes.
