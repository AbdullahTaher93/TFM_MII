Pierce meat all over with the tip of a sharp knife. Insert the garlic into the cuts in the meat. Place in a bowl or large freezer-weight resealable plastic bag. Mix dressing, cumin, lime peel and juice until well blended; pour over meat. Cover the bowl or seal the bag and refrigerate overnight. Remove meat from the marinade; discard marinade. Place meat in a foil-lined roasting pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours. Pour orange juice over meat. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the meat. Bake an additional 30 min. or until internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F. Let stand 10 min. before slicing to serve. Serve with juices from the pan.
