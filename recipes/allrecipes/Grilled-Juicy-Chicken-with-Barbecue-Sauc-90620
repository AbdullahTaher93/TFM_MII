Bring 3 quarts water to a full rolling boil in a 5 to 6 quart pan. Drop chicken into boiling water, cover pot tightly, and remove from heat at once. Let stand undisturbed 20 minutes. To test doneness, cut chicken in thickest part; if still pink, let stand a few more minutes. Lift from pan and immerse in ice water until cold, about 10 minutes. Drain, then use or chill airtight up to 1 day. Preheat barbecue grill. Place cooled chicken in a resealable plastic food bag and pour enough barbecue sauce over chicken to coat each piece, about half the bottle (refrigerate unused barbecue sauce in bottle for another use). Remove chicken from plastic bag. Lay chicken over a solid bed of medium coals or medium heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 4 to 5 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning chicken as needed to heat and brown evenly, about 6 minutes total. Remove chicken to a platter and slather with extra barbecue sauce, if desired.
