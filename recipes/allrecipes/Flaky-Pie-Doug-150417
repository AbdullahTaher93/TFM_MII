In a food processor, pulse the flour and salt. Add the butter and lard and pulse 5 or 6 times, until they are the size of peas. Drizzle on the ice water and pulse just until the crumbs are moistened. Press the dough into a ball. Divide the dough into 2 pieces, one slightly smaller than the other. Flatten into disks, wrap in plastic and refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes.
