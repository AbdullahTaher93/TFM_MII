In a bowl, sprinkle gelatin over cold water; let stand for 1 minute. Drain pineapple, reserving 1 cup juice (discard remaining juice or save for another use). Set the pineapple aside. In a saucepan, bring reserved juice to a boil. Remove from the heart. Stir in sugar, salt and gelatin mixture until dissolved. Add orange juice and vinegar. Refrigerate for 2 hours or until partially set. Fold in the carrots and pineapple. Transfer to a 4-cup mold coated with nonstick cooking spray. Refrigerate until firm. Unmold onto a serving platter.
