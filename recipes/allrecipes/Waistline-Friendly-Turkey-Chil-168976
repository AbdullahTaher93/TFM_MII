Heat a large, nonstick pot over medium-high heat and stir in the ground turkey, onion, garlic, green pepper, and red pepper. Cook and stir until the turkey is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Pour in the tomatoes, salsa, barbeque sauce, green chiles, corn, and black beans. Season with lime juice, cumin, red pepper flakes, chili powder, and cilantro. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the flavors develop, 1 to 3 hours. Serve with a dollop of sour cream on each serving.
