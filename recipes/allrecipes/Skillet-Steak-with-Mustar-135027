Cook the rice according to the package directions. While the rice is cooking, heat the olive oil in a nonstick skillet. Brown the sirloin strips, onions, and bell peppers over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes. Mix in the soy sauce and mustard; cook for 5 minutes or until the meat is tender. Salt to taste. Serve over the rice.
