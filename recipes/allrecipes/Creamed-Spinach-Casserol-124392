In a saucepan, cook spinach in a small amount of water for 2-3 minutes; drain thoroughly. Add 4 tablespoons butter, salt, pepper, cheese, eggs and milk. Spoon into two greased 8-oz. baking dishes. Melt the remaining butter; add crumbs. Sprinkle over spinach mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until almost set.
