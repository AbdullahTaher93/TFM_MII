In a large stock pot, combine onion, chicken broth, carrots, celery and garlic. Bring to a boil. Add broccoli, cover and cook for 5 to 10 minutes or until tender. Transfer soup to a blender or food processor and puree. Return to stock pot, add milk, salt and pepper, and heat through over medium heat.
