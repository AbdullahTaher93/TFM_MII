Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch square baking dish. In a large bowl, stir together the spinach, eggs, corn, sour cream and margarine until well blended. Stir in the dry cornbread mix. Pour into the prepared pan, and spread evenly. Bake for 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm and slightly browned on the top.
