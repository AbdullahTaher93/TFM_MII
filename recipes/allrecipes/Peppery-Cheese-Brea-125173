Dissolve yeast in water. Add the sour cream, egg, sugar, salt and 2/3 cup flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough (dough will be sticky). Fold in cheese and pepper. Do not knead. Divide in half. Place in a greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
