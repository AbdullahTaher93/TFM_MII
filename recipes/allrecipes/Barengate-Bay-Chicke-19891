In a small saucepan heat soup with milk over low heat; when heated through, set aside. Meanwhile, roll chicken in bread crumbs, pressing hard to make sure chicken is well coated. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place coated chicken in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish and drizzle with oil, then sprinkle with chopped garlic. Stir chicken broth into soup mixture, and pour mixture all over chicken. Sprinkle with mushrooms, then squeeze lemon over all. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 40 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
