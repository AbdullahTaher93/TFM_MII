Preheat an oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Season the beef brisket with garlic salt and meat tenderizer, and place in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix the beef gravy, Italian salad dressing, mushrooms, and onion soup mix in a bowl. Pour mixture over the beef brisket. Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until very tender, 4 to 5 hours.
