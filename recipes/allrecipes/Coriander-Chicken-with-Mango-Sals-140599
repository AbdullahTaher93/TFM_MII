Sprinkle chicken breast with salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper; set aside for 10 minutes. Evenly coat with ground coriander. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the chicken breast, browning well on both sides until no longer pink in the center. Remove from heat, allow breast to cool before slicing. In a bowl, mix together the mango, orange, onion, chile pepper, fresh cilantro and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Pour salsa over sliced chicken breast and serve.
