Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 12 cup muffin pan. In a small bowl, mix the honey, applesauce, yogurt, egg, lemon juice, and lemon zest. In a medium bowl, mix the unbleached flour, whole wheat pastry flour, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg. Make a well in the center, and pour in the honey mixture. Stir until no large lumps remain. Pour into the prepared muffin pan, filling each cup about 2/3 full. Bake 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.
