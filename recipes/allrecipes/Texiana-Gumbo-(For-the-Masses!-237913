Cook sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Whisk olive oil and flour together in a large stockpot over medium heat until mixture is thick and smooth. Cook and stir until mixture is browned and bubbling, 10 to 20 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Slowly whisk chicken broth and beer into flour mixture; bring to a boil. Mix sweet onion, bell pepper, celery, okra, green onions, Creole seasoning, and parsley into broth. Stir shredded chicken, shrimp, and sausage into vegetable-broth mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer, stirring often, until flavors blend and vegetables are tender, about 60 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
