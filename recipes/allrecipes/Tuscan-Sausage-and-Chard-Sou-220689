Heat a large pot over medium-high heat and stir in the sausage. Cook and stir until sausage is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir onion and red bell pepper into sausage; cook and stir until vegetables begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Pour water into the pot; add Swiss chard, chicken bouillon, garlic salt, and Italian seasoning. Cover and reduce heat to medium-low; Simmer until vegetables are very tender, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle soup with Parmesan cheese before serving.
