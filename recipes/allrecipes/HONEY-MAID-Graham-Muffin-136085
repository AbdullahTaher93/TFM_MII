Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Mix crumbs, sugar and baking powder in medium bowl. Add milk, egg and honey; stir just until moistened. Spoon batter evenly into nine greased medium muffin cups, filling each cup two-thirds full. Bake 15 to 18 min or until lightly browned. Let stand 5 minutes; remove from pan. Serve warm.
