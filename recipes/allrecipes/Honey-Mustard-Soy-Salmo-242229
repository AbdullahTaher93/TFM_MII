Grease one side of a sheet of aluminum foil with vegetable oil. Stir honey mustard, soy sauce, lemon juice, dill, rosemary, and thyme together in a bowl. Place salmon fillet onto prepared aluminum foil sheet. Brush honey mustard mixture over salmon. Wrap foil around salmon and seal edges to form a packet; let marinate for 20 to 30 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Cook salmon in the foil packet until it flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 13 minutes. Open packet and let salmon cook until the moisture atop salmon dries slightly, about 2 minutes more.
