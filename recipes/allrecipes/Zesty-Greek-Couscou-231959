Put couscous in a large bowl. Pour boiling water over the couscous, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and set aside until the water is absorbed completely, about 5 minutes; fluff with a fork. Stir olive oil and lemon juice with the couscous. Fold tomatoes, zucchini, green onion, and basil into the couscous mixture. Cover bowl with plastic wrap; refrigerate 4 hours to overnight. Stir feta cheese into the couscous mixture; season with salt and pepper.
