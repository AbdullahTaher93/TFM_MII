Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a cookie sheet with vegetable oil cooking spray; set aside. In a large skillet, over medium-high heat, cook sausage, crumbling into small pieces. Once cooked through, drain fat. Add 8 oz. cream cheese to sausage and stir until melted. Add tomatoes, cumin, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Stir to combine. Open can of biscuits; separate each biscuit into 2 halves. Flatten each half with your hands to make larger. Spoon a heaping tablespoon of sausage mixture onto center of each biscuit; fold biscuit in half and seal by pressing edges together. Place on prepared baking sheet and brush with beaten egg. Bake 15 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly before serving with Chipotle Cream. Chipotle Cream: In a small saucepan, combine 4 oz. cream cheese, sour cream, chipotle peppers and garlic salt. Cook over medium heat until cream cheese is melted and all ingredients are combined.
