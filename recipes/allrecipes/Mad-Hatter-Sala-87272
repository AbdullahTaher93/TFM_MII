In a large bowl, toss together the coleslaw mix, green onions and broccoli. Set aside. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Crumble the ramen noodles into a bowl, and mix with the almonds and sunflower seeds. Sprinkle the seasoning packets over all. Add to the skillet; cook and stir until noodles and nuts are toasted, about 8 minutes. In a jar with a tight fitting lid, combine the sugar, vinegar, oil and soy sauce. Seal, and shake vigorously to blend. Just before serving, combine the slaw mixture with the nuts and noodles. Pour the dressing over all, and stir briefly to coat.
