In a skillet, saute onion in oil until golden brown, about 7 minutes. Set aside to cool. In a bowl, combine buttermilk and egg. Stir in biscuit mix, onion and 1/2 cup cheese. Pour into a greased 9-in. round baking pan. Sprinkle with poppy seeds and remaining cheese. Drizzle with butter. Bake at 400 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Cool slightly. Cut into wedges.
