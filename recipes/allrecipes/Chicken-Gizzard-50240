Place gizzards in a saucepan with enough water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over medium heat, cover, and cook for 1 1/2 hours. Drain and chop into bite size pieces. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry gizzards in butter for about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
