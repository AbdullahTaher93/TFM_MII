Place asparagus in a saucepan with a small amount of water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 3-5 minutes or until crisp-tender. Drain and set aside. In a large saucepan, saute onion and garlic in butter until tender. In a bowl, whisk together the soup, water, egg yolks, Worcestershire sauce, mustard and pepper. Whisk in lemon juice. Add to onion mixture. Add cream cheese. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted. Stir in spinach and asparagus; heat through. Transfer to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a thermometer reads 160 degrees F. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
