Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and generously salt water. Simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain well. Mash potatoes together with cream cheese, sour cream, chives, salt, and pepper. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Place in a storage container with the lid off and chill in refrigerator. When potatoes are cold, cover tightly with a lid. When ready to reheat potatoes, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish and spoon desired amount of potatoes into dish. Sprinkle with paprika and dot with butter. Bake for 30 minutes, or until heated through. Use within 10 days.
