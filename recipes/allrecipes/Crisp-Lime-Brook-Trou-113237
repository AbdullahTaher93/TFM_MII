Heat the oven to 200 degrees F. Cover a baking sheet with paper towels. In a small bowl, whisk together the lime juice, lime zest, 1/8 teaspoon of the salt, and a pinch of pepper. Add the olive oil slowly, whisking. In a large nonstick frying pan, heat the cooking oil over moderately high heat. Sprinkle the trout with the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Put half the fillets in the pan, skin-side down, and cook until golden, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook until just done, about 1 minute longer. Transfer the fillets to the prepared baking sheet, skin-side up and keep warm in the oven while cooking the remaining fillets. Add more oil between batches if necessary. Serve, skin-side up, surrounded by the lime dressing.
