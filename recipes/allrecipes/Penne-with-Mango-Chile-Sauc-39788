Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne pasta, and cook for 9 to 13 minutes or until al dente; drain. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, and stir in mango, red onions, and chile pepper. Cook for about 5 minutes, until onions are tender. Mix in tomatoes and wine. Stir in the bay leaf, cloves, and cinnamon stick. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes. Remove bay leaf, cloves, and cinnamon stick from the mango mixture. Season with salt. Mix in honey and red wine vinegar. Serve over cooked pasta with cilantro and olives.
