In a casserole, heat oil over medium heat. Add scallions, garlic, and orzo and saute until orzo turns gold and scallions soften, about 3 minutes. Add wine and stir until nearly evaporated. Add broth, 1/2 cup at a time, until it's absorbed and orzo is tender. Lower heat, stir in spinach, and cook until wilted.
