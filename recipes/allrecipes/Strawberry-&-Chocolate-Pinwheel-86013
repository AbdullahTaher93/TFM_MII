Place 2 tortillas on a work surface; spread chocolate frosting on each, leaving a 1/2-inch border around edge. Place remaining 2 tortillas on surface; spread each with cream cheese; top with strawberries. Make sure to leave a 1/2-inch border around edges. Stack one strawberry and cream cheese tortilla on top of chocolate tortilla and roll up jelly roll style. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Wrap each roll with plastic wrap and freeze for a 1/2 hour. To serve, slice off the trim at each end and cut each roll into 8 pieces.
