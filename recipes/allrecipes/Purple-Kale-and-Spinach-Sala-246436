Whisk celery, onion, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, pepper, and salt together in a bowl until dressing is well-mixed. Combine kale, spinach, and Caribbean lettuce in a separate bowl. Sprinkle alfalfa sprouts over kale mixture; add yellow bell pepper, orange bell pepper, prunes, sunflower seeds, spirulina, chlorella, and maca powder and mix well. Drizzle dressing over salad while continually stirring until evenly distributed.
