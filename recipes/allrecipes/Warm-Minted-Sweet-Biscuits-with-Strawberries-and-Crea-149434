1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. To make the biscuits: Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt into a medium mixing bowl. Add SPLENDA(r) Granulated Sweetener and mix well. Cut the shortening into the flour mixture with a fork, pastry cutter or your fingertips. Whisk together the eggs, milk and the chopped mint, in a small mixing bowl, blending until smooth. Stir the egg-milk mixture into the dry ingredients and mix well. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. To prepare the strawberries: Clean the strawberries. Measure and slice 5 cups of strawberries and place in a mixing bowl. Puree the remaining 2 cups of strawberries with 1 cup of the SPLENDA(r) Granulated Sweetener and the optional Grand Marnier. Pour over the sliced berries and fold together. Refrigerate until ready to use. To prepare the whipped cream: Whip the heavy cream, SPLENDA(r) Granulated Sweetener and vanilla together using a wire whisk or the whisk attachment to your mixer. Whip the cream until soft peaks form. Refrigerate until ready to use. To bake the biscuits: Remove biscuit dough from the refrigerator and place on a lightly floured surface. Roll or pat it by hand to an approximate 3/4 - inch thickness. Cut the dough with a 3-inch biscuit cutter into 8 shortcakes. Place biscuits on a greased baking sheet. Bake the shortcakes in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown. To serve the shortcakes: Slice the shortcakes in half, lengthwise, while they are still hot. Spoon the strawberry filling on the bottom half of the shortcakes, and top with the whipped cream. Place the top crust on berries and garnish with a mint sprig.
