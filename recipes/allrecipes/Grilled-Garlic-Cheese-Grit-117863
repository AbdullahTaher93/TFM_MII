In a saucepan, bring water to a boil. Slowly add grits and salt, stirring constantly. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 40-45 minutes or until thickened, stirring occasionally. Add cheese and garlic; stir until cheese is melted. Pour into a 9-in. square baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 2-1/2 hours or until firm. Before starting the grill, coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray. Cut grits into 3-in. squares; brush both sides with oil. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 4-6 minutes on each side or until lightly browned.
