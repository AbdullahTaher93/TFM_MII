Whisk milk, egg, flour, baking powder, basil, salt, and garlic powder together in a bowl until batter is the consistency of eggnog. Heat grapeseed oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat cheese curds with batter and cook 4 to 5 at a time in the hot oil until golden brown, about 1 minute. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels.
