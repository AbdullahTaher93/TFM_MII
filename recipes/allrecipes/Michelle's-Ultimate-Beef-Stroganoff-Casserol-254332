Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large dish. Season ground beef with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add seasoned beef; cook and stir until browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add cream of mushroom soup, cream cheese, and milk; cook and stir until cream cheese melts and mixture is saucy, about 6 minutes. Pour mixture over noodles. Add carrots; stir until evenly combined.
