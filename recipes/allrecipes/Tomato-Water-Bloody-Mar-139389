For tomato water: In food processor, puree first six ingredients until smooth. Line sieve with cheesecloth and set sieve over nonreactive bowl. Pour puree into center of cheesecloth and refrigerate overnight. Gather sides of cheesecloth up over puree to form large sack and squeeze gently to extract last bits of water. Discard sack and its contents and transfer tomato water to bowl. Set strainer over bowl and squeeze in lime, lemon, and orange juice. Stir well. Makes about 20 ounces tomato water, enough for roughly 4 drinks. For Bloody Mary: Fill 4 highball glasses with ice. In each, combine 4 ounces tomato water and 1 1/2 ounces vodka and stir. Garnish with cherry tomatoes.
