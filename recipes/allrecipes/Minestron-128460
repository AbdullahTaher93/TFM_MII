Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until soft. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the broth, zucchini, green beans, corn, lemon peel, rosemary, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Stir in the tomatoes (with juice) and beans. Simmer, covered, for 30 minutes. Stir in the basil.
