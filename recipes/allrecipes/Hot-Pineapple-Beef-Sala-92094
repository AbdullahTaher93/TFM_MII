In a bowl, mix soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, and garlic. Cut steak across the grain into 1/8-inch-thick slices; add to bowl and mix to coat with marinade. Let stand for 15 minutes or up to 2 hours. Meanwhile, place a lettuce leaf on each plate. Cut pineapple into 1/2-inch-thick rings. Arrange half the rings equally on lettuce; cut remaining rings into 1-inch chunks. Place a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over high heat. When it's hot, remove meat from marinade and add to pan; reserve 1/4 cup marinade. Stir often just until meat is browned on the outside but still slightly pink on the inside (cut to test), 2 to 3 minutes, or as done as you like. Transfer meat to another bowl. Add pineapple chunks and reserved 1/4 cup marinade to pan. Stir pineapple until hot, about 1 minute. Pour meat and juices back into pan, and stir in green onions. Spoon meat mixture and juices equally over pineapple rings and lettuce leaves.
