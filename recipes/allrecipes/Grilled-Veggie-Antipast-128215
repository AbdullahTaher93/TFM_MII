Coat a large skillet with nonstick spray and heat over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and saute until lightly browned. Transfer the mushrooms to a large bowl. Add the green peppers to the skillet and saute until softened slightly. Add the olive oil, vinegar, garlic, basil, and pepper. Refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes, stirring once or twice. Place the onions in a small saucepan with enough water to cover and simmer, covered, until tender. Sprinkle the oregano over the tomatoes. Using four metal skewers, pass each skewer through alternating chunks of green pepper, whole mushrooms, onion, and tomato. Grill or broil until hot and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Serve with cheese cubes and bread.
