Heat oil in large fry pan over medium-high heat. Add frozen potatoes in an even layer and cover pan with lid. Cook over medium-high heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. Stir in the Alfredo sauce, then top with sausage slices. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until heated through, about 5 more minutes. Serve immediately.
