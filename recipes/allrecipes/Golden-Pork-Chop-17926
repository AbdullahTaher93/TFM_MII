Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Rinse pork chops, pat dry, and season with seasoned salt and pepper. Place them in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a separate small bowl, combine the onion, mushrooms and soup. Mix together well and spoon over the chops. Cover, and bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 minutes. Uncover, and bake for 15 more minutes. (Note: Time could be less or more depending on the thickness of the chops.) Pork chops are done when their internal temperature has reached 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
