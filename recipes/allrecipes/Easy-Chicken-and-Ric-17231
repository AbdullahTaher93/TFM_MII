Melt the shortening in a large skillet over medium high heat. Saute the chicken sections in the shortening for 2 minutes per side, or until browned. Remove chicken and set aside. Add the rice and green bell pepper, if desired, and saute for 3 minutes, or until slightly browned. Add the soup mix and water and stir together well. Bring this to a boil, then add the chicken, reduce heat to low and simmer for 45 minutes.
