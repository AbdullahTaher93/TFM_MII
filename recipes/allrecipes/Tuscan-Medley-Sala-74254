Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add Mann's Vegetable Medley. Cook until water returns to a rolling boil, 1-2 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold running water to cool; drain well. In a large bowl, combine Mann's Vegetable Medley with beans, bacon, parsley, and vinaigrette, tossing gently to mix. If made in advance, cover and refrigerate up to 24 hours. Vinaigrette: In a small bowl, mix vinegar, garlic, salt, mustard, pepper and crushed red pepper until well blended. Whisk in olive oil.
