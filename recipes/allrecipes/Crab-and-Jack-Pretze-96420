Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat cream cheese, mayonnaise, and horseradish in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in garlic, onion, lemon juice, and hot pepper sauce. Gently fold in the crabmeat, and season with white pepper to taste. Spoon mixture evenly over the pretzels, and sprinkle each with 1/2 cup shredded cheese. Place pretzels in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the topping is bubbly, about 20 minutes.
