In a small bowl, mix together the ketchup, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce and the oregano, set aside. Grate the cauliflower. This is accomplished best by using your grating wheel on your food processor. But you can do it by hand also with a cheese grater. Mince the celery, scallions and peppers quite finely. Set aside. Rub each salmon fillet with canola oil and place on a foil lined sheet pan, skin side down. Sprinkle each with the lemon pepper. Place under the broiler for 5 minutes. Turn off broiler and set oven to 300 degrees F. Place two lemon slices on each fillet and cook until the 'rice' is ready. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the celery, scallions and peppers and saute for a minute or two. Add the cauliflower and saute for a minute or so, stirring occasionally until it soaks up all the butter. Then splash in the water to let the cauliflower steam a bit (30 seconds or more). Drizzle the ketchup mixture over the veggies (do not dump it all in one spot) and stir well. Taste and add salt or pepper as needed. To assemble: Heap the paella in the center of a platter and lean each salmon fillet along the sides. Serve with a green salad and or green vegetable.
