In a saucepan combine ketchup, steak sauce, garlic salt, liquid smoke, onion powder and brown sugar. Add lemon juice, pepper sauce, Worcestershire sauce and whiskey. Warm over medium low heat until simmering. Refrigerate for at least one hour before using, to let flavors mingle. Brush on meat during the last few minutes of grilling or baking. Not recommended for marinating unless you omit the lemon juice, as the acid makes the chicken grainy.
