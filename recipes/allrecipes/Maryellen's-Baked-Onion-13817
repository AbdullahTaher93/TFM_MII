Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Peel onions and make two cross cuts on the top of the onion. Place in a clay cooker or casserole dish. Mix together the Balsamic vinegar, honey and tarragon. Pour over onions and marinate for 1 hour. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until onions are tender.
