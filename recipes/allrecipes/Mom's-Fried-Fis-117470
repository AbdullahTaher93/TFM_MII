Place eggs and cracker crumbs in separate shallow bowls. Dip fillets into eggs, then coat with crumbs. Let stand for 5 minutes. In an electric skillet or deep-fat fryer, heat oil to 375 degrees F. Fry fillets, a few at a time, for 2 minutes on each side or until fish is golden brown and flakes easily with a fork. Drain on paper towels. In a small bowl, combine the tartar sauce ingredients. Serve with fish.
