Heat oil in a 5- to 6-quart pan over medium-high heat. Add onion, celery, basil, rosemary, and oregano. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is soft, about 7 minutes. Add broth, garlic, potatoes, carrots, and pasta. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat and simmer until potatoes and pasta are tender to bite, about 20 minutes. Mix in beans and their liquid, tomato paste, and kale. Simmer, uncovered, until kale is tender to bite and soup is heated through, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle soup into serving bowls. Offer cheese to sprinkle over individual portions.
