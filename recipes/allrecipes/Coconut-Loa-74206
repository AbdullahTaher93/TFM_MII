Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, stir together the coconut, sugar, and self-rising flour. Stir in the milk, just until everything is moistened. Spoon into a greased 8x4 inch loaf pan. Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted into the crown of the loaf comes out clean.
