Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season the chicken breasts on both sides with the salt and pepper. Cook the chicken in the hot oil until completely browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to the prepared baking dish; cover tightly with aluminum foil. Place the potatoes and bell peppers in the skillet. Season with oregano, onion powder, and red pepper flakes. Cook and stir until the vegetables soften, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, and chicken broth to the skillet; bring to a boil. Remove from heat and pour over the chicken breasts; tightly cover again with the aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
