Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Place ham in a 10- by 15-inch roasting pan. Bake, basting frequently with pan juices, until a meat thermometer inserted in thickest part (not touching the bone) registers 140 degrees F; allow about 20 minutes per pound, or 2 to 2 1/4 hours total. If ham begins to look dry, cover with foil and bake until glaze is added. Meanwhile, mix cornstarch with the water and set aside. In a 2- to 3-quart pan, combine cherries, port, syrup, vinegar, peel, and cinnamon. Bring to a boil over high heat; cover and simmer until cherries are plump, about 10 minutes. (If making ahead, cover and chill up to 1 day.) Whirl half in a food processor or blender until smooth; reserve remaining glaze. Remove from oven and tent loosely with foil. Meanwhile, combine reserved whole-cherry glaze and beef broth in a 3- to 4-quart pan over medium-high heat. Stir often until mixture boils; briskly stir in cornstarch mixture until sauce boils again. Transfer ham to a platter and sauce to a serving container. Cut ham into thin slices; offer with sauce.
