In a large saucepan over medium heat, cook butter and brown sugar until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved. In a large bowl, combine cereal, coconut and nuts; add sugar mixture and stir until coated. Press half into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Spread ice cream over crust. Top with remaining cereal mixture. Freeze until firm.
