Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Soften the butter and blend with the almond meal, coconut flakes and Splenda. Whisk together the powdered egg whites and water. Be patient, it takes a little while before it dissolves. Add to the almond mixture. Blend well. Press dough into your pan. (I prefer a tart pan with the removable bottom because the crust stays together better that way). If it is difficult to shape the crust the way that you want it, then put it in the freezer for 5-10 minutes and then fine-tune the shape. Bake at 350 degrees F for about 8 minutes for a baked pie or 12 minutes for a refrigerator pie. Allow to cool before filling.
