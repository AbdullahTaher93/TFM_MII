In small bowl, combine olive oil with Herbes de Provence and Morton(R) Kosher Salt. Brush mixture on one side of each tortilla. Place tortillas, oil-side-down in single layer, on lightly greased large baking pans. Evenly spread pesto on top of tortillas. Sprinkle two tortillas evenly with asparagus, and red pepper. Arrange Brie slices over asparagus/pepper mixture; sprinkle 2 tablespoons mozzarella cheese over Brie slices. Cover with second tortilla; press down firmly. Bake quesadillas at 375 degrees F 10 to 15 minutes or until tortillas are light golden brown along edges and cheese melts. Cut into wedges and serve immediately.
