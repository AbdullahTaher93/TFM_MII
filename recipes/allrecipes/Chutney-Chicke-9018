Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium bowl, combine chutney and dry soup mix. Mix together. Season chicken pieces with salt and pepper to taste. Place seasoned chicken pieces in a 9x13 inch baking dish and pour chutney mixture over chicken. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 60 minutes, or until chutney sauce has turned brown and crunchy.
