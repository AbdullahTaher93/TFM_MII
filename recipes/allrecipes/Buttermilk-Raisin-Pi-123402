In a saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch and salt. Beat egg yolks and buttermilk; stir into the sugar mixture until smooth. Add raisins and lemon juice; cook and stir over medium heat until mixture comes to a gentle boil. Cook and stir 2 minutes longer. Remove from the heat; stir in butter and vanilla. Pour into pie shell. For meringue, beat egg whites and cream of tartar in a mixing bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar, beating until stiff peaks form. Spread over hot filling and seal to the edges. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until lightly browned. Store in the refrigerator.
