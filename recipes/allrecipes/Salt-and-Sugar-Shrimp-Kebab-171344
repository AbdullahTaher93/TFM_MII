In a large bowl, mix together salt and sugar. Add shrimp and stir to coat evenly. Cover bowl and chill at least 45 minutes or up to 2 hours. If using wooden skewers, put them in a shallow pan with water to cover and soak at least 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above the cooking grate only 2 to 3 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). While grill heats, rinse shrimp well and pat dry. Drain wooden skewers. Thread shrimp in a C shape onto skewers. Lay skewers in a rimmed pan. In a glass measuring cup, combine oil, lemon juice, and garlic; pour over shrimp and turn skewers to coat evenly. Let stand 5 to 10 minutes. Lay shrimp on cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook, turning occasionally with tongs, until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and opaque but still moist-looking in center of thickest part (cut to test), about 5 minutes. Transfer skewers to a platter. Serve with lemon wedges to squeeze over shrimp.
