Melt 1 tablespoon coconut oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir tempeh and curry powder in hot oil until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Reduced heat to medium and stir kale, remaining coconut oil, and garlic powder into tempeh mixture; cook and stir until kale wilts, about 10 minutes. Transfer to plates and top with goat cheese and sea salt.
