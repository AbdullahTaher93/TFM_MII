Place rice in a greased shallow 2-qt. baking dish. In a bowl, combine the milk, water and salad dressing mix; set aside 1/4 cup. Pour remaining mixture over rice. Top with chicken strips. Drizzle with butter and reserved milk mixture. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until rice is tender and chicken juices run clear. Sprinkle with paprika.
