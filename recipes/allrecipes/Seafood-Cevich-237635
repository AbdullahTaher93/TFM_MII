Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Put whole tomatoes, whole jalapeno peppers, and onion in a large bowl; drizzle olive oil over the vegetables and stir to coat. Spread vegetables onto the prepared baking sheet. Cook under the preheated broiler until the skin of the peppers and tomatoes has blackened and blistered, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer peppers and tomatoes to a bowl and tightly seal bowl with plastic wrap. Steam peppers as they cool, about 20 minutes. Remove and discard skins and seeds. Make an ice bath in a large bowl set in the sink. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Lightly blanche shrimp, halibut, and scallops in boiling water for 1 minute; drain and immediately plunge into the ice bath until chilled completely. Drain seafood mixture well and transfer to a large glass bowl. Blend roasted tomatoes, roasted jalapeno peppers, roasted onion, lime juice, tomato juice, orange juice, and lemon juice in a blender until smooth; pour over the seafood mixture, cover bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in refrigerator at least 24 hours. Mix green onions, chopped jalapeno peppers, avocados, and diced tomato together in a small bowl; stir into the seafood mixture. Season with salt and pepper.
