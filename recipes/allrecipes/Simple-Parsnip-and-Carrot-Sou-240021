Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot oil until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir garlic with the onion; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute more; add parsnips and carrots, stir, cover the saucepan with a lid, and cook until the parsnips and carrots begin to soften, about 5 minutes more. Pour vegetable broth into the saucepan; add ginger and stir. Bring the mixture to a boil, place cover on the saucepan, reduce heat to low, and cook for 10 minutes. Remove lid and continue cooking until vegetables are completely tender, 10 to 15 minutes more. Working in batches, pour soup into a blender to fill bowl no more than halfway. Hold lid in place while pulsing the mixture a few times before leaving blender on to puree until smooth. Repeat blending until soup is entirely pureed. Season soup with salt and pepper.
