In a 5- to 6-quart pan, bring broth to a boil over high heat. Break linguine in half; add to boiling broth. Cook pasta until all broth is absorbed (10 to 12 minutes). While linguine cooks, place sausages in a 12- to 14-inch nonstick frying pan. If using frozen sausages, add 1 cup water. Cook over high heat, turning often, until sausages begin to brown and water evaporates, about 10 minutes (about 5 minutes for fresh sausages). Remove frying pan from heat. On a cutting board, cut sausages into 3/4-inch slices. Return slices to frying pan and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until browned and no longer pink in center, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain sausages briefly on paper towels. When linguine is done, add sausages, artichoke hearts with reserved 2 tablespoons marinade, and roasted peppers. Mix well, then transfer to individual bowls. Offer parmesan to add to taste.
