Place zucchini in a wide, shallow bowl. Peel, pit, and slice avocados. Arrange avocados and arugula over zucchini. In a small bowl, combine oil and lemon juice; season to taste with salt and pepper, then mix well. If making salad ahead, cover salad and dressing separately and let stand up to 45 minutes. Pour dressing over salad and mix lightly.
