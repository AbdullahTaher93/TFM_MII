Place sweet potatoes in a colander. Place a cheesecloth over the potatoes, and squeeze the potatoes to release as much liquid as possible. Let the potatoes sit to release more liquid, then squeeze again. In a large bowl, combine sweet potatoes, eggs, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, flour, salt, cloves, and cinnamon; mix well. Spray a non-stick pan with cooking spray. Set over medium heat. Form mixture into pancake size cakes, and fry in hot pan. Flip cakes after 2 to 3 minutes (when bottom is browned), and brown other side. Serve piping hot!
