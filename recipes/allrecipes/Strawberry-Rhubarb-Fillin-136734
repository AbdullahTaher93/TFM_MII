Mix 2 tablespoons orange juice and cornstarch in a small bowl. Combine rhubarb, strawberries, dried apricots, sugar and remaining 2 tablespoons orange juice in a saucepan; bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Cook, stirring often, until the rhubarb is tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the cornstarch mixture and cook, stirring constantly until thickened, about 1 minute.
