Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook chicken in boiling water, skimming any fat, until partially cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir tomato puree, whole onion, bay leaves, cardamom pods, mistika, salt, and pepper into the pot. Cook until chicken is cooked through and tender, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
