Place each chop between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. With a heavy, flat-sided mallet, pound meat firmly but gently all over to a thickness of 1/4 to 1/3 inch In a small bowl, stir together broth, cranberries, orange juice concentrate, mustard, and cornstarch. Set aside. Melt butter in oil in a wide nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. When butter sizzles, add as many pork pieces to pan as will fit without crowding (you may need to cook pork in batches). Cook, turning once, until pork is well browned on both sides and no longer pink in center; cut to test (4 to 5 minutes). Transfer to a platter and keep warm. Add broth mixture to pan, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil, stirring. Then continue to boil and stir until slightly thickened (about 1 minute). Pour over pork.
