Mix flour, flax seed meal, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Mash banana in a separate bowl, add coconut milk and egg; stir. Pour banana mixture into flour mixture; mix batter to combine. Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
