Combine chicken broth, brown sugar, honey, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a gentle boil. Reduce heat and simmer sauce, stirring often, until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Whisk water and cornstarch together in a small bowl. Pour into the saucepan; simmer until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.
