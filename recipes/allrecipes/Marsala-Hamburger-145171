In medium bowl, combine ground beef, 1/4 cup cooking wine and pepper. Shape into 8 thin patties. Place 2 tablespoons cheese on center of 4 patties. Cover each with remaining patties; press edges to seal. Broil 4 to 6 inches from heat for 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Meanwhile, melt margarine in small saucepan over medium heat. Add mushrooms; cook until softened. In small bowl, combine remaining sauce ingredients; mix well. Stir into mushrooms. Bring to a boil. Boil until thickened, about 1 minute, stirring constantly. Serve over patties.
