Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Divide dough into 3 pieces; roll each into a very flat oval on a lightly floured board (about 7x11-inches). Place dough on baking sheets and brush with 1 tablespoon oil. Bake for 10 minutes. (May be prepared ahead to this point.) Just before serving, top each flat bread with 2/3 cup cheese. Bake at 425 degrees F for 5 minutes. To prepare plum salad, toss remaining oil with remaining ingredients. Place equal amounts on each warm cheese flat bread and cut into 3-inch slices to serve.
