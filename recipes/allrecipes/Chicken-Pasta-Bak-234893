Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix tomato-vegetable juice cocktail, penne pasta, water, artichoke bottoms, basil, vegetable bouillon, and coriander seeds in a large oven-safe pot. Layer chicken atop pasta mixture and season with salt and pepper. Layer zucchini and red bell pepper on chicken; drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Roast chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle each serving with Italian cheese blend.
