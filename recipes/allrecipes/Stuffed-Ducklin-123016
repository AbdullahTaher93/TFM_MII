In a large skillet, saute onion and garlic in butter until tender; transfer to a large bowl. Add the bread cubes, rice, basil, rosemary, sage, parsley flakes, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper. Add the raisins, pecans and enough broth to moisten; toss gently. Sprinkle duck cavity with remaining salt. Lightly stuff bread mixture into duck. Place breast side up on a rack in shallow roasting pan. Prick skin well with a fork. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1-3/4 to 2 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees F for duck and 165 degrees F for stuffing. Drain fat as it accumulates during roasting. Cover duck with foil and let stand for 20 minutes before removing stuffing and carving.
