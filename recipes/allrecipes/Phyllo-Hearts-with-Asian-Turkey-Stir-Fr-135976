In a large nonstick skillet or wok, stir-fry turkey and garlic in 2 tsp oil. Cook and stir until turkey is lightly browned and reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees F. Remove and keep warm. In the same pan, stir-fry the vegetables in 2 tsp of oil for 4-5 minutes or until heated through. Return turkey to the pan; mix well. Combine cornstarch and cold water until smooth; stir into turkey mixture. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1 minute or until thickened. Using a knife or large cookie cutter, cut heart shapes from thawed phyllo dough. Cover dough with waxed paper, then with damp towel to prevent it from drying out. Place 3-4 layers of heart shaped phyllo dough on lightly greased baking pan. Spoon turkey vegetable mixture into center of the heart; use a slotted spoon to minimize the liquid. Top with 3-4 layers of heart shaped phyllo dough. Seal the seams by pressing lightly moistened edges of top and bottom together. Brush top with oil. Bake in 350 degrees F oven for 15 minutes, or until dough becomes crisp and golden brown. Remove from oven and let sit for 5 minutes before serving. Top with reserved sauce from the pan.
