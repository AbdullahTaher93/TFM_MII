In a large nonstick skillet over medium-heat, add the butter and olive oil. When the butter melts add the rosemary and garlic. Stir constantly for about 30 seconds. Do not let the garlic burn. Add the chicken pieces and cook for 1 full minute per side. Carefully add the wine; let it boil for about 1 minute. Then add the chicken stock. Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. (If your skillet does not have a cover, then make one out of aluminum foil). Transfer chicken to a plate and cover. Add the kitchen bouquet and the guar gum to the juices. Mix well. Increase the heat to medium-high and let boil until the sauce thickens and reduces to about 1 cup. Add the chicken back into the skillet (along with any juices). Coat each piece with the sauce. Serve immediately.
