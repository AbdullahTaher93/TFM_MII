Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 7 to 10 minutes; drain and discard grease. Return skillet and beef to stove and reduce heat to medium-low. Stir chili sauce, mustard, brown sugar, and vinegar into the ground beef; simmer until the sauce thickens, 5 to 10 minutes.
