Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush the inside of the unbaked pie crust with the melted butter; set aside. Whisk together the cream, brown sugar, flour, and espresso powder until well blended. Pour into the prepared pie crust. Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 50 minutes. Remove from the oven; cool completely on a rack. Generously pipe the edge of the pie with chocolate whipped cream.
