Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Melt the butter with the olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the rosemary. Cut the sweet potatoes lengthwise into 1 1/2 inch-thick wedges and place in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper, and drizzle with the butter mixture. Toss gently. Arrange the wedges on a large baking sheet in one flat layer so they don't touch. Bake in the upper part of the oven, turning once, until softened and lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Season again with salt and pepper, and carefully remove from the sheet (the wedges are relatively fragile after cooking). Serve hot.
