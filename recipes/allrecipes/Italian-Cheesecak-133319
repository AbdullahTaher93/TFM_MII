Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour a 10-inch springform pan and place it on a baking sheet. Using an electric mixer, combine the ricotta, eggs, granulated sugar, orange peel and juice, cream and vanilla. Pour into the prepared pan and bake for 1 1/2 hours. Turn off the oven and let the cake rest inside for 30 minutes. Let cool, then sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
