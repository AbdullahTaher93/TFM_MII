In large saucepan melt butter over low heat. Add marshmallows and stir until completely melted. Remove from heat. Add KELLOGG'S RICE KRISPIES cereal. Stir until well coated. Using 1/2-cup measuring cup coated with cooking spray, divide warm cereal mixture into portions. Using buttered hands shape each portion into ghost shape. Decorate with coconut, frosting and/or candies. Best if served the same day.
