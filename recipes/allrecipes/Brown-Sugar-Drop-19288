In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time then stir in the buttermilk. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the buttermilk mixture until well blended. Cover dough and chill for at least one hour. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until almost no imprint remains when touched with your finger. Remove from cookie sheets immediately to cool on wire racks.
