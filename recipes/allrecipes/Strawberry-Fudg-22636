Grease an 8 x 8 inch square pan. In a medium saucepan combine sugar, water and cream of tartar; bring to a boil. Heat to 242 to 248 degrees F (116 to 120 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a firm but pliable ball. Stir in the strawberry preserves; return to a boil. Remove from heat. Slowly pour the strawberry mixture over the beaten egg whites, stirring constantly. Beat until thick and fluffy. Pour into prepared pan. Cool for 2 hours, or until firm, and cut into squares.
