In a medium bowl, mix together the brown sugar, teriyaki sauce, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke and meat tenderizer. Pour over meat, and refrigerate in a sealed container. Shake container occasionally to cover meat. Take out of the refrigerator before cooking, and let come to room temperature while the smoker heats up. Never use barbeque sauce with this marinade.
