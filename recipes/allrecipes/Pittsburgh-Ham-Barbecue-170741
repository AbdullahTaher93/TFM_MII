Preheat an oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir the onions in the butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir the ketchup, vinegar, water, brown sugar, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce into the skillet with the onions; simmer about 10 minutes. Stir in the ham; cook until heated through and the sauce is bubbling, 5 to 7 minutes more. While the ham simmers, heat the kaiser rolls in the preheated oven until toasted, 5 to 7 minutes. Assemble the sandwiches by dividing the ham mixture among the toasted kaiser rolls, topping the ham with pickle relish. Serve hot.
