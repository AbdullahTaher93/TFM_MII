Beat egg yolks and 2/3 of the confectioners' sugar together in a bowl until smooth; add vanilla extract, cinnamon, cloves, salt, allspice, and baking soda and beat until smooth. Beat egg whites in a bowl using an electric mixer until frothy; add the remaining confectioners' sugar and beat until stiff peaks form. Fold egg white mixture into egg yolk mixture. Refrigerate or freeze mixture until chilled, at least 1 hour. Spoon 2 tablespoons mixture into each mug; top each with 1 shot brandy and 1 shot rum. Fill the rest of each mug with boiling water; stir and top with nutmeg.
