Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute celery, onion, and garlic in hot oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir ground beef and chorizo with the vegetable mixture, breaking meat into increasingly smaller chunks as you cook and stir until the meat is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir tomato sauce, stewed tomatoes, tomato paste, and diced tomatoes with green chile peppers into the beef mixture, respectively; season with chili seasoning mix. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook chili at a simmer until thickened, about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
