In a pitcher (at least 2 qt.), combine rum, mint syrup, and lime juice; add about 2 cups ice cubes. Pour into ice-filled glasses and garnish with mint leaves if desired. Mint Syrup: In a 1- to 2-quart pan, combine 1 1/4 cups fresh mint leaves, water, and sugar. Stir over medium heat until sugar is dissolved and mixture is simmering. Remove pan from heat, cover, and let stand 30 minutes. Pour mixture through a fine strainer into a small pitcher or bowl; discard mint leaves. Use syrup or cover and chill up to 1 week. Makes about 1 cup.
