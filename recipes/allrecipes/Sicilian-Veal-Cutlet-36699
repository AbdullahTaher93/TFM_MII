Trim fat from veal. Place each piece between 2 sheets of heavy-duty plastic wrap; flatten to 1/8-inch thickness using a meat mallet or rolling pin. Combine flour and pepper. Dredge veal in flour mixture; shake off excess flour. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a skillet over high heat until hot. Add half of cutlets to skillet. Cook 2 minutes on each side or until browned. Repeat with 1 teaspoon oil and remaining veal. Remove from pan. Add garlic, and saute 30 seconds. Add wine, scraping pan to loosen browned bits. Reduce heat to medium-high; boil wine mixture for 3 minutes. Return veal to pan. Add tomato, olives, and artichokes; cover and simmer 1 minute or until thoroughly heated. Serve immediately with the pasta. Garnish with thyme, if desired.
