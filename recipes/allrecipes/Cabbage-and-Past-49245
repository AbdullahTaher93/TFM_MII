Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add farfalle pasta, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the cabbage, onion, and garlic, and season with salt and pepper. Cook 15 minutes, or until the cabbage and onion are tender. In a large bowl, toss together the cooked farfalle and the cabbage mixture. Serve warm.
