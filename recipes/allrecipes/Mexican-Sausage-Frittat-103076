Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9-inch glass or ceramic pie plate with cooking spray. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; add sausage and fry until it loses its raw color, 5 to 7 minutes. Spread sausage into the bottom of the prepared pie plate. Lightly beat eggs in a medium bowl, mix in Cheddar cheese, chiles, and green onions, and season with chili powder, cumin, and black pepper; pour over sausage. Bake until set, about 20 minutes. Cool briefly, cut into wedges, and serve.
