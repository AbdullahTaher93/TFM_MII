Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add eggplant and squash and cook until tender but still firm, about 10 minutes. Drain and cool. In a 2 quart casserole dish combine eggplant, squash, onions, bread crumbs, butter and chiles. Sprinkle crushed crackers and cheese over the top. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
