Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Wrap each beet separately in a square of heavy-duty aluminum foil and put in the oven for 1-1/4 hours or until beets are tender. When cool enough to handle, slip off skins and coarsely chop beets. In a food processor, process beets and garlic until smooth. Add Dannon(R) Plain Yogurt, salt and pepper to taste. Steam the broccoli stalks and serve drizzled with the beet sauce.
