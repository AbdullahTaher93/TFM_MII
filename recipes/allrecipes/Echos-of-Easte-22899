Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a shallow 2 quart baking dish. Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool and peel. Cut eggs in half lengthwise and remove yolks. Mash yolks together with onion, mustard, Worcestershire and mayonnaise. Spoon yolk mixture back onto egg white halves. Set aside. Cook broccoli by steaming or boiling.
