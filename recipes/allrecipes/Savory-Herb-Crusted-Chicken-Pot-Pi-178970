Thaw the pastry sheet at room temperature for 40 minutes or until it's easy to handle. Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Stir the egg and water with a fork in a small bowl. Stir the chicken and vegetables in a 13x9 inch shallow baking dish. Set aside. Heat the butter in a 2 quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and cook for 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Gradually stir the broth into the saucepan and heat to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to a low and cook for about 3 minutes or until the mixture thickens. Pour over the chicken mixture. Unroll the pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface. Roll the sheet to a 13x9 inch rectangle. Place the pastry over the chicken mixture, gently pressing the pastry to the edge of the dish to seal. Flute the edges if desired. Brush with the egg mixture and sprinkle with the herbs. Cut several 2 inch long slits on the top. Bake for 25 minutes or until golden and filling is bubbly.
