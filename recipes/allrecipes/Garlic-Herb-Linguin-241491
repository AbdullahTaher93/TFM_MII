Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain and transfer pasta to a large bowl. Mix melted butter, garlic, and parsley in a small bowl; drizzle over the linguine and toss to coat. Season pasta with seasoned salt.
