Heat olive oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat and cook mushrooms, stirring occasionally, 4 minutes or until tender. Meanwhile, broil bread slices until golden; rub with garlic. Evenly spoon unheated sauce over bread, then top with mushrooms and pepper. Garnish, if desired, with sliced fresh basil.
