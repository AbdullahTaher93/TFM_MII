Cook the beef in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat. Stir the soup and salsa in the skillet and cook until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Spoon about 1/3 cup beef mixture down the center of each tortilla. Top with the lettuce. Fold the tortillas around the filling. Serve with additional salsa.
