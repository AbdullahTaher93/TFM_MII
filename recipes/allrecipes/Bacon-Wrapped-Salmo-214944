Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet liberally with olive oil. Place the salmon fillets onto the baking sheet skin-side-down. Sprinkle the fillets with garlic powder, dill, salt, and pepper. Lay the bacon strips over the fillets to cover completely. Do not overlap the bacon strips. Bake in the preheated oven until the salmon is no longer translucent in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. Turn the oven on to broil and cook until the bacon has crisped, 1 to 2 minutes.
