In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add 3 eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Beat in lemon peel, orange peel and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture. Divide dough into four portions; shape each into an 8-in. x 2-in. rectangle on ungreased baking sheets. In a small bowl, lightly beat remaining egg; brush evenly over dough. Sprinkle with almonds. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool for 5 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board; cut diagonally with a serrated knife into 3/4-in. slices. Place, cut side down, on ungreased baking sheets. Bake for 12-14 minutes or until golden brown, turning once. Cool on wire racks. Store in an airtight container.
