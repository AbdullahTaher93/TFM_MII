Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion, tomato, basil, and garlic in hot oil until the onion begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Break ground turkey into small pieces and add to pot; season with Italian seasoning and oregano. Cook and stir mixture until turkey is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir tomato sauce into the turkey mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the sauce has thickened slightly, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir tomato paste into the turkey mixture until evenly colored; season with salt and pepper. Cook until the liquid is reheated, 1 to 2 minutes more.
