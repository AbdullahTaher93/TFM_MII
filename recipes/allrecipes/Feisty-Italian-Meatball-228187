Lightly coat a 15x10x1-inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray; set aside. In a large bowl combine the 1 tablespoon finely chopped pepper, the chili sauce, bread crumbs, onion, cheese, and fennel seeds. Add pork. Mix well. Shape into 36 meatballs. Place in prepared pan. Bake, uncovered, in a 350 degree F oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until browned and cooked through. Remove from oven; drain off fat. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan heat the Classico(R) Tomato and Basil pasta sauce until bubbly. Add baked meatballs and the 1/4 cup chopped peppers; heat through. Serve over hot noodles.
