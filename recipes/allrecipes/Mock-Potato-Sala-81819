Cut turnips into bite size cubes. Put into a pot of cold water and bring to a boil. Cook on medium-high heat for 10 minutes or just until a fork pieces through without much resistance. Drain and cool. Mix together the mayonnaise, sour cream, mustard, Worcestershire, chives, dill and pepper. Add salt to taste. Add dressing to cooled turnips and toss. Serve right away or refrigerate for up to two days.
