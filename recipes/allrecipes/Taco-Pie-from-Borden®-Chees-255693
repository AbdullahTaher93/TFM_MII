Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray the inside of a 9 x 9 baking dish with non-stick cooking spray. Unroll the crescents and line the inside of the prepared baking dish pinching all the edges together and overlap if needed to form a solid layer of rolls; set aside. Cook ground beef in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat until browned; drain fat. Add taco mix and water. Cook until most of moisture has evaporated. Sprinkle 1 cup of taco chips on top of rolls; top with meat mixture, followed by sour cream and shredded cheese. Bake 20 minutes at 350 degrees F or until crescents have browned and sauce has begun to bubble at the edges. Top with remaining taco chips, and bake 5 minutes more.
