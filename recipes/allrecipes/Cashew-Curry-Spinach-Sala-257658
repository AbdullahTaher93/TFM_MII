Whisk vegetable oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, sesame seeds, honey, and garlic together in a bowl to make dressing. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble into smaller pieces. Layer bacon crumbles, spinach leaves, frisee, pears, red onion, and grapes on individual serving plates. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread cashews on a baking sheet. Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Stir in brown sugar, curry powder, rosemary, salt, and cayenne pepper until smooth. Toast cashews in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add to the saucepan with the butter mixture; stir until coated. Let cool, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle cashews over salad plates. Drizzle dressing on top.
