Heat butter in a microwave-safe dish in microwave on high for 7 seconds. Transfer butter to a bowl and beat with cream cheese and vanilla extract with an electric mixer until mixture is nearly fluffy, about 5 minutes. Gradually stir confectioners' sugar into cream cheese mixture to make a smooth frosting. Store in refrigerator.
