Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Pour enough oil into a skillet to coat the bottom; place into oven. Mix buttermilk, cornmeal, and flour together in a bowl until smooth. Remove skillet from oven; pour in buttermilk mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until cornbread is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
