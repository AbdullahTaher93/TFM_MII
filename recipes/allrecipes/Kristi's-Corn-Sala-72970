In a large bowl, toss together the corn, zucchini, pimentos, red onion, and green chile peppers. In a jar with a lid, mix the olive oil, lime juice, cider vinegar, cumin, salt, pepper, and garlic salt. Seal, and shake well. Pour the oil mixture over the corn mixture, and gently stir to coat all ingredients. Cover, and chill at least 3 hours in the refrigerator before serving.
