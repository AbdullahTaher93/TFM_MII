Dissolve 1 teaspoon salt in water in a saucepan and add potatoes. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and return potatoes to saucepan. Mash butter, French onion dip, and garlic into potatoes, using a potato masher or fork. Mix milk into potatoes, 1 teaspoon at a time, until potatoes are your desired consistency. Season with salt and black pepper.
