In a medium bowl, mix together chicken pieces, 2 tablespoons oil, paprika, oregano, salt and pepper; set aside. Heat a large, deep pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken to hot skillet and cook until well browned and cooked through, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the pan over medium-high heat. Stir in sausage, onion and bell pepper; cook until tender, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic, bay leaves, pepper flakes, saffron and rice; cook until well coated with the oil. Add chicken broth; cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until almost all of the liquid is absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in cooked chicken, shrimp, lemon zest, and parsley; cover and continue to cook until shrimp are pink, about 5 to 7 minutes longer. Stir well and serve.
