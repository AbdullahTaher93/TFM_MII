Spoon 3 to 4 tablespoons of Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM) on to a plate. Take a tall glass and rim the edge with the lemon wedge, gently squeezing the wedge to moisten. Turn glass upside down and dip into Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM), to form a nice thick spiced rim. Stand glass right side up. Add ice cubes and season with a good sprinkle of Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM). Add a dash or 2, or more if desired, of the Worcestershire and hot sauces. Add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice from the wedge. Pour in the chilled vodka and top with chilled tomato juice. Garnish with celery stick and stir gently 3 or 4 times to incorporate. Add remaining garnishes of cucumber, grape tomato and cooked shrimp to rim of glass. Serve immediately. Repeat as necessary.
