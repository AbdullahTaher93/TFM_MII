In a bowl, microwave the chocolate chips at medium power for 10 seconds; stir until smooth. Dip each pretzel halfway in the chocolate and hang off the side of a cooling rack (put foil down to catch the drips). Let the chocolate set slightly, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle the chocolate with decorating sugar and let set completely, about 2 hours (do not refrigerate).
