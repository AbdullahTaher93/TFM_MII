Prepare pudding mixes according to package directions; cool. Blend in 1 teaspoon of the almond extract. Set aside. Combine remaining 1/2 teaspoon extract with grape juice. Set aside. Spread 1/4 of pound cake slices with raspberry preserves and 1/4 with blackberry preserves; top each spread slice with unspread slice to form "sandwiches." Cut sandwiches into 3/4-inch wide pieces. Reserve a few to garnish top of trifle; sprinkle remaining pieces with grape juice mixture. To assemble trifle, spoon 1/3 of pudding into 6-cup dessert dish or trifle bowl. Alternate raspberry and blackberry cake pieces in pattern on pudding, using half of pieces. Repeat procedure. Top with remaining pudding. Chill several hours. Shortly before serving, whip cream with powdered sugar and vanilla until soft peaks form. Sprinkle crushed macaroons around edge of dish. Pipe rosettes or spoon dollops of whipped cream on top of trifle; garnish with reserved cake pieces
