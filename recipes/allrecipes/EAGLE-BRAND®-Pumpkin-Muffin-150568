Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In small bowl, combine flour, baking powder, 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice and salt. In large mixing bowl, beat butter, sweetened condensed milk and 1/2 cup sugar until fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add pumpkin; mix well. Gradually stir in dry ingredients only until moistened. Stir in mincemeat. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups 3/4 full. Combine remaining 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice; sprinkle evenly over muffins. Bake 25 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from pans; serve warm.
