In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook the pork chops until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan; stir the brown sugar into the melted butter until smooth. Add the evaporated milk and stir; bring the mixture to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Stir the corn syrup into the milk mixture; fold the pecans into the sauce. Spoon the sauce over the pork chops to serve.
