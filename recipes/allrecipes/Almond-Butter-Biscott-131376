Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Combine flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together almond butter, almond extract, eggs, and egg whites in a medium bowl; add to flour mixture, and stir until just blended (batter will be sticky). Fold in slivered almonds. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Turn dough out onto baking sheet and shape into a log about 12 inches long and 1 inch high. Bake for 35 minutes. Transfer log to a wire rack and cool 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F. With a sharp serrated knife, cut log diagonally into 20 1/2-inch slices. Place slices, cut sides down, back on baking sheet. Bake at 300 degrees F for 20 minutes. Turn cookies over and bake an additional 20 minutes. Remove from baking sheet; cool completely on a wire rack (cookies will harden further as they cool).
