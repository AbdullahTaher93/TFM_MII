Heat the oil in a 6-quart saucepot over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook until well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat. Add the onion to the saucepot and cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the wine to the saucepot and heat to a boil, stirring to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the saucepot. Cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the broth and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Stir in the kale and beans. Cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the kale is tender, stirring occasionally. Sprinkle with the parsley and cheese, if desired.
