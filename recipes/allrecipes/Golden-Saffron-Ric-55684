In a 4- to 5-quart pan over high heat, bring 4 cups fat-skimmed chicken broth, 2 cups basmati rice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon saffron to a boil. Cover and reduce heat; simmer until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender to bite, about 18 minutes. Remove from heat, stir with a fork to fluff, then spoon into a bowl.
