Place beef pieces in a large resealable bag. Whisk 1/2 cup Swanson(R) Beef Broth, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and fajita seasoning mix together in small bowl until mix dissolves; pour over beef. Seal bag and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Arrange French fries in a single layer on a baking sheet; bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes (or according to package directions). While fries are baking, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour and stir until smooth, about 2 minutes. Whisk in remaining 2 cups Swanson(R) Beef Broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and saute 2 minutes or until soft. Add bell pepper and saute an additional 3 minutes. Drain marinade from beef and discard. Add beef to skillet with vegetables. Saute to desired doneness, about 5 minutes. Place fries on a serving platter. Cover fries with beef mixture and cheese curds. Top with gravy and garnish with cilantro and chopped jalapenos.
