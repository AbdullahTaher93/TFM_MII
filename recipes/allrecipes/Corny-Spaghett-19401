Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. While pasta is cooking, in large skillet over medium heat, saute onion in butter 2 minutes. Stir in garlic and zucchini and cook 3 minutes more. Add mushrooms and cook 5 minutes more, until mushrooms are soft. Pour in red wine and pasta sauce, reduce heat to low and simmer. Add corn and bring back to a simmer again to heat through. Serve sauce over pasta with a dab of butter, or toss together.
