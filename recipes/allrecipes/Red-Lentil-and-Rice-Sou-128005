Heat the oil in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Saute onion 5 minutes, until soft. Add garlic, carrots, ginger, and cumin; saute 2 minutes. Add lentils, broth, and 5 cups water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until lentils are just tender, about 20 minutes. Add tomatoes and rice, and simmer 5 minutes. Remove about a quarter of the soup (about 2 cups) and puree in a blender. Return to pot and stir. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Drizzle with a little oil before serving.
