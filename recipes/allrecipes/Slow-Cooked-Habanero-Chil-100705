Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ground turkey and cook until no longer pink and evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, place the cooked meat into a slow cooker, and drain any oil from the skillet. Using the same skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat. Stir in the red pepper and garlic; cook until tender, about 3 minutes. Stir into the slow cooker with the turkey. Stir the kidney beans, black beans, black-eyed peas, tomato sauce, and habanero pepper into the slow cooker with the turkey mixture. Set on High and cook for 3 hours, or on Low for 7 hours. One hour before the time is up, stir in the corn, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, basil, and sage. Continue cooking the chili for the remaining hour. Season to taste with salt.
