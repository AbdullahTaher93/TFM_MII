Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf pans evenly with butter. Combine cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, beating well between each addition. Pour in vegetable oil; beat until fluffy. Fold in strawberries, strawberry puree, rhubarb puree, and rhubarb gently. Mix brown rice flour, tapioca starch, garbanzo-fava bean flour, coconut flour, baking powder, xanthan gum, and salt together in a separate bowl. Fold into the strawberry-rhubarb mixture until thoroughly blended. Add walnuts and vanilla extract to the batter. Divide batter between the greased loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes; invert onto a wire rack to cool completely.
