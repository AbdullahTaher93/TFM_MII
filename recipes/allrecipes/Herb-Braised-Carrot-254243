Heat butter in a large pan over medium heat until completely melted. Add carrots and shallot to pan; cook and stir until the carrots are coated in butter and shallots are slightly soft, about 5 minutes. Stir vegetable stock, thyme, ground nutmeg, and ground sumac into the carrots; cover pan, reduce heat to low, and cook and stir until most of the liquid has disappeared, about 15 minutes. Remove pan from heat and garnish carrots with rosemary, sage, salt, and white pepper.
