Mix marshmallows and melted chocolate until marshmallows are completely coated. Drop by spoonfuls onto sheets of wax paper to make 24 clusters for the "bodies" of the "spiders." Cut each 12-inch piece licorice into 8 pieces. Decorate each spider with 8 pieces of licorice for the "legs" and 2 candies for the "eyes." Let stand at room temperature or refrigerate until firm. Store in airtight container at room temperature.
