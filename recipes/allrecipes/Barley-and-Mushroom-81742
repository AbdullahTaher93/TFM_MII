In a pot with a good fitting lid, melt the butter over medium high heat. Add the celery and peppers and saute for 1 minute. Add the scallions and saute another minute. Add the mushrooms and barley, stir and cook for about 3 minutes. Add the chicken stock and herbs. Bring to a boil, then reduce to lowest setting and cover. Cook for 30 minutes. Leave it alone and don't stir it for at least 25 minutes. Check for tenderness of barley. If it is still too crunchy then cook a little longer adding more stock if needed.
