Add boiling water to gelatin mix in a mixing bowl; stir until completely dissolved. Allow to cool for a few minutes. Stir the yogurt into the gelatin and beat with an electric mixer until fluffy, about 2 to 3 minutes. Pour into a 9x13 inch pan and freeze until firm. Remove from freezer 15 minutes before serving. Cut into squares and serve.
