Heat oil in wok or large skillet over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Carefully add green beans. Cook and stir about 2 minutes or until beans just begin to brown in spots. Add water; cover and reduce heat to medium. Cook about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until almost crisp tender. Remove cover and increase heat to medium-high; cook until any remaining water evaporates, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Stir in teriyaki sauce and half of cashews until beans are coated with sauce. Pour into serving dish; top with remaining cashews.
