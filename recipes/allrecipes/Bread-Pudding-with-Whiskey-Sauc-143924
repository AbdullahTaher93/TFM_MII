Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Soak cubed bread in LACTAID(R) Fat Free Milk. Toss with hands to make sure LACTAID(R) Fat Free Milk has soaked through. Add eggs, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and raisins to bread mixture and stir well. Lightly spray a 9 x 13 rectangular baking dish and distribute bread mixture evenly in the pan. Bake for 40 minutes or until the pudding puffs up and the top is firm and golden brown. Serve warm or cold.
