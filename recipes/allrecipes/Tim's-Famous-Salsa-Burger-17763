Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Form the ground beef into 4 individual patties. Grill patties over high heat for 2 to 4 minutes, then flip over. Top the cooked side of each patty with a dash of hot pepper sauce, a teaspoon of salsa, a slice of Cheddar cheese and a slice of Monterey Jack cheese. Grill for 2 to 4 minutes or to desired doneness.
