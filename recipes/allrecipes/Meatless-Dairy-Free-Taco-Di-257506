Combine garbanzo beans, diced tomatoes, roasted red pepper, jalapeno pepper, sriracha sauce, garlic powder, and chili powder in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until beans are soft and heated through, about 15 minutes. Drain all but 1 tablespoon liquid from the mixture. Stir taco seasoning into the bean mixture; cook until flavors combine, about 2 minutes. Pour bean mixture into a food processor; puree to desired consistency. Spoon dip into a serving bowl.
