Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and line a muffin tin with liners. For the crumb topping combine the sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, melted butter, and cake flour. Mix together until crumbly topping forms. Set aside. In the bowl of a countertop mixer with the paddle attachment, sift together cake flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir until well combined. Add the softened butter and sour cream; mix until combined. Add eggs and vanilla. Mix just until liquid is absorbed. Batter may look lumpy. Fill the muffin cups about 1/2 full with batter. (Note: Do not add crumb topping yet.) Bake the muffins until the muffins are set but not quite fully baked, 23 to 25 minutes. Add a generous amount of crumb topping to the top of each muffin. Gently press the topping into the muffins. Continue baking until muffins are done, 8 to 10 more minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of the muffin should come out almost clean once the muffins are done. Remove from oven and set on rack to cool slightly. While the muffins are cooling, make the Kahlua Glaze. Combine the powdered sugar and Kahlua in a small bowl. Stir together until a thick glaze forms. Drizzle the tops of the cooled muffins with the Kahlua Glaze.
