Whisk together cream of chicken soup and cream cheese in a large pot. Whisk in milk, 2 cups at a time, until smooth. Stir in hash brown potatoes, bacon, butter-flavored granules, salt, and pepper. Bring soup to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until potatoes are tender, 30 to 45 minutes.
