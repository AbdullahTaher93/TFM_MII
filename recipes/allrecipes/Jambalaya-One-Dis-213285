Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken, sausage and garlic and cook until they're browned. Pour off any fat. Stir the soup and the picante sauce in the skillet. Heat to a boil. Stir in the rice, shrimp and peas. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the shrimp turn pink and the meats are cooked through.
