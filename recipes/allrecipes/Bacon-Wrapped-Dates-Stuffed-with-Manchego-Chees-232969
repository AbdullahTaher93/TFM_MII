Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Stuff 1 piece manchego cheese into each date and then wrap with 1 piece bacon, securing with a toothpick. Arrange dates in a shallow baking dish with the bacon seam down and 1 inch between pieces. Bake in preheated oven for 5 minutes, turn dates with tongs, and continue baking until bacon is crisp, 5 to 6 minutes more. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels.
