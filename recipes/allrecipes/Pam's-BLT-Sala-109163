Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside, reserving 3 tablespoons of the drippings in a bowl. Reduce heat to medium, toss the bread in the drippings and add to skillet. Cook until crisp and golden, about 5-7 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, vinegar and basil. Cover and refrigerate. When ready to serve, toss lettuce, tomatoes, bacon, croutons and dressing in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
