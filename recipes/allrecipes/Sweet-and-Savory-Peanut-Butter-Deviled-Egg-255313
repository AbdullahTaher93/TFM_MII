Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil; remove from heat and let stand, about 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water and cool under cold running water. Peel and cut in half. Place bacon pieces in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels, reserving 1 tablespoon grease. Scoop egg yolks into a bowl. Add reserved bacon grease and peanut butter; mash well. Mix in pickles, mayonnaise, and hot sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon yolk mixture into empty egg whites. Garnish with bacon pieces and paprika.
