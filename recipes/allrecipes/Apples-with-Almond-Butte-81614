Slice the apple ultra thin. Leave the skin on, it's loaded with nutrients. If you are going to use this as an appetizer then fill a bowl with about 1 cup of water and the juice of 1 lemon. Add the apple slices to the bowl; this will keep them from turning brown (and adds a bit of zesty flavor) refrigerate until ready to use. Mix together the flax seed meal and almond butter. If it does not stir well then zap it in the microwave for just 15 seconds. Spoon out a dollop onto each apple slice.
