Bring chicken broth and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Mix ricotta cheese, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, egg, basil, parsley, and oregano together in a large bowl. Season with salt and black pepper. Spread cooked quinoa in the bottom of the baking dish. Top with 1/3 of the pasta sauce. Cover with zucchini slices and ricotta mixture. Top with another 1/3 of the pasta sauce. Scatter all the spinach on top. Cover with remaining 1/3 of the pasta sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese on top. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, 35 to 40 minutes.
