Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orzo in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 13x9-inch baking dish with some of the butter. Stir tomatoes, cream of celery soup, and capers together in the prepared dish. Bake tomato mixture in preheated oven for 10 minutes. Stir orzo into the tomato mixture. Melt remaining butter with olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Season cod with salt and pepper; fry in the butter mixture until browned, about 90 seconds per side. Transfer browned cod to the baking dish. Pour any drippings from the skillet over the cod fillets. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the cod. Bake in the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes.
