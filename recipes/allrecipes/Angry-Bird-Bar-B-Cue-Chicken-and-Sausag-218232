Brown the sausage in a skillet over medium heat. Place the cooked sausage in a bowl and set aside. Return the skillet to the stove and stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the peppers, chicken, sausage, and barbeque sauce. Pour in the water and simmer for 20 minutes. Add the cilantro just before serving.
