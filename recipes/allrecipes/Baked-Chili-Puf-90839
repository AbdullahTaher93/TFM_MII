Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut jack cheese into as many equal-size sticks as you have chilies; insert a cheese stick into each chili. Arrange stuffed chilies in a single layer in a buttered 1 1/2- to 2-quart baking dish (about 2 inches deep). In a large bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on high speed just until they hold stiff, moist peaks. In another bowl, beat egg yolks with flour and milk until well blended. Gently fold yolk mixture into whites, then spread batter evenly over chilies. Sprinkle with cheddar cheese. Bake until casserole is puffy and appears set when dish is gently shaken, 18 to 20 minutes. To serve, spoon portions onto plates and offer guacamole and salsa to add to taste.
