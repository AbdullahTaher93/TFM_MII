To make salsa: In a bowl, mix tomatoes, radishes, red onion, chile, and cilantro. Season with salt and cayenne. Set aside. Lightly brush tortillas with hot water. Stack, wrap in foil, and heat in a 350 degrees F oven until warm (10 to 12 minutes). Meanwhile, in a bowl, stir together green onions, lime juice, oil, garlic, cumin, coriander, chile powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne. Add shrimp and stir to coat; let marinate for 5 minutes, turning a few times. Meanwhile, pit, peel, and dice avocado. Place a wide nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Add shrimp and their marinade. Cook, stirring often, until shrimp are just opaque in center; cut to test (3 to 4 minutes). To serve, fill tortillas with shrimp, avocado, salsa, and sour cream; fold to enclose.
