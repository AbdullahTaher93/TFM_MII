Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter 8 small ovenproof ramekins. Cut fish into 8 pieces, and arrange in a shallow 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour wine over fish, and sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until fish flakes easily; keep oven on for final step. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Saute mushrooms, onion and red bell pepper until tender; remove from heat and set aside. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the saucepan over low heat. Mix in flour, and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly until smooth. Gradually add milk and increase heat to medium; stir constantly until mixture is thick and bubbly. Stir in mushroom mixture, salt and remaining 1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper to saucepan, stirring until well combined. Remove sauce from heat and set aside. Remove fish from wine carefully with a slotted spoon, and place 1 piece into each ramekin. Sprinkle crabmeat evenly on tops, followed by 2 tablespoons sauce and 1 1/2 teaspoons cheese in each dish. Bake in preheated oven for 5 minutes or until cheese is hot and bubbly; serve immediately.
