Preheat oven broiler. Rinse steak and pat dry. In small mixing bowl, combine rosemary, marjoram, thyme, and bay leaf. Crush with fingers until finely crumbled. Stir in salt and pepper. Rub both sides of steak with herb mixture, patting evenly. Broil 1/2 inch from heating element on high, 5 minutes for rare meat, 6 minutes for medium-rare. Turn and broil for 5 more minutes, 6 minutes for medium-rare. Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes. Slice thinly across the grain to serve.
