In a large skillet sprayed with nonstick vegetable cooking spray, over medium-high heat, add vegetable oil. When heated, add lamb chops and sprinkle them with 1/4 tsp salt. Brown both sides by cooking 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 5 to 6 minutes. Reduce heat again to simmer. Mix apricot preserves and apple juice and pour over chops. Cover and cook for 10 minutes. Add to the hot cooked couscous the slivered blanched almonds (optional), chopped parsley, and remaining 1/2 tsp salt. Mix well and serve with lamb chops.
