Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Season zucchini pieces with salt. Mix panko bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and Italian seasoning in a bowl. Dip zucchini pieces into the beaten eggs and then press into bread crumbs to coat; gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Arrange breaded zucchini onto the prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Bake zucchini in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
