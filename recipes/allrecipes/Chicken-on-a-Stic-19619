Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry. Sprinkle with the meat tenderizer and place in a sealable plastic bag. Pour the dressing in the bag and turn the chicken to coat thoroughly. Seal and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil grate. Place the chicken onto skewers and grill over medium heat for 5 to 10 minutes per side. Chicken is done when its juices run clear.
