Place bacon in a stock pot over medium-low heat; cook and stir until bacon begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir onion and garlic into bacon; cook and stir until onion is tender, about 10 minutes. Add green tomatoes, vegetable broth, celery salt, bay leaf, and black pepper to bacon-onion mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until tomatoes are tender, about 40 minutes.
