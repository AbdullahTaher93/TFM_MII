In a large bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. Combine milk, oil and egg; pour over cornmeal mixture and mix well. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. Crumble corn bread into a large bowl. Add parsley, poultry seasoning and pepper; toss. Combine egg substitute and 3/4 cup butter; add to the corn bread mixture, stirring just until blended. Just before baking, stuff the turkey with dressing. Skewer or fasten openings. Tie drumsticks together. Place on a rack in a roasting pan. Brush with remaining butter. Place remaining dressing in a greased baking dish; cover and refrigerate until ready to bake. Bake turkey at 325 degrees F for 4-1/2 to 5 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees F for the turkey and 165 degrees F for the stuffing. When turkey begins to brown, cover lightly with a tent of aluminum foil. Bake extra dressing at 325 degrees F for 1 hour. When turkey is done, let stand for 20 minutes before carving. Remove all dressing to a serving bowl.
