Combine flour, salt, yeast, sugar, cocoa, sunflower oil, and water in a large bowl. Stir everything with a wooden spoon until you have a soft dough. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface. Knead for five minutes, until smooth and elastic. Divide the dough in half, and roll each half into a ball. Place both on a baking sheet. Cut crisscross designs in the tops, and cover with a kitchen towel. Let rise until double in size. Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 35 minutes.
