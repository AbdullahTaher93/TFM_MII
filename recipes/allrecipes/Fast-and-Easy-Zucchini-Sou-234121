Stir zucchini, water, and chicken bouillon cubes together in a stock pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, place a cover on the pot, and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, until the zucchini is tender, about 20 minutes. Drop cream cheese into the soup; cook and stir until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes. Blend the soup with an immersion blender until smooth.
