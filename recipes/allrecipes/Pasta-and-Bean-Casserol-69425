Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Oil a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook onion in oil until soft, then add garlic and red and green peppers. Stir in jalapeno, if desired. Continue cooking for 2 more minutes. Stir in tomatoes and garbanzo beans. Season with basil, oregano, paprika, cumin, coriander, and salt and pepper. Simmer with 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in pasta. Transfer to prepared baking dish, and top with cheese. Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
