Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add turnips and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, and cool. In a large bowl, combine the turnips, green onions, apples, pineapple and sugar. Stir to evenly coat with the sugar. Whisk together the oil, water, salt and pepper. Pour dressing over fruit and vegetables. Toss and refrigerate overnight.
