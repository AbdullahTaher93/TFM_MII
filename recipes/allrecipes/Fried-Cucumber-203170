Heat the vegetable oil in a large heavy skillet over medium high heat. Line a plate with a paper towel; set aside. Roll the cucumber slices in the cornmeal. Fry the slices in the hot oil, a few at a time, until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the cucumbers to the prepared plate; sprinkle with salt to serve.
