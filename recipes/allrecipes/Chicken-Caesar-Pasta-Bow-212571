Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until it's well browned on all sides. Stir the soup, water and dressing in the skillet. Heat to a boil. Add the tomatoes. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Toss with the linguine. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
