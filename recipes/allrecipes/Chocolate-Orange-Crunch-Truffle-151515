Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Place the chocolate and cream in a small saucepan over low heat. Carefully melt the chocolate, stirring to blend with cream. Remove from heat and stir in the orange marmalade. Mix until blended, then fold in the rice cereal. Spoon the mixture by tablespoons onto the baking sheet. Repeat until all of the mixture is used. Chill the truffles in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight. Place each truffle in a small decorated paper cup.
