Stir together broth, oyster sauce, rice wine, and cornstarch in a small bowl. Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Stir-fry garlic and ginger with salt until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add shiitakes and stir-fry until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add bok choy and stir-fry until crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Re-stir cornstarch mixture. Make a well in vegetables and add cornstarch mixture. Bring to a boil and toss to coat vegetables. Serve immediately.
