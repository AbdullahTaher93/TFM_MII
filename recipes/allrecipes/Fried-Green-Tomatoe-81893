Rinse tomatoes and remove the stem portion. Cut into slices about 1/3 inch thick. You should be able to get 6 slices from each tomato. If your tomatoes are small, add a third tomato to the recipe. In a flat bowl, beat the egg thoroughly. Set aside. On a plate or shallow dish, mix together the parmesan cheese, garlic powder and cayenne pepper. In a frying pan over medium-high heat, add enough canola oil to cover the bottom about a 1/8 inch high. Using your left hand, soak a tomato slice in the egg, then place it on the plate with the cheese. Using your right hand, dredge both sides of the tomato through the cheese. Lightly pat it to encourage the cheese to stick. Set aside or place directly in the fry pan. Using separate hands for the wet and dry portions keeps you from getting to messy. Repeat with each slice. Fry the tomato slices until a medium brown. Turn over carefully and fry the other side. Remove the slices to a paper towel and lightly salt them immediately. Serve immediately; 3 slices per serving.
