In a 3- to 4-quart pan over high heat, bring 2 1/4 cups water to a boil. Stir in couscous; remove from heat, cover, and let stand until liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Stir with a fork to fluff; let cool. Meanwhile, put nuts in an 8- or 9-inch-wide pan. Bake in a 350 degree F oven until lightly toasted, about 10 minutes total. To make dressing, mix lemon peel with lemon juice. Add olive oil, mustard, garlic, and dill. Add to couscous the nuts, peas, onion, cheese, and dressing; mix well. Line plates with spinach; mound salad on leaves. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
