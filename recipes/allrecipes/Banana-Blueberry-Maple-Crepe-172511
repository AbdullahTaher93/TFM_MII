Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Set aside a few banana slices and about 1/2 cup fresh or thawed blueberries for garnish. In a large frying pan, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add almonds and stir until slightly darker, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat and with a slotted spoon, lift out almonds, draining melted butter into pan, and transfer to a small bowl. Add maple syrup to browned butter in pan. Bring to a rolling boil over high heat, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Add remaining bananas and blueberries to syrup and mix gently. Lay crepes on a counter in a single layer with speckled sides up. With a slotted spoon, lift fruit from syrup, drain, and divide fruit evenly among crepes, spooning onto a quarter-section of each. Fold each crepe in half over filling, then fold again to make a triangle. Using a wide spatula, set filled crepes in a single layer on a baking sheet with filling sides up. Bake until crepes are warm, 5 to 7 minutes. Meanwhile, bring the syrup to a boil. With wide spatula, put 3 filled crepes on each plate. Moisten crepes with a little hot syrup. Spoon about 2 tablespoons yogurt onto each portion. Sprinkle crepes with toasted almonds and reserved fruit. Add remaining yogurt and syrup to taste.
