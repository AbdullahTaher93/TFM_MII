In a food processor, combine cookies, 2 tablespoons cocoa, pecans, and 1/3 cup powdered sugar. Whirl until fine crumbs form. Mix in liqueur and corn syrup. Continue to process until mixture is well blended and holds together when pressed, about 15 seconds. Using your hands, roll mixture into 1-inch balls. Sift together equal amounts of powdered sugar and cocoa. Roll balls in mixture to coat. Serve or store airtight up to 1 week; for longer storage, freeze up to 2 months. Roll in more powdered sugar just before serving if a white snowball effect is desired.
