Pierce potato wedges with a fork, and arrange in a single layer on a microwave safe plate. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder and Parmesan. Microwave on high for 10 minutes, or until cooked through; rotate the plate after 5 minutes if your microwave doesn't have a rotating plate.
