In a bowl, combine cake mix and butter; mix well. Spread half the mixture into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Combine the marshmallow creme and peanut butter; carefully spread over cake mixture. Crumble reserved cake mixture over the top. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until a tooth pick inserted near the center comes out with moist crumbs (do not overbake). Cool completely. Cut into squares.
