In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the kidney beans, refried beans, onion, ground beef, jalapenos, hot sauce and taco seasoning. Cook for 10 minutes or until beef is brown. Add the green onions and grated cheese just before serving. Serve hot with tortilla chips and sliced jalapenos if desired.
