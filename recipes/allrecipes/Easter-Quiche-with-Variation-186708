Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Whisk eggs, half and half, salt and pepper in medium bowl until well blended. Sprinkle cheeses into baked pie crust; top with bacon. Pour egg mixture over cheese and bacon. Bake 55 to 65 minutes or until crust is light golden brown in center and knife inserted in center comes out clean. Let stand 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with chopped green onions, if you like.
