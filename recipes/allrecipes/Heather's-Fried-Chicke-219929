Place chicken thighs and drumsticks in a large bowl, cover with cold water, and mix in salt. Cover and refrigerate from 8 hours to overnight. Rinse chicken thoroughly. Mix buttermilk, beaten egg, and 1 teaspoon chicken seasoning in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Place chicken pieces into buttermilk mixture and refrigerate 30 minutes to 1 hour. Heat vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place flour and 2 tablespoons chicken seasoning into a shallow bowl and mix until combined. Remove chicken from buttermilk bath, shake off excess buttermilk, and press into flour. Tap off excess flour. Gently place chicken into hot oil, 3 or 4 pieces at a time; fry chicken until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes per batch. Remove chicken pieces to a cooling rack set over paper towels to remove excess oil before serving.
