Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Place whole potatoes into a covered dish; cook in microwave on High for 4 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before cutting each potato into 8 to 10 wedges. Place the potato wedges in a large bowl, drizzle with olive oil, and toss until evenly coated. Spread the wedges in a single layer onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake the potatoes in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Spray the wedges with the cooking spray, turn, and spray again with the cooking spray. Continue baking until golden brown, about 12 minutes more. Stir the rosemary, thyme, garlic powder, oregano, parsley, sage, pepper, and salt together in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly over the potato wedges. Serve hot.
