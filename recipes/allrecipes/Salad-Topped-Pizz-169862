Bake pizza as directed on package. Meanwhile, toss salad greens with vinaigrette. Place pizza on cutting board or serving platter. Cut pizza into 8 wedges; leave in place as whole pizza. Toss salad again. Using tongs or two forks, lift lettuce, shaking to remove any excess dressing, onto top of pizza. Discard any remaining dressing. Sprinkle pizza with cheese.
