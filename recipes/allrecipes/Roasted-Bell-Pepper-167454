Prepare a grill. Wash peppers and pat dry. Cut each in quarters lengthwise. Remove seeds and pithy membrane. Grill for 5 minutes, placing them at the outer edge of the barbecue, then turn them over and grill until barely browned and tender-crisp, about 5 more minutes. Slice each piece into three strips. Serve hot or at room temperature.
