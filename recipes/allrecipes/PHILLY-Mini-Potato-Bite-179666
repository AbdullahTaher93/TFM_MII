Place potatoes in large saucepan; add enough water to cover. Bring to boil on medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer 15 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Meanwhile, mix cream cheese spread, sour cream and Parmesan cheese; cover. Refrigerate until ready to use. Drain potatoes. Cool slightly. Cut potatoes in half; cut small piece from rounded bottom of each potato half. Place, bottom-sides down, on serving platter. Top each with 1 teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture. Sprinkle evenly with bacon bits and chives.
