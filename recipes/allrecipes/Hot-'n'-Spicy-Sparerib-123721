Combine the first seven ingredients; mix well. Rub all of it onto both sides of ribs. Stack the three sheets of foil and place ribs in the center. Bring opposite long edges of oil together; fold down several times. Fold the short edges toward the food and crimp tightly to prevent leaks. Refrigerate overnight. Remove from refrigerator 30 minutes before grilling. Grill, covered, over indirect heat and medium-low coals with meat side down, for 45 minutes. Turn and cook 45 minutes longer or until meat is fork-tender. Remove ribs from foil and place on grill rack. Grill, uncovered, for 10-15 minutes or until crisp, turning once.
