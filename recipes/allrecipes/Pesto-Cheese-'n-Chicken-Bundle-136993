Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Separate dough into 4 rectangles. Firmly press perforations to seal. Cut each rectangle in half crosswise to make 8 pieces; press each to form 4-inch square. In medium bowl, combine cream cheese, pesto, jelly and 2 tablespoons of the bread crumbs; mix well. Stir in chicken and cheese. Place 1/4 cup chicken mixture in center of each square. Bring 4 corners of each square up over filling; twist firmly to seal. Brush top and bottom of each bundle with water; coat with remaining bread crumbs. Place on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F for 14 to 22 minutes or until deep golden brown. Serve warm.
