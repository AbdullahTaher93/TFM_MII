Put the Splenda in a bowl, add the orange extract and the mustard and stir. Cut up the head of cauliflower into flowerets and blanch them by immersing them in a big pot of boiling water for 1 minute, drain and then plunge them into iced water to stop the cooking. Drain. Line a platter with whole lettuce leaves. Place the bowl of orange mustard in the center and then evenly distribute the cauliflower flowerets and ham cubes on the lettuce. Place a jar of fancy toothpicks next to the platter.
