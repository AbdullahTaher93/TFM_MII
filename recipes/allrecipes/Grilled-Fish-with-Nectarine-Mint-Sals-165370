Prepare grill for cooking fish over medium-high heat. Rinse fish and pat dry. Melt butter in a small saucepan. Add lemon juice, garlic, lemon pepper and salt; simmer for 1 minute over low heat and set aside. Cook fish fillets for about 5 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily with a fork, brushing liberally with butter mixture during the last few minutes of cooking. Serve with a large scoop of Nectarine Mint Salsa. To prepare salsa, stir together all ingredients and keep covered until ready to serve.
