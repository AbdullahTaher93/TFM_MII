In a large resealable bag, combine the first nine ingredients. Add catfish, one fillet at a time, and shake to coat. Place a large cast-iron skillet on a grill rack over medium-hot heat. Melt butter in the skillet; add catfish. Grill, covered, for 6-8 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
