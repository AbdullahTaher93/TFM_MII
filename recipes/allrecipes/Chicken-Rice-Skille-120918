In a large skillet over medium heat, brown chicken in oil for about 4 minutes on each side or until almost tender. Add celery, onions and peppers; cook until vegetables are crisp-tender. Stir in the beans and mushrooms; cook until chicken juices run clear. Stir in the broth, water and seasonings. Bring to a boil. Stir in rice; cover and remove from the heat. Let stand for 5 minutes or until rice is tender; fluff rice with a fork.
