In a small bowl, pour rum over raisins. Let stand for 30 minutes and drain. Place ingredients in pan in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Use the regular setting for a 1 pound loaf. If your machine has a Fruit setting, add the raisins at the signal, or about 5 minutes before the kneading cycle has finished.
