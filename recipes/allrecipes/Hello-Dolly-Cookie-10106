Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 x 9 inch baking pan. In a medium bowl, combine graham crackers, chocolate chips, walnuts and coconut. Pour melted butter over the dry ingredients and stir. Press into prepared baking pan. Drizzle the condensed milk over the top. Bake for 25 - 30 minutes, until lightly colored on top. Let cool before cutting into bars.
