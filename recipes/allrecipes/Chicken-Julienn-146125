Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish. Place the butter and flour in separate shallow dishes. Dredge the chicken strips first in the flour, coating evenly, and then in the butter. Place chicken in prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with lemon juice. Add salt, and pepper, to taste. Pour the heavy cream over the chicken. Sprinkle evenly with Parmesan cheese, and paprika. Bake in preheated oven until cheese melts and cream bubbles, about 20 minutes.
