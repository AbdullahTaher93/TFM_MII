Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion; cook and stir until starting to brown, then mix in the hot dogs. Fry until browned, then transfer hot dogs and onions to a 2 quart casserole dish. Stir in the baked beans, applesauce, mustard, ketchup and ginger. Top with shredded cheese. Bake uncovered for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until heated through and cheese is melted and browned.
