Blend yogurt, peanut butter, banana, and flaxseed meal in a food processor or blender until smooth. Pour into 8 lined cups of a muffin tin (silicone cupcake liners work well for these), filling cups halfway. Top each with a dogbone treat. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until solid, at least 2 hours. Pop treats out of tin, remove liners, and freeze in a zip-top plastic freezer bag up to 2 weeks.
