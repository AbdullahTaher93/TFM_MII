Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line shallow baking pan with aluminum foil; spray foil with cooking spray. Mix tomato sauce and brown sugar in small bowl; set aside. Combine meat, drained tomatoes, bread crumbs and eggs in medium bowl. Shape meat mixture into a loaf shape in pan. Bake 30 minutes. Remove from oven; pour tomato sauce mixture over meatloaf. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Bake 25 to 30 minutes more or until meatloaf is cooked through (160 degrees F). Let stand 10 minutes before cutting into 6 slices.
