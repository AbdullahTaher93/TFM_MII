In a bowl, mash the yellow curry paste with about 2 tablespoons of chicken broth to help dissolve the paste; whisk in remaining chicken broth, sugar, curry powder, salt, light soy sauce, and coconut milk. Set aside. Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat for about 30 seconds; pour in the oil. Let the oil heat until shimmering, about 30 more seconds. Stir the chicken, garlic, and ginger into the hot oil; cook and stir until the chicken has begun to brown and the garlic and ginger are fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in the onion and potatoes, toss all ingredients in the hot oil, and pour in the sauce mixture. Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce heat, and cover the wok. Simmer until the chicken is cooked through and the potatoes are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
