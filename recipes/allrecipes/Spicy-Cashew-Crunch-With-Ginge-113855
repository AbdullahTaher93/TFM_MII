Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly oil a large baking sheet. In a small bowl, dissolve the granulated sugar in the hot water. Stir in 1 teaspoon of the soy sauce. In a saucepan of boiling water, blanch the garlic for 10 seconds. Drain and pat dry. Transfer the garlic to a bowl. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of soy sauce and the cashews, ginger, red pepper and lime zest and toss well. Toss the cashews with the soy syrup. Add the raw sugar; toss again. Spread the nuts on the prepared baking sheet. Season with salt. Bake for 25 minutes, or until bubbling and golden. Let cool until warm but still pliable. Using a metal spatula, loosen the nuts from the baking sheet; let cool completely.
