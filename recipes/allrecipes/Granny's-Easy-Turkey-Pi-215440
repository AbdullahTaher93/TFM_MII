Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x12-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the ground turkey and onion until the turkey is no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle the turkey and onion with salt, black pepper, and ground celery seed; break the turkey apart into crumbles as it cooks. Drain if necessary. Mix together the cream of celery soup, milk, egg, peas and carrots until thoroughly combined. Spoon the cooked turkey mixture into the prepared baking dish, and pour the soup mixture over it. Top with Cheddar cheese in a layer. Unroll the crescent dough, and place over the cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until the crescent dough is golden brown and the filling is bubbling, about 25 minutes.
