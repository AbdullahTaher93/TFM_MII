In a small bowl, mix together Neufchatel cheese, lemon zest, and honey. Refrigerate for 1 day to allow the flavors to develop. Spread about 2 tablespoons of the sweetened Neufchatel cheese over one side of a slice of bread. Top with about 2 tablespoons of chopped kiwi fruit, and another slice of bread. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make 8 sandwiches in all.
