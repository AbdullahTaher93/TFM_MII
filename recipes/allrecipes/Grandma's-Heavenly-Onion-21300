In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter and saute onions until translucent. Transfer onions to a 9x12 inch casserole dish and sprinkle cheese over onions. Spread butter on both sides of the bread, then lay the bread over the cheese. In a medium bowl combine milk, soup, soy sauce, salt and pepper. Mix well and pour over bread. Cover and refrigerate over night. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes.
