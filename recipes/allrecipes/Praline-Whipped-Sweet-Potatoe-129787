Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Prick potatoes with fork, then microwave on HIGH 15 to 20 min. or until tender. Remove from oven; cool 5 min. Cut each potato lengthwise in half; carefully scoop potato flesh into medium bowl, reserving potato shells for later use. Mash potatoes until smooth. Add cream cheese and 1/2 tsp. of the cinnamon; mix until well blended. Spoon evenly into potato shells. Place cereal in resealable plastic bag; gently crush with hands or a rolling pin. Mix with brown sugar, butter and remaining 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. Sprinkle evenly over potatoes. Bake 15 min. or until potatoes are heated through and streusel topping is golden brown.
