Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Arrange chicken pieces in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish, allowing room between pieces. Drizzle with Worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke, then sprinkle with chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, thyme, oregano and salt and pepper to taste. Cover dish with aluminum foil and bake for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
