Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and coat with olive oil. Arrange flounder fillets on prepared baking sheet and season with salt and pepper. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes and sprinkle evenly with dill. Continue baking until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 2 minutes more. Stir sour cream, capers, and lemon zest in a bowl; season with salt. Serve fish with lemon wedges and sour cream caper sauce.
