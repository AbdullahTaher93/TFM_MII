In a small mixing bowl, beat the egg white and 1 teaspoon vanilla on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in 1/2 cup sugar, about 2 tablespoons at a time, on high until glossy stiff peaks form. Fold in the coconut. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl, cream shortening and remaining sugar. Beat in the eggs, egg yolk, sour cream, and remaining vanilla until light and fluffy. Combine the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with coffee. Pour half of the batter into a greased 10-in. tube pan with removable bottom. Top with coconut mixture; spread with the remaining batter. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely. In a small mixing bowl, combine frosting ingredients; beat until smooth. Spread over the top and sides of cake.
