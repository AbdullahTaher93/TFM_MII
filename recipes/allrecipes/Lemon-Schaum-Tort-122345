In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites, vanilla and cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in 1 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, on high speed until stiff glossy peaks form and sugar is dissolved. Spread meringue on the bottom and up the sides of a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake at 275 degrees F for 1 hour. Turn oven off and let stand in oven for 1 hour. Do not open door. Remove from the oven; cool on wire rack. In the top of a double boiler, combine egg yolks and remaining sugar. Gradually stir in lemon juice and peel. Cook and stir over simmering water for 15 minutes or until mixture is thickened and reaches 160 degrees F. Cover and refrigerate until cool. In a mixing bowl, beat cream and confectioners' sugar until stiff peaks form. Spread half over meringue; cover with lemon mixture. Top with remaining cream mixture. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Refrigerate overnight.
