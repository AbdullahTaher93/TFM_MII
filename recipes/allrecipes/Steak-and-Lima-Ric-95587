Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the lima beans, and cook until wrinkled, about 10 minutes. Pour tomato sauce over the beans and stir in 2 cups of water and sugar. Cover and simmer over low heat for 45 minutes. Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown steaks on each side, then pour in just enough water to cover. Place a lid on the pan and simmer for 35 to 40 minutes over medium-low heat. Spoon some of the liquid into a cup or small bowl and mix with flour until smooth. Return to the pan and simmer until gravy has thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Combine the rice and 4 cups water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and cook for 20 minutes, or until rice is tender. To serve, spoon rice onto plates. Top with steak and gravy then top with lima bean sauce.
