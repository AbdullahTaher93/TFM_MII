Place cream cheese between 2 sheets of wax paper. Roll out to 6x4-inch rectangle with rolling pin. Remove top sheet of wax paper; coat top and sides of cream cheese with shredded cheese. Invert onto serving plate. Remove wax paper. Arrange 3 rows of olives in top left corner of cream cheese rectangle for the 'stars' of the 'flag.' Make 4 (1/4-inch-deep) rows, using rounded end of 1/4-tsp measuring spoon for the 'flag's stripes,' leaving a 1/4-inch-wide space between the rows. Fill rows with salsa. Serve immediately or cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Serve as a spread with crackers.
