In a small bowl, mix oil, butter, lemon juice, mustard, basil, garlic, salt and pepper. Place shrimp in a large, resealable plastic bag. Add oil-basil mixture and toss to coat. Allow to marinate for 20 minutes before threading onto skewers. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Place shrimp on hot grill. Cover and cook until grill marks form on one side, about 3 minutes. Turn skewers over and cook until shrimp are fully cooked, about 2-3 minutes longer.
