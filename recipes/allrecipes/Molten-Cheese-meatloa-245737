Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 9x5 inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, with edges hanging over for easier pickup. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Combine ground beef, onion, garlic, salt, pepper and crushed Cheerios(TM) in a mixing bowl. Mix until well combined but do not overwork. Place half of the meat mixture in prepared loaf pan. Press mixture into all corners and up the sides leaving a trough in the center for the cheese. Sprinkle in the cheese; place remaining meat mixture on top. Press well to seal cheese inside meatloaf. Turn out meatloaf onto foil-lined baking sheet; double check to make sure cheese is sealed inside. Bake until internal temperature is 165 degrees, about 2 hours. Allow to rest 10 minutes before slicing.
