In a 3-quart heavy saucepan, combine half-and-half, Ghirardelli(R) 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Chips, Ghirardelli Sweet Ground Chocolate and Cocoa, and sugar. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until just boiling and mixture is smooth. Serve immediately in demitasse cups or shot glasses with Cinnamon Whipped Cream and stick cinnamon. In a chilled medium bowl, combine whipping cream, powdered sugar, and cinnamon. Beat with chilled beaters of an electric mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form (tips curl).
