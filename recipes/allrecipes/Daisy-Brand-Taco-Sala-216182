Brown the beef over medium high heat for about 4 minutes and drain. Remove the beef from the pan to a clean bowl. Add the minced onion, garlic, and Serrano pepper to the hot pan and saute for 2 minutes over medium heat. Return the beef to the pan and add the seasonings, beef broth and the juice from 1/2 of the lime. Bring the mixture to a simmer and reduce the heat to low. Cook for an additional 5 minutes. Create a bed of chips on each plate and layer on vegetables, beans, beef, and Cheddar cheese. Top with a dollop of Daisy Brand sour cream. *Try serving in a chip bowl instead of using a bed of chips.
