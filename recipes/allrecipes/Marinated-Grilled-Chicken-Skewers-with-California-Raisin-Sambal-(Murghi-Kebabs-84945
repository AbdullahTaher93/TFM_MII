In food processor or blender, blend together cilantro, mint, shallots, lemon juice, garam masala, ginger, sugar, garlic and jalapeno. Slowly add vegetable oil, blending thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside. Set skewers to soak in water for 1 hour. Lightly pound chicken breasts. Cut lengthwise into 1-inch wide strips, 3 to 4-inches long. Thread chicken strips onto skewers; brush with marinade. Refrigerate at least one hour or overnight. To make sambal, heat oil in small saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute onion, ginger, garlic and jalapenos, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in raisins and turmeric; cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add vinegar; simmer 10 to 12 minutes or until all liquid evaporates. Puree mixture; season with salt and pepper. Preheat grill or broiler. Arrange skewers in single layer; grill 2 to 3 minutes each side or until chicken is no longer pink at thickest part. Serve arranged on red leaf lettuce with sambal on the side.
