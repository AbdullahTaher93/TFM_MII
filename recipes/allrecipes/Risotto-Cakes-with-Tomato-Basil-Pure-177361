Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 3- to 4-quart pan over medium-high heat. Add rice and stir until opaque, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in broth and 1 1/2 cups water. Bring to a boil, stirring often. Then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered and stirring often, until rice is tender and almost all liquid is absorbed, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in mozzarella, parmesan, and onions. Let cool uncovered. If making ahead, cover and chill up to one day. In a food processor or blender, combine tomatoes and their liquid, yogurt, and chopped basil. Whirl until smooth; set aside. Divide rice mixture into 12 equal portions; shape each into a cake about 3/4 inch thick. Heat 1 teaspoon of oil in a wide, nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add risotto cakes to pan, a portion at a time (do not crowd pan); cook, turning once, until golden on both sides, about 20 minutes. Add remaining 2 teaspoons oil as needed. As cakes are cooked, arrange them in a single layer in a large, shallow baking pan; cover loosely with foil and keep warm in a 300 degrees F oven until all cakes are cooked. To serve, arrange 2 cakes on each plate. Top with tomato-basil puree and garnish with basil sprigs.
