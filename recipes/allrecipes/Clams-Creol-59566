Heat oil in a pot large enough to hold your clams, over medium heat. Add the onions, green pepper, celery and garlic; and cook, stirring until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the can of tomatoes with green chilies, wine and clams. Turn the heat up to medium-high, cover the pot, and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, or just until all of the clams have opened. Remove from heat immediately.
