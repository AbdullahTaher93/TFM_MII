Prepare Chocolate Frosting: Place 2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk (not evaporated milk) and 1/2 cup Hershey's Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips in small microwave-safe bowl; stir. Microwave at HIGH (100%) 1 minute or until chips are melted and mixture is smooth when stirred. Cool completely. Heat oven to 350 F. Beat butter, sugar, egg and vanilla in large bowl until fluffy. Stir together flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt; gradually add to butter mixture, beating until well blended. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Place on ungreased cookie sheet about 2 inches apart. Press thumb in center of each ball to make indentation; place one cherry in each thumbprint. Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until edges are set. Remove from cookie sheet to wire rack. Cool completely. Spoon scant teaspoonful frosting over each cherry, spreading to cover cherry.
