Cut biscuits into football shapes using a cookie cutter. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry biscuit dough in the hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes per batch. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate and cool completely, at least 15 minutes. Combine confectioners' sugar, coffee creamer, and cocoa powder in a bowl until glaze is smooth. Pipe icing into each donut using a pastry bag or plastic bag with the corner snipped. Dip each filled donut in the glaze until completely coated.
