Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. In a large bowl, stir together flour, sugar and baking powder. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in 2 cups buttermilk, mixing just enough for dough to come together. Roll dough out until 1 inch thick. Cut into rounds with a biscuit cutter. Place biscuits on prepared baking pan. Brush biscuits with 2 tablespoons buttermilk. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, until golden.
