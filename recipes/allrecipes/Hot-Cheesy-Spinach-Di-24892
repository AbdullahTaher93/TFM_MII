Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, baby spinach and white wine. Cook and stir 2 to 3 minutes, until spinach is wilted. Mix in salt and pepper and hot sauce. Remove from heat and transfer to a medium bowl. Mix green onion, mozzarella cheese, mayonnaise and half and half into the bowl with the spinach mixture. Transfer mixture to a medium baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven 20 minutes, or until bubbly and lightly browned.
