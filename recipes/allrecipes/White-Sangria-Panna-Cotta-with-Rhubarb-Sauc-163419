Bring rhubarb, 1/4 cup of the sangria and 1/4 cup of the sugar to boiling in medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low and boil gently 10 minutes. Let cool while preparing panna cotta. Meanwhile, add another 1/4 cup of the sangria to small bowl; sprinkle with gelatin. Let soften 5 minutes. Bring cream and remaining 1/2 cup sugar to boiling in medium saucepan; stirring to dissolve sugar. Remove from heat; stir in softened gelatin until dissolved. Stir in remaining 3/4 cup sangria. Ladle mixture into six lightly oiled 6-ounce custard cups or ramekins. Refrigerate until set, about 2 hours. Place cooled rhubarb in bowl of small food processor with metal blade. Process 30 seconds or until pureed. When ready to serve, remove panna cotta from custard cups by dipping them briefly in warm water and gently going around edge with plastic spatula if needed. Invert onto plates and spoon on the rhubarb sauce.
