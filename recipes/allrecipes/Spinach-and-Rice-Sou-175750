Melt butter in a 3- to 4-quart pan over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook, stirring often, until it begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Add zucchini and increase heat to high; stir often until zucchini softens and turns yellow, about 5 minutes. Add broth, spinach, and rice. Bring to a boil; then reduce heat, cover, and simmer until rice is tender to bite, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
