Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and cook until translucent, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, oregano and thyme; cook until garlic is light golden brown, about 1 minute. Using a whisk, mix cornstarch with 1/2 cup water until dissolved. Add cornstarch mixture, wine, chicken bouillon and sugar to skillet. Bring wine mixture to a boil and cook until the sauce is reduced by half, 2 - 5 minutes. Stir beans into sauce and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes more. Add cooked, hot pasta to skillet; stir to coat completely with sauce. Divide pasta evenly among serving bowls. Garnish with fresh thyme, if desired.
