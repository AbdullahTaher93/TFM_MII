Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease with cooking spray. Slice each potato into long spirals using a spiralizer fitted with the straight-flat blade. Cut each spiral into 3 shorter pieces. Thread a skewer through the middle of each potato spiral. Gently push down to fan out spiral. Set skewers on the prepared baking sheet; spray generously with cooking spray. Sprinkle taco seasoning on top. Roast in the preheated oven until browned and crisp, 17 to 18 minutes. Season with sriracha sauce and sea salt.
