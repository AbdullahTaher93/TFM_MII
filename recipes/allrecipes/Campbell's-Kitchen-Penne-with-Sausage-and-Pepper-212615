Cook the sausage in a 12-inch skillet until well browned, stirring often. Stir in the pepper, onion and oregano and cook until the vegetables are tender. Stir the gravy in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes or until the sausage is cooked through. Add the pasta to the skillet and toss to coat. Sprinkle with the cheese.
