Season scallops with salt and pepper and set aside. Tie noodles together at one end with a rubber band and cook according to package instructions. When finished, cut hard ends of noodles off. Meanwhile, bring water to a boil. Remove from heat, add tea, and let steep for 5 minutes. Strain tea and whisk in oil, vinegar, soy sauce, honey, lemon juice, and pepper to taste. Coat noodles with vinaigrette, saving some to coat peas and tomatoes later, and let stand. Heat oil in pan and sear scallops 1 1/2 minutes on each side. (Spread them out so they cook evenly.) Remove from pan and place on paper towel. Blanch peas by dunking into boiling water briefly, then place in bowl of cold water. To serve, pinch a bunch of noodles and arrange in a swirl on each dish, topping with four scallops per serving. Plate peas and tomatoes on side or sprinkle over scallops and noodles. Drizzle with reserved dressing.
