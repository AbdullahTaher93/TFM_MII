Cook beef, pork, onion, and garlic in hot oil until onion is golden. Add tomato sauce, tomato paste, mushrooms, carrot, salt, pepper, and sugar, and simmer 15 minutes. Remove the carrot and throw away--it is just there for sweetness. Alternate layers of macaroni, cheese, and meat in greased 2-quart casserole. Sprinkle top with cheese. Bake in a 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven for 45 minutes.
