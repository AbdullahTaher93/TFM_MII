Drain cherries, reserving juice. Add enough water to measure 1/2 cup. Set cherries aside. In a microwave-safe 8-in. square baking dish, combine 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch and reserved juice until smooth. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 3-4 minutes or until thickened, stirring occasionally. Gently stir in the rhubarb, basil, reserved cherries and remaining sugar. In a bowl, combine the flour, oats, brown sugar and salt. Cut in margarine until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle over cherry mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown.
