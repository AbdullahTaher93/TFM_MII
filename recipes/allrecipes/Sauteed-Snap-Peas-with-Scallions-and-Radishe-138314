Trim sugar snap peas. Slice scallions (white and pale-green parts only) into 2-inch lengths. Trim and quarter radishes. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add snap peas; cook, tossing frequently, until just beginning to soften (do not brown), 3 to 4 minutes. Add scallions and radishes; season with salt and pepper. Cook, tossing frequently, until scallions soften and snap peas are crisp-tender, 1 to 2 minutes more.
