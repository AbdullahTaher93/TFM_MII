Heat the oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, carrots, celery, onion, garlic, and ginger and cook, stirring often, for 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are lightly browned. Add the sherry and cook for 1 minute, stirring to loosen browned bits from the pan. Add the broth and salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes, adding the snow peas during the last 3 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the soba noodles according to package directions. Drain and set aside. Stir the tofu, soba noodles, and scallions into the broth and simmer for 3 minutes, or until heated through.
