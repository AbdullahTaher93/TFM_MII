Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Flatten chicken breasts without breaking through meat. Roll each ham slice in a cheese slice, then roll up in chicken breasts. In a shallow dish or bowl season flour with salt, pepper and paprika. In a separate dish or bowl beat together eggs and milk. Dip chicken rolls in seasoned flour, then egg mixture, then bread crumbs. Heat oil in a large skillet and fry chicken in hot oil until golden brown. Set aside. To Make Sauce: In a large bowl combine the soup, mushrooms, garlic powder, curry powder, wine and sour cream. Mix all together. Place browned chicken in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour sauce mixture over chicken and bake in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Garnish with fresh parsley sprigs.
