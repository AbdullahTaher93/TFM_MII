In a large mixing bowl, cream butter, cream cheese and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in vanilla. Combine flour and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Divide dough into fourths. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until easy to handle. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each piece of dough to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut with floured 2-in. round cookie cutters. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Spoon 1/4 teaspoon jam in the center and spread to within 1/4 in. of edge. Shape into a bell by folding edges of dough to meet over filling. Bake at 375 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
