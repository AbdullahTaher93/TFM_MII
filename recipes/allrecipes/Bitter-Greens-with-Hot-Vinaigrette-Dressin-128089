Arrange the greens in 4 salad dishes. Broil the bacon until crisp. Drain on paper towels until thoroughly cool, then crumble and sprinkle evenly over the greens. In a 1-quart (1-L) saucepan, whisk the vinegar, honey, mustard, garlic, tarragon, and pepper. Whisk over medium heat until the mixture is hot but not boiling. Spoon immediately over the greens.
