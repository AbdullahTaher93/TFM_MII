Bring 10 cups water and navy beans to a boil in a large pot; cook at a boil for 2 minutes. Stir bacon, onion, brown sugar, molasses, and salt into the water. Carefully pour the mixture into a slow cooker. Cook on High, stirring occasionally, for 4 hours. Stir 3 cups water into the mixture. Continue cooking until beans are tender, about 2 hours 15 minutes more.
