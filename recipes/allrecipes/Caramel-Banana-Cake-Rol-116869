Line a 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan coated with nonstick cooking spray with waxed paper and coat the paper with nonstick cooking spray; set aside. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt and baking powder. In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs for 5 minutes; add 1/2 cup sugar, banana, vanilla and lemon peel. In a small mixing bowl, beat egg whites on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in remaining sugar, a tablespoon at a time, on high until stiff peaks form. Add flour mixture to banana mixture; mix gently until combined. Fold in egg white mixture. Spread into prepared pan. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Cool for 5 minutes. Turn cake onto a kitchen towel dusted with confectioners' sugar. Gently peel off waxed paper. Roll up cake in towel jelly-roll style, starting with a short side. Cool completely on a wire rack. For filling, in a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and brown sugar until smooth and sugar is dissolved. Beat in vanilla; fold in whipped topping. Unroll cake; spread filling over cake to within 1/2 in. of edges. Roll up again; place seam side down on a serving platter. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving. Before serving, sprinkle with confectioners' sugar, then drizzle with ice cream topping. Refrigerate leftovers.
