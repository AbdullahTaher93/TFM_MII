Heat oil in a heavy pot over medium heat. Cook and stir beef in hot oil until browned completely, about 5 minutes. Pour reserved liquid from figs into a 2-cup measuring cup. Add enough water so the mixture is 2 cups total; pour into pot with the beef. Stir carrots, onion, green onions, coriander, and cinnamon into the beef mixture. Reduce heat to low and cook at a simmer for 90 minutes. Stir honey, vinegar, salt, and pepper into the beef mixture; continue cooking on low for 1 hour more. Stir figs and almonds into the beef mixture. Remove from heat. Cool for 1 hour before reheating to serve.
