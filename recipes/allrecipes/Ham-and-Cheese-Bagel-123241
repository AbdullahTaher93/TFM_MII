Spread cream cheese over cut sides of bagels. Place on an ungreased baking sheet with cream cheese side up. Cut the ham and cheddar cheese into 2-in. squares; place over cream cheese. Top half of the bagels with tomato and onion and half with pineapple and parsley. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes or until cheese is melted.
