Heat broiler. Lightly coat broiler-pan rack with nonstick vegetable-oil cooking spray. Shape ground turkey into 4 burgers, 4-1/2 inches wide and 1/2 inch thick. Place on broiler-pan rack. Broil 2 inches from heat 4 to 5 minutes. Turn burgers over and flatten with spatula; broil another 4 to 5 minutes or until internal temperature registers 160 degrees F on instant-read thermometer. Remove from broiler. Meanwhile, place frozen garlic toast slices on large baking sheet. Broil toast until lightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Top each burger with 1/4 cup Classico(R) Four Cheese pasta sauce and 1 slice cheese. Broil burgers 4 to 6 inches from heat to melt cheese and heat pasta sauce through, about 2 to 3 minutes. Spoon any remaining Classico(R) Four Cheese pasta sauce over half the toast slices. Top each with burger and slice of toast. Serve warm.
