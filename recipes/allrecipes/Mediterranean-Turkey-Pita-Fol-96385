In large, non-stick skillet over medium-high heat, cook turkey until no longer pink, about 4 minutes; drain. Add oregano and garlic salt; mix well. In small bowl, mix ranch dressing and cucumber. To assemble, place one pita flat bread on each dinner plate. Top each pita with about 1/2 cup turkey mixture. Drizzle about 3 tablespoons dressing mixture. Top with spinach, tomato, black olives and feta cheese equally over each pita.
