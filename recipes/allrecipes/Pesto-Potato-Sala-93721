If the potatoes are large, cut into equal chunks about the size of golf balls. Place in a single layer in a microwaveable dish. Cover with waxed paper. Microwave on high for about 10 minutes, rotating occasionally, until tender. Remove and set aside for 10 minutes, or until cool enough to handle. In a bowl, whisk the pesto, mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon oil and salt. Add the scallions. Cut the potatoes into 1/2-inch chunks. Add to the bowl. Toss. Add up to 1 tablespoon more oil if needed.
