In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, yeast, sugar and salt. Add milk, eggs and butter; beat for 2 minutes. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. Pour batter by 1/2 cupfuls onto a lightly greased hot griddle; turn when bubbles form on top of pancakes. Cook until second side is golden brown.
