Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Quickly brown the spareribs on both sides. Remove the ribs, and place in a roasting pan. In a medium bowl, stir together the ketchup, cola, and ginger. Pour over the ribs, and place a lid on the pan, or cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake for 2 hours in the preheated oven. Remove the lid during the last 30 minutes.
