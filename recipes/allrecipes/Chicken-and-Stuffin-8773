Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine the stuffing and melted butter/margarine. Put 1/2 of the stuffing mixture in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a large mixing bowl, combine the milk, chicken meat, peas, onion, ground black pepper, pimentos, water chestnuts, celery, mushrooms and soup. Mix well. Pour chicken mixture over the stuffing in the baking dish, then add the other 1/2 of the stuffing mixture. Top with slivered almonds and bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes and serve.
