In a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Add sloppy joe seasoning, spaghetti sauce and tomato sauce; heat through. Transfer to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with cheeses. Place biscuits randomly over the top. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until biscuits are golden brown.
