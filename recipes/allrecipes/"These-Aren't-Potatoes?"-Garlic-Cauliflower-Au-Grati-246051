Cut cauliflower florets from the stems. Separate florets into their smallest subsections. Slice and halve stems into small pieces. Whisk half-and-half, 3 teaspoons black pepper, garlic powder, and salt together in a small bowl. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Scatter 1/3 of the butter cubes and 1/3 of the garlic slices on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer 1/2 of the cauliflower on top. Scatter another 1/3 of the butter cubes and garlic slices on top. Cover with 1 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese and 1/2 of the half-and-half mixture. Repeat layering remaining butter cubes, garlic slices, cauliflower, and Cheddar cheese. Pour in remaining half-and-half mixture. Sprinkle remaining 1 teaspoon of black pepper on top of the baking dish. Arrange the mozzarella cheese slices across the top, covering the layers underneath. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle Romano cheese and paprika on top. Return to the oven and continue baking until cheese crust is golden-brown, about 15 minutes.
