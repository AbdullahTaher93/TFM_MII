Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Prepare stuffing mix as directed on package, omitting stand time. Spray muffin cups with cooking spray. Press 1/4 cup stuffing firmly onto bottom and up sides of 12 muffin cups, forming about 1/4-inch rim around top of cup. Crack 1 egg into each stuffing cup. Sprinkle with bacon bits and cheese. Bake 20 min. or until yolks are set. Let stand 5 min. before serving.
