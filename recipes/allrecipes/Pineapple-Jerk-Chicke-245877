Prepare rice as label directs. Meanwhile, sprinkle chicken with jerk seasoning. In 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat, in hot oil, cook chicken pieces until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. With slotted spoon, remove chicken to plate. In drippings remaining in skillet over medium heat, cook onion, about 5 minutes. Add chicken pieces, pineapple chunks, black beans, green chilies and jerk marinade. Over high heat, heat to boiling; reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer 8 to 10 minutes until chicken is tender, stirring occasionally. Serve jerk chicken mixture over rice.
