Place a large sauce pan over medium heat and coat with the olive oil. Saute the onion and garlic for 3 - 4 minutes, stir in the thyme and cayenne for an additional 2 - 3 minutes. Meanwhile, steam the cubed sweet potatoes in the microwave with 1/8 cup water, covered for 3 - 4 minutes or until just tender. Add the okra and corn to the onion mixture, and saute for 3 - 4 minutes. Stir in the Smoked Andouille, toss for 2 minutes, and then add the chicken broth and cooked sweet potato. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer for 5 minutes. Add the shrimp. Cook just until the shrimp are cooked through about 3 - 4 minutes, season with the salt and serve immediately.
