Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the chicken pieces in a roasting pan skin-side down. Pour the olive oil and melted butter over the chicken. Sprinkle the pieces with minced roasted garlic, paprika, salt, and pepper. Roast in the preheated oven for 35 minutes. Turn the chicken pieces skin-side up and roast until the chicken is done and the skin is crispy, about 25 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the meat should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve the chicken pieces with the sauce on the side for dipping.
