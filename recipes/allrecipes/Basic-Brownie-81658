Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium sized bowl, add the chocolate and butter and zap in the microwave for 30 seconds. Stir and repeat until melted. In a bowl, beat the eggs well until they are light and form a ribbon (that is when the eggs form a string shape impression for a moment on top of the beaten eggs when drizzled from a distance of about 1 foot over the bowl). Add the Splenda, coffee crystals and vanilla extract. Stir. Add the almond meal and baking powder, stir. Then stir in the chocolate mixture. Chop the walnuts with a chef's knife or by placing them in a food processor. Add to the mixture. Lightly grease an 8 x 8 baking dish. Pour the batter into the pan and smooth out with a spatula. Bake in the middle of the oven for 12-15 minutes. Do not over bake. Let cool in the pan for at least 10 minutes (or more). Cut into 16 squares.
