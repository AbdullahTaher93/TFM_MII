Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray loaf pan with cooking spray. Mix together almond flour, ground cinnamon, and baking soda in a bowl. Beat two eggs in a bowl. Mix in water, almond extract, agave syrup, mashed bananas, and vanilla bean paste. Add banana mixture to almond flour mixture; mix until no dry areas are visible. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake banana bread in the preheated oven until brown and crisp around the edges, about 45 minutes.
