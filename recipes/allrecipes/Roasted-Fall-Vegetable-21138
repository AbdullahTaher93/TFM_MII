Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place the beets and turnip in a 9x9 inch baking dish. Cut an X in the root end of the onions and place them in the dish. Drizzle the olive oil over the vegetables and add the rosemary and salt. Stir to coat the vegetables with oil. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until the vegetables are golden brown and tender. Serve hot.
