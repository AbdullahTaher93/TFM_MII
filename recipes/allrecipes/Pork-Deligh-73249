Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the pork until evenly brown. Stir the apple, green onions, garlic, mushrooms, and zucchini into the skillet, and cook until lightly browned. Mix in the tomatoes, and season with cinnamon and Italian seasoning. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
