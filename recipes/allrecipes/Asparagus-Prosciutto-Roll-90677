Trim tough ends from asparagus, then peel lower parts of stalks. In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over high heat, bring 1 inch water to a boil. Add asparagus and simmer, covered, until tender-crisp to bite, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain, immerse in ice water until cold, and drain again. Separate cheese slices; cut each in half crosswise. Spread each piece with 1/2 teaspoon pesto. Separate prosciutto slices; cut into halves lengthwise. For each roll, wrap a cheese slice lengthwise around an asparagus stalk, then spiral a piece of prosciutto around cheese to hold it in place. Serve, or chill airtight up to 6 hours. Garnish with basil sprigs.
