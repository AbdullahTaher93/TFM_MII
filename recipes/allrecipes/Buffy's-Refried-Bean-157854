Melt the lard in a deep, heavy pot over medium-high heat; when the lard is hot, add the beans. Stir constantly while cooking until the beans reach a paste-like consistency. Season with salt. Reduce heat to low and stir in the water. Simmer and stir until the beans cook down to your desired consistency.
