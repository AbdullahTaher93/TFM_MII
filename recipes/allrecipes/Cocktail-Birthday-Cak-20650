Top the cooked ham with four slices of rye bread arranged in a square. Spread with mustard butter. Top with 4 slices of salami. Repeat until 8 alternating layers have been created. Trim overhanging meat. Place a small cookie sheet on top of the layers. Weigh down the cookie sheet with a bowl so as to lightly flatten the layers into a thinner, square cake. Continue flattening and refrigerate a minimum of 5 hours. Frost the chilled cake on all sides with cream cheese and curry powder. Decorate with almonds. Refrigerate until serving.
