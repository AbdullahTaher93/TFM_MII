Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a large bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, soda, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, raisins, and walnuts. In another bowl, beat to blend buttermilk, egg substitute, vanilla, and sweet potatoes. Add buttermilk mixture to flour mixture and stir until evenly moistened. Mound batter in 12 equal portions (about 1/4 cup each) on a lightly oiled 14- by 17-inch baking sheet, spacing at least 2 inches apart. Bake until browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool at least 5 minutes; serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.
