Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). In a roasting pan, combine the meat, carrots, onions and potatoes. In a separate bowl, combine the sugar, tapioca flour and juice cocktail and mix well. Pour this mixture over the meat and vegetables and cover tightly with foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 5 hours.
