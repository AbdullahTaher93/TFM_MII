Place soy sauce, maple syrup, rye whiskey, and wasabi paste into a blender. Cover blender and puree until smooth. Pour half of the mixture into a resealable plastic bag for marinade and reserve remaining mixture in the refrigerator for dipping sauce. Place salmon in the bag, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate salmon in the refrigerator for 4 hours. Submerge cedar planks in water and soak for at least 2 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Remove salmon fillets from marinade, and place each one on a soaked cedar plank. Discard bag and marinade. Place planked salmon into the grill, close cover, and roast until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes. Serve with reserved dipping sauce.
