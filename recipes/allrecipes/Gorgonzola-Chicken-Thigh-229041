Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a small bowl, mash and mix the cheese, 2 tablespoons of breadcrumbs, and the pepper with a fork. Lay the thighs, smooth side down, on a work surface. Crumble on the cheese mixture, then press to flatten. Roll up the chicken thighs and secure with a sturdy, pointed toothpick. Spray all sides of the chicken bundles with olive oil from a mister, or coat with a pastry brush dipped in olive oil. Spread 2 tablespoons of breadcrumbs and the salt on a sheet of waxed paper. Dip the thighs into the crumbs to lightly coat all sides. Shake off excess. Set on a large baking sheet. Mist all sides with olive oil. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until golden.
