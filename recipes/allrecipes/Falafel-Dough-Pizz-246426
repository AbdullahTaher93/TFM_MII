Place red lentils in a bowl and cover with water. Let soak until softened, about 2 hours. Drain. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and grease with 2 teaspoons oil. Place lentils in a food processor with onion, garlic, 1/2 bunch parsley, cilantro, and 1/4 cup green onions; pulse until finely ground. Transfer lentil mixture to a large bowl. Add 1/3 cup oil, egg, baking powder, black pepper, chile powder, cumin, coriander, and salt; mix until well-blended. Spread dough to 1/4-inch thickness onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and firm, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven. Combine yogurt, lemon juice, tahini, and salt in a small bowl; mix well until sauce is smooth. Layer sauce, Cheddar cheese, tomato, olives, 1 tablespoon parsley, and 2 teaspoons green onion on top of baked dough. Return to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.
