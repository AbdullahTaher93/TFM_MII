Whisk liquid amino acid, lemon juice, and olive oil together in a bowl until smooth; add red onion and alfalfa sprouts and stir to coat. Marinate onion and sprouts in the dressing for at least 15 minutes. Put kale into a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle sunflower kernels, pepitas, and sesame seeds over the kale. Pour the onion and sprout mixture with the dressing over the kale and seeds; mix together by hand to coat kale, massaging dressing into the leaves to soften. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate salad at least 1 hour.
