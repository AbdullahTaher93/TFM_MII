Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and rinse macaroni under cold water until chilled. Transfer macaroni to a large salad bowl. Toss pasta with hard-cooked eggs, onion, celery, and green bell pepper. Whisk mayonnaise, milk, pickle relish, and honey mustard in a bowl and pour dressing over the salad; mix well and season with sea salt and ground black pepper.
