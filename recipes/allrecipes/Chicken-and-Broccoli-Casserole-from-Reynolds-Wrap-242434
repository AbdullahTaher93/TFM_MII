Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Line a large 13x9x2-inch baking pan with Reynolds Wrap(R) Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil. Grease or spray foil to prevent sticking. Mix broccoli, soup, stuffing mix, 1/2 cup cheese and water together in a large bowl until well blended. Spread evenly in foil lined pan. Top with chicken. Sprinkle with seasoned salt and pepper. Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until chicken reaches 170 degrees F and juices run clear and stuffing reaches 165 degrees F. Top with remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Cover with a sheet of foil let stand until cheese melts.
