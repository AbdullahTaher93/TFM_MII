In a large skillet or soup pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat and saute the onion and chili peppers until the onions are translucent. Add the beer, cumin and Liquid Smoke. Go easy on both of these, no more than a scant 1/4 tsp of cumin and even less Liquid Smoke (you can always add more at the end if needed). Bring to a boil. Add the chicken, bring back to the boil. Turn the chicken and then reduce heat, cover and simmer for 35 minutes (30 minutes if just breast meat). Transfer chicken to a platter and cover. Boil the cooking liquids until they reduce down to less than 1 cup. Add the salsa and cook for 1 minute. Stir occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low, return the chicken (and any juices) to the skillet and continue to cook another minute, turn the chicken and cook another minute. Stir occasionally. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Transfer the chicken back to the platter (or to individual plates) spoon the sauce over the chicken and garnish with the minced cilantro.
