Crumble the ground beef into a large skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring to crumble, until starting to brown. Add the onion, garlic, bell pepper and jalapeno pepper, and cook until meat is no longer pink. Drain excess grease. Fill the pan with enough water to cover the beef, cover, and simmer over low heat for 30 minutes. Stir in the almonds, pimentos, raisins, tomatoes, tomato paste and sugar. Season with oregano and salt. Simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally for at least 1 hour.
