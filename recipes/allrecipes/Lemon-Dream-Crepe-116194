In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Combine the milk, eggs, butter and vanilla; add to flour mixture and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Heat a lightly greased 8-in. nonstick skillet; pour 2 tablespoons batter until the center of skillet. Lift and tilt pan to evenly coat bottom. Cook until edges are lightly browned; turn and cook 15-20 seconds longer. Remove to a wire rack. Repeat with remaining batter, greasing skillet as needed. When cool, stack crepes with waxed paper or paper towels in between. For filling, melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Add sugar, lemon juice, lemon peel and salt. Whisk in eggs and yolks. Cook over low heat until mixture thickens and coats the back of a metal spoon, whisking constantly. Remove from the heat. Transfer to a small bowl; press plastic wrap over top of filling. Refrigerate until chilled. In a small mixing bowl, beat cream until soft peaks form. Fold half of the whipped cream into lemon filling. To serve, spoon 2 tablespoonfuls of filling down the center of each crepe; fold sides of crepe over filling. Top with remaining whipped cream.
