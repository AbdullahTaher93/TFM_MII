Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place the sugar and cinnamon into a saucepan. Melt the sugar over medium heat without stirring. Add the cashews, and stir until well coated, then spread out onto the prepared baking sheet to cool to room temperature. Puree the raspberries, vinegar, and olive oil until smooth; set aside. Toss together the romaine, spinach, pears, cherries, and feta cheese in a large bowl. Toss with half of the raspberry dressing, and sprinkle with candied cashews. Serve with remaining dressing on the side.
