Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet over medium high heat, saute the cubed meat until well browned on all sides. Place meat in a 10x15 inch baking dish. Next, place the potatoes, onion, green bell pepper and mushrooms over the meat. Top with the salad dressing and cover with foil. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour, or until potatoes are tender.
