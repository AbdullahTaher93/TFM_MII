Arrange half of the grahams in bottom of 13x9-inch pan, cutting grahams to fit if necessary. Beat cream cheese in large bowl with electric mixer on low speed until creamy. Gradually add 1 cup of the milk, beating until well blended. Add remaining 2-1/2 cups milk, the dry pudding mixes, coffee granules and cinnamon. Beat 1 to 2 minutes or until well blended. (Mixture will be thick.) Gently stir in 2 cups of the whipped topping. Spread half of the pudding mixture over grahams in pan; arrange remaining grahams over pudding. Cover with remaining pudding mixture; top with remaining whipped topping. Sprinkle with grated chocolate. Freeze several hours or overnight. Cut into 32 bars to serve. Store leftover bars in freezer.
