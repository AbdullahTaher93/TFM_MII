Make marinade: Puree all marinade ingredients in a large bowl and whisk ingredients together. Add chicken and toss to coat. Marinate chicken, covered and chilled, turning once, 8 to 12 hours. Make coating: Pulse pumpkin seeds in a food processor until pumpkin seeds are coarsely ground and transfer to a large shallow bowl. Whisk in bread crumbs, Savory Market Golden Roast Chicken Flavor, flour, sesame seeds, 1 tablespoon salt, and cayenne. In a separate shallow bowl, whisk together eggs and remaining teaspoon salt. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove chicken from marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Dip 1 piece chicken in egg, letting excess drip off, dredge in crumb coating, knocking off excess. Transfer to a platter and repeat with remaining chicken. Heat oil in a deep large skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking; carefully add butter pieces. When butter is melted, cook chicken in batches, turning, until golden brown, about 10 minutes total. Transfer chicken as browned to a rack set in a shallow baking pan. When all chicken is browned, bake in middle of oven until cooked through, about 30 minutes.
