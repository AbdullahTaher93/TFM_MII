Heat oven to 400. Place 1 slice of cheese on each slice of ham. Next, place a frozen fillet on top of each cheese/ ham slice, roll it up and place the seam sides down in ungreased rectangular pan. Bake 15 minutes. Mix remaining ingredients in a bowl and spoon evenly over fillets. Bake uncovered until hot, about 15 minutes longer.
