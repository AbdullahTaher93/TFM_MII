In a large mixing bowl, combine the hot roll mix and contents of yeast packet; mix well. Stir in the warm water, egg and 2 tablespoons oil; beat for 2 minutes or until dough pulls away from sides of bowl. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place in a bowl coated with nonstick cooking spray, turning once to grease top. Let rest for 5 minutes. Divide dough in half. Roll each half into a 12-in. circle. Transfer to two 12-in. pizza pans coated with nonstick cooking spray. Using fingertips, make indentations 1 in. apart on dough; cover. In a small skillet, saute the onion, rosemary and thyme in the remaining oil for 3-4 minutes or until tender. Spread evenly on dough. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 min. Bake at 375 degrees F for 14-18 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks.
