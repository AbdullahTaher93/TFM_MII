In medium skillet over medium-high heat, warm oil. Sprinkle pork chops with salt and pepper and cook until browned and internal temp. reaches 145 degrees F, about 3 mins. per side. Place chops on a plate and let rest 5 mins. Cut chops into 1/4-in. slices. Microwave tortillas on high until slightly warm and softened, about 30 sec. Place tortillas on workspace and top with pork, avocado, onion, chiles and salad greens stopping 2 inches short of one edge. Working one tortilla at a time, fold one side of tortilla up and over fillings. Tuck fillings in tightly, then fold in the 2-in. edge. Continue rolling tortilla toward the other side, securing with toothpick if necessary. Repeat with remaining tortillas and serve.
