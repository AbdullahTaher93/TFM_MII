Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini and tri-color rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Rinse the pasta with cold water until cool; drain. Combine pasta, tomatoes, cucumber, and purple onion in a large bowl. Stir ranch dressing and Italian-style salad dressing together in a separate bowl; spread over the pasta mixture and stir to coat.
