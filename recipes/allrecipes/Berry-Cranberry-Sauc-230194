Stir 1 cup orange juice, water, sugar, and honey together in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil and stir cranberries, blueberries, raspberries, orange juice, and orange zest into mixture. Reduce heat to low and simmer, mashing berries occasionally to create a thicker texture, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir pumpkin pie spice into sauce. Refrigerate at least 3 hours up to overnight before serving.
