In a wide nonstick frying pan, melt butter over high heat. Add onion and mushrooms; cook, stirring often, until tinged with brown (about 3 minutes). Stir in barley, broth, thyme, and marjoram. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer until barley is tender to bite (10 to 12 minutes). Remove from heat and let stand, covered, until all liquid has been absorbed. Meanwhile, make a half-lengthwise cut in each sausage, cutting to within about 1/4 inch of bottom surface. Gently press sausages open; then place, cut side up, in a foil-lined broiler pan. Broil sausages 4 to 6 inches below heat, turning once, until evenly browned on both sides and cooked through (cut to test), 8 to 10 minutes. Into a wide bowl, spoon barley-mushroom pilaf. Top with sausages and sprinkle with parsley.
