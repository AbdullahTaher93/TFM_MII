Stir in tomato paste and 2 cups water. Cover and simmer on low heat. Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute garlic and bay leaves for 1 minute, then stir in onions; saute until onions are translucent. Stir in zucchini, green and red bell pepper and mushrooms. Slowly cook and stir for 5 to 7 minutes. Stir vegetables into tomato sauce and add oregano, Italian seasoning, chili powder and brown sugar. Simmer over low heat for 6 to 8 hours. Stir in the ricotta cheese 10 minutes before serving.
