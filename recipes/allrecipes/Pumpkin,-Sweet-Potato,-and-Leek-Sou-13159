Heat oil in a heavy-bottom pot. Add leeks, onion, celery, carrot, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, and garlic, and saute until they start to brown. Add bay leaf, stock, and cream; bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until all vegetables are tender. Add sage, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt and pepper to taste. Remove bay leaf, and puree. Serve hot.
