In a small skillet, saute mushrooms in butter until tender; set aside. In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, eggs, milk and biscuit mix just until combined. Stir in the broccoli, cheeses, salt and mushrooms. Pour into a greased round 2-1/2-qt. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
