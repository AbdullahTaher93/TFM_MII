Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Cut fish into 4 serving pieces and season with salt and pepper. Arrange in a single layer in a 10-inch pie plate or baking dish. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and saute until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add wine and garlic and simmer for 30 seconds. Stir in tomatoes, olives, oregano and orange zest. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon mixture over the fish. Bake until the fish is opaque in the center, about 15 minutes.
