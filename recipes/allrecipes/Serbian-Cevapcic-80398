Preheat a grill for medium-low heat. In a large bowl, combine the ground pork, ground beef, ground lamb and egg white. Add the garlic, salt, baking soda, black pepper, cayenne pepper and paprika. Mix well using your hands, and form into finger length sausages about 3/4 inch thick. Lightly oil the grilling surface. Grill sausages until cooked through, turning as needed, about 30 minutes.
