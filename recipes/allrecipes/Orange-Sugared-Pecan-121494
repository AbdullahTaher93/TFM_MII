In a heavy saucepan, combine sugar, water and orange juice concentrate. Cook over medium-high heat, without stirring, until a candy thermometer reads 238 degrees F (soft-ball stage). Remove from the heat; stir in pecans and orange peel. Beat with a spoon until mixture thickens and loses its gloss, about 2 minutes. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto waxed paper to harden. Store in an airtight container.
