Whisk olive oil, garlic, 1/2 cup of basil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add zucchini, yellow squash, and tomatoes to the oil mixture and toss to coat. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 5 to 10 minutes; drain. Transfer pasta to a serving bowl. While the pasta is warm, fold in half of vegetable mixture along with 2 tablespoons ricotta cheese, until pasta is coated and vegetables are evenly dispersed. Top with remaining vegetable mixture. Spoon remaining ricotta on top. Sprinkle 1/2 cup chopped basil over the dish. Season with salt and pepper to serve.
