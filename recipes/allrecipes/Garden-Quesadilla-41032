In a large nonstick skillet cook sweet peppers and onion in 1 teaspoon of the oil for 3 to 5 minutes or until crisp-tender. Stir in cumin and chili powder. Cook and stir for 1 minute more. Stir in cilantro. Set vegetables aside. Spread cream cheese over half of 1 side of each tortilla. Top with pepper mixture. Fold tortilla in half over peppers, pressing gently. Place tortillas on an ungreased large baking sheet. Brush tortillas with the remaining oil. Bake in a 425 degree F. oven for 5 minutes. Cut each quesadilla into 4 wedges. Serve warm. If desired, pass the salsa.
