Heat wok or large skillet with cover over high heat. Add oil and swirl to coat pan. Place broccoli in pan and toss to coat with oil. Reduce heat to medium-high and saute 4 minutes, allowing broccoli to brown in spots. Season with pepper. Add broth to pan, cover, and cook 2 minutes longer, until crisp-tender. Add soy sauce and orange juice and toss broccoli 2 to 4 minutes until all liquid has evaporated and broccoli is tender. Chill leftovers in airtight container up to 4 days.
