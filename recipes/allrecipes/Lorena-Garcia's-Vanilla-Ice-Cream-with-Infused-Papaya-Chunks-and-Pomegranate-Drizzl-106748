Simmer the pomegranate juice in a saucepan to reduce and thicken for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and cool before using. Heat the fat free half and half in a saucepan over medium heat to just before boiling. Set aside. In a separate mixing bowl place the SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and the egg yolks, mix at a speed #2 until pale yellow or light in color. Temper the hot half and half to the egg mixture; add the vanilla and the salt transfer back to saucepan and heat again at low heat until it thickens. Refrigerate over night. Place the mixture in the ice cream maker for 20 to 30 minutes, place in a chilled container and freeze for at least 4 hours before using. In a blender at high speed, add the vanilla ice cream and the papaya in chunks. Serve in a crystal glass, drizzle some of the pomegranate reduction on top. Optional: Garnish with a mint sprig and place some more of the fresh papaya on the bottom of the glass for a nice surprise. Creme the cassis can be used in place of pomegranate reduction.
