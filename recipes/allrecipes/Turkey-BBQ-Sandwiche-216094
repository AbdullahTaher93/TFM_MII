Spray the inside of a slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray, and place the turkey legs into the cooker. In a bowl, mix together the brown sugar, yellow mustard, smoke flavoring, ketchup, cider vinegar, hot pepper sauce, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the mixture over the turkey legs. Cover the cooker, set to Low, and cook 8 to 10 hours. Remove the turkey legs from the cooker, separate meat from bones and tendons, and shred the meat; return the meat to the sauce for serving.
