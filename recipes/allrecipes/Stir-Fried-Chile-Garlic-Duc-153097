Whisk chile-garlic sauce, water, vinegar, soy sauce and cornstarch in a small bowl. Heat oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking. Cook the duck, in a single layer, stirring once, until beginning to brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Add garlic and ginger to the pan and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add broccoli and bok choy; cook, stirring, until the broccoli is bright green, about 2 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring, until softened, about 1 minute. Add the chile-garlic sauce mixture; cook, stirring often, until the sauce is slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Return the duck and any accumulated juices to the pan; stir to coat with the sauce. Cook until heated through, about 1 minute.
