Assemble sandwiches starting with one slice of bread, then 1 slice of ham, a slice of cheese and then a slice of turkey; place one slice of bread and repeat with ham, cheese and turkey, top with a slice of bread. Cut into quarters and secure with toothpicks. Cover sandwiches with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Heat oil in deep fryer to 365 degrees. Dust each quarter sandwich with flour until all sides are coated; dip into beaten egg and toss into panko and cover completely. Carefully lower sandwich quarters one at a time into deep hot oil; fry until golden brown on all sides. Drain; remove toothpicks before serving.
