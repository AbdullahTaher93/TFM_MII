Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a saucepan bring salted water to a boil. Add rice, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat oil in a medium skillet and brown cubed chicken; add green onion and saute for 3 to 5 minutes, until soft. Spread cooked rice in the bottom of a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Add chicken/onion mixture and blend together; flatten with spatula, then sprinkle with cheese and olives. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
