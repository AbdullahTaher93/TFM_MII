In a small bowl whisk together egg and milk. In another small bowl mix cornmeal and flour. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; use more or less oil to reach about 1/4 inch in depth. Dredge tomato slices first in egg mixture, then in cornmeal mixture. Carefully place slices in hot oil and cook until browned on both sides.
