Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the beet in a small baking dish with 1/4 cup of water. Cover with foil and roast the beet for 45 minutes, until tender. Let cool slightly, then peel and finely dice. Meanwhile, spread the hazelnuts in a pie plate and toast them for about 10 minutes, until they are golden. Let cool, then coarsely chop the nuts. In a small saucepan of boiling salted water, blanch the green beans until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and cool under running water. Pat the beans dry and cut them into 1/4-inch pieces. In a large bowl, whisk the yogurt with the lemon juice, honey and olive oil and season the dressing with salt and pepper. Add the diced beet, hazelnuts, green beans, salad greens, carrot, celery, tomato, mint and goat cheese and toss gently. Serve the salad right away.
