Thoroughly rub chicken pieces with ginger paste, garlic paste, and 1 teaspoon salt. Heat the oil in a large deep saucepan or a kadhai over medium-high heat; fry the chicken pieces in the oil on both sides until well browned, about 5 minutes. Mix the yogurt, almonds, cumin, coriander, and turmeric together in a bowl. Pour the yogurt mixture over the chicken and turn to coat; cook another 10 minutes. Stir the mashed chile peppers, cilantro, and mint into the pot; season with salt. Add the water, cover, reduce heat to low, and continue cooking until the chicken is tender, about 20 minutes more. Stir the cream into the sauce just before removing from heat to serve.
