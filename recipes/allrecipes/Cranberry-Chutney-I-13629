In a 3-quart saucepan, combine cranberries, tomatoes, water, raisins, onion, and salt. Bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer. Cook, covered, for 15 minutes or until cranberries pop. Stir in brown sugar, vinegar, ginger, cloves, and pepper. Cover. Cook for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the consistency of relish, stirring occasionally. Ladle into jars or freezer containers. Refrigerate or freeze until ready to use.
