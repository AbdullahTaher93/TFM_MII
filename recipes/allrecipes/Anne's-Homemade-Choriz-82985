In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, ground pork, chili powder, oregano, garlic, salt, red wine and vinegar. I find that using my hands works the best. Cover, and refrigerate for 2 to 3 days. Take out daily, and mix thoroughly. If you are not going to cook with it immediately, divide it into 1 to 2 pound portions, and store in freezer bags in the freezer.
