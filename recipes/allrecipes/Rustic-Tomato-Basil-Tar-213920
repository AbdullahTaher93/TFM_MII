Unroll pie crust on baking sheet. Top with 1 cup cheese, leaving a 1-1/2 inch border around edges. Arrange tomatoes in a single layer over cheese. Drizzle balsamic glaze evenly over tomatoes; top with basil and the remaining cheese. Fold edges of pie crust over filling, tucking and pressing down edges onto tart. Bake on lowest oven rack in a preheated 375 degrees F oven 25 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand 15 minutes. Cut into wedges. Serve warm or at room temperature.
