Sprinkle half of the chow mein noodles into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. In a bowl, combine the chicken, celery, onion, soups, milk, water chestnuts, mushrooms and cashews. Spoon over the noodles; top with remaining noodles. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until heated through.
