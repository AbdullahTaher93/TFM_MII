Mix ground chicken, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, onion, egg, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Moisten hands and shape chicken mixture, 2 tablespoons at a time, into flat, oval-shaped patties. Spread remaining 1/4 cup bread crumbs into a shallow dish. Roll patties in bread crumbs to coat. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties in hot oil until deep brown in color on the bottom, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn patties and cook until other side is browned, 3 to 4 minutes more.
