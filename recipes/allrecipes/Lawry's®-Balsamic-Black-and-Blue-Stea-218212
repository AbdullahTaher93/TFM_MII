Cut a 4-inch wide pocket in each steak, being careful not to cut through back or sides of steak. Place steaks in large resealable plastic bag or glass dish. Add 1/2 cup of the marinade; turn to coat well. Refrigerate 30 minutes or longer for extra flavor. Remove steaks from marinade. Discard any remaining marinade. Fill pocket of each steak with about 2 tablespoons of the blue cheese. Press steak lightly to seal closed. Grill steaks over medium-high heat 6 to 8 minutes per side or until desired doneness, brushing with remaining 1/4 cup marinade. Sprinkle steaks with remaining 2 tablespoons blue cheese. Serve with tossed salad, if desired.
