In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, salt and pepper. Make a well in the center, and pour in the egg, milk, whole kernel corn, and cream-style corn. Mix until all ingredients are combined. Heat the lard in a skillet over medium-high heat. Drop tablespoon-sized dollops of batter onto the hot skillet, and fry for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Serve with butter and salt, and a cold glass of milk.
