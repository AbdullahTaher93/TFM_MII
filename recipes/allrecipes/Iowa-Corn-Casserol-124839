In a skillet, fry the bacon until lightly browned. Remove and set aside. Pour 1/8 to 1/4 cup of bacon drippings over bread crumbs; set aside. Discard all but 2 tablespoons of remaining drippings; saute onion and green pepper until tender. Stir in corn and bacon. Spoon into a 1-qt. baking dish; sprinkle with crumbs. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until bubbly and heated through.
