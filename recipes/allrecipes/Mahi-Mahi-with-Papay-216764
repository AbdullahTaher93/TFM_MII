Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the red bell pepper, papaya, and habanero pepper. Continue cooking a few more minutes until the bell pepper begins to soften. Stir together the cornstarch, water, and 2 tablespoons of lime juice. Stir into the papaya sauce until thickened, stirring constantly. Keep the sauce warm over very low heat. Stir 1 tablespoon of lime juice together with the melted butter, and brush on the mahi mahi fillets. Place onto a broiler pan. Cook under the preheated broiler for 4 minutes, then turn the fish over, and continue cooking for 4 minutes more. Sprinkle the almonds over the fish and return to the broiler until the almonds are crisp and the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and serve with the papaya sauce.
