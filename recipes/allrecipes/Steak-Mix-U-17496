Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced sirloin and salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder to taste. Stir and saute for 5 to 10 minutes, or until meat is well browned. Then add the onion and saute for 5 more minutes. Then stir in the chile peppers OR bell peppers, tomatoes, soup and milk. Mix this all together well, reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring often.
