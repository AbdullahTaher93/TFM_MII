Lay cucumber slices onto a large plate and sprinkle with salt on both sides. Set aside until water is drawn from the cucumber, about 15 minutes. Brush salt from cucumbers and press with paper towel to remove excess moisture. Combine cucumber slices, crab sticks, rice vinegar, and soy sauce in a glass dish bowl; toss to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or up to 24 hours). Divide cucumber salad onto 4 plates; sprinkle each portion with sesame seeds.
