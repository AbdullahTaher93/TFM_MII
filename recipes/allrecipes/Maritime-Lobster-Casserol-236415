Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add onion, celery, green pepper, and red pepper; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large pot over medium-low heat; whisk in flour and cook for 1 minute. Add milk; cook until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir vegetables and lobster into sauce; season with salt and pepper. Turn mixture into an 8x8-inch baking dish; sprinkle with bread crumbs, dot with butter pieces, and sprinkle with paprika. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 30 minutes.
