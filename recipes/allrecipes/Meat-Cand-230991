Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a large baking dish with aluminum foil. Stir cayenne pepper into brown sugar in a bowl. Wrap each smoked sausage in a piece of bacon; secure each with a toothpick. Arrange wrapped sausages into prepared baking dish. Pack brown sugar around wrapped sausages to cover by about 1/2 inch. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Increase oven heat to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Remove aluminum foil from pan. Continue baking in the hot oven until brown sugar has melted and thickened, 30 to 40 minutes.
