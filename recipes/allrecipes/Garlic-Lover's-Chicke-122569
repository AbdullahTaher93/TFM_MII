In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, salt if desired and pepper. Place milk in a shallow bowl. Dip chicken in milk, then shake in the crumb mixture. Place chicken in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Combine the butter, garlic and lemon juice; drizzle over the chicken. Sprinkle with paprika. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until the juices run clear.
