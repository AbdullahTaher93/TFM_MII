In a medium saucepan, bring water and brown rice to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 45 to 50 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium skillet over high heat, brown the ground beef and drain fat. Stir the mushroom soup, green onion, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce and pepper into the skillet with the beef. Simmer on medium low heat for 10 minutes. Serve over the rice.
