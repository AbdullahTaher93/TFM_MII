Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8-inch baking pan. In a bowl, mix together flour, cornmeal, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and sugar. In a separate bowl, stir together milk, eggs, and applesauce. Fold the wet mixture into the dry; mix together well. Then pour the combined mixture into baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and brown, about 15 to 20 minutes.
