Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a muffin pan with paper or foil muffin liners, or grease with vegetable oil spray. In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, rolled oats, sugar, baking powder and cinnamon. Add the milk, egg and oil, mix until well blended, then fold in fresh berries. Fill muffin cups 2/3 full. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until tops are golden brown and muffins spring back to the touch.
