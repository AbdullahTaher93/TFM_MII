Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange oysters on a baking dish. Measure 1 tablespoon lime juice into a bowl; reserve. Combine mushrooms, cilantro, olive oil, green onions, lime juice, lime zest, and garlic in a bowl. Place a spoonful of the mixture over each oyster. Add a drop of hot sauce to each oyster. Drizzle reserved lime juice on top. Bake in the preheated oven until warmed through, 10 to 15 minutes.
