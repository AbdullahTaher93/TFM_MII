Combine ground lamb, cooked rice, salt, garam masala, and ground black pepper in a bowl. Transfer mixture to a food processor and pulse until combined, 1 to 2 times. Stir dill into the mixture. Shape mixture into 10 meatballs about 2 inches in diameter. Beat egg in a small bowl. Pour flour onto a shallow dish. Dip meatballs in the beaten egg; dredge in flour. Heat oil in a large skillet. Cook meatballs until golden on all sides, about 10 minutes.
