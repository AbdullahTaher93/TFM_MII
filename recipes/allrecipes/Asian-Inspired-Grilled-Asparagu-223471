Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill asparagus on preheated grill until they turn bright green and have grill marks, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to baking dish. Whisk soy sauce and sesame oil together in a bowl; pour over cooked asparagus. Marinate in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
