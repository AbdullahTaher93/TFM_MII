Combine water, vinegar, sugar, and salt in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Add red bell peppers to the boiling water mixture, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until peppers are softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer red bell peppers and liquid to jars, cover with lids, and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
