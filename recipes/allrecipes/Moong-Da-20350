Rinse split peas; add to saucepan with 2 1/2 cups water. Allow split peas to soak for 30 minutes. Heat split peas and water, with salt, until boiling. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until tender and thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Add more water, if necessary, to prevent drying out. Stir in ginger, jalapeno pepper, tomato, lemon juice, and turmeric. Heat oil in a small saucepan and add cumin seed and red chile pepper. When pepper is heated, add Asafoetida powder and garlic. Stir mixture into split peas and add cilantro; mix well.
