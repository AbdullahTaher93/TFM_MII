Place the corn into a saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until the corn is fully cooked, about 2 minutes. Drain the corn in a colander set in the sink. Mix together the warm corn, black-eyed peas, ham, celery, and onion in a salad bowl. Whisk together the sour cream, ketchup, cilantro, Cajun seasoning, and hot pepper sauce in a bowl until smooth. Stir the dressing lightly into the black-eyed pea mixture until thoroughly mixed. Serve immediately.
