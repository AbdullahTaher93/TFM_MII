Grind cornmeal and pecans with salt and pepper in a food processor until nuts are finely ground. Transfer to a large shallow container. Dredge catfish in cornmeal mixture, patting it on to coat completely. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook 2 fish fillets until golden brown and firm to the touch, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate; sprinkle with salt, and cover to keep warm. Wipe skillet with a paper towel. Repeat with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and fish. Serve with lemon wedges, if desired.
