Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Mix flour, coconut flakes, vanilla extract, salt, and baking soda into creamed butter mixture until dough is smooth. Spoon dough onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
