In a large bowl, combine water, cracker crumbs and salt; add beef and mix well. Press into a 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan lined with waxed paper. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Cut the meat into 12 squares. Coat each square lightly with flour; brown in oil in a skillet, a few pieces at a time. Drain. Remove waxed paper from the baking pan; spread the soup in bottom of pan. Place meat squares in a single layer over soup. Bake, uncovered, at 300 degrees F for 35-40 minutes. To serve, spoon some soup over each meat square.
