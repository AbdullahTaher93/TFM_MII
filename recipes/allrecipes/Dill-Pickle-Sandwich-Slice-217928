Prepare stockpot/canner and jars as directed in step-by-step instructions Tie pickling spices in a square of cheesecloth, creating a spice bag. Combine vinegar, water, sugar, pickling salt and spice bag in a medium stainless steel saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar and salt. Reduce heat and boil gently for 15 minutes, until spices have infused the liquid. Place 1 bay leaf, 1 garlic clove, 1/2 tsp mustard seeds and 1 head of dill into each jar. Pack cucumber slices into hot jars, leaving 1/2 inch headspace. Add rounded 1/8 tsp Pickle Crisp(R) Granulates. Ladle hot pickling liquid into jars, leaving 1/2 inch headspace. Remove air bubbles; re-measure headspace. If needed, add more cucumbers to meet recommended headspace. Wipe rim; center lid on jar. Screw band until fingertip-tight. Process filled jars in boiling water for 15 minutes. Remove stockpot lid. Wait 5 minutes, then remove jars, cool and store.
