In a food processor, blender, or large bowl, mix eggs, milk, flour, sugar, vanilla, salt, and cinnamon until blended. If you're using a mixer, batter will be lumpy. Place butter in a 12-inch porcelain quiche dish or pie dish or a 9- by 13-inch baking dish. Place in the middle of a 425 degrees F oven until butter melts, 3 to 5 minutes. Add apple slices and return to oven until butter sizzles. Remove from oven and pour batter over top. Sprinkle with brown sugar. Bake for 20 minutes or until puffed and browned. Serve immediately.
