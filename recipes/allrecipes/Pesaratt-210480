Place the lentils and rice into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 4 hours to overnight. Blend the lentils, rice, green chile peppers, and ginger together into a smooth paste using a blender or food processor. Stir the cumin seed and salt into the paste. Prepare a flat griddle (tawa) or large, flat-bottomed skillet and place over medium-low heat. Ladle the lentil batter onto the middle of the heated surface and spread into a thin circle using the back of the ladle. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of onions and press the onions onto the pesarattu using your ladle or spatula. Cook for a few minutes and flip over to the other side. Cook a few more minutes, transfer to a plate and serve immediately. Dosas are best eaten hot and crispy right off the tawa.
