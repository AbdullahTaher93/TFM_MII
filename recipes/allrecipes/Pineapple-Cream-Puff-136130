Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Unfold pastry sheets on lightly floured surface. Cut each sheet into nine 3-inch rounds using cookie cutter or rim of a glass. Place on ungreased baking sheets. Bake 10 min.; cool completely. Beat cream cheese spread in small bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until creamy. Add whipped topping; beat 1 min. or just until blended. Gently stir in pineapple. Cut cream puffs horizontally in half. Spoon about 2 Tbsp. of the pineapple mixture onto bottom half of each cream puff; cover with tops. Serve immediately.
