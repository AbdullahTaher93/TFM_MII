In a 5-qt. slow cooker, combine water, sugar and juices; stir until sugar is dissolved. If desired, place cloves in a double thickness of cheesecloth; bring up corners of cloth and tie with string to form a bag. Add spice bag and red-hots to slow cooker. Cover and cook on low for 2-3 hours or until heated though. Before serving, discard spice bag and stir punch.
