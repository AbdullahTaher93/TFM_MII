Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and rinse under cold water to cool. Place pasta in a large bowl, and toss with the sesame oil, soy sauce, and cayenne pepper. Add the red bell pepper and cilantro and toss again until well mixed. Cover and refrigerate for one hour. Serve chilled.
