Coat an 8 inch square pan with cooking spray, or line with parchment paper. Place the chocolate and sweetened condensed milk into a large bowl. Heat in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until chocolate is almost melted. Stir to melt chocolate the rest of the way. Add the almonds, cranberries and orange zest; stir until evenly distributed. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and spread evenly. Let stand at room temperature or refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. Lift or tap the fudge out of the pan when cool. Cut into small squares. Store in a sealed container at room temperature for up to 3 weeks. These do not freeze well.
