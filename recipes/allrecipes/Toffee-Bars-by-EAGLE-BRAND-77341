Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease 13x9-inch baking pan. In large mixing bowl, combine 6 tablespoons margarine, oats, brown sugar, flour, walnuts and baking soda. Press firmly on bottom of pan. Bake 10 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Meanwhile, in medium saucepan, over medium heat, combine remaining 2 tablespoons margarine and sweetened condensed milk. Cook and stir until mixture thickens slightly, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in vanilla. Pour evenly over baked crust. Return to oven; bake 10 to 15 minutes longer or until golden brown. Remove from oven; immediately sprinkle with chocolate chips. Let stand 1 minute; spread chocolate chips while still warm. Garnish with additional walnuts (optional); press down firmly. Cool thoroughly. Cut into bars. Store tightly covered at room temperature.
