Lightly grease 18 muffin cups. Sift brown rice flour, tapioca starch, potato starch, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves in a bowl. Place quinoa, flax seeds, almonds, and sunflower seeds in a coffee grinder; process until mixture is finely ground. Add mixture to rice flour mixture. Beat eggs, yogurt, brown sugar, coconut oil, agave nectar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Stir rice flour mixture into egg mixture until batter is just blended. Fold zucchini, carrot, apple, and raisins into batter; divide evenly between prepared muffin cups. Let batter rest for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
