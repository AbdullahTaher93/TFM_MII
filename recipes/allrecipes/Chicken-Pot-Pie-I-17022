Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Steam carrots and broccoli in a covered pot for 3 minutes, until slightly tender but still firm. In a large bowl, mix together carrots, broccoli, chicken, soup, milk, cheese, and salt. Spoon mixture into pastry-lined 9 inch pie pan and cover with top crust. Seal edges and cut steam vents in top. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, until golden brown.
