In a shallow dish, stir together 1 tbsp. of the oil, 1 tbsp. of the lemon juice, and half the fresh or dried thyme. Turn turkey in lemon-thyme mixture to coat (reserve remaining mixture). Arrange turkey in a 9- by 13-in. baking pan. Bake in upper third of a 500 degrees F oven until meat in thickest part is no longer pink; cut to test (18 to 20 minutes). Halfway through cooking time, baste with remaining lemon-thyme mixture. Meanwhile, place potatoes in an oiled shallow 10- by 15-in. baking pan; brush with remaining oil and sprinkle with rosemary. Bake on next-to-lowest rack of a 500 degrees F oven until soft when pierced (20 minutes). Once turkey and potatoes are in the oven, bring 1 in. of water to a boil in a wide frying pan over high heat. Snap off and discard tough ends of asparagus; add asparagus to water and cook, uncovered, until just tender when pierced (3 to 5 minutes). Drain, immerse in ice water until cool, and drain again. Set aside. In a small bowl, mix mayonnaise, lemon peel, garlic, remaining lemon juice, and remaining fresh or dried thyme. Arrange turkey and potatoes on a platter alongside asparagus; offer aioli to spoon over foods.
