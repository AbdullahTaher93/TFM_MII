In a large saucepan, saute leeks, mushrooms, broccoli and garlic in butter until tender. Add flour, thyme, pepper and bay leaf; mix well. Stir in the broth and cream. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Add the cheese and crab; stir until cheese is melted and soup is heated through. Discard bay leaf before serving.
