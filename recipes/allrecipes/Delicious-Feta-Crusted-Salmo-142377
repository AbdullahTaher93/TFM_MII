Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and lightly oil. Place salmon onto foil and set aside. Mix together feta cheese, mayonnaise, cream cheese, Dijon mustard, balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder in a bowl until smooth. Spread mixture over salmon, then sprinkle panko over top, covering completely. Bake in preheated oven until easily flaked with a fork, about 35 to 45 minutes.
