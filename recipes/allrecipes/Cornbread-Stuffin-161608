Saute bacon with the butter in a skillet until crispy. Add onion and celery; cook for 5 to 7 minutes or until soft. Add herbs, salt and pepper. Transfer mixture to a large bowl; combine the onion mixture with the cornbread, corn, onions and pecans. Put the stuffing into a lightly buttered 2 quart baking dish. Pour chicken stock over the stuffing. Cover tightly with foil and bake in a 350 degree F oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Uncover and bake another 10 to 15 minutes until golden.
