Peel any wilted or dry leaves from the cabbage. Cut the top 1/3 from the cabbage. Carefully slice the bottom of the cabbage, just enough so it doesn't roll around. (If you accidentally cut it crooked don't worry. It will sit on a slight angle as creative flare.) Cut most of the middle of the cabbage by cutting a little chunk at a time until a bowl is formed, leaving a 1/2-inch border for the sides of the bowl.
