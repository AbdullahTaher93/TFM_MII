Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk eggs in a small bowl until smooth. Pour flour onto a shallow dish. Dip each cauliflower floret in beaten egg; coat with flour. Fry in hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Whisk mayonnaise and lemon juice together in a bowl to make sauce. Serve sauce alongside fried cauliflower.
