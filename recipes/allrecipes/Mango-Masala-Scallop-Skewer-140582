Soak skewers in white wine for 10 to 15 minutes. Trim white end of green onion to 3-inch lengths. Cut the remaining green part into thin slivers for garnish if desired. Thread onto a skewer in the following order: scallop-white part of green onion-mango, using 1 piece of each. Repeat 1 more time and then add 1 more scallop to secure the mango. Repeat with remaining skewers. Let sit for 10 to 20 minutes in refrigerator. Lightly brush skewers on each side with salad oil and season to taste with salt and pepper. Place on a preheated medium-high grill and cook until scallops are just cooked, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Garnish with green onion slivers and lime wedges.
