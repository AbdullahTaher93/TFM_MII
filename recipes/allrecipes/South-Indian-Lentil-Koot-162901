Bring the red lentils, pigeon peas, split yellow peas, and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the peas are tender, about 30 minutes. Add more water if needed to keep them from drying out. Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the mustard seeds, and cook until they begin to sputter and pop, about 2 minutes. Stir in the curry leaves until wilted, then add the carrot, and cook for 5 minutes. Add the zucchini, peas, turmeric, red pepper flakes, and salt. Cook and stir until the vegetables have softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the cooked peas and coconut to serve.
