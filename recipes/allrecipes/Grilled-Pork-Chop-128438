Sprinkle pork chops all over with Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt, paprika, and pepper. Cover and refrigerate at least 20 minutes or up to 2 hours. Coat a grill rack or broiler pan with nonstick spray. Preheat the grill or broiler. Cook 4 inches (11 cm) from the heat, turning once halfway through cooking time, 10 to 12 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted in the center of a chop registers 160 degrees F and juices run clear.
