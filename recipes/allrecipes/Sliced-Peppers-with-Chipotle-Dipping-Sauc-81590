To make the chipotle sauce, you can either mince the chilies (with a bit of the sauce from the can), stir it into the mayo and sour cream, or you can put all 3 ingredients in a food processor or blender. Taste before you add the salt, for it might not need it depending on your brand of Chipotle. If it is too spicy (wait for the heat, it is slow to arrive) then simply add more mayo or sour cream. If the heat is right but the sauce is too thick, then add a bit of water. Of course if you want more heat, then add more chipotle (only 0.5g net carbs/Tbsp). Set aside. Slice the peppers into about 12 strips each.
