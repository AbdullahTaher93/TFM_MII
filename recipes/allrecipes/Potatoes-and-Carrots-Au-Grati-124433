In a greased 2-qt. casserole, place potatoes, carrots, green pepper and onion. Combine half the cheese and remaining ingredients. Pour over vegetables; gently toss. Bake at 350 degrees F, covered, 35-40 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Top with remaining cheese; bake, uncovered, 10-15 minutes more.
