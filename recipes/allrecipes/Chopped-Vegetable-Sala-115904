Prepare an ice bath; set aside. Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add corn, and blanch until tender, about 6 minutes. With tongs, remove from water, and plunge immediately into ice bath. When corn is thoroughly cooled, remove from ice bath. Using a large knife, remove kernels from cobs. Transfer kernels to a large bowl. Add green and wax beans to boiling water. Blanch until tender, about 1 minute. With a slotted spoon, remove from water, and plunge immediately into ice bath. When beans are thoroughly cooled, drain in colander. Add green and wax beans, tomatoes, red and yellow peppers, onion, cucumber, cilantro, and jalapeno to corn. Stir to combine. Add olive oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine. Adjust for seasoning. Serve immediately.
