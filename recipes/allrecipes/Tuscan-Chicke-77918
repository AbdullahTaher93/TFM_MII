Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat a 9x13 inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Place the chicken breasts in the baking dish, and sprinkle olives over the top. Pour the beans over the chicken, then pour the spaghetti sauce over everything. Cover, and bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove the cover, and continue baking for 10 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink inside.
