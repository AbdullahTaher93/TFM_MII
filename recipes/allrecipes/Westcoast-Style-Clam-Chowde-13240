In medium skillet lightly fry bacon over medium heat; drain off fat and discard. Add onions to bacon and saute approximately 3 minutes. Do not brown. In a large stock pot add water and bring to boil. Once boiling add carrots, baby clams (including liquid), clam juice, potatoes, salt and pepper. Using a food processor or blender, puree tomatoes. Add to stock pot along with bacon-onion mixture and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes or until carrots and potatoes are tender. Do not overcook. Stir in celery and ketchup and cook for another 5 minutes. Slowly add milk, stirring constantly while bringing just to boiling. Finally, add instant potato flakes and cook for 3 minutes. Adjust seasoning to taste. If soup is not to your desired thickness add more instant potato flakes, about 2 tablespoons at a time. Remove soup from heat and let sit for about 15 minutes before serving.
