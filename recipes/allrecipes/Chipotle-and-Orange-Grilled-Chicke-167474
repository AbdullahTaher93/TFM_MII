Preheat grill or broiler. Whisk together orange-juice concentrate, chipotle pepper, vinegar, molasses and mustard in a small bowl. Lightly oil the grill or broiler rack (see Tip). Season chicken with salt and grill or broil for 2 minutes. Turn, brush with the glaze and cook for 4 minutes, brushing occasionally with glaze. Turn again, brush with the glaze, and cook until the center is no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes longer.
