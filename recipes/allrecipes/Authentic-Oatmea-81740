In a sauce pan, bring the milk just to the boil and add the oats and a dash of salt. Stir and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook (uncovered) for 20-25 minutes stirring occasionally. Taste for preferred level of crunchiness/softness. Remove from heat. Add your own choice of flavoring and sweetener. I like the cinnamon with vanilla as indicated above or cardamom with almond extract. Also consider maple flavoring with cinnamon.
