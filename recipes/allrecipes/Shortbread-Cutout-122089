In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar; gradually add flour. Divide dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each portion to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with 2-in. to 3-in. cookie cutters dipped in flour. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Sprinkle with colored sugar if desired. Bake at 300 degrees F for 20-25 minutes until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.
