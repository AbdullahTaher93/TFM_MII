Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Separate the crescent rolls into 8 triangles. Use as many as necessary to cover the bottom and sides of a 3qt casserole. Press edges together to seal. Combine the Jimmy Dean Skillets, two cheeses, pepper and lightly beaten eggs, making sure that the egg mixture coats the ingredients. Spoon into pan. Cut the remaining crescent rolls into cut strips and randomly layer over the top. Do not cover the entire top. Bake 1 hour at 350. If dough top and sides brown too quickly, cut heat back to 325 degrees F and bake until set. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
