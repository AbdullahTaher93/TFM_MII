Spray 13x9-inch baking pan with non-stick cooking spray. Cut French bread into 6 (1-1/2-in. thick) slices. Using small, sharp knife, cut 2-inch long slits in one side of each bread slice, cutting 3/4 of the way through bread to create a pocket. Spoon 2 heaping tablespoons chips into pocket of each bread slice; press to close. Place filled slices into prepared baking pan. Whisk together eggs, milk, cinnamon and vanilla in medium bowl. Pour egg mixture evenly over bread; carefully turn pieces over, spooning mixture in pan over top of bread. Cover pan with plastic wrap; refrigerate 2 hours or overnight. Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Bake, uncovered, 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Transfer toast to plates. Serve with maple syrup, if desired.
