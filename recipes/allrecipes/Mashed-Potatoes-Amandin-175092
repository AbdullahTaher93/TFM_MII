Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a shallow casserole dish. Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and transfer to a mixing bowl; mash. Beat the sour cream, cream cheese, green onion, salt, and pepper into the potatoes with an electric hand mixer; continue beating until smooth. Pour the mixture into the prepared dish, sprinkle the the almonds over the potatoes. Brush the top with the melted butter and cover with the bread crumbs. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 30 minutes.
