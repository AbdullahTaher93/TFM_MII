Light a grill. Skewer each onion slice with a toothpick. Thread the jalapenos on a skewer. Brush the onions and jalapenos with olive oil and grill over a hot fire until charred but still slightly crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove the toothpicks and skewer. Coarsely chop the onions. Peel and chop the jalapenos. In a medium saucepan, combine the cider vinegar with the light brown sugar, grainy and Dijon mustards, caraway seeds and turmeric and bring to a simmer. Add the onions and jalapenos and cook over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until the liquid is slightly reduced, about 12 minutes. Stir the cornstarch mixture, add it to the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Grill the sausages over a medium-high fire until golden and cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. Serve the sausages with the grilled-onion chowchow.
