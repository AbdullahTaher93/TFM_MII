Bring the roasted peppers, beer, and beef broth to a boil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook for 1 minute, then stir in the sliced bratwurst. Sprinkle the onion and jalapeno slices over the bratwursts, and simmer until the onion is tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the grape jelly, chili sauce, paprika, and black pepper. Cook about 10 minutes longer until the sauce thickens slightly.
