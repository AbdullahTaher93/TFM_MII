Prepare grill. Directions for Peppered Steak Fajitas: Stir together CRISCO(R) Oil, balsamic vinegar, salt and lime juice in shallow dish. Add steak and onion wedges; marinate at room temperature for 10 minutes, turning once. Remove steak from marinade; pat dry and rub with coarsely ground black pepper; sprinkle with salt to taste. Grill onions on medium-hot grill, turning occasionally, until tender, about 16 to 20 minutes. Add steak to grill after onions have been cooking for about 10 minutes. Cook 6 to 10 minutes total for medium-rare. Transfer to cutting board. Let stand 5 minutes before cutting across grain into thin slices. Place tortillas directly on grill rack, while steak is resting. Turn once, until puffed slightly and browned in spots, about 1 minute total. Tomato Lime Salsa: Place all the ingredients in a glass bowl and mix well. Let stand for 30 minutes. Taste and adjust salt and pepper. Refrigerate until needed. Serve at room temperature, using slotted spoon to drain excess liquid. Salsa can be made ahead, covered and refrigerated for up to 1 day. Serve steak, onions, salsa and sour cream wrapped in tortillas. Garnish with lime wedges.
