Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Mix nuts, cilantro, garlic, oil and lime peel until well blended; set aside. Place fish on lightly greased baking sheet. Drizzle with lime juice. Top evenly with the nut mixture; press lightly into fish to secure. Bake 10 to 12 min. or until fish flakes easily with fork. Meanwhile, cook rice and broccoli as directed on packages. Serve with the fish.
