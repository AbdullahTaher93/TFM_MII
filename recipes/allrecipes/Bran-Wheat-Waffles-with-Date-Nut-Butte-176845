In a large bowl, stir together all-purpose flour and whole-wheat flour, bran, baking powder, and salt. In a medium bowl, lightly beat egg yolks and sugar; stir in milk and butter. Stir yolk mixture into flour mixture just until moistened; do not beat. In a small bowl, beat egg whites just until stiff, moist peaks form; fold gently into batter. Bake waffles in a preheated waffle iron according to manufacturers directions. Meanwhile, if making date-nut butter, in a small bowl, beat butter, powdered sugar, dates, and pecans together until fluffy. Serve waffles hot with prepared butter, if desired, or cool on wire racks, package airtight, and freeze. To serve, heat waffles, unthawed, in toaster or toaster oven until crisp and hot.
