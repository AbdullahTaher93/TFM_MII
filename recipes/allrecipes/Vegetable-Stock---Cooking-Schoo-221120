Heat oil in large stockpot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir carrots, celery, onion, green onion, and garlic in the hot oil until browned, cooking in batches if necessary, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour water over onion mixture and stir in parsley, thyme, and bay leaves. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the stock is flavorful, about 40 minutes. Remove stock from heat and strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean container. Allow to cool to room temperature before refrigerating or freezing.
