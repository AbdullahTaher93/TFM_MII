Spread caramel mixture over dough to within 1/2 in. of edges. Roll up tightly, jelly-roll style, starting with a long side. Wrap each roll in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 4 hours or until firm. Unwrap and cut into 1/4-in. slices. Place 1 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks to cool.
