Place the flour in a resealable plastic bag. Add the beef, a few pieces at at a time, and shake the bag to coat. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the beef, cooking until browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the browned beef to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Place the beef, potatoes, carrots, onions, and thyme into a slow cooker, and pour the stout beer on top. Cover and cook on Low until the meat is very tender, about 8 hours. Season with salt, then remove thyme. Garnish with parsley before serving.
