Heat skillet to medium (hot enough to get a sizzle from the meat), and brown ground chuck and Italian sausage (remove casing if necessary) in a skillet. Drain fat, and put into a large stockpot. On medium heat, add water, both cans tomato juice and Hormel(R) Chili No Beans. Stir in Wick Fowlers Chili mix, chili powder, Lindeman's Peche Lambic beer and masa. Squeeze in the juice of 2 large limes. Finely chop and add large onion. Add salt to taste. Continue simmering on a medium heat for approximately 1 hour. The longer the chili simmers, the 'hotter' it gets. Serve in a soup bowl with shredded cheddar cheese and tortilla chips on the top.
