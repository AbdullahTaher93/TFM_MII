Place the garlic, green bell peppers, red bell peppers, green chile peppers, and onions into a food processor, and process to a coarse puree. Spoon the sofrito into ice cube trays and freeze. Once the cubes are solidly frozen, transfer them to a resealable freezer bag. Keep frozen for use as needed.
