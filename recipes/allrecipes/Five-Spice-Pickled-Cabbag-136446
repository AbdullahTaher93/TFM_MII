Place mushrooms in a small bowl and cover with very hot water. Let soak until soft, about 15 minutes. Remove from water and thinly slice. Drain cabbage, squeeze dry, and slice into 1/4 -inch pieces. Slice pork into 1/8-inch-by-1-inch strips and combine in a small bowl with cornstarch and rice wine. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok over high heat. Add pork and stir-fry until it is cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from wok and set aside. Heat remaining oil in the wok over medium-high heat. Add 1/4 teaspoon chile peppers and soy beans and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add mushrooms, cabbage, bean cake, and pork and stir-fry until heated through, about 2 minutes. Stir in sugar and remaining chile peppers. Serve immediately.
