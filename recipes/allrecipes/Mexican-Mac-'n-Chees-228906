Cook and drain pasta as directed on package. Meanwhile, in 10-inch nonstick skillet, heat both boxes frozen vegetables and both cans enchilada sauce to simmering over medium heat, cooking until vegetables are heated through. Remove from heat. Immediately stir in sour cream, cheese and cooked pasta. Sauce will thicken as it cools. Top with crushed taco shells.
