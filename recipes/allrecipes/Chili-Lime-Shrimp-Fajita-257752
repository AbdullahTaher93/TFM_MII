Whisk olive oil, 1/4 cup cilantro, chili powder, garlic, lime juice, and salt together in a bowl; add shrimp, toss to coat, and marinate in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; spray with cooking spray. Add onion, green bell pepper, and serrano chile pepper; saute until tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer vegetables to a bowl and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Pour shrimp and marinade into the same skillet over medium-high heat; cook until shrimp are pink and opaque, about 2 minutes per side. Stir vegetables into shrimp mixture; cook and stir until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Spoon shrimp-vegetable mixture onto tortillas and top each with Cheddar cheese, lettuce, sour cream, tomatoes, and remaining 1/4 cup cilantro.
