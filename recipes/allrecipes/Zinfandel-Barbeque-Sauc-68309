Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat, and cook and stir the green onions about 5 minutes, until tender. Pour in the wine, and cook until reduced by about 1/2. Mix the ketchup, soy sauce, mustard, and brown sugar into the saucepan with the wine. Reduce heat, and simmer 30 minutes, until thickened and well blended. Remove from heat, and mix in the parsley. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
