Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Rinse the sweet potato fries with cold water and drain. Spread onto a baking sheet. Stir the cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, coriander, and brown sugar together in a bowl; sprinkle over the fries. Drizzle the olive oil over the fries. Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to serve.
