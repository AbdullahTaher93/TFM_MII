Cook the pasta according to package directions. Drain and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. While the pasta is cooking, heat the oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over low heat. Add the garlic and cook until golden, about 1 minute. Add the sausage and cook, stirring frequently, until fully cooked, about 5 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and basil pesto to the saucepan and stir until well combined. Raise the heat and bring to a simmer. Simmer, uncovered, until the sauce thickens, 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir the cooked pasta, beans, mozzarella cheese, and half the parmesan cheese into the sauce. Place the pasta mixture in a 9 x 13-inch baking pan and sprinkle the top with the remaining parmesan cheese. Bake until bubbly, about 20 minutes. Add *optional topping, as desired.
