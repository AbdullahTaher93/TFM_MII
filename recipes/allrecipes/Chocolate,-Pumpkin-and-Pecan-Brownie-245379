Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment. In a medium-sized pan, heat the butter and sugar until just hot. Remove from heat then add 1/2 cup of the chocolate chips and stir until it has all melted. Allow to cool for 5 minutes, then beat eggs into the mixture in the pan one at a time. Add the flour and cocoa and beat well together. Stir in the rest of the chocolate chips and 1/2 of the pecans. Pour the brownie mix into prepared baking sheet. Pumpkin Mixture: Beat all the mixture ingredients together well in a bowl using a hand whisk or wooden spoon, then pour over the top of the brownies. Roughly swirl/fold the pumpkin mixture into the brownie mix. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup pecans on top. Bake 40 minutes, or until a crust has formed on the top. Allow to cool, then transfer to a wire rack. Cut into cubes and enjoy.
