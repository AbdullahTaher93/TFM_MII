Prepare Special Slaw. In a large bowl, mix together yogurt, mayonnaise, pickle relish, cocktail sauce, and mustard until well blended. Stir in coleslaw mix, bell pepper, and green onions. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside. Preheat barbecue grill. To make burgers, tear bread slice into pieces and place in a food processor or blender. Whirl until crumbs form; set aside. In a large bowl, beat together egg, milk, minced onion, garlic, salt, and pepper. Add beef and bread crumbs and mix gently. Form into 6 equal patties, each about 4 1/2 inches wide. Brush red onion slices lightly on both sides with olive oil. Lay patties and onion slices on grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning meat and onions once to brown on both sides, until a thermometer inserted in center of thickest part of meat registers 160 degrees F (and meat is no longer pink in center), 6 to 8 minutes total. About 2 minutes before patties are done, top each with a slice of cheese. Also lay bun halves, cut side down, on grill and toast 1 to 2 minutes. Set bun bottoms on a platter or plates. With a wide spatula, transfer patties to bun bottoms. Top each with a grilled onion slice and a spoonful of Special Slaw. Cover with bun tops.
