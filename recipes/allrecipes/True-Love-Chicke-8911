Preheat oven to 180 degrees F (81 degrees C). Peel the garlic and crush to release juices. In a large skillet, sear the chicken in 1 tablespoon olive oil and white wine. Place all of the garlic in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish and place chicken on top. Sprinkle a dash of ground black pepper over the top. Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, until the juices run clear. In a medium skillet saute the onion in 1 teaspoon of olive oil and butter/margarine, until it is soft and golden. Add the tomatoes and your favorite fresh herbs to taste. Stir together and remove from heat. To Make Pasta: Cook pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water about 8 to 10 minutes, until it is al dente. Drain and place pasta on a long, very shallow serving dish. Pour tomato sauce over it, then place baked garlic chicken pieces on top with some or all of the garlic. Serve.
