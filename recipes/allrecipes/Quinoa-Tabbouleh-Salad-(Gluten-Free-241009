Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let quinoa rest, covered, for 5 minutes. Uncover the saucepan and cool to room temperature. Stir quinoa, carrots, currants, mint, parsley, and green onions together in a bowl. Combine olive oil, lime juice, agave nectar, cumin, and salt in a jar; seal the jar with a lid and shake vigorously until dressing is well-blended. Pour dressing over quinoa mixture and toss to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until flavors blend, at least 30 minutes.
