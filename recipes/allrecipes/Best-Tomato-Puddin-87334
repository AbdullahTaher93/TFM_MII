In a saucepan over medium heat, stir together the water and tomato puree. Mix in the brown sugar, basil and salt, and bring to a boil. Simmer over low heat for 5 minutes, then set aside. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat a 2 quart casserole dish with cooking spray. Place the bread cubes into the dish, and drizzle with melted butter. Pour the tomato sauce over all. Cover with a lid or aluminum foil. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven. Remove the lid for the last 10 minutes.
