Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add wheat berries, lower heat to medium-low, and cook until wheat berries are tender and water is absorbed, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat; saute garlic until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add olives; cook and stir for 10 minutes. Add wheat berries to olive mixture. Cook and stir wheat berries-olive mixture until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt.
