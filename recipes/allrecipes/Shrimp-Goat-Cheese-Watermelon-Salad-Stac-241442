Preheat oven to 430 degrees F (220 degrees C). Season shrimp all over with onion powder, garlic powder, salt, smoked paprika, and chipotle pepper powder. Set shrimp into a baking dish. Bake shrimp in the preheated oven until bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 8 minutes. Use a ring mold (slightly larger in diameter than the diameter of the goat cheese slices) to cut watermelon into circle shapes. Cut circle shapes into twelve 1/4-inch thick slices. Place a slice of watermelon on a plate. Top with 1 slice cheese, 1 slice watermelon, 1 slice cheese, 1 slice watermelon, 2 shrimp, respectively, to form a salad stack. Repeat with remaining watermelon slices, cheese, and shrimp. Drizzle balsamic vinegar over each stack and garnish with basil.
