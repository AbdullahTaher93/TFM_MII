In an electric mixer with a dough hook, add flour, olive oil, kosher salt, and black pepper. Turn on mixer to medium speed. Stir yeast into warm water. Pour into flour mixture and mix until dough looks smooth. Remove dough from mixer and place on floured surface. Gently knead for 1 minute. Add finely chopped fresh herbs or chiles, if desired. Cut dough into four equal parts. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap; refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Unwrap dough and place on well-floured surface. Dust dough with flour and flatten dough with hands. Let dough rest for about 10 minutes then stretch (as if it were pizza dough) pulling the dough out. Shape into rectangles then brush with olive oil; season with salt and pepper. On a medium hot grill, cook bread for 3 to 4 minutes per side. For citrus flavor, squeeze freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice over dough while it's grilling. Serve immediately.
