Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. In a large mixing bowl, sift together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Use a fork to blend in peanut butter and oil. Add egg and milk; mix well. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.
