In a medium bowl, beat together egg, beer, flour, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Place cod in the bowl, and thoroughly coat with the mixture. In a separate medium bowl, mix the cornflake crumbs and Cajun seasoning. Dip the cod in the crumb mixture, and thoroughly coat all sides. In a large, heavy skillet or deep fryer, heat the oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Fry the fish until golden brown, and flesh is easily flaked with a fork.
