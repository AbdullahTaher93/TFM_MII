Add shallots; saute until tender, about 1 minute. Add garlic; saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add quinoa; cook and stir until toasted, about 2 minutes. Mix vegetable stock, thyme, and salt into quinoa mixture; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until liquid is absorbed and quinoa is tender, about 12 minutes.
