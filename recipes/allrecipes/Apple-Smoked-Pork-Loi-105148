At least 1 hour before cooking, soak wood chips or chunks in enough water to cover. Meanwhile, trim fat from roast. Place roast in a shallow dish. In a small bowl stir together the dried oregano, salt, pepper, and garlic. Sprinkle evenly over all sides of roast; rub in with your fingers. Drain wood chips. For a charcoal grill, arrange medium-hot coals around a drip pan. Test for medium heat above the pan. Sprinkle half of the drained wood chips over the coals. Place roast on grill rack directly over drip pan. Cover and grill for 1 to 1 1/4 hours or until internal temperature registers 155 degrees FF on an instant-read thermometer. Add more coals and wood chips as needed during grilling. (For a gas grill, preheat grill. Reduce heat to medium. Adjust for indirect cooking. Grill as above.) Remove roast from grill. Cover roast with foil; let stand for 15 minutes before slicing. To serve, slice pork. If desired, garnish with apple slices and oregano sprigs.
