Place fish in resealable plastic bag. Add marinade; seal bag. Turn bag over several times to evenly coat fish with marinade. Refrigerate 30 min. to marinate. Meanwhile, combine nuts, cilantro, garlic and oil. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Remove fish from marinade; discard bag and marinade. Place fish on lightly greased baking sheet. Top evenly with nut mixture; press lightly into fish to secure. Bake 10 to 12 min. or until fish flakes easily with fork.
