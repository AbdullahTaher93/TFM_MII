Stir together Dijon, horseradish, basil, thyme, tarragon, and pepper. Spread mixture evenly over top and sides of the steaks. Wrap individually with plastic wrap, and allow to marinate in the refrigerator overnight. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a small, glass baking dish with cooking spray. Unwrap steaks and sprinkle with salt to taste. Place into baking dish, and roast in preheated oven to desired degree of doneness (30 minutes for medium-rare, 60 minutes for well done).
