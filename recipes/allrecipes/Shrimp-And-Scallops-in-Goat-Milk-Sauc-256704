Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain. Keep warm. Heat olive oil and non-dairy butter in saucepan over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and scallops; cook until heated through, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook 30 seconds. Stir in white wine, goat milk, and lemon juice. Cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Add cilantro, oregano, lemon pepper, and seasoned salt. Stir celery and mixed vegetables into shrimp mixture; cook another 3 or 4 minutes. Serve over hot penne pasta.
