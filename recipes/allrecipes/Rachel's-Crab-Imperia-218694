Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x9-inch baking dish. Melt the margarine in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the flour, and cook a few minutes until the bubbles begin to subside. Whisk in the milk, and cook over medium-high heat until thickened. Stir in the crabmeat, Worcestershire sauce, green pepper, and beaten egg. Season to taste with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Cook, stirring constantly until quite thick. Spoon into the prepared baking dish. Place the breadcrumbs into a mixing bowl, and drizzle with the melted butter. Toss together until the breadcrumbs are evenly moistened with butter. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs evenly over the crab mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until the casserole has firmed and the bread crumbs are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
