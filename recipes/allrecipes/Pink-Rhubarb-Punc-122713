In a large saucepan, bring rhubarb and water to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer for 10 minutes. Drain, reserving liquid (save rhubarb for another use). In a large bowl, combine sugar, gelatin and boiling water until dissolved. Add pineapple and lemon juices; mix well. Stir in rhubarb liquid; refrigerate. Just before serving, pour into a punch bowl and add ginger ale.
