Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Coat an 8-inch square baking dish with cooking spray; set aside. Whisk together SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, flour, cinnamon, apple juice, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a medium bowl; set aside. Melt butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat; add apples and cook, stirring often, until softened, 8 minutes. Stir in apple juice mixture and bring to a boil; stir in raisins, if desired. Spoon apple mixture into prepared baking dish. Topping Instructions: Combine flour, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in the bowl of a food processor; add butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl; stir in the sour cream, milk, and vanilla. Drop dough by spoonfuls onto the apple mixture; bake 25 minutes or until topping is lightly browned. Serve warm.
