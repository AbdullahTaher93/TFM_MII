Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Melt butter in a pot over medium heat. Cut each bread slice into 16 cubes; add bread cubes and garlic powder to melted butter. Stir to coat. Transfer coated bread cubes to the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until crispy, 8 to 10 minutes.
