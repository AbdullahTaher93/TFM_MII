Arrange sole in a fairly even layer in a shallow 8- by 12-inch casserole; fold small fillets in half or overlap larger ones. (Use recommended casserole size; larger dish may cause sauce to dry out.) In a 1- to 2-quart pan, mix cornstarch with water until smooth. Add cream, pesto, and lemon peel. Stir on high heat until sauce thickens, but do not boil; sauce will be thick. Immediately stir in lemon juice and spread evenly over fish. Break teleme cheese into small lumps and scatter evenly over fish (or sprinkle with shredded jack cheese). Bake in a 400 degrees F oven, gently jiggling casserole every few minutes to help blend sauce, until fish no longer looks wet in center of thickest part (cut to test) and sauce bubbles, 15 to 20 minutes. Before serving, lightly dust with paprika. Lift out portions with a wide spatula and spoon sauce over fish.
