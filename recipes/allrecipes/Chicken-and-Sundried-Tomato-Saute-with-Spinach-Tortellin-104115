In small bowl, combine garlic and reserved tomato oil. Brush chicken with half of oil mixture, then season with 1/2 teaspoon Morton Lite Salt(R) Mixture and pepper. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour to marinate. In a large skillet, heat remaining garlic/oil mixture and add shallots. Saute over medium heat until shallots are soft and translucent; add chicken. Stir and cook until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear. Add mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, vermouth and remaining 1 teaspoon Morton Lite Salt(R) Mixture. Saute chicken/vegetable mixture until mushrooms are crisp-tender, about 2 to 3 minutes. Prepare tortellini according to package directions; substituting Morton Lite Salt(R) Mixture for salt. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking liquid and drain. Gently toss tortellini and reserved cooking liquid with chicken mixture. Serve immediately with Parmesan cheese, if desired.
