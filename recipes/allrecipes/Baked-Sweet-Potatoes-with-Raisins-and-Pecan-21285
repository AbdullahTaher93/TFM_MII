Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread sweet potatoes in a single layer in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle with raisins and chopped pecans. In a small bowl, mix the butter, syrup and water. Pour the mixture over potatoes. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven 50 to 60 minutes, until sweet potatoes are tender.
