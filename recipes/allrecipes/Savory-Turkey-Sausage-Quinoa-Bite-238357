Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly spray a mini-muffin pan with cooking spray. Mix turkey sausage, garlic, and sage in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned, about 6 minutes. Drain. Mix browned sausage mixture, quinoa, Cheddar cheese, Parmesan cheese, green onions, eggs, flour, and black pepper together in a medium bowl until well-blended. Spoon mixture into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
