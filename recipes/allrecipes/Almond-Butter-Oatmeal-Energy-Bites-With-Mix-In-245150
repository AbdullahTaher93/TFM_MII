Microwave almond butter in a microwave-safe bowl until softened, about 45 seconds. Stir the softened almond butter until smooth; add honey and mix until smooth and creamy. Stir oats, quinoa flakes, cocoa powder, and salt into butter mixture. Stir coconut, ground flax seeds, hemp seeds, walnuts, and cranberries into oat mixture. Knead dough by hand until well blended. Shape small, bite-sized squares out of the dough, about 2 teaspoonfuls each, and place on a serving dish. Refrigerate until serving.
