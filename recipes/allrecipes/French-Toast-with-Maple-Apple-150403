In a shallow glass dish, beat the eggs with the skim milk, vanilla and nutmeg. Add the bread, turn to coat and let soak for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter. Add the apples and 2 tablespoons of the maple syrup and cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until softened and lightly caramelized, about 8 minutes. Add the cinnamon and the remaining 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons of maple syrup and simmer for 1 minute; keep warm. Heat a large nonstick skillet over moderately high heat. Add 1/2 tablespoon of butter and 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil and cook half of the bread until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining butter, oil and bread. Halve the slices of French toast on the diagonal and stack on plates. Top with the apples and serve.
