Place the rye berries and 2 cups water in a pot, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 2 hours, or until tender. Place cannellini beans in a pot with enough water to cover, bring to a boil, and cook 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Let stand 1 hour, until tender; drain. In a large pot, mix the cooked rye, beans, cabbage, onion, celery, beets, carrot, potato, garlic and tomatoes. Pour in the water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook 30 minutes, or until all vegetables are tender. Stir in lemon juice and honey, and season with salt and pepper during the cook time.
