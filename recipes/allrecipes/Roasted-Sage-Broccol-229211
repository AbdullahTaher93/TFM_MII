Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spread broccoli in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle onion and sage leaves over broccoli; drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle salt, garlic salt, and black pepper over broccoli mixture; toss to coat. Roast in the preheated oven until broccoli is browned and crisp, 20 to 30 minutes.
