In a heavy pot, heat oil over medium heat. Saute onions in oil until tender. Add paprika, textured vegetable protein, and green pepper; cook and stir mixture until vegetables are coated with paprika. Stir in broth or water, potatoes, carrots, tomato, 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper, and parsley. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until carrots and potatoes are almost tender. Add more water if needed. In a small bowl, mix together, egg, flour, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Mix in enough water to have a smooth consistency; dough should be stiff and sticky. Spoon onto a flat plate, and slice off small amounts into soup while it is simmering. Add to soup in such a way that noodles do not land in the same spot every time. Continue until all mixture has been added to pot. Simmer until done.
