Rinse wakame, place in a bowl, and cover with water. Let soak until soft, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain and squeeze dry; slice into thin strips. Whisk rice vinegar, green onions, soy sauce, sesame oil, chili sauce, garlic, ginger, and stevia powder in a serving bowl. Add wakame strips; toss until coated. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top.
