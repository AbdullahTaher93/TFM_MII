Spread out meat, and season with salt and pepper. Spread one layer of mustard over the meat, and one layer of chopped onion. Roll meat up in a cabbage leaf. Use thread or a toothpick to hold the roll together. Melt butter or margarine in a medium size saucepan, fry cabbage rolls over a medium heat until brown. Add 2 cups water, and let simmer for 35 to 40 minutes.
