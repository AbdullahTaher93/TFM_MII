Boil water in a 3 quart sauce pan to soak the chilies. Blister the chilies on a dry Comal or cast-iron frying pan over medium heat. Place the chilies in a medium mixing bowl, pour the boiling water over and soak for 20 minutes. Remove chilies from water and use a blender with a little of the chili water, as needed, to puree. Press the blended mixture through a food mill or sieve to remove skins and set mixture aside. Heat the chicken stock in a heavy 4 quart pot. Poach the chicken in the stock over low heat for 35 to 45 minutes. Reserve the stock and set chicken aside on a plate. Roast tomatoes in a pan over medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove tomatoes from pan to drain. Roast onions and garlic in same pan. Blend tomatoes, fried plantains, raisins, garlic, bread, cinnamon, peppercorns, allspice, salt and 2 cups of the reserved stock until pureed and smooth, place in bowl and set aside. Puree pineapple and apple together and set aside. Heat the sunflower oil until smoking in a heavy 6 quart stockpot and pan fry the chili mixture. Stirring constantly for 10-15 minutes add the blended tomato mixture and continue to cook and stir for about 10 minutes, add the SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and keep frying 15 more minutes(thin with stock as needed). Stir in the pineapple and apple puree. Continue cooking until the mole is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Place chicken in a wide bowl and ladle the mole over it.
