Combine white vinegar and olive oil in a pot; bring to a boil. Add carrots; simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in jalapenos, garlic, peppercorns, coriander, salt, mustard seeds, and thyme; simmer until jalapenos soften, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour the jalapeno mixture into 2 jars, making sure that the jalapenos are fully submerged in the vinegar mixture. Cool for about 1 hour; cover and refrigerate.
