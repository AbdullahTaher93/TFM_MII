Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease 8 muffin cups. In a large bowl, mix together whole wheat flour, soy flour, rye flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Work in oil with fingers, pastry blender or a fork. Add egg, buttermilk and molasses; stir well. Scoop into prepared muffin cups. Bake in preheated oven for 17 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
