Evenly cut top 1/2 inch off oranges; reserve tops. Using a knife with a curved serrated blade, cut around flesh of each orange to free it from peel, leaving shell. Cut removed orange into 1/2-inch chunks; discard seeds, if any. Peel banana and slice thinly. Place an eighth of the slices in bottom of each shell; top with an eighth of the orange chunks. Repeat banana and orange layers. Garnish with coconut. Set each orange on a dessert plate with top of orange alongside. Garnish with mint, if desired.
