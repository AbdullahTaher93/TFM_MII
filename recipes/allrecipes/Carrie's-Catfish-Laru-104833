Place 1 tablespoon of oil in a heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat. Saute onion, green pepper, and carrot until golden brown; remove from the pan. Using the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, sear all of the fillets on both sides. Lay all of the fillets into the skillet, sprinkle with salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, and garlic powder. Top with the sauteed vegetables, and pour on the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and white wine. Bring to a simmer, and cook gently until the sauce has thickened slightly, and fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes.
