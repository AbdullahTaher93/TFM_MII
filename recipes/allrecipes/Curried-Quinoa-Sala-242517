Bring vegetable broth, quinoa, and salt to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until liquid has absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and let stand, covered, for 10 minutes; uncover and fluff quinoa with fork. Whisk yogurt, canola oil, rice wine vinegar, honey, and curry powder together in a bowl until combined; pour over quinoa and toss until coated. Transfer dressed quinoa to a serving dish and top with cucumbers, mangos, cranberries, mint, and almonds; season with salt and pepper.
