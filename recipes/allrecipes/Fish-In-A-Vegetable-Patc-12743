In a small sauce pan, combine the tomato sauce, celery, green pepper, onion, carrots, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce and salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 5 minutes. Spoon vegetable mixture into a shallow 1 1/2 quart baking dish. Place fish filets over vegetables and spoon some of the sauce over the fish. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for about 15 minutes or until fish flakes with a fork. Garnish with lemon twists and chopped celery.
