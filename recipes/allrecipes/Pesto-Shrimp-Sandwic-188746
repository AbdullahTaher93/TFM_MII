Preheat an oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Cut the baguette in 4 equal pieces, and place in the oven to warm. Mix the cooked shrimp and pesto sauce together in a bowl. To assemble the sandwiches, cut each piece of warmed bread in half and spread the cut sides with butter. Fill each sandwich with one lettuce leaf and equal amounts shrimp and pesto to serve.
