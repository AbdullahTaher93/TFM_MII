Place the potatoes in a saucepan and cover with cold water (optional: for added flavor, swap out part of water with broth, or add a spoonful of bouillon concentrated paste, such as Better Than Bouillon(R)). Add salt, bring to a boil, and cook just until the potatoes fall off a fork when pierced, about 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes, and press through a potato ricer into a large bowl. Mix in the butter, yogurt (optional), warmed LACTAID(R) milk and chives to blend. Add a tablespoon or 2 extra LACTAID if necessary to obtain desired consistency. Salt and pepper to taste. Add suggested topping if desired (see footnotes).
