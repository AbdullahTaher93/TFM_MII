Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In large skillet, in 1 tablespoon butter, cook bell peppers, mushrooms and onions until tender. Meanwhile, in bowl, whisk together eggs and milk. In remaining butter, cook eggs until soft set. Add vegetables and stir to combine. Spoon egg mixture down the center of each tortilla. Roll up. Place tortillas seam-side down in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover tortillas with chili and sprinkle with cheese. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until hot and bubbly. If desired, serve with salsa, sour cream, guacamole and green onions.
