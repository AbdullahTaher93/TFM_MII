In a fondue pot or double broiler over medium heat, melt the butter. Stir in the garlic and onion. Slowly cook and stir until the vegetables are soft. Mix in the tomatoes and cook another 3 minutes. Pour in the wine. Continue stirring until the wine reaches a near boil. Remove from the heat and stir in Gruyere and Swiss cheeses until melted.
