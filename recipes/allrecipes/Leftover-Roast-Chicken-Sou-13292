In a large stock pot place chicken frame, bones, giblets etc. Add enough water to cover chicken frame and gently simmer for 90 minutes, covered. Remove all bones and chicken frame, but leave any chicken pieces in the soup. Add peppercorns, bay leaves, carrots, onions, green beans and potatoes. Add enough water to ensure that all the vegetables are covered. Cover and simmer gently until the vegetables are soft. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.
