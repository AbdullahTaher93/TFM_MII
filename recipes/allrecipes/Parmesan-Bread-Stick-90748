Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Separate 1 can (11 oz.) refrigerated soft bread-stick dough into individual portions; cut each portion in half to make 16 pieces. Form pieces into bread-stick shape and place on ungreased baking sheet. Brush bread sticks with melted butter and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese. Press the ends of each piece into place gently on the baking sheet to keep them from shrinking as they bake. Bake for 14 to 18 minutes or until the bread sticks are golden brown.
