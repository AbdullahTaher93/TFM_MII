Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place tortillas on a baking sheet and spread 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese on each. Bake tortillas in the preheated oven until cheese has melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken, spinach, and tomatoes; cook and stir until spinach has wilted, about 5 minutes. Divide chicken mixture evenly over each tortilla; fold in half. Coat the same skillet with a thin layer of oil; heat over medium heat. Cook folded tortillas in batches until browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side.
