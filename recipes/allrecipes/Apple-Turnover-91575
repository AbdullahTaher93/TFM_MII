Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Peel and core apple and cut into small dice; you should have about 1 cup. Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the apples and cook, stirring, until they are almost tender, about 7 minutes. Add the cider, sugar, raisins, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon; simmer until all of the cider has evaporated. Trim the crusts off the bread so that the bread is an exact square. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Roll out the bread with a rolling pin until it is flattened to about 1/16-inch thick. Divide apple mixture to the left of center on the bread slices; moisten the edge of each bread slice. Fold the larger side of the bread slice over the apple mixture to form a triangle and press the sides together firmly. Brush the outside of each turnover with some of the remaining butter. Transfer to a baking sheet and bake until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon over tarts.
