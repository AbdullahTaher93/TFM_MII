In a small bowl, mix hoisin sauce, sherry, soy sauce, green onions, garlic and ginger. Place steak pieces in a large, resealable plastic bag. Pour in marinade and mix well. Refrigerate for 2 hours, or overnight. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Thread beef, peppers and onions onto skewers, alternating beef with every 2 pieces of vegetable. Place kabobs on hot grill. Cover and cook, turning once until grill marks form on both sides, about 8-10 minutes. Serve.
