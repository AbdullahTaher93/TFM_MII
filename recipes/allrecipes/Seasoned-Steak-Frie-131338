Preheat oven to 450 degrees . Peel potatoes, then cut into steak-fry-size pieces. In a medium mixing bowl, toss the potatoes with oil and seasoning. Place in single layer on a medium baking sheet so they don't touch. Bake 22 to 25 minutes, rotating them about halfway through, until outsides are slightly crisp and insides are tender.
