Combine the cheese and butter in a small bowl and use a fork to work the mixture until blended and smooth. Stir in the chopped fruit. Toast the bread and transfer to a wire rack. (This will prevent the toast from steaming and becoming soggy.) Spread equal amounts of the cheese mixture over the toast while it is still warm. Cut into halves before serving.
