Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Line 15x10-inch pan with sides or large cookie sheet with parchment paper. Unroll dough on cutting board into 2 long rectangles; press each into 12x3 1/2-inch rectangle, firmly pressing perforations to seal. Spread raspberry filling on 1 dough rectangle to within 1/2 inch of all edges. Sprinkle evenly with chopped almonds. Place second dough rectangle over almonds; gently press top and long edges to seal. Cut crosswise into 8 strips. Twist each strip twice; place 2 inches apart in paper-lined pan. Bake at 375 degrees F for 11 to 13 minutes or until deep golden brown. Remove twists from pan; place on wire rack. Cool 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in small bowl, blend powdered sugar, almond extract and enough water for desired spreading consistency until smooth. Spread glaze over cooled twists. If desired, sprinkle with additional sliced almonds.
