Rinse rib racks, pat dry, and cut into 4 or 5bone sections. Put ribs in a large bowl or bowls and pour in cola to cover meat, reserving 1/2 cup to use later. Cover and chill at least 2 hours or up to 24, turning ribs halfway through marinating time. Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for indirect heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is balanced on the sides, not directly under the food). In a small bowl, mix brown sugar, garlic powder, and pepper. Drain ribs and pat dry. Pat meat side of ribs evenly with brown sugar mixture. Cut two 24inch long sheets from a roll of heavy duty foil (18 in. wide; see tools). Place half the ribs, meat side up, on one half of a sheet of foil. Fold other half of foil over meat, leaving a space above ribs. Fold two edges to seal, then pour 1/4 cup of the reserved cola into packet through unsealed edge; fold to seal. Repeat with remaining ribs. Lay packets, folded side up, on center of grill (not over direct heat). Cover charcoal grill and open vents; close lid on gas grill. Cook until meat has pulled back from bone ends (cut packet to check), about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, in a bowl, mix cherry jam and barbecue sauce; set aside half for serving. Using tongs and a wide spatula, take packets off grill; remove ribs from packets and return to center of grill (not over direct heat); cover grill and open vents for charcoal. Cook, brushing often with half the jam mixture and turning as needed to brown on both sides, until meat is no longer pink in center between ribs (cut to test), about 15 minutes. Transfer ribs to a clean platter or rimmed carving board and cut between bones to separate. Serve ribs with reserved jam mixture.
