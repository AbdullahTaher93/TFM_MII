Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Meanwhile, cut cream cheese into 8 pieces and set aside to soften. In a large bowl, combine, figs, walnuts, honey, salt and pepper; stir until well mixed. Lay out 3 sheets of phyllo. Lightly brush each with melted butter, then stack aligning all edges. Cut into 4 equal pieces. Spread one piece of cream cheese gently across the centre of the phyllo, then top with some of the fig mixture. Fold both sides of the package into the centre; seal the seams with a light coat of butter. Fold the top and bottom edge in, sealing with another light coat of butter. Repeat with remaining 3 sheets of phyllo, fig mixture and butter to make a total of 8 parcels. Place prepared parcels on a parchment-covered baking sheet and bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until crisp and golden brown. Slice parcels diagonally and serve over greens if desired.
