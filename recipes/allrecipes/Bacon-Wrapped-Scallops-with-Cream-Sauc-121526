Place bacon in an ungreased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 7-10 minutes or until partially cooked and lightly browned. Drain on paper towels. Wrap each strip of bacon around a scallop; secure with toothpicks. In a saucepan, bring cream to a boil. Reduce heat; about 8 minutes. Stir in the mustard, syrup and salt. Bring to a boil and boil for 2 minutes. Meanwhile, place the scallops on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F for 8-12 minutes or until firm and opaque. Serve with the cream sauce.
