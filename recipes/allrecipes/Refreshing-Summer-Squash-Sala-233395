Toss yellow squash and zucchini with salt in a large bowl. Whisk mint, olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, and black pepper in a small bowl; pour over squash mixture. Toss to coat. Heat a small nonstick skillet over medium heat; cook and stir prosciutto in the hot skillet until crisp, about 2 minutes. Divide squash salad over 4 plates. Evenly sprinkle prosciutto and feta cheese over salads.
