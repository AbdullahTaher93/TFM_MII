Bring chicken stock, rice, and 1 tablespoon butter to a boil in a pot; simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon butter to rice and a few splashes soy sauce; stir. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). (If using a countertop induction oven, preheat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) or use the Combo 2 function.) Spray a baking pan with cooking spray; place inside oven to warm. Combine ground beef, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, bread crumbs, onion flakes, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, milk, brown sugar, onion powder, parsley, olive oil, beef bouillon powder, salt, garlic powder, paprika, pepper, and celery seed in a large bowl; mix until combined. Form beef mixture into balls using a small ice cream scoop; arrange on warm prepared baking pan using heatproof gloves. Bake in the preheated oven, turning meatballs 2 to 4 times, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes in the conventional oven and 8 to 10 minutes in the countertop induction oven. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Pour pasta sauce over meatballs. Top evenly with 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese; splash with soy sauce. Bake in the preheated oven until mozzarella cheese is melted and sauce is warm, about 5 minutes. Divide rice and meatballs evenly between serving plates.
