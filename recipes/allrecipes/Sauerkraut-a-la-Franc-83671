Heat the margarine in a skillet over medium heat, and saute the onion, red bell pepper, and garlic until tender. Season with paprika, caraway seed, and marjoram. Place pork strips into the skillet, and cook 5 minutes, until lightly browned. Stir in water and tomato paste, and sprinkle in the bouillon. Continue cooking 10 minutes. Mix sauerkraut into the skillet, and continue cooking 10 minutes, until pork is done and sauerkraut is heated through.
