Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; saute onion until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Spread potatoes and broccoli onto a microwave-safe plate. Cook in microwave until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Place onion, potatoes, broccoli, milk, chicken broth, pepper, salt, ginger, and thyme in the Vitamix(R) or blender. Start on variable 1, slowly increase to variable 10, and end on high for 4 to 5 minutes. Serve hot.
