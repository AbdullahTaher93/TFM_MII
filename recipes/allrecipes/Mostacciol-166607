Heat the canola oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion and red pepper, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the pork sausage, cook and stir until the sausage is crumbly and browned, about 10 minutes. Drain off and discard any excess fat, then stir in the crushed tomatoes, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 20 to 30 minutes until the sauce has reached your desired consistency. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the penne pasta, and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the penne, then toss with the red sauce and Italian cheese blend. Stir until the cheese has melted. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.
