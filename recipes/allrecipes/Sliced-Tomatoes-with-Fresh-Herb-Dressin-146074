Arrange the tomato slices in a shallow casserole dish. Whisk together the olive oil, thyme, oregano, parsley, chives, and garlic in a small bowl. Add salt and pepper to taste. Pour herb mixture over the tomatoes, covering evenly. Top with Parmesan cheese. Cover, and refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving.
