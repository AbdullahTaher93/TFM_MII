Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Mix butter, 1/2 cup sugar, brown sugar, egg, and vanilla until creamy. Add the peanut butter; stir until well blended. Gradually add the flour. Once you have nice dough, form into mini-meatball sized dough balls and roll them in the reserved cup sugar. Place the balls on an ungreased cookie sheet. Use a fork to press the dough ball down, making a crisscross in the center of each cookie. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes.
