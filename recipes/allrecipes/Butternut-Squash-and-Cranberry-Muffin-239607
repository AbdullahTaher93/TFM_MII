Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or line 24 muffin cups with paper liners. Mix flour, white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, ground nutmeg, cloves, baking soda, and freshly grated nutmeg together in a bowl; fold in cranberries. Beat butternut squash, eggs, coconut oil, safflower oil, and ginger together in a separate bowl until smooth; stir into flour mixture until batter is just mixed. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes.
