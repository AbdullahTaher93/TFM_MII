Whisk olive oil, onion powder, seasoned salt, and garlic powder together in a bowl; add zucchini and marinate for about 30 minutes. Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill zucchini slices on the preheated grill for about 10 minutes. Flip and grill until edges are crisp and grill marks are present, about 10 minutes more.
