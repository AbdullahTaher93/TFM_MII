Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate; crumble bacon. Place broccoli, onion, raisins, and bacon in a large bowl. Stir mayonnaise, sugar, and vinegar together in a bowl; pour dressing over broccoli mixture and toss to coat. Season with salt and black pepper.
