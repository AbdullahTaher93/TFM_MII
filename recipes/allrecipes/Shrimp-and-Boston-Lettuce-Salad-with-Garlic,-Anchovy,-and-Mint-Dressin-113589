In a blender, combine the anchovies, garlic, and lemon zest. Pulse to chop. Add the mint, oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper and blend until smooth. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the shrimp until they just turn pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the shrimp and transfer them to a medium glass or stainless-steel bowl. Toss the shrimp with half the dressing. Put the lettuce in a large glass or stainless-steel bowl and toss with the remaining dressing. Put the greens on plates; top with the shrimp.
