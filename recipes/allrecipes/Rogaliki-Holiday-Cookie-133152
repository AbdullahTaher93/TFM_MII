Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg, vanilla, and almonds; mix a few seconds until well incorporated. Stir in the flour until a dough forms. Roll the dough into a rope 3/4-inch thick. Cut the rope into 3-inch long pieces. Shape the cookies by rolling each piece back and forth while pressing down gently with two fingers on each end until the piece is about 5-inches long. The dough piece should be plump in the center, and thinner on it's ends. Repeat with remaining cookies. Place the cookies onto a cookie sheet, bending the ends toward each other to form a crescent 'C' shape. Bake in preheated oven until the edges have turned golden brown, about 20 minutes. Dust immediately with powdered sugar, then cool completely on a wire rack.
