Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut baguette into 1/2-inch-thick slices and arrange on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until slices are lightly toasted, about 15 minutes. Set aside. Trim and discard tops and ends of leeks. Cut leeks in half lengthwise and rinse under running water to remove any sand or grit. Pat dry, then cut leeks crosswise into thin slices. In a 5- to 6-quart pan, combine leeks, mushrooms, lemon peel, and broth over high heat. Cover and bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes. Add chicken, asparagus, and beans. Simmer until asparagus and beans turn bright green and are just tender when pierced, 5 to 7 minutes. Add peas and cook until hot, 1 minute more. Ladle soup into serving bowls and top with toasted baguette slices. Add salt and pepper to taste.
