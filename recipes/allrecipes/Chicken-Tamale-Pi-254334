Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9-inch glass baking dish with cooking spray. Mix chicken, green enchilada sauce, 1/2 cup yogurt, salsa, and coriander together in a bowl. Combine cornbread mix, remaining 1/2 cup yogurt, and water in a bowl. Spread half of the cornbread mixture in the bottom of the dish. Spoon chicken mixture evenly on top. Sprinkle pepperjack cheese and green olives over chicken mixture. Spread remaining cornbread mixture on top. Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 30 minutes.
