Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain and toss with 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large bowl; set aside. Whisk together the garlic, basil, oregano, salt, pepper, half-and-half, an 1/2 cup olive oil in a bowl. Toss with the cooked spaghetti. Add the green bell pepper, red bell pepper, parsley, Jarlsberg, and pecans. Toss the salad again to mix, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese to serve.
