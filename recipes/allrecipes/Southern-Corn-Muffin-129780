Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Beat egg, milk and salsa in medium bowl with wire whisk until well blended. Add remaining ingredients; stir just until moistened. Spoon evenly into six paper-lined or greased medium muffin cups. Bake 20 min. or until golden brown. Remove muffins from pan to wire rack. Cool slightly.
