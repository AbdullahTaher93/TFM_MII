In a Dutch oven, cook beef, onions and garlic in oil; drain. Stir in water, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 1-3/4 to 2 hours or until meat is tender. Cool. Divide beef and cooking liquid between three freezer containers; cover and freeze. May be frozen for up to 3 months.
