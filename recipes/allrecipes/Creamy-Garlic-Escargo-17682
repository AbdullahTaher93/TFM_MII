Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly spray a cupcake pan with non-stick cooking spray. Place the phyllo dough on a flat surface and brush each sheet with the melted butter. Layer the sheets on top of one another and cut the pile into fours. Push each piece of dough into a cupcake pan, forming cups with the dough. Bake the phyllo cups for 10 to 15 minutes, until golden. Drain the snails and rinse them with running water until the liquid runs clear. In a small bowl, mix together the egg yolks and heavy cream. Heat a saute pan, add 4 tablespoons of butter, the garlic and then the snails. Saute for a couple of minutes and then add half of the heavy cream mixture. Bring to a boil and season with the salt and pepper. The sauce will thicken while cooling. Remove the phyllo cups from the muffin tins. Place a phyllo cup on a plate or bowl and put 8 escargot in the cup and flowing out of the cup. Pour the sauce in the cup over the escargot.
