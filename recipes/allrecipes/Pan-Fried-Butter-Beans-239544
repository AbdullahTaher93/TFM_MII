Heat olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Cook and stir beans into hot oil until slightly golden and crispy, about 10 minutes. Stir garlic, rosemary, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into beans; continue cooking until crispy, about 5 minutes. Drizzle vinegar over beans and toss.
