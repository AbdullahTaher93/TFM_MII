Preheat waffle iron. In a large bowl, beat 2 egg yolks (reserve whites; discard remaining yolks), yogurt, milk, orange peel, orange juice, sugar, nutmeg, and butter until smoothly blended. In another bowl, stir together all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Add flour mixture to egg mixture and stir just until dry ingredients are evenly moistened (do not overmix). Beat egg whites until they hold stiff, moist peaks; fold into batter. Cook in preheated waffle iron according to manufacturer's directions.
