Place chicken, 4 tablespoons of the vinaigrette and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the rosemary in 1-quart resealable food-safe plastic bag; seal. Turn bag to coat chicken thoroughly. Marinate 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat grill. Combine remaining 1 tablespoon vinaigrette, 1/2 teaspoon rosemary and apricot preserves in small saucepan. Heat, over low heat, just until preserves are melted; set aside. Remove chicken from bag; discard balsamic mixture left in bag. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Place chicken on grill over medium-high heat. Cover and cook 4 minutes on each side. Turn again; cook 3 minutes. Turn once more and spoon 1 tablespoon of preserve mixture on top of each breast. Cook about 3 more minutes or until chicken is fork tender and juices run clear. Serve topped with remaining apricot mixture.
