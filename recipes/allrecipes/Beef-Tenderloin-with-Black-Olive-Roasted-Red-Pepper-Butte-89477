Preheat broiler or grill. Combine butter, black olive bruschetta topping and peppers in a small bowl and mash together with a fork to combine well. Season to taste with black pepper. Brush steaks with a little olive oil and season liberally on both sides with Archer Farms steak seasoning. Grill or broil steaks to desired doneness. While steaks are still hot, top each steak with a dollop of prepared butter and serve as it melts over the steak.
