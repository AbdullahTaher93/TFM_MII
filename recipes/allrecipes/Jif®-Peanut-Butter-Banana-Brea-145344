Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease 9 x 5 x 3-inch loaf pan. Combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in large bowl. Add banana, peanut butter, milk, canola oil and egg. Beat at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping sides and bottom of bowl. Mix just until blended. Bake at 350 degrees F for 60 to 65 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. (Cover top loosely with foil after 45 minutes to prevent over-browning.) Cool 10 minutes in pan. Remove to cooling rack.
