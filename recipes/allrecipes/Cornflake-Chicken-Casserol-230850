Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix cream of chicken soup, cooked chicken, celery, 1 cup cornflakes, water chestnuts, mayonnaise, and onion together in a large bowl; spread mixture into a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Mix 1 cup cornflakes and melted butter together in a bowl until coated; sprinkle over casserole. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling and topping is crisp, about 45 minutes.
