Combine strawberries, sugar, 2 tablespoons water, and balsamic vinegar in a saucepan and bring to simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Whisk 2 tablespoons water and cornstarch in a small bowl. Whisk cornstarch mixture into strawberry mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Transfer mixture to a blender and puree until smooth.
