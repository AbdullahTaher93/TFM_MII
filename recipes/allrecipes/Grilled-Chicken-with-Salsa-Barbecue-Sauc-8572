In a medium saucepan, combine salsa, lime juice, Worcestershire sauce, orange juice, vinegar, brown sugar, corn syrup, oregano, and oil. Simmer over low heat for 45 to 60 minutes. Remove sauce from heat, and add cilantro. Use sauce to baste chicken during the last 20 minutes of grilling, reserving about 1/2 cup of the sauce to baste the cooked pieces just before serving.
