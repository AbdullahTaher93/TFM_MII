Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat an 8-inch (20 cm) square cake pan with cooking spray. Separate egg yolks and whites into large mixing bowls. Beat egg whites on medium speed until frothy. Beat in sugar slowly, until soft glossy peaks form. Whisk yolks, milk and vanilla, until well combined. Add flour and cinnamon all at once; stir until just combined. Slowly fold in half of the egg white mixture; fold in remaining whites being careful not to over mix and lose volume. Arrange half of the fruit in prepared pan. Spread batter over fruit and top with remaining fruit. Bake for 25 minutes or until top springs back when lightly touched. Let cool on rack for 5 to 8 minutes. To serve, spoon warm onto plates and top with a 1 tablespoon (15mL) dollop of NUTELLA(R).
