Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. Place the chicken in the baking dish. Arrange pepper, potatoes, and pineapple around chicken. Pour the reserved pineapple juice over all, and top with barbeque sauce. Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until chicken juices run clear and potatoes are tender.
