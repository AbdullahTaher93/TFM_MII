In a large mixing bowl combine roasted corn, sliced white mushrooms, grilled red onions, diced tomatoes and romaine. Cut avocados in half, remove all usable flesh from avocados, and puree into a fine mousse. Season with salt and pepper and pinch of paprika. Chill avocado mousse in air tight container. Have four large plates chilled and ready. Heat a medium-large saute pan over medium-high heat, season shrimp and saute clove of minced garlic in 1 tablespoon of oil. Toss the shrimp a few times in the saute pan and set aside. Add the vinaigrette to the salad and vegetables. Toss the salad to ensure the vinaigrette has coated the salad evenly. Make a high and even mound of salad in the center of each plate. Using a spoon, place three even dollops of the avocado mousse around the plate. Place a shrimp standing on top of each avocado dollop. Place tails of the shrimp to point outwards. Drizzle residual sauce in the saute pan around the plate.
