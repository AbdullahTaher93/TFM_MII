Set oven rack 6 inches from the heat source; preheat broiler. Stir eggs, hot sauce and pepper briskly with a fork in a medium bowl. Stir in scallions and cilantro (or parsley), if using. If black bean dip is cold, warm it in the microwave on High for 10 to 20 seconds. Place wrap between paper towels and warm in the microwave on High for about 10 seconds. Spread bean dip over the wrap, leaving a 1-inch border all around. Brush oil over a 10-inch nonstick skillet; heat over medium heat. Add the egg mixture and cook, lifting the edges with a heat-resistant rubber spatula so uncooked egg will flow underneath, until the bottom is light golden, 20 to 30 seconds. Place the skillet under the broiler and broil just until the top is set, 20 to 30 seconds. Immediately slide the omelet onto the wrap. Sprinkle with cheese. Fold the edges over the omelet on two sides, then roll the wrap up and around the omelet. Serve immediately, with salsa, if desired.
