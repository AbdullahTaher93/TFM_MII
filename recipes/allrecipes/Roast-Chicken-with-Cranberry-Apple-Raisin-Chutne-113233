Heat the oven to 425 degrees F. Rub the chicken cavity with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper and put the orange zest inside. Twist the wings of the chicken behind the back and tie the legs together. Put the chicken, breast-side up, in a roasting pan. Coat the chicken with the oil and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Roast the chicken until just done, 50 to 60 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium stainless-steel saucepan, bring the cranberries to a boil with the apple, raisins, brown sugar, apple juice, vinegar, ginger, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Cover and simmer over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has thickened and the fruit is tender, about 15 minutes. When the chicken is done, transfer the bird to a plate and leave to rest in a warm spot for about 10 minutes. Pour off the fat from the roasting pan. Set the pan over moderate heat and add the orange juice. Bring to a boil, scraping the bottom of the pan to dislodge any brown bits. Boil until reduced to approximately 1/4 cup, about 4 minutes. Add any accumulated juices from the chicken and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Serve the chicken with the orange sauce and the chutney.
