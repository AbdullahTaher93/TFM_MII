Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Place kale leaves in a large resealable bag. Mix olive oil and garlic together in a bowl; pour over kale. Seal and shake bag until kale leaves are evenly coated. Add vinegar to bag, reseal bag, and shake until coated. Spread leaves evenly onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until crisp, 20 to 25 minutes. Season with salt.
