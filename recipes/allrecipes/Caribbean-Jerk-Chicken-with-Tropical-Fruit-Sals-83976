In large Ziploc(R) bag, place 3/4 cup Caribbean Jerk Marinade and chicken; seal bag. Marinate in refrigerator at least 30 minutes or up to 3 hours. Meanwhile, combine fruit salad with 2 tablespoons marinade. Cover and chill in refrigerator. Remove chicken from bag, discarding used marinade. Grill or broil chicken about 13 to 20 minutes, or until thoroughly cooked, brushing often with remaining 1/4 cup fresh marinade. Spoon fruit salsa over top of each cooked chicken breast before serving.
