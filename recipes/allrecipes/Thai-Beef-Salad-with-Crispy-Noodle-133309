Season the steak with salt and pepper. In a grill pan, sear the steak over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes per side for medium rare; transfer to a plate to rest. In a small bowl, whisk together 3 tablespoons water, the soy sauce, honey, peanut butter and lime juice. In a large bowl, combine the slaw mix, cilantro and basil with the peanut dressing and toss. Add the dry ramen noodles and toss again. Divide evenly among 4 shallow bowls. Cut the steak into thin slices and distribute among the salads.
