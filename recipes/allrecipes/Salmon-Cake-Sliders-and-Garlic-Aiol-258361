Mix salmon, bell pepper, olive oil mayonnaise, bread crumbs, green onion, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 tablespoon cilantro, mustard, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, seafood seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Whisk egg in a small bowl; pour over salmon mixture and mix until evenly incorporated. Form salmon mixture into 12 patties. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook salmon patties in batches until lightly browned, about 5 minutes per side. Place 1 patty in each slider bun. Mix mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 tablespoon cilantro, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, and garlic together in a bowl to make aioli. Spread aioli over the salmon patties.
