Combine soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, cornstarch, cold water, ginger, garlic, and black pepper in a bowl. Add chicken breasts to marinade and stir to coat. Pour the marinade and chicken into a 9x9-inch square baking dish. Cover and marinate chicken in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bake chicken in marinade until meat is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 40 minutes, turning midway through cooking.
