Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place the potatoes in a large pan and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook for about 10 minutes, just cooking partially. Place the potatoes into a large lidded tub and pour in the lamb drippings. Season with rosemary and salt. Close the lid and shake to coat the potatoes. Pour them out onto a baking sheet. Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until dark brown and crispy.
