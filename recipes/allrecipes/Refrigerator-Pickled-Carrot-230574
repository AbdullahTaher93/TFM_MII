Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook carrots in boiling water until tender but not mushy, about 15 minutes; drain. Stir sugar, vinegar, and cloves together in a saucepan; drop in cinnamon stick and bring mixture to a boil. Stir until sugar dissolves. Transfer carrots to a bowl and pour syrup over carrots. Cover tightly; refrigerate until chilled and flavors have blended, 3 hours to overnight.
