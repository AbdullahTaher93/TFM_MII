Separate garlic bulb into cloves, and peel. Cut into lengthwise strips. Using a sharp knife, punch holes into steak. Stuff holes with garlic strips. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Preheat grill for hot heat. Lightly oil grate. Place stuffed steaks on hot grill, garlic side up. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, turn, and season with salt and pepper. Continue cooking until done, another 4 to 5 minutes.
