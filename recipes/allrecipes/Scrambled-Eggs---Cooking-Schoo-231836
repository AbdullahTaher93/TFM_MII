Beat eggs, water, and salt together in a bowl. Melt butter in a nonstick pan over medium heat. Pour eggs into the pan and let cook undisturbed for 30 seconds. Gently push the eggs to the center of the pan with a heatproof spatula; let cook another 30 seconds before pushing again to the center. Continue cooking until eggs are no longer liquid and thick moist curds have formed, 1 to 2 minutes.
