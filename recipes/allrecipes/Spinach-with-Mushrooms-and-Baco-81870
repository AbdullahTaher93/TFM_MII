In a small bowl, mix together the vinegar and mustard. Set aside. In a very large skillet over medium-high heat, cook the bacon strips until very crispy. Transfer to paper towel. Crumble when cooled and set aside. Pour off all but 1 Tbsp of the bacon fat. Reduce heat to medium and add the onions, separating them into rings and cook until translucent. Add the mushroom and cracked pepper; cook for 2 minutes, stir occasionally. Add the spinach and cook until just wilted turning the leaves over with tongs as it cooks. Remove from heat and toss in the vinegar mixture. Serve immediately.
