In a large kettle over medium-high heat, cook peppers in boiling salted water for 3-5 minutes. Drain and rinse in cold water; set aside. In a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Add remaining ingredients and mix well. Loosely stuff into peppers. Place in a 9-in. square baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until peppers are done and filling is hot.
