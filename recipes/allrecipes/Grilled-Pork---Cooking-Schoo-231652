Pat pork chops dry with paper towels. Season chops with salt, pepper, and rosemary. Cover and set aside for 30 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Place chops on the grill; cook for 2 minutes and rotate the chops 1/4 turn to create grill marks. Cook for 2 more minutes, flip over chops, and reduce heat to medium. Cook until golden brown and no longer pink inside, about 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Transfer chops to a plate, lightly cover with foil, and allow to rest.
