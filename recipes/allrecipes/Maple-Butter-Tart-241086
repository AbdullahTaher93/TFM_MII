Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place tart shells on a baking sheet; sprinkle raisins evenly into the bottom of tart shells. Beat brown sugar and butter together in a bowl until smooth; whisk in eggs, maple syrup, flour, vanilla extract, and salt. Fill each tart shell 3/4 full with maple syrup mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until filling is set and shells are golden, about 16 minutes. Turn the baking sheet halfway through the baking time for even baking.
