Place the garbanzo beans in a saucepan, and cover with several inches of water. Combine the quinoa with 1 cup of water in a small saucepan. Set both aside to soak overnight. The following day, pour the soaking water off of the garbanzo beans, and fill with fresh water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the garbanzo beans are tender, about 1 hour. Drain and set aside. Meanwhile, bring the quinoa to a boil over high heat in its soaking water. Reduce heat to low, and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes; set aside. Combine the drained garbanzo beans and quinoa in a mixing bowl with the parsley; set aside. In a separate bowl, whisk together the shallot, garlic, lemon juice, tahini, and olive oil. Season to taste with sea salt and pepper. Pour the dressing over the garbanzo bean mixture, and stir gently before serving.
