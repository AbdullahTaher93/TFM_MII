Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion, garlic, and chile pepper in hot butter until fragrant and lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir cooked rice, egg, soy sauce, and sesame oil into onion mixture. Cook and stir until egg is cooked through and rice is coated and heated through, 3 to 5 minutes.
