Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Prick potatoes in several places with fork. Bake 1 hour. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Cut off thin slice from top of each potato. Discard tops of potatoes; scoop out centers, leaving 1/8-inch-thick shells. Mash potatoes in medium bowl. Add dressing, sour cream and chives; beat until fluffy. Spoon evenly into shells; top with VELVEETA. Place in shallow baking dish. Bake 20 minutes or until heated through.
