Wash and pare butternut squash. Cut in pieces, discarding string and seed portion. Cook in a small amount of boiling water until tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and mash. Heat margarine in medium skillet. Add onion and saute until tender. Combine with squash and remaining ingredients. Blend well; turn into greased 1-quart casserole. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes.
