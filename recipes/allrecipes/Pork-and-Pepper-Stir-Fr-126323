In a medium bowl, combine the all-fruit spread, 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce, and 1/4 teaspoon of the red-pepper flakes. Add the pork and toss to coat well. Cover and marinate for 20 minutes at room temperature. Heat 2 teaspoons of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add the pork mixture and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 minutes, or until the pork is slightly pink in the center. Place in a bowl and keep warm. Wipe the skillet with a paper towel. In a cup, whisk together the broth and cornstarch and set aside. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons oil to the same skillet and place over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, ginger, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes, or until the garlic is golden. Add the bell peppers, onion, and the remaining 1 tablespoon soy sauce and cook, stirring, for 6 minutes, or until tender. Add the pork and any accumulated juices to the pepper mixture. Stir the cornstarch mixture and add to the skillet. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute, or until thickened.
