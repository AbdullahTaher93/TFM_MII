In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add 4 cups flour, milk, shortening, sugar, eggs and salt; beat for 2 minutes or until smooth. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead lightly. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 2-3 hours. Punch dough down; divided into four equal parts. Roll each into a 9-in. circle; brush with butter. Cut each circle into eight pie-shaped wedges; roll up each wedge form wide edge to tip of dough and pinch to seal . Place rolls with tip down on baking sheets; freeze. When frozen, place in freezer bags and seal. Store in freezer for up to 4 weeks. To bake, place on greased baking sheets; thaw 5 hours or until doubled in size. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from baking sheets and serve immediately or cool on wire rack.
