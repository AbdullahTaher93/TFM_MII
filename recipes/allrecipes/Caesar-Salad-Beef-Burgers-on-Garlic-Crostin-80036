Combine ground beef, minced garlic, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in large bowl, mixing lightly but thoroughly. Lightly shape into four 3/4-inch thick patties, shaping to fit the bread slices. Place patties on grid over medium, ash-covered coals. Grill, uncovered, 13 to 15 minutes to medium (160 degrees F) doneness, until not pink in center and juices show no pink color, turning occasionally. Season with salt and pepper, as desired. Meanwhile brush both sides of bread slices lightly with oil. Place bread around outer edge of grid. Grill a few minutes until lightly toasted, turning once. Remove bread slices from grid. Rub both sides of each slice with a garlic quarter. Place one lettuce leaf on four of the bread slides; top each with a burger. Sprinkle evenly with cheese; cover with remaining bread slices. Cut burgers in half, if desired; arrange on lettuce-lined platter, if desired.
