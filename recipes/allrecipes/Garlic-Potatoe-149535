Place the potatoes and garlic into a large pot, and just cover with salted water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low, and cover. Simmer until very tender, about 20 minutes. Drain. Allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Return the potatoes to the pot. Pour in milk, and season with salt; mash until smooth. Stir in the parsley.
