Combine cranberry sauce, chipotles, dried cranberries, apple, sugars, vinegar, and spice in large saucepan or skillet over medium heat. When mixture begins to bubble, lower heat to simmer and cook for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and let cool slightly. Gently stir in avocado pieces just before serving. Prepare Brie: On a shallow ovenproof serving plate (or in shallow casserole dish), place Brie. Pour prepared chutney over cheese.
