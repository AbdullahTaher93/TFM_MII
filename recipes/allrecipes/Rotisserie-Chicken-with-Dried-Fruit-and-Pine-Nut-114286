Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Add the prunes, apricots, cherries and pine nuts and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until the pine nuts are golden and the fruit is browned in spots, about 3 minutes. Add the port and cinnamon stick and cook over moderate heat until syrupy, about 5 minutes. Add the stock and chicken drippings and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, in a large nonstick skillet, brown the chicken pieces over high heat until the skin is golden and crisp, about 2 minutes. Scrape the dried fruit sauce and liquid into the skillet with the chicken and bring to a boil, turning the pieces of chicken until they are nicely coated with sauce, about 1 minute. Transfer to plates and serve.
