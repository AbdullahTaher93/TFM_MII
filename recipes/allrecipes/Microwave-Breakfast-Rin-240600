Mix brown sugar, water, butter, and cinnamon together in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until the butter melts, about 2 minutes. Stir biscuit dough and apple with the sugar mixture to coat dough pieces completely. Spread the mixture evenly around the ring of a microwave-safe tube pan (such as Bundt(R)). Cook in microwave oven on High for 3 minutes. Let rolls finish cooking as they rest at room temperature for 5 minutes. Invert onto a serving platter.
