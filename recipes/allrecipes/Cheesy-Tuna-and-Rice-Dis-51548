Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Melt butter in a saucepan. Blend in flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Stir in evaporated milk. Cook until thickened, stirring constantly, then stir in grated cheddar cheese and grated parmesan cheese. Combine instant rice, chopped parsley, paprika, cayenne pepper, oregano, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Layer whole tomatoes, chopped onion, and tuna (drained) over the rice. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the rice is tender.
