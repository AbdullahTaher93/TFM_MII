Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the spinach and wilt, about 3 minutes; season with salt and pepper. When cool, squeeze excess water out of the spinach and chop. In a bowl, toss the spinach with the goat cheese. In a food processor, pulse the walnuts with the 2 tablespoons flour until finely chopped; transfer to a shallow bowl. In another shallow bowl, beat the eggs with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Place the remaining 1/2 cup flour on a clean plate. Coat 1 side of each chicken breast with the flour, then dip in the egg mixture and in the walnuts. Place the chicken on a work surface, coated side down, and spread the top with one-fourth of the spinach mixture, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Roll up from the long side, jelly-roll style, and place, seam side down, on a baking sheet. Refrigerate for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the chicken until cooked through, about 30 minutes. Let stand, covered loosely with foil, for 15 minutes; slice into rounds.
