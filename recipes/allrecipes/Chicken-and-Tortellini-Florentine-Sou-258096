Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in tortellini and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the tortellini are tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain. Melt butter in a pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Add paprika, cumin, marjoram, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to low. Stir flour into the pot. Whisk in chicken stock slowly until fully blended. Bring soup to a boil, stirring frequently until thickened. Add tortellini, chicken, spinach, and heavy cream; stir until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in Parmesan cheese until melted, 1 to 2 minutes.
