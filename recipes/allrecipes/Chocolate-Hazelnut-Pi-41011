For crust, in a bowl stir together flour, hazelnuts, and brown sugar. Stir in melted butter; toss to mix. Spread evenly in a 9-inch pie plate. Press onto bottom and sides to form a firm, even crust. Bake in a 425 degree F oven for 8 to 10 minutes or until brown. Cool. For filling, in another mixing bowl combine cream cheese, melted chocolate, granulated sugar, and milk; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. In a chilled bowl beat whipping cream until soft peaks form; fold into cream cheese mixture. Spread in the cooled crust. Cover loosely and chill for several hours or overnight. Before serving, in a small saucepan melt 1/4 cup chocolate pieces and 2 tablespoons butter or margarine; drizzle onto pie. For sauce, in a blender container or food processor bowl combine raspberries and corn syrup; cover and blend or process until nearly smooth. If desired, press sauce through a sieve to remove seeds. Serve with pie. If desired, garnish with fresh raspberries and mint.
