Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add cauliflower and cook uncovered until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain. Combine sour cream, Cheddar cheese, onion, melted butter, red pepper flakes, and salt in a baking dish. Mix in cauliflower. Sprinkle bread crumbs on top. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and cheese is melted, about 30 minutes.
