Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and rinse in cold water until macaroni is cooled. Place macaroni into a large salad bowl and stir in tomatoes, green bell pepper, cucumber, and green onion. Whisk sugar, vegetable oil, ketchup, vinegar, salt, paprika, and black pepper, stirring in a bowl until sugar has dissolved. Pour dressing over macaroni and vegetables and toss to coat.
