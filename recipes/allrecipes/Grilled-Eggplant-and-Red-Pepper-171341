Prepare a charcoal or gas grill for direct, high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above cooking grate only 3 to 4 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). While grill heats, slice eggplant crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Brush slices with 1 tablespoon olive oil; set aside. Place peppers on oiled cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook, turning occasionally with tongs, until skin is charred, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let stand until cool enough to touch. Meanwhile, place eggplant slices on cooking grate and cook, turning often with a wide spatula, until browned and soft when pressed, 8 to 10 minutes total. Lay slices on a platter. Pull off and discard pepper skins, stems, and seeds. Cut peppers in halves and arrange on platter with eggplant. Sprinkle vegetables with salt and pepper to taste; drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Serve warm, or let cool, then cover and chill up to 1 day ahead, then bring to room temperature. Sprinkle with cheese.
