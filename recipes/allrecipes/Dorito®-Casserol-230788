Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray. Mix crushed tortilla chips, tomatoes, cream of chicken soup, green bell pepper, green chile peppers, 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese, and 1/2 cup pepperjack cheese together in a large bowl. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground pork in hot skillet until crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Transfer pork to tortilla chips mixture, retaining drippings in the skillet. Cook and stir ground chicken in reserved drippings until crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Transfer cooked chicken to the pork-tortilla chip mixture; mix well. Pour mixture into the prepared casserole dish; top with 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese and 1/2 cup pepperjack cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling and cheeses are melted, about 30 minutes. Allow casserole to cool 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
