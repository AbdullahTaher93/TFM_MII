Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Arrange sweet potatoes onto a baking sheet. Drizzle coconut oil over the sweet potatoes; season with cumin, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Bake in the preheated oven, turning occasionally, until soft in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. Garnish with paprika and cilantro.
