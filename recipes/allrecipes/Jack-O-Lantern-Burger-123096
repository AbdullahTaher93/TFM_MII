In a large bowl, combine soup mix, ketchup, brown sugar, horseradish and chili powder. Crumble beef over mixture; mix well. Shape into 10 patties. Grill, broil or pan-fry until the meat is no longer pink. Cut eyes, nose and mouth out of each cheese slice to create a jack-o-lantern. Place cheese on burgers; cook until cheese is slightly melted, about 1 minute. Serve on buns.
