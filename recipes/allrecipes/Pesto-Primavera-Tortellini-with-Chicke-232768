Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. For pesto, combine garlic, the 1 cup basil, the 1/3 cup grated Parmesan, pine nuts, lemon juice, and salt in a food processor. Cover and process until chopped, stopping to scrape down sides as necessary. With processor running, gradually add the 1/3 cup oil. Transfer to a small bowl or airtight container. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use (Pesto may be made up to 1 day ahead; allow to stand at room temperature for 1 hour before using). Combine zucchini, asparagus, mushrooms, bell pepper, and onion in a large roasting pan. Drizzle with the 2 tablespoons olive oil; toss to coat. Roast for 30 to 35 minutes or until vegetables are tender and start to caramelize, stirring twice. While vegetables roast, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Cook the chicken in hot oil for 12 to 14 minutes or until cooked through and no longer pink, turning once. When cool enough to handle, chop the chicken (You should have about 2 cups); set aside until ready to use. Cook tortellini according to package directions in a large pot; drain and return to pot. Add the roasted vegetables, chicken, and pesto, stirring gently to coat. Stir in cherry tomatoes. Season to taste with black pepper. Top with additional basil and Parmesan.
