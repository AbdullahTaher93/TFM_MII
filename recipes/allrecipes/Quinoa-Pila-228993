Bring water, 1/2 teaspoon sea salt, and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan; cook until quinoa has absorbed all the water, 15 to 20 minutes. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and ginger until onion is lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Add cinnamon and cloves; stir to coat. Stir in cooked quinoa. Remove skillet from heat; stir in mint and cilantro. Season with sea salt and black pepper. Allow mixture to cool; fluff with fork before serving. Garnish with blanched almonds.
