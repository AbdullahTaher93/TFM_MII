In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan, combine 1 teaspoon oil, onion, garlic, and chili. Stir often over medium-high heat until onion is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and lemon juice; stir until mixture boils and thickens. Season with salt and pepper. Keep warm. Rinse fish and pat dry; cut into serving-size pieces. Rub fish with remaining oil. Season with salt and pepper. Place fish pieces slightly apart in a single layer in a 10- by 15-inch baking pan. Bake uncovered in a 425 degrees F oven until fish is barely opaque in thickest part (cut to test), 10 to 12 minutes. With a spatula, transfer fish to plates. Spoon sauce over fish; sprinkle with cilantro.
