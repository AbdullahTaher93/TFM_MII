In a large bowl, mix shallots, butter, shredded mint, and lemon peel. Add potatoes and mix gently to coat well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Rinse fish, pat dry, and cut so there is a total of 4 equally sized pieces. Cut 4 pieces of parchment paper, each about 4 times wider and 6 inches longer than each portion of fish. On each piece of parchment, coat an area the size of fish with oil, starting 1 inch from a long side (fish will be centered between top and bottom edges of parchment). Place fish on oiled areas and sprinkle with salt and pepper; top each portion of fish with a fourth of the potato mixture. Fold long edge of parchment closest to the fish over fish; then roll over several times to enclose fish. With seam side down, double-fold ends of packet, pressing lightly to crease and tucking ends under. Place packets, folded ends underneath, slightly apart on a baking sheet; coat lightly with oil. Bake in a 500 degrees F oven until fish is just opaque but still moist in thickest part; cut a tiny slit through parchment into fish to test, 10 to 12 minutes. Immediately transfer packets to individual plates. To serve, cut packets open with a sharp knife or scissors just enough to expose contents without letting juices run out. Garnish with mint sprigs, if desired.
