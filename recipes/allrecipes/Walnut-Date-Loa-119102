In a bowl, combine the dates, water and oil; let stand for 10 minutes (do not drain). Add the brown sugar, egg and vanilla; mix well. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into date mixture just until combined. Fold in walnuts. Transfer to a greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 60-65 minutes or until golden brown and a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
