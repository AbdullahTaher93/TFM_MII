With a meat fork, pierce holes in both sides of steak. Place in a large resealable bag. Combine the onion, lemon juice, oil, garlic salt, thyme, oregano, celery salt and pepper; pour over meat. Cover and refrigerate for 6 hours or overnight. Drain and discard marinade. Broil steak 6 in. from the heat for 8 minutes. Brush with butter and turn. Broil 6 minutes longer or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F).
