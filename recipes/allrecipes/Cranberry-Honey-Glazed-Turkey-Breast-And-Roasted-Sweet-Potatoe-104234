Place turkey breast in a large resealable plastic bag. Combine butter, lemon juice, cranberry wine, dried fruit, Morton (R) Kosher Salt, and pepper. Pour mixture over turkey to coat all sides; close bag. Refrigerate and allow flavors to marinate turkey at least 2 hours or over night. To roast: Remove turkey from marinade. Place turkey, breast side up, on rack in a 14x12x2-inch roasting pan. Pour marinade over turkey; add 1/2 cup water to pan. Roast at 375 degrees F for 1 to 1-1/2 hours or until juices run clear and thermometer registers at 175 degrees F. While turkey is roasting, prepare sweet potatoes. Do not remove potato skin. Brush potatoes with butter and sprinkle with Morton(R) Kosher Salt and pepper. Roast along side turkey for about 1 hour or until tender. Keep warm; slice before serving. Let turkey stand 15 minutes before carving. Pour off grease from roasting pan and place pan on top of the stove. Add remaining 1/2 cup water; bring to boil while scraping bottom of pan vigorously with wooden spoon, loosening all the crisp bits on the bottom of the pan. Let reduce by half. Serve over sliced meat and baked sweet potatoes. Serve Cranberry/Honey Sauce on the side in a gravy boat. Cranberry Honey Sauce: Combine all ingredients in small saucepan. Bring to low simmer while stirring constantly. Keep warm until needed or cover and serve at room temperature with sliced turkey.
