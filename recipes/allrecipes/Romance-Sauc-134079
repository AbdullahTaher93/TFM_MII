Heat olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garlic and onions, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until the onions soften and turn translucent. Add the dill, thyme, salt, and pepper; cook for 30 seconds to flavor the onion. Stir in the Dijon mustard, balsamic vinegar, and beef stock. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat then reduce heat to low, and continue simmering for 5 minutes to infuse the flavors. Remove sauce from the heat, and whisk in sour cream; season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.
