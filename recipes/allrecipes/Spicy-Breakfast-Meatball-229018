Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix sausage, ground turkey, eggs, Cheddar cheese, onion, and black pepper in a large bowl; roll into 1 1/2-inch balls. Arrange meatballs onto baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 18 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
