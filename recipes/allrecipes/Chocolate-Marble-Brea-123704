In a mixing bowl, combine 3 cups flour and yeast. In a saucepan, heat milk, sugar, butter and salt to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F, stirring constantly. Add to flour mixture; mix well. Beat in eggs on low speed for 30 seconds; beat on high for 3 minutes. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Divide dough into thirds. Knead cocoa into one-third of the dough (this may take 5-6 minutes). Shape into a ball. Shape remaining two-thirds dough into one ball. Place each ball in a lightly greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/4 hours. Punch dough down. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll white dough into a 20-in. x 10-in. rectangle; repeat with chocolate dough. Place chocolate layer on top of white layer. Starting with long side, roll up jelly-roll style; press edges to seal seam. Cut into 20 slices; place in a greased 10-in. tube pan in about three layers. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30-40 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from pan immediately; cool on a wire rack. Combine sugar and milk; drizzle over bread. Sprinkle with nuts.
