Brush the 2 tablespoons dressing over both sides of chicken breasts. Grill over medium-hot coals on a covered grill or cook in a ridged grill pan over medium heat 4 to 5 minutes per side or until chicken is no longer pink in center. Transfer to carving board; let cool 15 minutes. Cut chicken into chunks. Meanwhile, combine pasta and remaining 1/2 cup dressing in a large bowl. Add chicken and 1-1/2 cups cheese; toss well. Add lettuce and tomatoes; toss well and transfer to serving plates. Top with remaining cheese and croutons. Serve with pepper.
