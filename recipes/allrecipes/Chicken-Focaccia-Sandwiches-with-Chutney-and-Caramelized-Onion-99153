Season chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder and set aside. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions; cook and stir until tender and golden, about 10 minutes. Remove onions from the skillet and set aside. Add chicken to the hot skillet. Cook for 7 minutes per side, or until cooked through. In a small dish, mix together the mayonnaise and mustard. Spread onto the cut sides of the focaccia bread. Top bottom halves of each focaccia square with a piece of chicken, 1/4 of the onions and 1 tablespoon of mango chutney. Cover with the top halves of the bread and serve.
