Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and carrot; cook and stir until almost soft, about 5 minutes. Add chile peppers and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. Stir in pork and all-purpose flour. Stir chicken broth slowly into the pot. Add tomatoes, potatoes, and cumin. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and cover. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
