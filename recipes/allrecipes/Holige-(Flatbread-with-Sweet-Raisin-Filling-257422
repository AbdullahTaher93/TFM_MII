Combine semolina flour, 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, turmeric, and salt in a large bowl. Mix in 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. Stir in enough water to form a soft dough. Brush remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil over dough. Cover dough with a damp cloth or paper towel and let rest, 2 to 3 hours. Process raisins and dates into a paste in a food processor or high-powdered blender. Add sugar, coconut, mixed nuts, poppy seeds, cardamom, and nutmeg; blend until thoroughly combined. Roll raisin and date mixture into golfball-sized balls. Roll dough into 1-inch balls. Sprinkle 1/4 cup whole wheat flour over a flat work surface. Roll 1 ball of dough out into a thin circle; place 1 raisin and date ball in the center. Wrap dough around the ball and pinch to seal. Roll back out into a circle. Repeat with remaining dough and raisin and date balls. Melt 1 teaspoon of ghee in a large skillet. Cook dough until brown spots appear, about 2 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon ghee to the top of the dough and flip. Cook until brown spots appear on the second side, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a serving plate. Repeat with remaining dough.
