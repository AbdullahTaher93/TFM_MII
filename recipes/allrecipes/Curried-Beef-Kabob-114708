In a large resealable plastic bag or shallow glass dish, combine the first eight ingredients; mix well. Remove 2/3 cup for basting; refrigerate. Add beef to remaining marinade; turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Drain and discard the marinade. On metal or soaked bamboo skewers, alternate beef, green peppers, tomatoes and onions. Place on a greased rack in a broiler pan; broil 5 in. from the heat for 3 minutes on each side. Baste with reserved marinade. Continue broiling, turning and basting for 8-10 minutes or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F medium, 160 degrees F well-done, 170 degrees F).
