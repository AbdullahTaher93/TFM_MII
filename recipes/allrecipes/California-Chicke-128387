Coat a broiler pan and rack with nonstick spray. Preheat the broiler. In a shallow bowl, combine the mustard and egg white. Beat lightly with a fork. In another shallow bowl, combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan, and lemon peel. Dip the chicken into the mustard mixture, turning to coat, and then into the bread-crumb mixture, turning to coat. Place the chicken on the rack in the prepared pan. Broil 6 inches from heat, turning once, for 6 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown, no longer pink, 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) in the thickest portion when a thermometer is inserted, and with juices that run clear. If the chicken browns too quickly, turn off the broiler and bake the chicken in a 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until no longer pink. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the watercress or lettuce, tomatoes, onion, basil, vinegar, oil, and salt. Serve the chicken with the salad.
