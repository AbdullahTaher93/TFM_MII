Pour about 1 inch of water into the bottom half of a steamer pan set, and place over medium heat. Place the asparagus in the top half of the steamer pan set; steam until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the asparagus and arrange on a serving platter. Whisk the lime juice, lime zest, cilantro, ginger, and sugar together in a bowl; stream the vegetable oil into the mixture while whisking. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle over the asparagus.
