In a large mixing bowl, beat molasses, honey, oil and eggs until well-mixed. Combine dry ingredients and add alternately with the milk to the egg mixture. Pour batter into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Serve warm or at room temperature with chilled whipped cream.
