Heat a grill to medium-high heat or have a ridged grill pan ready. Combine 2 tablespoons of the oil, lemon juice, garlic, and 2 teaspoons of the rosemary in a small bowl. Sprinkle salt and pepper over chicken; place in a pie plate or shallow plate. Pour oil mixture over chicken; turn to coat. Let stand at least 10 minutes or up to 20 minutes. Transfer chicken to grill with some of marinade clinging; discard marinade on plate. Grill chicken (or cook in a heated ridged grill pan over medium heat) 5 minutes per side or until chicken is no longer pink in center and internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Brush remaining 2 tablespoons oil over both sides of bread. Place on grill (or in a large nonstick skillet) and cook 2 minutes per side or until golden brown. Transfer to serving plates; top with greens and cheese. Carve cooked chicken diagonally into 1/2-inch thick slices; arrange over cheese. Top with remaining 1 teaspoon rosemary.
