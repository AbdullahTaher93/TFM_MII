In a bowl, combine the first 8 ingredients with 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Mix in 1/3 cup of the oil. Set a slice of beef on a work surface with the long side facing you. Spread 1 1/2 tablespoons of the filling along the bottom third of the slice. Roll the meat around the filling into a tight log, folding in the sides as you go. Repeat with the remaining meat and filling to make 36 rolls. Light a grill or preheat the broiler. Grill or broil the skewers until the bread is crusty brown and the meat is pink in the center, about 2 minutes per side. Serve hot with the Grilled Lemon Vinaigrette.
