Soak aji peppers in 1/2 cup hot water in a small bowl until peppers are softened, about 15 minutes; drain. Place aji peppers, 1 quartered onion, garlic, beer, salt, and cumin into a blender and pulse several times to chop onion and peppers. Blend the mixture until it has the consistency of thin gravy and aji seeds are crushed, 1 to 2 minutes. Slice pork loin roast into 2-ounce pieces (about the size of a deck of cards per piece). Place pork pieces into a slow cooker and pour blended aji sauce over the meat. Pour 1 cup water or as needed into the blender and pour water and any remaining sauce over meat to cover. Add allspice berries to the slow cooker. Grind oregano to a powder with a mortar and pestle and stir into the meat and sauce. Cover the cooker, set to High, and cook for 4 hours. Stir 3 onions cut into strips into meat mixture and cook until meat is very tender, 4 hours more.
