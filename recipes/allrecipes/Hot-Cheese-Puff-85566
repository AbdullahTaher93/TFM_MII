Preheat the oven's broiler. Arrange the slices of baguette on a large baking sheet. Place under the broiler until lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Set aside. In a large glass or metal bowl, whip the egg whites until stiff. Gradually add the baking powder, salt, pepper and paprika while whipping. Fold in Cheddar cheese by hand. Spoon onto the toasted baguette rounds. Broil for about 5 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the topping is lightly browned.
