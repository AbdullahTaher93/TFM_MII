Heat oil in large nonstick Dutch oven over medium heat. Add chicken and saute until golden brown, about 3 minutes a side. Transfer chicken to plate with tongs or slotted spoon. Add onion and garlic to pan and cook until onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in curry powder and cook for 1 minute. Add tomatoes, apricots, salt, thyme, and pepper, and bring to a boil. Return chicken (and any accumulated juices) to Dutch oven. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes. (Recipe can be made ahead to this point and refrigerated. Reheat in 325 degree F oven.) Serve sprinkled with almonds.
