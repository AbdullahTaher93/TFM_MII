Melt butter in a 3 to 4 quart pan over medium-high heat. Add brown rice and onion. Cook, stirring often, until rice is lightly toasted and opaque, about 6 minutes. Add wild rice, broth, parsley, and rosemary. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover, and simmer until wild rice is tender to bite and liquid is mostly absorbed, 45 to 55 minutes. Uncover pan and stir in turkey, feta, and olives. Stir often until meat is heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in chopped mint then transfer pilaf to a serving dish or individual plates. Garnish with mint sprigs.
