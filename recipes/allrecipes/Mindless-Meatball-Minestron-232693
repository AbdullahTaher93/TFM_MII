Heat chicken broth and beef broth in a large Dutch oven or stock pot; add meatballs, vegetables, tomatoes, and macaroni. Cover Dutch oven and bring to a boil, about 10 minutes. Remove cover and stir. Stir kidney beans and Italian seasoning into soup; reduce heat to medium. Simmer, stirring frequently, until macaroni is tender, 6 to 7 minutes. Ladle soup into 6 bowls; garnish each with 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese.
