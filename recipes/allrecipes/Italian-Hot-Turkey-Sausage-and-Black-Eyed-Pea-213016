Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the onion and celery in the hot oil until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in the garlic and oregano, let cook for 1 more minute. Push the cooked ingredients to the sides of the pan. Cook sausage meat in the center of the pan until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, black-eyed peas, and chicken broth. Cover the skillet and reduce heat to medium-low. Let the mixture simmer until the vegetables are tender and the meat is thoroughly cooked, stirring occasionally, 18 to 20 minutes. Mix in the broken spaghetti and let the mixture cook until the pasta is tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Ladle into a heated serving bowl and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
