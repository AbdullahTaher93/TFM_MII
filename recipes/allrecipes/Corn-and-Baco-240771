Spread bacon into a large skillet and place over medium-high heat; cook and stir until bacon is crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towel. Stir corn into the bacon grease in the skillet to coat; saute until hot, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir bacon with the corn; season with salt and pepper
