In a blender or food processor, combine tomatoes, garlic, basil, oil and sugar and process until smooth. Cover and refrigerate sauce. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Remove sauce from refrigerator and pour over spaghetti. Toss to coat and serve topped with Parmesan cheese.
