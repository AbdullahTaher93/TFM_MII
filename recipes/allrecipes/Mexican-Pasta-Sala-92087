Cook pasta, uncovered, in 3 to 4 quarts boiling water until tender to bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, then rinse with cold water until cool; drain well. While pasta cooks, chop the green onions and Roma tomatoes. Stem, seed, and mince jalapenos. Stem, seed, and cut the bell pepper into thin, short slivers. In a large bowl, combine the pasta, onions, tomatoes, jalapenos, bell pepper, cilantro, and beans. Add the vinegar, oil, and cheese; mix well. Transfer to a serving platter. If desired, add salt to taste.
