In a small bowl, combine the first seven ingredients until smooth; set aside. In a nonstick skillet, stir-fry turkey in 2 teaspoons hot oil until no longer pink. Remove and keep warm. In the same skillet, stir-fry the celery, carrot, onion, mushrooms, green onions and garlic in remaining oil until crisp-tender, about 5-6 minutes. Add water chestnuts and turkey; heat through. Stir broth mixture and add to the pan. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until thickened. Sprinkle with almonds. Serve over hot cooked rice if desired.
