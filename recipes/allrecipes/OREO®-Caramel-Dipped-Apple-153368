Insert wooden pop stick (from bag of caramels) into stem end of each apple; set aside. Place caramels and 2 tablespoons water in large saucepan; cook on medium-low heat until caramels are melted, stirring frequently. Dip apples into melted caramel, spooning caramel over apples to coat. Roll in chopped cookies, pressing cookies gently into caramel to secure. Place on wax-paper-lined baking sheet; let stand 25 minutes or until caramel is set. Stir 4 drops yellow food coloring and 1 drop red food coloring into melted white chocolate to tint orange. Cool 15 minutes. Drizzle over apples; let stand until firm. Store in refrigerator up to 2 days.
