Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Mix ground beef, jalapeno chile pepper, and honey with your hands in a large bowl; shape into 4 even patties. Cook on preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, 7 to 10 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
