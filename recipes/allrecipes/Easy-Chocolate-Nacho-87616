Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir the cinnamon into the sugar in a small bowl; set aside. Brush the tortillas with melted butter on both sides. Sprinkle the tortillas evenly with cinnamon sugar; then cut each tortilla into 6 to 8 wedges. Place the tortilla wedges onto baking sheets in a single layer. Bake the tortillas in the preheated oven until the edges are lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. While the tortillas are baking, melt the chocolate and shortening in a small saucepan over low heat. Spread half of the tortilla wedges onto a serving plate and drizzle with half of the chocolate mixture. Place the remaining tortilla wedges on top, then drizzle with the remaining sauce.
