In a large saucepan, bring cranberries and water to a boil. Cook over medium heat until the berries pop, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat; cool slightly. Press mixture through a sieve or food mill, reserving juice and discarding skins and seeds. In a small bowl, sprinkle gelatin over cold water; set aside. In a saucepan, combine cranberry mixture and sugar; cook and stir until sugar is dissolved and mixture just begins to boil. Remove from the heat. Stir in gelatin mixture, stirring until gelatin is dissolved. Add lemon juice. Transfer to a shallow 1-qt. freezer container. Cover and freeze until ice begins to form around the edges of container, about 1 hour; stir mixture. Freeze until slushy, stirring occasionally.
