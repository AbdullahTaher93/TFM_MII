Combine pork, molasses, salt, black pepper, sage, thyme, red pepper flakes, onion powder, parsley, nutmeg, fennel seeds, cayenne, and allspice in a large bowl; mix well by hand. Divide pork mixture into 16 portions; shape into patties 1/4-inch thick. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat; pan-fry patties, in batches, until golden and no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side.
