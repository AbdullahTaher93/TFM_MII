Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). In a small bowl, mix together the butter and garlic. Spread garlic butter on both halves of bread, and sprinkle liberally with Parmesan cheese. Place in preheated oven until cheese is golden brown. Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly. On the bottom half of the bread, place a layer of lettuce. Alternating between meat and cheese, arrange layers of ham, turkey, salami, mozzarella, Swiss cheese and provolone. Add a layer of tomatoes, onion, black olives, mushrooms, green peppers and anything else you like. Place the remaining half of bread on top. Place the sandwich on a cutting board, and slice into individual servings.
