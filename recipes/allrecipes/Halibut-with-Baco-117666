In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the first seven ingredients. Add halibut; seal bag and turn to coat. Refrigerate for 10-15 minutes, turning once. In a large skillet, cook bacon over medium heat until cooked but not crisp. Drain on paper towels. Drain and discard marinade from halibut. Wrap two slices of bacon over the top and sides of each steak; secure with soaked wooden toothpicks. Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill. Place halibut, bacon side down, on grill rack. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 4-6 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Discard toothpicks.
