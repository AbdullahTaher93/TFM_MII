Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a baking sheet with the cooking spray. Stir the soup, broccoli, chicken and cheese in a medium bowl. Unroll the crust on the work surface and cut in quarters. Spoon about 1/2 cup chicken mixture on one side of each. Fold the crust in half over the filling. Pinch the edges to seal. Using a sharp knife, cut small slits in the tops of the pockets. Place the filled pockets onto the baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Let the pockets cool on the baking sheet on a wire rack for 5 minutes.
