Mix teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, and Worcestershire sauce in a large bowl. Place pineapple and garlic in a food processor or blender; process until smooth. Pour pineapple mixture and teriyaki mixture into a resealable plastic bag. Add beef, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 6 to 8 hours. Preheat smoker to 225 to 250 degrees F (110 to 120 degrees C). Drain beef and discard marinade. Smoke beef in the preheated smoker until jerky is dry and chewy but not crispy, 6 to 8 hours. Store jerky in the refrigerator.
