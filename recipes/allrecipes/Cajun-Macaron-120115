In a large saucepan, cook the beef, onion, green pepper and celery over medium heat until meat is no longer pink and vegetables are tender; drain. Add the tomatoes and Cajun seasoning; mix well. Cook, uncovered, for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, prepare macaroni and cheese, suing 2 tablespoons milk and 1 tablespoon butter. Stir in beef mixture; cook for 2-3 minutes or until heated through.
