Rinse beef and pat dry; slice crosswise into 1/8-inch strips about 2 1/2 inches long. In a bowl, mix beef, lemon juice, allspice, and pepper; let stand 10 minutes. Meanwhile, stack pocket breads and wrap in foil. Warm in a 200 degree F oven until ready to serve. Set a 12- to 14-inch nonstick frying pan over high heat. When hot, add beef mixture; stir until meat is no longer pink, about 2 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer beef to a wide bowl or platter. Boil juices until reduced to 1/4 cup, 1 to 2 minutes; pour over meat. Stir in salt to taste. Sprinkle onion and parsley over meat. Arrange tomato and cucumber slices beside beef. Serve pocket breads and Sesame Yogurt Sauce alongside. To eat, spoon beef mixture, tomatoes, and cucumbers into pocket bread halves. Add yogurt sauce to taste. To prepare Sesame Yogurt Sauce: In a 6- to 8-inch frying pan over medium heat, stir sesame seeds until golden, 2 to 3 minutes; watch carefully, since they can burn quickly. Pour seeds from pan into a small bowl. To the bowl, add yogurt and garlic; mix well. Add salt and pepper to taste.
