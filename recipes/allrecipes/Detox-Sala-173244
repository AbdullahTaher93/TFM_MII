Mash the cottage cheese and garlic with a fork in a small mixing bowl until smooth. Add the cider vinegar, walnut oil, and salt and pepper; mix to blend, then set aside. Arrange the Belgian endive leaves onto two plates in a circle with the tips pointing out. Place the apple into the center of the plates, then sprinkle with watercress, walnuts, and blue cheese. Top with the cottage cheese dressing to serve.
