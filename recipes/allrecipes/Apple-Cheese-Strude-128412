Line a sieve with a coffee filter or cheesecloth. Place over a bowl. Fill with the cottage cheese and allow to drain for 15 to 20 minutes. In a food processor, combine the cottage cheese, cream cheese, 1/2 cup (125 ml) of the granulated sugar, and vanilla extract. Process for 30 seconds, or until smooth. Set aside. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the apples, 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of the remaining granulated sugar, lemon juice, flour, walnuts, and cinnamon. Toss to coat. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat a baking sheet with butter-flavored nonstick spray. In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs and 2 tablespoons (25 ml) of the remaining granulated sugar. Place 1 sheet of phyllo dough on a work surface with the narrow end toward you. Coat lightly with nonstick spray. Sprinkle lightly with 2 scant teaspoons of the bread-crumb mixture. Repeat layering with 5 of the remaining phyllo sheets, the nonstick spray, and the remaining bread-crumb mixture. Spread with half of the cheese filling, leaving a 1-inch (2.5-cm) border on all sides. Spoon half of the apples evenly on top. Starting at the bottom, roll the dough over the filling twice. Tuck the sides in and continue rolling into a cylinder. Place, seam-side down, on 1 end of the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make another strudel. Transfer to the baking sheet. Coat each strudel with nonstick spray and sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon (15 ml) sugar. Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp. Remove to a rack to cool for 15 minutes. Serve warm or cool completely. To serve, sift the confectioners' sugar onto the strudels. Cut each strudel into 6 diagonal pieces.
