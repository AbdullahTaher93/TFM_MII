Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl, mix flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt. Beat butter and sugar in a large bowl until creamy. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Gradually add flour mixture and beat it just until combined. Beat in the chocolate and nuts. Measure out 2 tablespoons of dough and drop onto ungreased cookie sheet, with 2 to 3 inches between each cookie. Bake for 12 minutes or until just set, being careful not to overcook. Cool for about 5 minutes. Remove from sheet to a wire rack. Cool completely.
