In large saucepan, saute mushrooms, onion, carrot and garlic in hot oil until onion is tender. Add uncooked rice. Cook and stir over medium heat 3-5 minutes or until rice is golden brown. Meanwhile, in another saucepan, heat water, bouillon and cooking wine to a boil. Slowly add 1 cup of the broth to the rice mixture, stirring constantly. Continue to cook and stir over medium heat until liquid is absorbed. Continue to add 1/2 cup of broth at a time to rice mixture, stirring constantly, until all broth has been added, absorbed and the rice mixture is creamy. Add cheeses and stir until well blended. Garnish as desired with fresh parsley and diced tomato.
