Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. In a small bowl, combine the dry salad dressing mix, flour, salt, butter or margarine and lemon juice. Mix together, then brush mixture evenly over the top of the chicken breasts. Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes or until tender.
