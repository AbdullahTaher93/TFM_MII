Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Sprinkle 2 teaspoons salt over eggplant rounds in colander; allow to drain at least 30 minutes. Rinse salt off the eggplant. Spread bread crumbs into a shallow bowl and beat egg in a separate bowl. Dip eggplant into egg, allowing excess egg to drip off the eggplant; press into bread crumbs until eggplant slices are evenly coated on both sides. Arrange coated eggplant on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Mix remaining 1 teaspoon salt with ricotta cheese in a bowl. Spoon ricotta cheese mixture onto each eggplant. Bake eggplant in the oven until cheese is heated through, 5 to 7 minutes. Place 1 eggplant slice onto each pita chip; top with a cherry tomato and basil leaf.
