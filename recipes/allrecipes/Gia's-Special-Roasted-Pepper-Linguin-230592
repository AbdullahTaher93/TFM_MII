Broil peppers for 15-20 minutes or until skins are blackened and blistered, turning occasionally. Place peppers in a tightly closed bag and let stand for 10-15 minutes. Remove skins and seeds. Cut into thin strips and set aside. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook pasta according to package directions. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and saute until slightly yellow. Meanwhile, add cauliflower florets to the skillet and saute for 3-4 minutes (skip this step if cauliflower is omitted). Add roasted bell pepper strips to the skillet and saute for 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Drain pasta, reserving 1/3 cup of cooking liquid. Toss pasta with the sauce. If needed, add some cooking liquid to the skillet. Toss pasta with parsley and mix well. Top with cheese before serving.
