Preheat the broiler. Spread the cut sides of the brioche with the truffle butter and set on a baking sheet, cut sides up. Broil the rolls 6 inches from the heat, until toasted. Reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees F. In a large bowl, mix the mayonnaise, red onion, parsley, lime juice, apple and hot sauce and season with salt and pepper. Fold in the crabmeat. Set the top halves of the rolls aside. Top the bottoms with the crab salad and sprinkle with the Gruyere. Bake in the upper third of the oven until the cheese is melted. Close the crab melts and serve.
