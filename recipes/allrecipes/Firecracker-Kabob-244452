Whisk maple syrup, lime juice, garlic, ketchup, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl until marinade is smooth. Place beef in a bowl; pour in marinade and stir to coat. Marinate beef in the refrigerator, at least 3 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Soak skewers in water for at least 10 minutes. Thread beef, mushrooms, onion, green bell pepper, squash, and zucchini onto skewers. Cook kabobs on the preheated grill until vegetables are tender and beef is cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
