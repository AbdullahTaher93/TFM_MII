Place the onion, sugar, mustard, celery seed, and black pepper into a small bowl. Pour in the vinegar, and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Whisk in the olive oil until the dressing is thick. Cover, and refrigerate at least 3 hours. To make the salad, toss the lettuce, oranges, mushrooms, almonds, and bacon together in a large bowl. Drizzle with the dressing, and toss again to coat.
