Coat a shallow baking pan with cooking spray. Arrange potatoes, skin side down, in single layer in pan; coat cut surfaces with cooking spray. Combine canola oil, mustard, and lemon juice; drizzle over cut surfaces of potatoes. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven until potatoes are golden brown and tender when pierced (about 50 minutes).
