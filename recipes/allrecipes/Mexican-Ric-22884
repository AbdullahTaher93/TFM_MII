In a medium stock pot, brown the ground beef over medium heat. Drain any fat. Add onion and green pepper. Cook until onion is tender. Stir in the beef broth, corn, tomatoes with green chile peppers and tomato sauce. Add salsa, chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, salt, pepper and cilantro. Mix thoroughly. Bring to a boil and stir in rice. Cover and cook until rice is done, about 25 minutes. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the mixture and continue cooking 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
