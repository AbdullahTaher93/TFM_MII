Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Prepare a broiler pan with cooking spray. Stir mayonnaise, garlic, Italian seasoning, and Parmesan cheese together in a bowl. Arrange pollock fillets onto prepared broiler pan. Spread mayonnaise mixture over the top of each fillet. Cook fillets under the broiler until the flesh flakes easily with a fork, 6 to 8 minutes. Drizzle lemon juice over the fish.
