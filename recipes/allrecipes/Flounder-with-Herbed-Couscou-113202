In a blender, puree the parsley and scallions with the lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of the oil, 1/4 cup of the water, and 1/4 teaspoon each of the salt and pepper. In a medium saucepan, bring the remaining 2 cups water to a boil with 3/4 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper. Stir in 3 tablespoons of the parsley puree and the couscous. Cover, remove from the heat, and let sit for 5 minutes. In a large nonstick frying pan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over moderately high heat. Sprinkle the fish with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Dust the flounder with the flour and shake off any excess. Saute the fish until brown and just done, about 2 minutes a side for 1/2-inch-thick fillets. Serve the fish on the couscous with the remaining parsley puree on the top.
