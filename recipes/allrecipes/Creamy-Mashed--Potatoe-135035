Wash potatoes and poke them all over with a fork. Leaving the skins on, cut the potatoes into 1/2-inch cubes. Place the chunks in a 2-quart glass micro-safe casserole dish with water. Cover the casserole with plastic wrap. Poke some vent holes in the plastic. Microwave on high for six minutes, then stir once and microwave again until the potatoes are fork-tender (about five more minutes). Take out. In a micro-safe measuring cup, microwave skim milk on high for 45 seconds. Add the milk to the potatoes. Mash the potatoes with a masher and fluff with a fork. Garnish with cilantro, sunflower seeds or pine nuts.
