Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. In a medium bowl, mix olive oil, steak sauce, soy sauce, rosemary, garlic powder, steak seasoning and onions. Prick steaks all over on both sides with a fork. Put steaks into marinade and leave to marinate for 20 minutes. Place steaks on hot grill. Cover and cook until grill marks form, about 8 minutes per side for medium or until internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove from grill and let rest for 5 minutes. Slice each steak in half and serve.
