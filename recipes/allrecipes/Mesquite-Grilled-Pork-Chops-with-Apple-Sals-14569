In a medium bowl, combine applesauce, onion, jalapeno pepper, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and white pepper. Refrigerate several hours, or overnight. Season chops with garlic powder, and salt and pepper to taste. Preheat grill for medium-high heat. Sprinkle soaked wood over coals, or place in the smoker box of a gas grill. Lightly oil grate, and place chops on grill. Cook for 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. Serve with applesauce salsa.
