Bring 1 inch of water to a steady boil in a large saucepan. Cut broccoli lengthwise so the florets are 1 to 2 inches wide and are attached to the long stalks. Place broccoli in a steamer basket, cover and cook over the boiling water until just tender, 3 to 6 minutes. Reserve 1/3 cup of the broccoli-steaming liquid. Place tahini in a blender; with the motor running, gradually add the reserved cooking liquid. Add harissa, lemon juice and salt and blend until smooth, scraping down the sides as necessary. Serve the broccoli with the sauce.
