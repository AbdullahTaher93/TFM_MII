Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions and green bell pepper until onions are slightly browned and soft, 8 to 12 minutes. Mix in ketchup, sugar, chili powder, hot pepper sauce, and cinnamon until thoroughly combined. Pour in water, bring mixture to a boil, and simmer uncovered until onions are tender, about 10 more minutes.
