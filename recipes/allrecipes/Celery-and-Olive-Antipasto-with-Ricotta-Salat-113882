Put the celery in a large bowl of ice water and refrigerate until curled and very crisp, at least 2 hours. In a bowl, whisk the olive oil with the lemon juice, anchovies, garlic and lemon zest. Season with salt and pepper. Drain the celery and pat dry. Return the celery to the dry bowl and toss with the olives and dressing. Transfer the antipasto to a platter, scatter the ricotta salata over the top and serve.
