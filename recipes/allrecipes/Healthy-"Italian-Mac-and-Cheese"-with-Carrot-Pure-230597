Bring a large pot and a small pot of water to a boil. Cook pasta 1 minute less than package directions. Pre-heat Oven to 400 degrees F. Meanwhile in a large skillet saute garlic in olive oil until slightly yellow in color. Add cream to skillet; slowly bring to a simmer and add carrot puree and pasta. Whisk in Asiago and fontina cheeses, simmer. Pour mix into a 2-quart casserole dish, top with Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and bake 10 minutes in the oven.
