Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Place the wings on a baking rack and set on prepared baking sheet. Bake until wing pieces are crispy and golden brown, 60 to 70 minutes. Whisk cornstarch and Swanson(R) Chicken Stock together in a bowl until smooth. Pour sauce mixture into a saucepan and bring to a simmer; add red curry paste, sriracha, brown sugar, fish sauce, and garlic powder. Whisk until smooth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until sauce reaches your desired thickness, about 10 minutes. Toss wings in sauce, garnish with cilantro, and serve immediately.
