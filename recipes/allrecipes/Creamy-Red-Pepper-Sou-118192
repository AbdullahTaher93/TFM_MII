In a Dutch oven, saute onions and garlic in butter until tender. Add potatoes, red peppers and broth. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Remove from the heat. Add pears; let cool. In a blender, cover and puree in batches. Return to the pan. Stir in cayenne and black pepper. Cook until heated through.
