In a bowl, combine shrimp, salt, and sugar; mix, set aside. Trim and discard romaine ends. Rinse leaves, pat dry, coarsely chop. Arrange leaves in large, shallow serving bowl; set aside. In a 12-inch nonstick frying pan, place bacon over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring often, until bacon is well-browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. With slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels. Discard all but 2 tablespoons of drippings. Return 1 tablespoon drippings to pan; place over medium-high heat. Add ears of corn; cook, turning often, until kernels char in spots, about 10 minutes total. Remove corn; let stand until cool enough to handle. Cut kernels from cobs; discard cobs. Rinse salt mixture off shrimp and pat shrimp dry. Add 1 more tablespoon bacon drippings to frying pan along with the shrimp. Increase heat to high and stir often until shrimp are no longer translucent in center (cut to test), 2 to 3 minutes total. To assemble salad, arrange shrimp, corn, bacon, and avocados in attractive piles on top of romaine. To serve, mix salad with dressing to taste.
