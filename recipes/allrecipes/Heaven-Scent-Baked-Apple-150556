Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Core apples; peel a strip from the top of each. If necessary, cut thin slice from bottom of each apple so apple will stand upright. Place apples upright in greased 11x7-inch baking dish. Fill centers with fruit bits or raisins. In medium bowl, combine sweetened condensed milk, water and cinnamon; pour over and around apples. Set dish in a 13x9-inch pan. Set on oven rack. Carefully pour boiling water into pan to 1-inch depth. Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until apples are tender, occasionally spooning sweetened condensed milk mixture in bottom of dish over apples. Serve warm.
