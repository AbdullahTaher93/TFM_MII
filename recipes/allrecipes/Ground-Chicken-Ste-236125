Mash garlic in the bottom of a saucepan. Stir curry paste with the garlic; add onion and bell pepper. Cook and stir over medium-low heat until the onions are golden, about 5 minutes. Crumble the ground chicken into the saucepan; add celery, carrots, tomatoes, and zucchini. Increase heat to medium, cover saucepan with a lid, and cook until the carrots have softened, 7 to 10 minutes. Pour chicken broth and soy sauce over the mixture; season with salt. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover with a lid, and simmer for 1 hour.
