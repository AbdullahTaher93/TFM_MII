Pour apple juice into a medium saucepan. Add orange slices, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, for about 15 minutes to blend flavors. Ladle into mugs, leaving orange slices in pan. (You can filter out spices too; they're for flavor, but not eating.)
