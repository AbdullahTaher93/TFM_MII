In a skillet, saute onion in butter until tender. Remove from the heat; stir in rice and salmon. Combine egg and mayonnaise; add to the salmon mixture. Spoon half into a greased 2-qt. baking dish; top with half of the Parmesan cheese and broccoli. Sprinkle with 1 cup cheddar cheese. Top with the remaining salmon mixture, Parmesan and broccoli. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining cheddar. Bake 5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.
