Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare pasta shells as package directs. Rinse shells under cold water and drain well. Meanwhile, in large saucepan, heat chili. Remove chili from heat and stir in cream cheese until melted. Spoon 1/2 cup salsa over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Top with filled pasta shells. Spoon the remaining salsa over the pasta. Cover pan with foil and bake for 15 minutes. Remove foil and sprinkle with remaining shredded cheese. Return to oven and continue to bake for an additional 15-20 minutes or until hot. If desired, garnish with green onions.
