Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir celery and onions until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. In a large bowl, combine the crumbled cornbread, cooked celery, cooked onions, giblets, oysters, parsley, basil, salt, paprika, dried sage, and nutmeg. Toss well. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir beaten eggs and chicken stock into the stuffing mixture. Transfer mixture to a casserole dish and bake it in preheated oven approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes. You can also stuff the stuffing mixture in the turkey. Remove stuffing promptly once bird is cooked.
