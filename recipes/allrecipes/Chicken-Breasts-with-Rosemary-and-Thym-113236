Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Press a rosemary and thyme sprig on each chicken breast. Sprinkle the chicken with the crushed red pepper and season with salt and black pepper. In a large nonstick, ovenproof skillet, heat the olive oil until shimmering. Add the chicken breasts, herb side down, and cook over moderately high heat until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Season the chicken with salt and black pepper, turn and cook until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast the chicken for 20 minutes, or until the juices run clear when the breast is pierced near the wing joint. Transfer the chicken breasts from the skillet to a platter, cover and keep warm. Pour off any fat in the skillet and set the skillet over a burner. Add the chicken stock and cook over high heat, scraping up any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. Whisk the flour and water mixture into the skillet and boil until slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Pour the pan sauce into a bowl and serve with the chicken.
