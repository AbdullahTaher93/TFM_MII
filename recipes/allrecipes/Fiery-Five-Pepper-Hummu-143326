Combine half the garbanzo beans with half the red bell pepper, Cubanelle pepper, banana peppers, jalapeno peppers, and serrano peppers in a blender or bowl of a food processor. Add red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, garlic, olive oil, sesame seeds, and cumin. Blend until well mixed. Stir remaining garbanzo beans and peppers into the blender or food processor. Pour in 1 tablespoon reserved garbanzo bean liquid, or amount required to thin mixture to desired consistency, and blend until smooth.
