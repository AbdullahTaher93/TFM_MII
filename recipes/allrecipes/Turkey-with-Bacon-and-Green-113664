Put the Swiss chard and the water in a medium pot. In a large nonstick frying pan, cook the bacon until crisp. Drain on paper towels. Pour off and reserve all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon fat, which you should leave in the pan. Put the pan with the one tablespoon of fat over moderately low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, 30 seconds longer. Add the mixture to the Swiss chard. Bring the water to a simmer, cover, and cook over low heat until the greens are wilted and tender, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of the reserved bacon fat in the frying pan over moderately high heat. Season the turkey cutlets with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and the pepper. Cook until just done, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove the cutlets from the pan so that they don't overcook. Remove the Swiss chard from the heat. Stir in the sour cream and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Remove the greens from the pot with a slotted spoon, leaving the sauce. Divide the greens among four plates. Top each pile of chard with a turkey cutlet. Spoon some of the sauce over the top and sprinkle with the bacon.
