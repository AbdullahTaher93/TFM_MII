Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Combine the rice, mushroom soup, dry onion soup mix and milk. Mix together. Place rice mixture in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place chicken pieces on top of rice mixture and bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven for 3 hours or until rice is tender (turn chicken once).
