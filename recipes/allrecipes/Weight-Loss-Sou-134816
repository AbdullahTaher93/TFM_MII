In a 4-quart pot, combine the onions, celery, carrots, garlic, and oil. Cover and cook for 10 minutes over medium heat, stirring often. Put the tomatoes (juice included) in a blender and blend until smooth. Add the tomatoes to the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 20 minutes. Add rice and broth, cover, and simmer for another 20 minutes. Sprinkle dried herbs over the top before serving.
