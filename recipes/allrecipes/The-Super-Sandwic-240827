Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Place about 1/2 of the potato nuggets on the preheated waffle iron, close the waffle iron, and cook until nuggets are golden brown and pressed to resemble a slice of bread, 3 to 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining potato nuggets. Place 1 slice of potato nugget "bread" on a plate; top with ham and turkey. Set tomato atop sliced meats and top tomato with potato chips. Place bacon over chips, Swiss cheese over bacon, and pickles over cheese. Top with remaining slice of potato nugget "bread".
