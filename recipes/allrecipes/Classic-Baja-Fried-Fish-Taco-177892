In a shallow bowl, combine beer, flour, and salt. Whisk to blend well. Rinse fish, pat dry, and cut into 4 equal pieces. In a deep, heavy pan, heat 1 inch of oil over medium-high heat to 360 degrees F on a deep-frying thermometer. Using a fork to turn fish, coat 2 pieces of fish with beer batter; lift out and drain briefly. Slide batter-coated fish into oil; turn up heat to maintain oil temperature. Cook, turning once, until fish is golden (about 2 minutes). Lift from oil with a slotted spoon and drain briefly on paper towels. Keep warm while you batter and fry the remaining 2 pieces of fish. Thin mayonnaise with a little water and season with pepper to taste; set aside. To assemble each taco, stack 2 tortillas; top with fish and a fourth of the cabbage. Spoon on thinned mayonnaise and salsa to taste. Squeeze lime over filling; then fold tortillas to enclose filling and eat out of hand.
