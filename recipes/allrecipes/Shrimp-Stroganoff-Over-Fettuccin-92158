Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook, stirring often, until they are just opaque in center (cut to test), 4 to 5 minutes. Remove shrimp from pan and keep warm. Melt remaining butter in pan. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring often, until onion is soft but not browned, about 3 minutes. Blend in flour and cook, stirring, until bubbly. Remove from heat and gradually stir in broth, whisking to prevent lumps. Return to heat and cook, stirring often, until sauce boils and thickens. Stir in sour cream, catsup, chopped dill, and shrimp. Stir just until heated through; do not boil. Remove from heat and season to taste with salt and pepper. Place fettuccine in a large serving bowl and top with stroganoff. Garnish with dill sprigs.
