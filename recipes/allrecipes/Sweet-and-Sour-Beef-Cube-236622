Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Put flour into a large, sealable plastic bag; add beef cubes and seal bag. Shake bag to coat beef in flour; transfer beef to a large casserole dish. Top beef with sliced onions. Whisk water, ketchup, soy sauce, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and sugar together in a bowl; pour over the onion slices. Cover the dish with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven until the beef is tender enough to pull apart with a fork, about 3 hours.
