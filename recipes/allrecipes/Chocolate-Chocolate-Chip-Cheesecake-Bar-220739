Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease bottom and sides of a 9x13 inch pan. Mix the crust ingredients together by hand. Press into the bottom of the 9x13 greased pan. Set aside. Beat together cream cheese, eggs, and sweetened condensed milk until smooth. Beat in 1/4 cup of dry cake mix, until well blended. Mix package of triple chocolate pouch, following the directions on box (stir 1/3 cup cold water into dry pouch ingredients). Stir pouch mixture into filling and mix until blended. Do not over mix. Pour filling batter on top of crust. Bake in a 325-degree oven for 23-25 mins. Filling will still be slightly jiggly. Cool completely. Garnish with chocolate shavings if desired. Refrigerate after cooling.
