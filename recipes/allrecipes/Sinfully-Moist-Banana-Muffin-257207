Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 2 muffin tins with cooking spray or line with paper liners. Whisk applesauce, mashed bananas, butter, and eggs together in a large bowl. Combine flour, white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, vanilla extract, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Fold into the applesauce mixture until batter is just combined. Divide batter evenly among muffin tins, filling each cup almost full. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes.
