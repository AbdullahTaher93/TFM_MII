Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. In small bowl, combine one packet of the seasoning mix, paprika, garlic salt and lemon pepper. Rub ribs with seasoning mixture and place in shallow roasting pan and set aside. In a medium bowl, stir together remaining ingredients and mix well. Pour the sauce over ribs. Cover with foil and roast for 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours. Remove from oven and let stand 10 minutes. Remove the ribs to a serving platter. Drain the sauce from the pan into a gravy separator and let stand for 5 minutes or until the fat has separated from the gravy. Pour the sauce over the ribs and serve immediately.
