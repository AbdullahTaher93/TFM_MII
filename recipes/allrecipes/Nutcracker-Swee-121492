Combine the crumbs, almonds and chocolate; set aside. In a small mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually beat in 1/2 cup sugar until stiff peaks form; set aside. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, cloves and remaining sugar. In another bowl, beat egg yolks, oil and extract. Add to dry ingredients; beat on medium speed for 1 minute. Stir in crumb mixture. Fold in egg white. Pour into two greased 9-in. round baking pans lined with greased waxed paper. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pans to wire racks. Carefully remove waxed paper; cool completely. In a mixing bowl, beat cream and confectioners' sugar until soft peaks form. Add extract; beat until stiff peaks form. Split cake layers in half horizontally; spread almond cream over each layer. Stack on a serving plate. (Do not frost sides of cake.) Garnish with grated semisweet chocolate if desired. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
