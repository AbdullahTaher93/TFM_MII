Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Place the pita bread rounds on a non-stick baking sheet. Spread 2 tablespoons of pizza sauce onto each pita round; sprinkle with cheese. Use the Hidden Valley(R) Original Ranch(R) Light Dressing as the glue to add assorted vegetables to the pizzas. Take your time and create silly faces with the veggies. Bake the pizzas for 10 to 12 minutes or until cheese melts.
