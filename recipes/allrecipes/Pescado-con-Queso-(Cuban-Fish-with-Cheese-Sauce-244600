Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix onion and Cheddar cheese together in a bowl. Sprinkle 1/2 of the cheese mixture into the prepared baking dish; top with swai fish. Sprinkle the remaining cheese mixture over fish. Whisk milk, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; pour over fish. Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork and the cheese is melted, about 45 minutes.
