In a bowl, combine brownie mix, eggs, oil and water; beat until combined. Fold in pecans. Transfer to a greased 10-in. springform pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out with moist crumbs. Cool completely. For filling, in a mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, cranberry juice and sugar until smooth. Set aside 1 cup whipped topping for garnish. Fold remaining topping into cream cheese mixture. Carefully spread over brownie. Stir cranberry sauce; carefully spread over the filling. Garnish with reserved whipped topping and pecan halves if desired. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving. Store leftovers in the refrigerator.
