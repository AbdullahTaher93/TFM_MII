In a large shallow glass dish, combine the first seven ingredients. Add chicken; turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 3-4 hours. Place cracker crumbs in a shallow bowl; roll chicken in crumbs until coated. Transfer to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Combine butter and oil; pour over the chicken. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until chicken juices run clear.
