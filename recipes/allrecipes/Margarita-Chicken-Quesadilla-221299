Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir margarita mix, lemon juice, lime juice, and garlic powder together in a large bowl. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir chicken in the hot oil until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain excess oil from chicken. Pour margarita mixture into the skillet with chicken; simmer until most of margarita mixture is evaporated, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer and drain chicken to a paper towel-lined plate. Layer 4 tortillas with chicken, Cheddar cheese, and Monterey Jack cheese; top with remaining 4 tortillas. Place the prepared quesadillas, 1 or 2 at a time, on a large baking sheet. Bake quesadillas in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 15 minutes. Repeat with remaining quesadillas; cut into quarters to serve.
