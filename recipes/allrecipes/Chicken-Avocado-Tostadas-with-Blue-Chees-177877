In a bowl, combine chicken, vinegar, 1 tablespoon of the oil, cheese, onions, and pepper. Set aside. Lightly brush both sides of each tortilla with remaining 1 1/2 teaspoon oil (make sure to oil edges). Arrange tortillas well apart on two 12- by 15-inch baking sheets. Bake in a 475 degrees F oven until crisp and golden brown (about 5 minutes; switch positions of baking sheets halfway through baking time). Meanwhile, place beans in a microwave-safe bowl; cover lightly and microwave on high (100%) for 3 minutes or until heated through, stirring once. To assemble tostadas, set one hot tortilla on each individual plate. Spread tortillas equally with heated beans, then top equally with salad mix, chicken mixture, tomatoes, and avocado slices.
