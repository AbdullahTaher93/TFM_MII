Peel back husks form the corn, remove strings and leave just a few layers of husk on the corn. Spread butter or margarine over each ear of corn. Sprinkle Cajun seasoning lightly over each ear, or to taste. Fold corn husks back over the corn. Wrap in foil. Place on grill for 25 minutes, turning occasionally. Unwrap foil, peel back husks and enjoy.
