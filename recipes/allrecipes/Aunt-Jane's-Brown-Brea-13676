Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter and flour two 9x5-inch bread pans. In a small bowl, combine milk, sugar and molasses. Mix together whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, salt, baking soda and baking powder. Add to milk mixture and mix well. Pour mixture into bread pans. Bake in preheated oven until a tester inserted in the centers comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Let bread cool in pans for 10 minutes, then invert on wire rack and allow to cool completely.
