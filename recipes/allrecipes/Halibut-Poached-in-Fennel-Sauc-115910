In a large, wide saucepan, combine carrots, celery, half the fennel, leeks, parsley stems, peppercorns, fennel seeds, bay leaves, salt, wine, and 4 cups water, and bring to a boil. Lower heat, and simmer, covered, for 25 minutes. Strain, reserving liquid and discarding solids. Return liquid to pan; simmer for 5 minutes over medium heat. Add potatoes and remaining fennel to the broth. Simmer for 5 minutes. Add halibut fillets, and cover. If liquid does not cover fish, add water until it does. Turn heat down to lowest setting. Cook until fillets are just opaque, 10 to 15 minutes (start checking after 7 minutes). Be careful not to overcook. Place a fillet in each of four shallow bowls. Divide vegetables among bowls, top with a little broth, and serve immediately.
