Melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir chanterelle mushrooms and garlic in the hot butter until mushrooms have softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir pork in the hot oil until browned and meat is no longer pink inside, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer pork to a plate, leaving pan drippings in saucepan. Pour mushroom mixture with butter into pan drippings. Stir flour into mushroom mixture until thoroughly combined; mix in water and bring gravy to a boil, stirring often. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Serve pork cubes with chanterelle gravy.
