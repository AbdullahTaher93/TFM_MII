Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain. Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken and garlic in butter until chicken is browned. Add mushrooms, green bell pepper, and red bell pepper; cook and stir until vegetables are tender. Melt remaining 1/2 cup butter with half the heavy cream in a large saucepan over medium heat. Gradually add Parmesan cheese, alternating with pieces of cream cheese, stirring constantly. Stir in remaining heavy cream, simmering until sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir chicken and vegetable mixture into cream sauce. Transfer pasta to the saucepan and stir in egg. Cook and stir for 1 minute and serve immediately.
