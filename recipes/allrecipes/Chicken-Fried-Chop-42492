In a shallow bowl, combine flour, salt, mustard and garlic powder; dredge pork chops. In a skillet, brown chops on both sides in oil. Place in a slow cooker. Combine soup and water; pour over chops. Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours or until meat is tender. If desired, thicken pan juices and serve with the chops.
