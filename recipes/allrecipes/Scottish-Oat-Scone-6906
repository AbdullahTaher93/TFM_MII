Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. In a large bowl, mix the flour, oats, sugar, baking powder, salt, and currants. Make a well in the center. In a small bowl, beat egg until frothy, and stir in melted butter and milk. Pour into the well, and mix to create a soft dough. Pat dough into two 1/2 inch thick circles. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Score 8 wedges into each circle of dough. Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until risen and browned. Split wedges, and serve warm.
