Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Coat a 9-inch glass pie plate with cooking spray. Place the artichokes in a colander and rinse well with cold water to separate. Drain well, then pat dry with paper towels. Place in the prepared pie plate and sprinkle with the lemon juice. In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs, cheese, Italian seasoning, garlic, and oil. Sprinkle the mixture evenly over the artichokes.
