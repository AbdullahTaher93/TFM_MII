Place all ingredients (except apricots) in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select dough cycle; press Start. At the end of dough cycle, turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, cover and let rest 10 minutes. Roll dough out into a rectangle, sprinkle apricots on top, and roll up into a loaf shape. Place into a greased 9x5 inch loaf pan, cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Slash the risen loaf down the center with a sharp knife. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from pan and place loaf on a wire rack to completely cool.
