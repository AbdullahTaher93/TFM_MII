Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Place 2 slices bacon each in 4 separate pieces of aluminum foil. The foil pieces must be large enough to fully wrap a potato. Place one potato in each piece of foil. Top each potato with a slice of processed cheese. Salt and pepper to taste. Tightly wrap potatoes with the foil. Place on the prepared grill. Cook approximately 30 minutes, or to desired doneness.
