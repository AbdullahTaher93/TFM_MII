Add KELLOGG'S RICE KRISPIES cereal, stirring until well-coated. Using buttered spatula or waxed paper, press cereal mixture evenly into a shallow 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan coated with cooking spray. Allow to cool. Using a knife, cut into rectangle shapes for gift tags. Decorate by spreading frosting over gift tags. Create lines and words by applying decorating gel. Use green frosting for holly leaves and slices of fruit snacks for holly berries. Loop licorice for string.
