Position rack in upper third of oven; preheat broiler. Combine refried beans, pinto beans, salsa and 1/3 cup cheese in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until the mixture is hot and the cheese is melted, 6 to 8 minutes. Spoon the bean mixture into a 2-quart baking dish and sprinkle with the remaining 1/3 cup cheese and scallions. Broil until the cheese is lightly browned, about 2 minutes.
