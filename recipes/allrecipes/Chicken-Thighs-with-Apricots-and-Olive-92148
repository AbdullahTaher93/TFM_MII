Rinse chicken, pat dry, and cut into 1-inch pieces. Place in a 9- by 13-inch baking dish and add olives, apricots, vermouth, capers, orange peel, orange juice, vinegar, basil, oil, and garlic. Stir to mix well; then spread out evenly. Bake, uncovered, in a 500 degrees F oven for 15 minutes. Turn oven temperature to broil. Sprinkle chicken mixture evenly with sugar. Then broil about 6 inches below heat until top begins to brown and chicken chunks are no longer pink in thickest part; cut to test (about 5 more minutes). If desired, let chicken stand for about 5 minutes before serving to let juices thicken slightly. Garnish with parsley sprigs and, if desired, orange slices.
