Place lamb in a large plastic zipper bag or shallow glass dish. In a medium bowl, mix yogurt, liqueur and pepper. Pour over lamb, turning to coat both sides. Close bag or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, turning once. To make sauce, heat oil in a medium saucepan over moderately high heat. Add bay leaf, leeks and figs; saute, stirring for 4 minutes. Stir in chicken broth, wine and honey. Lower heat and boil gently until reduced to about 2 3/4 cups, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in dissolved cornstarch. Return to heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove bay leaf. One hour before grilling, remove lamb from marinade, blot dry with paper towels and let sit at room temperature. Soak a handful of mesquite, apple or other wood chips in water for at least 30 minutes. Oil grill rack, place 3 to 4-inches from coals and prepare coals. When hot, add wood chips. Sprinkle lamb generously with salt and pepper. Grill, covered with the lid of the barbecue to impart a smokier flavor and keep the flames from flaring up, for 8 to 10 minutes. Turn and grill covered for 8 to 10 more minutes or until the thickest parts are rare and the thinner ones medium-well. Do not overcook; the meat will continue to cook off the heat. Let rest 5 minutes and carve into thin slices. Serve with sauce.
