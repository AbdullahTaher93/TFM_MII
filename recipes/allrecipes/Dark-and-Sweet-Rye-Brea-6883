Combine water, oil, honey, raisins and 4 tablespoons brown sugar in blender. Liquefy. Soften yeast in warm water with remaining 1 tablespoon brown sugar. In large bowl sift together 1 cup all purpose flour, 2 cups wheat flour, 1 cup rye flour, powdered milk, and salt. Add honey and yeast mixtures. Beat at medium speed until smooth (2 minutes). Gradually stir in enough of the remaining flours to make soft dough that pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn out onto floured surface and knead until smooth and satiny (10-12 minutes). Place dough in lightly greased bowl and turn to grease surface. Cover and let rise until double (about 1-1/2 hours). Punch down and let rest 10 minutes. Divide into 4 round loaves and place on greased cookie sheets sprinkled w/cornmeal. Cover and let rise in warm place until doubled (1 hour). Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) oven for 30-35 minutes. Brush with melted butter and cool on racks.
