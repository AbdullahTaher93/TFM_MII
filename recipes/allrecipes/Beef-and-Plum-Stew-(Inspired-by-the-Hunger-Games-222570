Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in the melted butter until lightly brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Cook bacon in the onion mixture until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Heat wine in a separate pot over medium heat until simmering. Add dried plums to wine and cook for about 10 minutes. Add mushrooms, cover pot, and reduce heat to low. Cook and stir tomatoes and beef into bacon mixture until beef is browned, about 20 minutes. Transfer bacon and beef mixture to the wine mixture. Add mustard powder, sage, cloves, salt, and pepper. Cook stew over medium heat for 2 1/2 hours.
