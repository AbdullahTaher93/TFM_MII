Prepare rice according to package directions. Cool to room temperature. Stir in apples, peanuts, 2 heaping tablespoons of the chutney, ginger, poultry seasoning, and currants. Meanwhile, remove hens from wrapping; remove giblets. Rinse hens and dry well. Salt and pepper hen cavities and fill with cooled stuffing. (You will have a little left over.) Tie legs together with string. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place hens on rack in shallow roasting pan. Brush with melted butter and season with salt and pepper. Bake for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, with a vegetable peeler, peel long strips of peel from orange. Place strips on a cutting board and cut into thin slivers. Bring a small pot of water to a boil and boil orange peel strips for 2 minutes. Drain and pat dry on paper towels. Make glaze by combining orange juice, remaining chutney, vinegar, and orange peel strips in a small pan. Set aside. After hens have baked for 30 minutes, reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Brush hens with glaze, distributing orange peel strips and bits of chutney evenly over them. Continue to bake for 30 to 45 minutes longer, brushing with a small amount of glaze every 10 minutes. The hens should roast approximately 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours, depending on size. They are done when they are deep golden brown and a meat thermometer inserted into the thigh registers 175 degrees F to 180 degrees F. Remove from oven and let rest 10 minutes. Cut strings from legs. Meanwhile, stir wine into remaining glaze. Simmer slowly until wine is reduced slightly and flavors are blended, 4 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. If desired, garnish hens with orange slices and watercress. Serve with sauce.
