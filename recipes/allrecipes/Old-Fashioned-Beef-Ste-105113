Heat oven to 325 degrees F. With the flat side of a large knife, crush the garlic with salt to form a paste. Combine the garlic paste with beef, chopped onions, thyme, and pepper in a large, heavy Dutch oven. Cover and roast 1-1/2 hours. Stir in tomato paste, carrots, celery, mushrooms, and small onions. Cover and roast until beef and vegetables are tender, 1 to 1-1/2 hours more and let stand for 15 minutes before slicing
