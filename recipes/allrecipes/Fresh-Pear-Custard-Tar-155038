Prepare Single Crust Pastry: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. In a medium bowl, combine all-purpose flour and salt. Using a pastry blender, cut in shortening until pieces are pea-size. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon water over part of mixture; gently toss with a fork. Repeat moistening dough with 3 to 4 more tablespoons water, using 1 tablespoon water at a time, until all the dough is moistened. Form dough into a ball. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough from center to edge into a 13-inch circle. Ease into an 11-inch tart pan with removable bottom. Trim pastry to edge of pan. Prick bottom and sides well with fork. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden. Cool in pan on a wire rack. For filling, in heavy medium saucepan combine sugar and 2 tablespoons cornstarch. Stir in LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Remove from heat. Gradually stir about 1 cup of the hot mixture into egg yolks. Return all of the egg yolk mixture to the saucepan. Cook and stir until bubbly. Reduce heat. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla. Pour into baked tart shell. Cover and chill for at least 1 hour or until ready to assemble tart. For glaze, combine the pear nectar and 2 teaspoons cornstarch. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Remove from heat. Cover surface with plastic wrap; cool to room temperature. To assemble the tart, peel, core, and thinly slice pears. Arrange in a concentric pattern over filling. Pour cooled glaze over pears, spreading evenly. Cover and chill for 1 to 4 hours. To serve, top with berries. If desired, sprinkle berries with sifted powdered sugar and garnish with fresh mint and edible flowers.
