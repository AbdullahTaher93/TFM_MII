Set muffin liners on a large baking sheet. Combine cocoa powder, peanut butter, coconut oil, and honey together in a bowl; stir in vanilla extract. Continue mixing until all lumps are gone. Transfer mixture to a piping bag or resealable plastic bag with a corner snipped. Pipe the mixture into each muffin cup, filling 3/4-full. Refrigerate bites until set, at least 30 minutes.
