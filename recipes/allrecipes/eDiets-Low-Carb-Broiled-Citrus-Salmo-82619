Preheat broiler. Rinse and pat dry the salmon. Mince the garlic. In a small bowl whisk together the orange and lime juices with the minced garlic, cumin and ginger until well blended. Pour the citrus juices over the salmon and marinade in the refrigerator for about 15-20 minutes. Coat the broiler pan with cooking spray and cook the salmon for about 4-5 minutes on each side until cooked and no longer opaque. Serve hot.
