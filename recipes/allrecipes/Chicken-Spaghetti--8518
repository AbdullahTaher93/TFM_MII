Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling water until done. Saute onion, celery, and bell pepper in oil until tender. In a 9 x 13 inch baking pan, combine saute mixture with chicken, cooked spaghetti, soup, olives, pimentos, and mushrooms. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Slice cheese, place evenly across top of casserole, and bake until cheese is melted. Cool and serve.
