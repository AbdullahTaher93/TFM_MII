Slice squid bodies into 1/2-inch-thick rings; leave tentacles whole. Rinse carefully inside and out and pat dry. Set aside. Scrub lemon and cut crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices. Cut each slice into quarters and set aside. Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in a large heavy skillet over high heat. Add half of the peppers and 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper; saute until barely tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Add half of the squid and saute until opaque, 30 to 45 seconds. Add half of the lemon pieces and saute until the lemon is just heated through, 30 seconds longer. Transfer the squid mixture to a serving dish and keep warm. Add the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil to the pan and heat over high heat. Cook the remaining peppers, crushed red pepper, squid and lemon in the same manner. Transfer to the serving dish. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve immediately.
