Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 12 (2 3/4x1 1/4-inch) nonstick muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray. Place unopened fudge packet from brownie mix in bowl; cover with warm water to soften. In large bowl, combine melted chocolate chips, bananas, butter, vanilla and eggs; mix until smooth. Add brownie mix; beat 50 strokes with spoon. Divide half of batter evenly into sprayed muffin cups. (Cups will be slightly less than half full.) Cut off small corner of fudge packet. Squeeze about 1 teaspoon fudge filling into center of batter in each muffin cup. Top with remaining batter. Sprinkle pecans over batter; press in gently. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 to 27 minutes or until edges are set. (Centers will be soft.) Cool 3 minutes. Run knife around edge of each cake to loosen; remove from muffin cups. Drizzle chocolate-flavored syrup decoratively onto each individual serving plate. Top each with warm cake. Drizzle with additional syrup. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Serve with ice cream.
