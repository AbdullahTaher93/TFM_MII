Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. In large pot, cook macaroni pasta in boiling salted water with a pinch of basil and one teaspoon of olive oil until al dente. Rinse with cool water. Drain. Meanwhile, use a blender to mash the whole peeled tomatoes. In a large bowl combine mashed tomatoes, 1 cup of the grated Cheddar cheese, chopped bacon and bell green pepper, bacon, and chopped carrots. Mix well. Add the cooked macaroni and toss well to coat evenly. Place in 2 quart baking dish. Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup grated Cheddar cheese and 2 teaspoons basil on top. Layer the sliced tomatoes over all. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes.
