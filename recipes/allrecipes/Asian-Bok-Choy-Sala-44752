Mix water and sugar in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil. Cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until a light syrup has formed. Remove from heat, and mix in lemon juice, soy sauce, and olive oil. Refrigerate until serving. In a medium bowl, toss together bok choy and green onions. Top with pine nuts and dried rice noodles. Sprinkle with the dressing to taste.
