Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken breasts in a single layer in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle the chopped onion and green pepper over the breasts. Place small pieces of butter around on the vegetables. Sprinkle turmeric powder evenly over the entire dish, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover the dish with a lid or aluminum foil. Bake for 45 to 60 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the chicken is no longer pink, and the juices run clear.
