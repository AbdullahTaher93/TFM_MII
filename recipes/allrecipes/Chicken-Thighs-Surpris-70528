Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the squash, eggplant, mushrooms, onion and garlic. Cook and stir for about 5 minutes, until lightly browned. Transfer to a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a medium bowl, stir together the condensed soup, chicken broth, garlic salt and pepper. Pour half of this mixture over the vegetables. Place chicken thighs over the top of the vegetables, and sprinkle with Swiss cheese. Pour the rest of the soup over all. Bake uncovered for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
