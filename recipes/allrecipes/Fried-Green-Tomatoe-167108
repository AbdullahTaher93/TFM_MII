Heat about 2 cups of the oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat (There should be about 1/2 inch of oil in the pan. It will appear to shimmer on the surface when it is ready). Mix the eggs and LACTAID(R) Milk together in a large shallow pan. Combine the flour, garlic powder, seasoned salt and pepper in a second large shallow pan. Coat the tomato slices first with the egg mixture and then dredge them in the flour mixture, coating well. Fry the tomatoes about 4 to 5 slices at a time, in the hot oil and fry on both sides until golden brown, about 1 to 2 minutes per side. Drain tomatoes on a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Add more oil to the pan as necessary To serve, season to taste with additional seasoned salt and arrange on a serving platter.
