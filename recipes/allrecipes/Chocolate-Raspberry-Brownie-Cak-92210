In a 2- to 3-quart pan over low heat, stir butter and chocolate just until melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and mix in granulated sugar, pecans, eggs, and vanilla. Add flour and stir to mix ingredients well. Spread batter in a buttered, floured 9-inch cake pan with a removable rim. Next to rim, around the edges, distribute 1 cup berries, rinsed and drained dry, in a band about 2 inches wide; gently press fruit into batter. Bake in a 350 degrees oven until top, at outside edge, cracks and feels firm to touch, 45 to 50 minutes. Let brownie cool in pan on a rack. If made ahead, chill airtight up to a day. Remove rim and set cake on a plate; dust with powdered sugar and mound remaining 1 1/2 cups rinsed, drained berries in the center. Cut into wedges.
