Season chicken breasts with salt, pepper and seasoned salt. In a small bowl, combine flour and water and mix until no lumps remain and the mixture is completely smooth. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add chicken and brown for 3 to 4 minutes each side. Remove chicken to a plate or platter. Deglaze skillet with wine and broth and bring to simmer over medium low heat. When simmering, add herbs; whisk in flour mixture. Return to simmer, reduce heat to low and return chicken to skillet with juices. Cover skillet and simmer gently for 20 to 30 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through (no longer pink inside), turning frequently.
