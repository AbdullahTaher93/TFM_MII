Coat a grill rack with nonstick spray. Preheat the grill. Brush the swordfish with 1/4 cup (60 mL) of the taco sauce and place on the hot grill. Grill 4 inches (11 cm) from the heat for 5 minutes per side per 1 inch (2.5 cm) thickness of fish, or until the fish is opaque and flakes easily when tested with a fork. Transfer to a medium bowl and flake with fork. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of taco sauce and toss to coat. Wrap the tortillas in plastic wrap and microwave on high power for 1 minute to soften. Place the tortillas on a flat surface. Divide the lettuce among them, arranging it in a row in the center of each. Top with the fish. Sprinkle with the scallions and Monterey Jack. Top with the salsa and sour cream. Cut the lime into quarters and squeeze the juice over the filling. Fold the tortillas around the filling to enclose it.
