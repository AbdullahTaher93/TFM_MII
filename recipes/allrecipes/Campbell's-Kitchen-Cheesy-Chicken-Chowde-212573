Heat the soup, milk, picante sauce, pepper and onions in a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes or until the vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally. Stir the chicken in the skillet and cook until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Serve with the sour cream.
