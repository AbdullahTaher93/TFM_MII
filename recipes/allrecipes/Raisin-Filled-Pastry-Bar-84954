Combine raisins and water in small saucepan. Bring to boil and simmer until all water is evaporated. Cool and chop in food processor or blender. Set aside. For bars, oil a 9x13-inch jelly roll pan; set aside. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Combine flour, sugar, salt and soda in work bowl of food processor or mixer. Mix together. In small bowl, mix oil, water, 2 tablespoons of egg and vinegar together. Add to dry ingredients and process or mix until dough forms ball and cleans the side of the bowl. Turn onto lightly floured surface; knead together until smooth. Divide into two equal balls. Roll out one ball to 9x13-inch rectangle and place in bottom of prepared pan. Spread with Raisin Filling. Roll remaining ball to 9x13 rectangle and arrange on top. Trim edges and score 3 x 4 to make 12 bars. Brush generously with remaining egg and bake at 375 degrees F for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown and done. Cool and cut as scored.
