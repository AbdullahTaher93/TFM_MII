Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place potatoes in a saucepan and cover with water; bring to a boil. Cover and cook until almost tender, 7 to 12 minutes; drain and cool. Combine soup, 1 1/2 cups Cheddar cheese, sour cream, green onions, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; fold in potatoes. Place mixture in prepared baking dish and sprinkle with remaining 1 1/2 cups Cheddar cheese. Bake in preheated oven until heated through and cheese is melted, 25 to 30 minutes.
