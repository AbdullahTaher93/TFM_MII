Line a 9 x 9 inch pan with plastic wrap. Set aside. Combine chocolate with sweetened condensed milk in a microwaveable bowl. Cook on high (100% power) for about 1 1/2 minutes or until chips are JUST melted. Take care not to overheat the mix. Stir after 1 1/2 minutes. Don't stir too much or the mix will get oily. Gently stir in the peppermint bark and peppermint extract. Pour the thick fudge into prepared pan. Press evenly into the corners. Allow fudge to set for 4 hours at room temperature or cover and leave it overnight. Cut into squares or cut out shapes with cutters. Store fudge at room temperature (not in the fridge) and wrap well so it doesn't dry out.
