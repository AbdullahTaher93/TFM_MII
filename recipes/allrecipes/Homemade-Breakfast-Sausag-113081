In a large bowl, combine the pork, salt, pepper, sage and marjoram and mix well with a fork. Knead the sausage into a large ball. (Taste for seasoning by pinching off an olive-size piece of sausage and placing it in a small nonstick skillet. Cook the small piece over medium heat, turning often, until it's no longer pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes. Taste, then add additional salt, pepper or herbs to the sausage mixture as desired.) Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill the uncooked sausage mixture for 1 hour. Using your hands, form the meat into 24 uniform balls, then flatten each into a patty. Place 8 of the patties in a large nonstick skillet and cook over medium heat until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels, repeat with the remaining patties and serve.
