In a saucepan over low heat, combine chopped chocolate and amaretto. Stir constantly until the chocolate is almost melted, then remove from the heat and continue to stir until the chocolate is completely melted. Beat in the butter, one piece at a time until smooth. Refrigerate until frosting is of a spreadable consistency.
