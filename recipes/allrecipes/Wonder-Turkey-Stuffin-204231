At least 6 hours before you are ready to bake, tear each slice of Wonder Bread into bite-size pieces and let stand on an open table or countertop. Once the bread has dried out, mix it in a large baking dish with the boiling water, butter, onion, salt and sage. For added flavor, cook and chop up the turkey giblets and add to the stuffing. Heat oven to 350 degrees F and bake for 30 to 40 minutes in a covered dish.
