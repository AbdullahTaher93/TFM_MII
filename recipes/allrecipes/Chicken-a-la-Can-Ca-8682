Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine the chicken, soup, rice, mushrooms, diced onion, ground pepper, celery, water chestnuts and peanuts. Put mixture in a 9x13 inch casserole dish. Sprinkle 1/2 can of the French fried onions on top and bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and onions are crisp. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 of fried onions on top and serve.
