In a mixing bowl, cream sugar and shortening. Add egg, milk and vanilla; mix well. Combine dry ingredients; add to creamed mixture and beat well. Chill. Meanwhile, for filling, combine sugar and cornstarch in a saucepan. Add water; stir to dissolve. Add raisins; cook and stir until mixture comes to a boil and thickens, about 3 minutes. Set aside to cool. Divide chilled dough into thirds. Roll one-third out on a lightly floured surface to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut into 3-in. circles. Using a thimble, cut small holes in the center of half of the circles. Place 1 teaspoon filling on solid circles; top each with a circle that has a hole. Pinch edges together to seal. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Bake on ungreased baking sheet at 375 degrees F for 15-17 minutes or until lightly browned.
