To prepare Dulce de Leche: Heat soy milk over medium heat until it comes to a simmer. Whisk in all other ingredients. Continue to simmer for approximately 30 minutes or until desired caramel consistency is achieved. Remove from heat and set aside. Keep warm. To prepare Cookies: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper. Sift flour and cinnamon into a medium sized mixing bowl. Mix in SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend. Rub margarine into flour mixture until crumbly. Add soy milk and mix until mixture forms a dough. Roll dough out on a floured surface to 1/8 inch thick. Cut dough into 2 inch wide circles using a round cookie cutter. Place rounds on an un-greased cookie lined with parchment paper. Bake for approximately 20 minutes or until lightly golden brown on the edges. Allow cookies to cool for 3 minutes. Spread each cookie with 1 tablespoon of Dulce de Leche. Sandwich two cookies together. Serve warm.
