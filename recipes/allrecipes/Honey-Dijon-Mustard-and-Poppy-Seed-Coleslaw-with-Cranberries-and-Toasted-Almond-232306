Spray a small skillet lightly with olive oil cooking spray and place over medium-low heat. Cook and stir almonds in the skillet until lightly golden brown and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl to cool. Stir cabbage, cranberries, green bell pepper, celery, and chives in a salad bowl. Toss toasted almonds with cabbage mixture. Whisk mayonnaise, honey-Dijon mustard, honey, and poppy seeds together in a small bowl. Stir dressing into slaw until coated. Season with salt and black pepper.
