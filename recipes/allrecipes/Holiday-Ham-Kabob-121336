Drain the pineapple, reserving 2 tablespoons juice; set pineapple aside (discard remaining juice or save for another use). In a saucepan, combine the juice, butter, brown sugar and cinnamon; cook and stir over medium heat until sugar is dissolved. Set aside. Place sweet potatoes in another saucepan and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, for 10-12 minutes or until potatoes are tender; drain. On metal or soaked wooden skewers, alternately thread sweet potatoes, green pepper, ham and pineapple. Brush with brown sugar mixture. Broil 4 in. from the heat for 4-6 minutes on each side or until heated through and peppers are tender, basting occasionally.
