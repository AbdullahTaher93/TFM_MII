Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Line large shallow roasting pan with heavy foil, extending foil over edges of pan. Butter foil. Remove all unpopped popcorn. Pour popcorn into prepared pan. Keep warm in oven. In medium saucepan, combine EAGLE BRAND(R) and dry gelatin. Heat and stir over low heat until mixture is slightly thickened and bubbly, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour EAGLE BRAND(R) mixture over popcorn. Using a long-handled wooden spoon, stir gently to coat. Bake 20 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. Carefully turn out onto large piece of lightly buttered foil. Cool. Break into pieces or clusters.
