Cut into each chicken breast horizontally, leaving 1/3 of an inch connecting two, thin halves like a book. Pour one bottle of buffalo wing sauce over chicken, cover, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil. Combine egg and milk in a bowl until smooth. Toss together flour, cornstarch, salt, and pepper in a separate bowl. Remove chicken from the marinade; squeeze excess marinade from the chicken, and discard. Open the chicken breasts up, and place two slices each of Swiss cheese and ham in the middle of each breast. Roll the breasts and secure the sides and ends with toothpicks. Coat the chicken with the flour mixture, dip in the egg mixture, then re-coat with the flour mixture; set aside. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add sliced garlic and cook until brown; then discard the garlic. Place the coated chicken in the skillet, and cook until golden brown all over, about 5 minutes per side. Place chicken onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until the juices run clear and the internal temperature has reached 165 degrees F (75 degrees C). Warm the remaining buffalo wing sauce in a sauce pan or in the microwave. Remove the toothpicks from the chicken and place on a platter. Pour the warm sauce over the chicken and serve.
