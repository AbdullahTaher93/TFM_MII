Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, garlic and red pepper; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add cumin and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes, broth, corn and black beans; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes to allow flavors to blend. Stir in cilantro and tortilla strips; adjust seasoning, including salt and pepper to taste. Ladle soup into bowls and serve with lime wedges.
