In a large covered pot, steam asparagus 3 to 4 minutes, or until tender but still bright green. Remove from the pot and arrange in a single layer in a 9x13 inch pan. In a medium bowl, mix together sour cream, horseradish, and garlic salt; spoon over asparagus. In a small bowl, stir together the melted butter and bread crumbs; sprinkle over the asparagus. Preheat the oven's broiler and adjust the oven rack so that it is about 3 inches from the heat source. Broil asparagus 1 to 2 minutes, until the topping is toasted, taking care to watch closely to prevent over browning.
