Mix soy sauce, barbeque sauce, 1 tablespoon olive oil, maple syrup, liquid smoke, paprika, chili powder, and cayenne pepper in a shallow dish. Add eggplant; turn to coat each slice evenly. Marinate eggplant in the refrigerator, 6 to 12 hours. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook eggplant slices until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Arrange eggplant slices on a baking sheet; sprinkle brown sugar on top. Roast in the preheated oven, checking frequently, until dark brown, 5 to 8 minutes.
