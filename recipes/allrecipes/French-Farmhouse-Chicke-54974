Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken, in batches, 8 minutes, or until golden; transfer to plate. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet. Cook shallots 2 minutes, or until soft. Add vinegar; cook 3 minutes, or until slightly reduced. Whisk in tomato paste and wine. Return chicken to skillet. Simmer, partially covered, 40 minutes, or until juices run clear when thickest part of chicken is pierced and temperature on instant-read thermometer reaches 180 degrees F. Transfer chicken to platter. Skim off fat from pan juices; whisk in remaining butter. Pour over chicken. (Refrigerate leftovers.)
