Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a muffin pan with twelve Reynolds(R) Foil Baking Cups; set aside. In a large bowl stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Make a well in the center of flour mixture; set aside. Whisk together buttermilk, eggs, butter, and dill in a 2-cup measure. Add all at once to flour mixture. Gently stir just until moistened (batter should be lumpy). Chop 2 ounces of the smoked salmon. Gently fold in salmon. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups, filling each three-fourths full. Bake for 15 minutes or until golden. Cool in cups on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Split the muffins and spread split sides with cream cheese. Sandwich some of the remaining 2 ounces smoked salmon in between muffin halves. Garnish with additional fresh dill.
