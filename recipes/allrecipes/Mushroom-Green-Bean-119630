Place beans in a steamer basket. Place in a saucepan over 1 in. of water; bring to a boil. Cover and steam for 7-8 minutes or until crisp-tender. Meanwhile, in a skillet, saute mushrooms in oil for 5-7 minutes or until tender. Drain beans; add mushrooms. In a small bowl, combine the lemon juice, mustard, salt and pepper. Drizzle over vegetables and toss to coat.
