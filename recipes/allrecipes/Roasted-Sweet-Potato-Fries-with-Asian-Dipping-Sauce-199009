Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. In a bowl, toss potato wedges with oil and season with salt and pepper. Place on a baking sheet in a single layer so that potatoes are not overlapping. Cook on one side until browned, about 20 minutes. Turn and cook on second side for an additional 10 minutes, or until wedges can be pierced with the tip of a paring knife. Serve warm or at room temperature with dipping sauces (see below). Garnish with sliced scallions if desired. While potatoes are baking, make dipping sauces. For Vietnamese Dipping Sauce: In a small bowl, combine garlic, chili sauce, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, lime juice, rice vinegar, and fish sauce. For Creamy Spicy Sauce: In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, garlic, ginger, scallions, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, and chili sauce. Stir each sauce before serving.
