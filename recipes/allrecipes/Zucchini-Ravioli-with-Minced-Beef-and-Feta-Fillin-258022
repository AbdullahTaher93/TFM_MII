Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat; add garlic. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add ground beef; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir 4-ounce can tomato sauce, chile pepper, turmeric, black pepper, cumin, and coriander into the beef mixture; cook and stir until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Peel zucchini into large flat ribbons using a vegetable peeler. Arrange 2 pieces in an "x" shape. Place a piece of feta cheese in the middle of the zucchini "x"; add a spoonful of beef mixture. Carefully wrap the ends of zucchini ribbons over the top to form a ravioli-shape. Repeat with remaining zucchini, feta cheese, and beef mixture. Coat the bottom of a baking dish with 1/2 of the 15-ounce can tomato sauce. Arrange zucchini "ravioli" over sauce. Top with remaining tomato sauce, basil, and Parmesan cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until sauce has thickened and cheese is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
