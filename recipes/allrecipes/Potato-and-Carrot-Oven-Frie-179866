Mix potatoes, carrots, and 1 1/2 tablespoons of the oil; set aside. Grease 2 large, rimmed baking sheets with remaining oil and place in a 425 degrees F oven for 5 minutes. Spread vegetable mixture evenly on hot baking sheets and bake, turning once with a spatula, until vegetables are lightly browned and tender when pierced (about 45 minutes total); switch pan positions halfway through baking. Transfer vegetables to a napkin-lined basket for serving. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with vinegar, if desired.
