Prepare Idahoan Signature™ Russets Mashed Potatoes according to package instructions. Keep warm. Combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, and sriracha hot sauce in a large bowl. Stir until combined. Add beer and continue to stir until batter is smooth. Place pieces of fish to the bowl and coat all sides evenly coated with the batter. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook fish fillets in batches until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain cooked fillets on a wire rack. Season with salt. Serve with a side of Idahoan Signature™ Russets Mashed Potatoes.
