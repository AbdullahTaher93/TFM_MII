Layer three phyllo sheets in a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray, lightly spraying the top of each sheet with nonstick cooking spray. In a bowl, combine the spinach, cheese, 2 eggs, parsley flakes and salt; spread over phyllo dough. Top with remaining phyllo sheets, lightly spraying the top of each sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Using a sharp knife, cut into 12 squares; cover and chill for 1 hour. Beat egg whites, milk and remaining eggs; pour over casserole. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Remove from the refrigerator 1 hour before baking. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 40-50 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean and top is golden brown. Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting.
