Divide asparagus into 2 bunches. Align each bunch in a flat row with ends at the same level. Thread 2 skewers crosswise through each bunch in lower third of stems, where thickest, to form a solid mat. Thread remaining 2 skewers horizontally through onion slices, 2 per skewer. Rinse eggplant in a colander with tbs kosher salt. Pat dry with towel. Brush asparagus, eggplant, and onions with 1 tbs regular olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. To Make Vinaigrette: In a glass Bowl combine Balsamic vinegar, kosher salt, black pepper, garlic, and shallots; mix well. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil while whisking. Grilling: Preheat grill. Grill eggplant, onions, and asparagus uncovered, on a lightly oiled rack (using regular olive oil) over moderate heat, brushing occasionally with 1 tbs regular olive oil turning, until tender, 8-12 minutes total. Remove vegetables from skewers and drizzle with vinaigrette. Top with baby spinach and sprinkle with Parmesan shavings.
