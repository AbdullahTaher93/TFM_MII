Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine buttermilk and oats in a small saucepan; heat just until warm; set aside. Grease muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. In a large bowl, combine honey and vegetable oil with oat mixture. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; stir into wet mixture. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Serve warm.
