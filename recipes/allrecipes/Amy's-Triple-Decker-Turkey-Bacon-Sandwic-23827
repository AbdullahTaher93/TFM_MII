Toast the bread slices. Spread a thin layer of mayonnaise on each slice. Layer bottom slice with lettuce, tomato, turkey bacon, and cheese. Spread another thin layer of mayonnaise on the cheese; repeat layers twice. Top with second slice of bread. Heat in microwave for 45 seconds to 1 minute, or until cheese is melted.
