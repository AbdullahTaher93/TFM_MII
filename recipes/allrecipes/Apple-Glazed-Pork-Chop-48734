Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium skillet over medium heat, brown pork chops about 5 minutes on each side. In a small bowl, mix apple, applesauce, and onion soup mix. Place the browned pork chops in a medium baking dish. Top with the apple mixture. Bake pork chops about 30 minutes in the preheated oven, to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
