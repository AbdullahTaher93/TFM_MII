Cook broccoli in a small amount of water for 5 minutes or until crisp-tender. Rinse with cold water and drain. Place in a large bowl; add tomatoes, mushrooms and onions. Combine dressing ingredients in a jar with a tight-filling lid; shake well. Pour over salad; toss gently. Cover and chill for 1 hour. Serve with a slotted spoon.
