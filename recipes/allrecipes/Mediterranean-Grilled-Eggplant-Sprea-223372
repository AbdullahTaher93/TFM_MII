Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Arrange red bell pepper, eggplant, and onion slices on on the preheated grill; cook until red pepper is charred and eggplant and onion are tender with grill marks, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Place red pepper in a paper bag and close tightly to 'sweat', about 10 minutes; peel the charred skin off the pepper. Blend red bell pepper, eggplant, onion, olive oil, basil, oregano, lemon juice, sea salt, and black pepper in a food processor until smooth and spreadable. Stir in feta cheese.
