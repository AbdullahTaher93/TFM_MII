Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Press pastry into a 9-1/2 inch tart pan with a removable bottom; set aside. Lightly whip egg yolk with the creme fraiche and set aside. Bring milk to a boil, stirring constantly. Turn off heat and add chocolate to milk. Stir mixture until chocolate is completely melted. Slowly add the creme fraiche egg mixture to the chocolate mixture, stirring until thoroughly mixed. Spread into prepared pastry shell and place in preheated oven. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes; remove tart from oven and cool to room temperature (tart will set as it cools). Chill in refrigerator for at least one hour before serving. Cut into thin wedges and top with a small dollop of creme fraiche, if desired.
