Preheat the oven broiler. Place the ground coffee on a sheet of aluminum foil, and place about 6 inches from the heat source. Broil for about 45 seconds, shaking the foil about every 10 seconds, or whenever you see smoke. In a small bowl, stir together the coffee, black pepper, salt, cayenne pepper, and cumin. Rub into steaks, or pound in with a meat mallet. Grill as desired.
