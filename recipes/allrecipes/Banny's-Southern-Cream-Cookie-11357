Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets. Cream the shortening with 2 cups of the white sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, vanilla and sour cream; mixing well. Stir in the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda into the shortening mixture to make a stiff dough. Add the chopped black walnuts. Drop teaspoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets. Mix the 3 tablespoons with the ground cinnamon. Grease the bottom of a small glass. Dip it into the cinnamon-sugar mixture and gently press the cookies to flatten the balls of dough slightly. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 to 15 minutes or until centers are done.
