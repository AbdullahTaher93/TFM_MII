Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 6 muffin cups with cooking spray. Whisk coffee, eggs, and coconut oil together in a bowl. Combine coconut flour, brown sugar, and shredded coconut together in a separate bowl. Stir coffee mixture into flour mixture until batter is just combined; spoon into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
