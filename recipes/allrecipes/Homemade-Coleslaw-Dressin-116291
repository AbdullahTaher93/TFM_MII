In a heavy saucepan, whisk the sugar, salt, mustard, paprika and egg yolks until smooth. Gradually whisk in water and vinegar. Cook and stir over medium heat until a thermometer reads 160 degrees F and mixture is thickened. Remove from the heat; cool to room temperature. Place the cabbage in a bowl; add dressing and toss to coat. Refrigerate until serving.
