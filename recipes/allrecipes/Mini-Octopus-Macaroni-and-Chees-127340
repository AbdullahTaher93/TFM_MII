Cut wieners in half lengthwise with sharp knife, starting each cut about 1 inch from one of the ends of each wiener. Roll each wiener one-quarter turn and cut a second lengthwise slice in wiener, again starting about 1 inch from the uncut end. (This will form 4 "legs" of the "octopus.") Using a small knife or kitchen scissors, cut each leg lengthwise in half, about 1 inch from the uncut end, creating a total of 8 legs in each wiener. Poke 2 holes into the uncut portion of each wiener for the "eyes." Add wieners to pot of boiling water and cook as directed on package, watching each wiener turn into an octopus right before your eyes. Meanwhile, prepare Dinner as directed on pkg. Spoon Dinner evenly into 4 small bowls; top each with an octopus.
