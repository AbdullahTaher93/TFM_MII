Cook the beef, onion and carrots in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until the beef is well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat. Stir the picante sauce in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, adding the water if needed until desired consistency. Place the penne and cilantro into a large bowl. Add the beef mixture and toss to coat.
