Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place the potatoes into a large pot of salted water. Bring to a boil, and boil for 1 minute. Drain, rinse in cold water to cool, drain again, and pat dry. In a medium bowl, stir together the ricotta cheese, parsley, salt, pepper and nutmeg. In a measuring cup, whisk the egg with a fork, then fill the cup with enough cream to make 1 cup. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg also. Arrange a layer of slightly overlapping potato slices in the bottom of the buttered baking dish. Dot with 1/3 of the ricotta cheese. Sprinkle with 1/3 of the Gruyere cheese. Repeat layers two more times, and end with a layer of potatoes on top. Pour the egg and cream evenly over the potatoes. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until the potatoes are tender, and the cheese is browned and bubbly. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving to allow the sauce to thicken.
