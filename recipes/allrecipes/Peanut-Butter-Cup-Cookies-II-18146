Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease mini muffin pans. Sift together the flour and baking soda. Set aside. In a medium bowl, cream together the white sugar, brown sugar, and shortening. Add the peanut butter and egg; mix until blended. Stir in the milk and vanilla alternately with the dry ingredients. Press rounded tablespoons of dough into the prepared mini muffin cups. Press dough up the sides of the cup, leaving a hole in the middle. Press a peanut butter cup into the center of each cup, being careful not to push all the way through the dough. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool completely before removing from pans.
