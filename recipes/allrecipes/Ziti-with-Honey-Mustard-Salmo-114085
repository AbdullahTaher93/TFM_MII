Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly oil a small roasting pan. Put the salmon in the pan, skin side down. Spread the honey over the salmon and then sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper. Roast the salmon until just barely done, about 12 minutes, depending upon the thickness of the fillet. Remove from the oven. In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over moderately low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the wine and simmer until about 1 tablespoon remains, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the mustard, cream, salt, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Turn off the heat. Flake the salmon and stir it and the parsley into the sauce. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the ziti until just done, about 13 minutes. Drain the pasta and toss with the sauce.
