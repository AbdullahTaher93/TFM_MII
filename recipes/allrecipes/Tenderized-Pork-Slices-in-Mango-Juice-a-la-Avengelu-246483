Heat olive oil in a stockpot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until translucent and beginning to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add pork, mango slices and juice, liquid seasoning, and pepper; cover and reduce heat to low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until pork is very tender, 1 to 2 hours.
