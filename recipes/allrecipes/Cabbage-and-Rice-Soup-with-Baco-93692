Place the bacon slab on a cutting board. Cut crosswise at 1/2-inch intervals. Separating some of the pieces, scatter the bacon in a large pot set over medium heat. Cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes or until crisp. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon to a paper-towel-lined plate. Pour off and discard all the fat. Add the oil to the pot; heat until warm. Add the leeks and carrots. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes, or until golden. Add the wine. Increase the heat to high. Bring to a boil and cook for about 5 minutes, or until reduced to about 1/4 cup. Add the cabbage, broth, rice, bay leaves, and 1/2 to 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover partially and cook for 20 minutes, or until the rice is tender. Add the pepper. Remove and discard the bay leaves. Beat the egg in a medium bowl. Gradually add 1 to 2 cups of broth skimmed from the soup. Add the egg mixture to the pot. Cook, stirring constantly, for about 2 minutes, or until the soup thickens slightly. Season with salt to taste. Sprinkle each serving with the reserved bacon.
