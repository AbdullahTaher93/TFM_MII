Pour milk into large bowl. Add dry pudding mix. Beat with wire whisk 2 min. or until well blended. Gently stir in 1-1/2 cups of the whipped topping and the chopped cookies. Spoon into crust. Spread with remaining 1/2 cup whipped topping. Melt chocolate as directed on package; drizzle over pie. Refrigerate 2 hours or freeze until firm. If frozen, remove pie from freezer about 10 min. before serving; let stand at room temperature to soften slightly. Store leftovers in refrigerator or freezer.
