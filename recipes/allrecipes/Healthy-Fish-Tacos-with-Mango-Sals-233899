Stir mango, avocado, tomato, red onion, red pepper, parsley, canola oil, brown sugar, lime juice, cider vinegar, hot pepper sauce, salt, and ground black pepper together in a bowl. Refrigerate salsa for at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Heat taco shells in preheated oven until crisp, about 5 minutes. Season mahi mahi with 1 teaspoon ground black pepper, paprika, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook mahi mahi in olive oil until fish flakes easily, about 3 minutes per side. Place mahi mahi slices in taco shells and top with mango salsa.
