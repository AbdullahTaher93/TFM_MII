Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the onion and ham; cook until onions turn translucent. Pour in the water; season with the boullion cube, parsley, basil, and black pepper. Simmer for 30 minutes, uncovered, stirring occasionally. Pour in the heavy cream, and simmer for an additional 2 minutes.
