Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin with cooking spray. Mix pancake mix, mozzarella cheese, and onion together in a large bowl. Add kale, milk, and ricotta cheese; mix until combined. Scoop batter into the prepared muffin tin. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
