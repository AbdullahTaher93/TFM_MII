In a mixing bowl, cream butter and brown sugar. Beat in egg yolks and vanilla. Combine flour, pecans and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Shape into two 10-in. rolls; wrap each in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours. Unwrap and cut into 1/4-in. slices. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 11-13 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks to cool. For filling, heat butter in a saucepan over medium heat until golden brown. Remove from the heat; add confectioners' sugar, vanilla and enough cream to achieve spreading consistency. Spread on the bottom of half of the cookies; top with remaining cookies.
