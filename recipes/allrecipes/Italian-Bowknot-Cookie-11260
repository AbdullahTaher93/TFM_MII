Mix the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar together. Cut in the butter until well-blended. Stir in the eggs and mix thoroughly. Knead dough on a floured surface until dough is elastic. Let dough rest for 1 hour. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Divide dough into 4 parts, keeping each piece covered until ready to use. Roll each piece into a thin rectangle, about 8x10 inches. Cut dough into strips about 8 inches long and 3/4 inch wide. Tie each strip into loose knot. Fry cookies in hot oil 3 to 4 at a time, until golden brown. Transfer cookies to a paper towel-lined plate. Drain well and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar and honey, if desired. Serve hot or cold. Store any uneaten cookies in an airtight container (see Editor's Note).
