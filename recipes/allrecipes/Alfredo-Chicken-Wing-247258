Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a large rimmed baking sheet. Place wings on prepared baking sheet.. Sprinkle with seasoned salt; mix to evenly season the wings. Arrange in a single layer. Bake in preheated oven until crisp and cooked through, about 1 hour. Turn on oven broiler; finish the wings under the broiler to crisp both sides, about 1 minute per side. Melt butter over medium-low heat in a small saucepan. Add cream and garlic stirring until small bubbles form. Add grated cheese and continue to stir until well blended. Remove pan from heat. Toss wings with Alfredo sauce and serve.
