Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine coconut, milk and vanilla. Drop by heaping teaspoonfuls, about 1 inch apart, onto baking sheets sprayed with cooking spray. To prevent burning, press down any ends of coconut shreds with back of spoon. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Immediately transfer cookies from baking sheets to wire racks. Cool completely. Melt chocolate as directed on package. Dip cookies halfway into chocolate; return to racks. Let stand until chocolate is firm.
