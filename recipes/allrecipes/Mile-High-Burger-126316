Coat a grill rack or broiler-pan rack with cooking spray. Preheat the grill or broiler. Place the sun-dried tomatoes in a medium bowl. Cover with boiling water and soak for 10 minutes, or until very soft. Drain and discard the liquid. In a food processor, combine the tomatoes, mayonnaise, basil, and garlic. Process until smooth. Combine the beef and tomato mixture in the same bowl. Mix just until blended. Shape into 4 burgers. Place the burgers on the prepared rack. Cook 4 inches from the heat for 4 minutes per side, or until a thermometer inserted in the center registers 160 degrees F and the meat is no longer pink. Top each burger with a slice of pepper and cheese. Cook for 30 seconds longer, or until the cheese melts. Divide the lettuce among the buns. Top each with a burger.
