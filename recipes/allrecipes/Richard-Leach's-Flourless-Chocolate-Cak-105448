Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Butter an 8- inch round cake pan and line bottom with a parchment paper cake circle. Set aside. Mix the cornstarch and cocoa powder together. Set aside. Place chocolate, sour cream and butter in the top bowl of a double boiler. Heat over medium heat until mixture has melted. Stir frequently. Mix 1 cup SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, egg yolks and water in a medium size bowl using a wire whisk. Whisk until thoroughly mixed. Pour melted chocolate mixture into the egg yolk mixture, gently folding chocolate into the egg yolks. Whip egg whites in an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Add the remaining 1 cup SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and whisk briefly. Fold 1/3 of the whipped egg whites into the chocolate mixture until lightly blended. Fold in the blended cornstarch and cocoa powder. Fold in the remaining whipped egg whites. Pour cake batter into prepared cake pan. Place the cake pan in a larger baking pan. Pour about 1/2 inch of water into the larger baking pan to create a water bath. Bake in preheated 250 degrees F oven for 50-60 minutes or until firm. Remove cake from water bath. Cool cake completely before removing from the pan. Carefully invert the pan onto a serving plate to unmold.
