Combine chicken stock and tortilla strips in a large pot. Cook over medium heat until strips soften and broth thickens slightly. Stir in green and red enchilada sauces and cumin. Stir in turkey and half-and-half; heat through but do not boil. Divide soup among four bowls and garnish with diced tomato, jalapeno, avocado and cheese.
