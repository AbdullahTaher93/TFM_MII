Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.) In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, SPLENDA(R) and vanilla. With an electric mixer, beat on medium speed until smooth. Blend in eggs and egg whites. Reserve 1 cup of cream cheese mixture and set aside. Pour remaining mixture into pie crust. Into the reserved cream cheese mixture, stir pumpkin puree, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Pour over the top of the plain filling in the crust. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until center of pie is almost set. Allow to cool, then refrigerate 4 hours or overnight. Top with whipped topping before serving.
