Place each chop between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. With a heavy, flat-sided mallet, pound meat firmly but gently all over to a thickness of 1/4 to 1/3 inch. Coat pork lightly with flour. Melt butter in a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. When butter sizzles, add pork. Cook, turning once, until pork is well browned on both sides and no longer pink in center; cut to test (4 to 5 minutes). Transfer to a warm platter and keep warm while preparing sauce. Add shallot and pepper to pan; stir until shallot is soft (1 1/2 to 2 minutes). Add wine, orange peel, and juice. Increase heat to high and boil, stirring often, until sauce is reduced to 1/2 cup (3 to 4 minutes). Pour sauce over pork.
