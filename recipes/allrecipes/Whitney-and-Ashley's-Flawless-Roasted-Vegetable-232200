Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a shallow baking pan with Reynolds(R) Parchment Paper. Place vegetables in a large bowl. Add olive oil, seasoning or herbs, salt and pepper and toss to coat. Spread vegetables in a single layer in the parchment paper-lined pan. Sprinkle additional Italian seasonings or fresh herbs on top of the vegetables, if desired. Place pan of vegetables into the oven on the top rack. Bake 15 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender. Squeeze lemon over vegetables for even more flavor.
