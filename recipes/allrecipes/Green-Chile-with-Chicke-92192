Pour oil into a 4- to 5-quart pan over high heat. Add pork and brown on both sides for 5 to 8 minutes, turning once. Pour onion around pork and stir often until onion is limp, about 5 minutes. Turn pork to avoid scorching. Meanwhile, in a food processor, whirl chilies until coarsely pureed. Add to pan along with chicken broth; bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer until pork is tender when pierced, 30 to 40 minutes. Lift pork from pan, trim off and discard bone and fat. Finely chop pork and return to pan. Add salt to taste. Turn heat to high, stir in cornstarch mixture and stir until boiling. Serve hot, or let cool, cover and chill up to 2 days; reheat to serve. Arrange warm chicken and rice on a large platter; ladle some of the green chile gravy lightly over the chicken; garnish with cilantro and surround with limes. Serve portions topped generously with remaining green chile and add juice from limes to taste.
