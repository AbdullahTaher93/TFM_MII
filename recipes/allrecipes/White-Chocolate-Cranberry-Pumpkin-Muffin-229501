Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 3 muffin pans or line with muffin wrappers. Mix flour, white sugar, salt, baking soda, and allspice together in a bowl. Whisk eggs in a separate large bowl. Add vegetable oil, pumpkin, orange juice, vanilla extract to eggs; whisk until smooth. Stir flour mixture into pumpkin mixture until just combined; fold in white chocolate chips and cranberries. Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups. Sprinkle each muffin with brown sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes.
