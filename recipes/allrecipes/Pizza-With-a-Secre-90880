Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Unfold dough. Coat a 12- to 14-inch pizza pan or a 14- by 17-inch baking sheet with cooking oil spray. Pat dough into a 12-inch-diameter round with a slightly thicker 1/2-inch-wide rim. Bake crust on lowest rack in oven until lightly browned on bottom, 6 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, in a bowl, mix tomato paste, oregano, and 2 tablespoons water. Spread tomato mixture over partly baked crust, but not the rim. Sprinkle with capers. Drop shredded mozzarella cheese in clusters onto tomato mixture, then sprinkle evenly with parmesan. Return pizza to oven and bake until mozzarella softens (about 3 minutes). Scatter basil and chili flakes over pizza, then serve hot.
