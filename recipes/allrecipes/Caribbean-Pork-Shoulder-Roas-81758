To make the marinade, mix together in a bowl all ingredients except the pork. Place roast in a gallon size zip-lock baggie. Pour the marinade over the roast and close the baggie trapping as little air as possible. Refrigerate at least 8 hours and up to 2 days. Be sure to turn the roast every time you open the refrigerator so that all sides are in the down position for at least 2-4 hours. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Place pork in a roasting pan along with the marinade. Cover with a pan lid or foil. Roast for 2 hours, then remove the cover and continue roasting for at least another 30 minutes. The roast should be cooked until the center reaches at least 150 degrees F (slightly pink) or up to 165 degrees F (well done). Remove from oven and loosely cover with foil for at least 10 minutes before carving. Scrape the bottom and sides of the roasting pan with a wooden spoon to loosen up and dissolve any dark bits. Strain the liquids into a sauce pan and bring to a slow boil to reduce slightly. Taste and adjust seasoning accordingly. Add a drop or two of extracts (orange, lemon and/or lime) to intensify the citrus flavors, but be careful not to over power the cumin (which should be the predominate flavor). Carve the roast into thick slices and place them on a platter. Add the juices from carving into the sauce and stir well. Drizzle the sauce over the pork.
