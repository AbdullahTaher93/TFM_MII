Combine flour, oats, sugar, baking powder and salt in large bowl; set aside. Stir together milk, Egg Beaters, yogurt, oil and vanilla in small bowl. Add to flour mixture; stir just until blended. (Do not overmix. Batter still should be slightly lumpy.) Spray griddle with cooking spray. Heat over medium heat until hot or heat electric griddle to 400 degrees F. Pour about 1/4 cup batter onto hot griddle for each pancake. Cook 2 to 3 minutes or until bubbles form on top and bottom is golden brown. Turn and cook side until golden brown. Repeat with remaining batter. Drizzle each serving with 1 tablespoon honey; top with fresh fruit. Serve immediately.
