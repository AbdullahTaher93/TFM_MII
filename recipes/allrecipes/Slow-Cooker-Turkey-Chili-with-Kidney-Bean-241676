Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir turkey, onions, and Anaheim chile peppers in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and transfer turkey mixture to a slow cooker. Mix kidney beans, Mexican-style tomato sauce, chili powder, cornmeal, garlic, onion flakes, cocoa powder, cumin, ground black pepper, sugar, parsley, oregano, beef base, red pepper flakes, and coriander into turkey mixture. Add enough water to reach desired consistency. Cook on High for 4 hours (or on Low for 8 to 10 hours).
