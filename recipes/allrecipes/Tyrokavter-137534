In a large bowl, or in the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the cream cheese, feta cheese, hot pepper sauce, white pepper, and lemon juice. Mix on low speed until blended. Gradually mix in the olive oil until it has fully incorporated. Stir in half and half until the mixture is smooth and soft. Stir in the roasted red peppers if using. Cover and store in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
