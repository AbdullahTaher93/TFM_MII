Heat skillet sprayed with cooking spray over medium-high heat. Cook chicken breasts in the skillet until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut chicken into strips. Whisk apple juice, lemon juice, cornstarch, and chicken bouillon in a skillet until smooth. Heat skillet over medium heat, stirring until sauce is thick and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes; continue cooking for 3 more minutes. Place chicken strips into the apple juice sauce and simmer for 6 to 8 minutes before serving.
