Whisk eggs and egg yolk together in a bowl. Add Pecorino cheese and mix well. Heat olive oil in a large wok or skillet over medium heat; cook and stir pancetta until cooked through but not crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the zucchini noodles (zoodles); cook and stir until zoodles are warmed but not soft and pancetta is slightly crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove wok from heat. Pour egg mixture over zoodles and stir until evenly coated. Top zoodles with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and black pepper.
