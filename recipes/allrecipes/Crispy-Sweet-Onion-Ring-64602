In a large bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy. Separate the onion slices into individual rings. Add the onion rings to the bowl with egg whites and toss to coat. Mix corn flake crumbs with flour, chicken granules and chili powder; place mixture on a sheet of wax paper. Roll the coated rings a few at a time in the crumb mixture. Place rings on the baking sheet and coat with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 375 degrees for about 15 minutes, turning once, or until outside is crispy and onion is soft.
