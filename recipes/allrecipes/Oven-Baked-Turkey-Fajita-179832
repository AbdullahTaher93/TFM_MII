Mix together lime juice, vinegar, garlic, honey, coriander, and cumin. Pour into a 1-gallon heavy resealable plastic food bag or a large bowl. Add turkey, mix well, and seal bag or cover bowl. Chill at least 20 minutes or up to 1 day; mix often. Stem, seed, and thinly slice bell pepper; thinly slice onion. Combine vegetables in a lightly oiled 10- by 15-inch rimmed pan. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven for 10 minutes. Push vegetables to 1 side of pan; lift turkey from marinade and lay in pan; save marinade. Spread vegetables around meat. Frequently baste meat and vegetables with marinade; bake until turkey is no longer pink in thickest part (cut to test), about 20 minutes. Turn vegetables often. Thinly slice turkey and divide equally with vegetables among tortillas. Roll to enclose; eat out of hand, adding lime.
