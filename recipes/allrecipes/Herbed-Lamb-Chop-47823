In a large, nonreactive container, blend the olive oil, red wine vinegar, white wine, lemon juice, garlic, and onion. Season with tarragon, parsley, and pepper. Place lamb chops in the mixture. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator about 2 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate. Grill lamb chops on the prepared grill 5 minutes per side, to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Discard remaining marinade.
