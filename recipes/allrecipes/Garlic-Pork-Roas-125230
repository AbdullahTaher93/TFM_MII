With a sharp knife, cut a deep pocket between each rib on meaty side of roast. Combine green pepper, green onions, celery and garlic; stuff deeply into pockets. Season roast with salt and cayenne pepper. Insert meat thermometer. Place roast, rib side down, in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 2-3 hours or until thermometer reads 170 degrees F. Let stand for 15 minutes before carving.
