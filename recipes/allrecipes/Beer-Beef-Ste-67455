In a bowl, mix the flour, salt, and pepper. Toss the beef in the mixture to coat. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat, and brown the beef on all sides. Pour in the broth, beer, tomato sauce, and tomato paste. Stir in the potatoes, mixed vegetables, and cabbage. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
