In a bowl, toss together the coconut, flour and salt. Stir in sweetened condensed milk and almond extract until blended. (Mixture will be thick and sticky.) Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls 3 in. apart on baking sheets lightly coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 300 degrees F for 18-22 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Cool for 2 minutes before removing to wire racks.
