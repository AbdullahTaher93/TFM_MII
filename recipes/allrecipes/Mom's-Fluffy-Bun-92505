Dissolve yeast in 1 teaspoon sugar and 1/2 cup warm water. Set aside in a warm place for 10 minutes. Beat together eggs, 3/4 cup sugar, canola oil, 2 cups water and salt. Add yeast mixture and combine. Add approximately 4 cups of flour. Mix until a round dough is formed. If using a dough hook or kneading by hand, knead for approximately 5 to 10 minutes adding flour as you go. Knead until dough is soft, smooth and silky to the touch. Place dough in a large oiled bowl and put in a warm place to rise. Allow the dough to rise for 1 hour. Punch down. Repeat this process 3 times and then form dough into buns. Place the buns on oiled cookie sheets not quite 1 inch apart. Let rise for 2 to 3 hours and then bake until browned, about 15 to 20 minutes in a 375 degrees F oven. This recipe doubles well.
