Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 9x13 inch baking pan. Combine the oats, butter or margarine, white sugar and brown sugar and press into the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 to 12 minutes. Melt the chocolate chips and peanut butter together over low heat. Spread over the top of the baked oatmeal mixture. Cool and cut into squares.
