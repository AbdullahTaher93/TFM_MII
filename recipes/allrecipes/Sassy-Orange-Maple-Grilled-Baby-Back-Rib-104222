Remove membrane from the bone side of the back rib or ask your butcher to do this for you. Rub the ribs, on both sides, with 2 tablespoons of Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM), pressing the Hot Salt into the meat. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Place the onion slices in the bottom of a 4 inch deep roasting pan. Mix together the ginger, 1 cup of the orange juice and water. Pour mixture into the bottom of the pan. Place the ribs meat side down on top of the onions. Place three to four slices of orange on the back of each rib. Cover the pan with a lid or aluminum foil. Braise ribs in oven for 2 to 2 1/2 hours until tender. The bones should easily wiggle and pull from the meat. Remove from oven and let cool slightly. Carefully remove ribs from pan, discarding braising liquid. In a bowl combine the 1/4 cup of remaining orange juice, maple syrup, barbecue sauce and 1/2 teaspoon of Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM). Preheat grill to medium high. Grill ribs for 4 to 6 minutes per side, basting with the sassy orange maple barbecue sauce until ribs are lightly charred, heated through and sticky. Cut between every third rib and serve with grilled corn on the cob, sweet peppers and red onions; all seasoned with Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM).
