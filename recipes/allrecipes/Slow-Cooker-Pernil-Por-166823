Place the garlic, onion, oregano, cumin, chile pepper, salt, and pepper into a blender. Pour in the olive oil and vinegar. Puree until smooth. Spread this mixture all over the pork loin, and place into a slow cooker. Cook on Low until the pork is fork tender, 6 to 8 hours. When ready, cut the pork into chunks, or shred; garnish with lime wedges to serve.
