In a small saucepan, combine the bulgur and the water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, until the bulgur is tender and most of the water has been absorbed, about 15 minutes. Drain and transfer to a medium bowl to cool. When the bulgur is cool, stir in the scallions, cucumber, radishes, carrot, parsley, and mint. Add the tuna with its oil, the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Mix gently to combine.
