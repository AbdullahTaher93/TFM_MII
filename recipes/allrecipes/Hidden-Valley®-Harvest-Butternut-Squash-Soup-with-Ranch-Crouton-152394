Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, toss the cubes of squash with olive oil and arrange on a large rimmed baking sheet. Place the apples, cut side down on the baking sheet. Roast until tender when pierced with a fork, about 30 to 35 minutes. Place the cubes of roasted squash in the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Use a spoon to scrape out the flesh of the apples, and add to the work bowl. Discard the apple skins. Puree the squash and apples until smooth. Add 1 cup of the stock and continue processing until smooth. Put this mixture in a 3 1/2- to 4-quart saucepan, add the remaining 3 cups of stock, the cream, nutmeg, and sugar. Bring to a boil, and then reduce to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. CROUTONS: Place the bread cubes in a large mixing bowl. Toss with the seasoning mix until thoroughly coated. Drizzle the olive oil over and toss the bread cubes until thoroughly coated. Spread in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until toasty brown, about 10 to 12 minutes. When ready to serve, ladle the soup into a warmed soup tureen or individual soup bowls, garnish with the croutons, and serve immediately.
