Whisk the balsamic vinegar and Dijon mustard together in a small bowl. Whisk in the shallot, garlic, cumin, and crushed red pepper. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil, whisking constantly until fully incorporated, and continue to whisk for an additional 1 to 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Let the dressing sit for 10 minutes to allow the flavor to develop.
