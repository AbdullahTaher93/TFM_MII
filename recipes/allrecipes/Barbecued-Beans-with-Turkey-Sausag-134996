Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Put the sausage in a 2-quart baking dish and bake until browned (about 5 minutes). Drain the fat and set the dish aside. Coat a skillet with nonstick spray and saute the onion, mushrooms, and garlic over medium-high heat for 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to the baking dish; then add the beans and tomatoes, plus salt and pepper to taste. Bake for 20 minutes or until the edges bubble. In a small bowl, mix the bread crumbs with the olive oil. Sprinkle over the sausage mixture, and broil 4 to 5 inches from the heat for 3 minutes, so the top is golden brown.
