Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Mix rhubarb, strawberries, sugar and tapioca in large bowl. Let stand 15 minutes. Place 1 of the pie crusts in 9-inch pie plate. Fill with fruit mixture; dot with butter. Cover with remaining crust; seal and flute edge. Cut several slits in top crust to allow steam to escape. Bake 45 minutes or until juices form bubbles that burst slowly. Cool.
