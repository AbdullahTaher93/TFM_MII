In a pot, melt butter over medium heat. Add garlic, curry powder and ginger and saute for 30 sec or until softened. Add carrots, sweet potato and red pepper and saute for about 5 min or until carrots start to soften. Stir in broth and 1/2 tsp (1 ml) salt. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil, stirring often. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for 10 min or until vegetables are almost tender. Whisk flour into cream and stir into pan with chickpeas and green peas. Simmer, stirring, for about 3 min or until sauce has thickened and peas are hot. Season to taste with salt. Serve topped with yogurt and with lime wedges to squeeze over top.
