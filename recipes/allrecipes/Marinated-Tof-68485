Drain tofu and cut into slices or cubes, depending upon your recipe. Place in a shallow dish, and coat with barbeque sauce. Cover, and refrigerate 3 hours or overnight, turning occasionally. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook with a small amount of sauce, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides. Return tofu to the baking dish. Bake in preheated oven for approximately 10 minutes.
