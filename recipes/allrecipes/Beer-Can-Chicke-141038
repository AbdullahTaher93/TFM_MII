Heat grill to medium heat. Rub outside of chicken with 1 tablespoon rub. Open beer; remove 1/2 cup beer (discard or drink) and add 1-tablespoon rub to beer in can. Insert beer can into cavity of chicken. Combine remaining 2 teaspoons of rub and Italian dressing; set aside. Place chicken vertically over indirect heat, using the base of the beer can and the two legs to form a tripod to balance the chicken upright. Grill, covered, about 1 1/2 hours, basting twice with dressing mixture, until chicken registers 180 degrees F on a thermometer inserted into thickest flesh of thigh. Using a clean towel, grasp the chicken by the neck cavity and insert a flat metal spatula under the beer can to remove chicken from grill, keeping chicken upright. Let rest 5 minutes. Again using towel to grasp chicken by the neck cavity, slowly lift chicken, using an oven mitt or another thick towel, grasp beer can and remove carefully. Serve.
