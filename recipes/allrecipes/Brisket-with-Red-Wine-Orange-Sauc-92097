Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. With a spoon, in a roaster or covered casserole into which the brisket fits comfortably, stir together soup mix, wine, water, and flour until blended. Stir in basil, thyme, marmalade, orange peel, sugar, garlic, and pepper. Add brisket, spooning some of the liquid over the top. Cover and bake for 4 hours, basting every hour, until tender when pierced. Remove brisket to a carving board. Slice thinly against the grain. (Chilling first makes it easier to slice.) Overlap slices in roasting pan. Pour sauce over meat. Add mushrooms to pan, basting with sauce. Increase oven temperature to 325 or 350 degrees F; bake, covered, for 30 to 40 minutes, basting once, until brisket slices are heated through and mushrooms are tender.
