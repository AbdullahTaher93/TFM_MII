Place bacon in a skillet over medium high-heat, and cook until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. In a large bowl, toss together the bacon, broccoli, celery, peas, cranberries, green onions, green grapes, red grapes, and almonds. In a separate bowl, whisk together the sugar, salt, vinegar, grated onion, Parmesan cheese, and mayonnaise. Pour dressing over the salad. Gently toss to coat.
