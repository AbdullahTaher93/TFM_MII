Crush 10 wafers to form coarse crumbs; place 1/4 crumbs in each of 2 parfait glasses. Top each with 1 Tbsp. COOL WHIP, 2 banana slices and half of 1 pudding snack. Repeat layers of crumbs, bananas and pudding. Refrigerate 15 min. Meanwhile, wrap reserved banana slices tightly in plastic wrap; refrigerate until ready to use. Top parfaits with remaining COOL WHIP, wafers and banana slices just before serving.
