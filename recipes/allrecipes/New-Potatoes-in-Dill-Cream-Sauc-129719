Place potatoes in large saucepan: add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium; cook 15 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Meanwhile, mix cream cheese spread, milk and green pepper in large microwavable bowl. Microwave on HIGH 40 to 50 seconds or until cream cheese spread is melted; stir until well blended. Stir in dill. Add drained potatoes; toss lightly to coat.
