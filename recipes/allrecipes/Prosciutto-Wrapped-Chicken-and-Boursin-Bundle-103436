One at a time, place chicken breasts in an unsealed, gallon-size plastic bag. Place flat on work surface. Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, flatten each piece to about 1/4-inch thick. Divide cheese spread into quarters. Place chicken breasts on a work surface and place piece of cheese in center of each. Fold all 4 sides of each breast over cheese to form a flat 4-1/2x 2-1/2 inch bundle. Wrap each bundle with a piece of Prosciutto. Bundles can be covered and refrigerated for up to 6 hours. When ready to cook, melt butter in large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. When butter is foamy, add chicken bundles, seam-side down. Use tongs to turn bundles, browning them all over. Reduce heat to medium, cover and cook for 10 minutes or until chicken is cooked through, and no longer pink.
