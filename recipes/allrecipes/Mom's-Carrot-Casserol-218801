Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in cream of celery soup, milk, and salt and pepper. Mix in the shredded carrots, then spread carrot mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Combine the bread crumbs, Cheddar cheese, and melted butter in another bowl. Sprinkle the cheese mixture on top of the carrots. Bake in the preheated oven until browned and bubbly, 45 to 50 minutes.
