Divide half of the mango pieces among 4 glasses and add a few tablespoons of yogurt to each glass. Stir the raspberry jam to soften it and spoon on top of the yogurt. Add one or two additional layers of mangoes, yogurt and jam, then top with the almonds and a drizzle of honey. (You can prepare the dessert a few hours ahead; refrigerate it without the nuts and honey and add them just before serving.)
