Bring carrots and water to a boil in a saucepan, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the carrots are tender, about 10 minutes. Drain carrots; stir in butter until carrots are coated. Stir in brown sugar, ginger, and salt; bring to a boil, and cook the carrots, stirring often, until the carrots are glazed, 2 to 3 minutes.
