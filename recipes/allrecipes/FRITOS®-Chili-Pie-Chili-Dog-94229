Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In bowl, combine corn chips, chili, cheese and onion. Split hot dogs lengthwise down the middle (but not completely through). Place chili filling down the center of each dog. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until warmed through. If desired, sprinkle with additional chips before serving.
