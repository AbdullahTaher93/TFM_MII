In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the butter, sugar, milk powder, salt, aniseed, eggs and 2 cups flour. Beat on low speed for 3 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into thirds. Shape each into a 15-in. rope. Place ropes on a greased baking sheet; braid. Pinch ends to seal and tick under. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Beat egg and milk; brush over braid. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, almonds and sugar. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature.
