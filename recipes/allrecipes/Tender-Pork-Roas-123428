Cut roast in half; place in a 5-qt. slow cooker. Combine remaining ingredients; pour over roast. Cover and cook on low for 8-9 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees (63 degrees C). Remove roast to a serving platter and keep warm. If desired, skim fat from pan juices and thicken for gravy.
