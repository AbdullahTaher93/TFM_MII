For Ragout: In medium saucepan, heat butter over medium heat. Cook and stir shallot and garlic 2 to 3 minutes. Add beans, tomatoes and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat; set aside and keep warm until ready to serve. For Leek Garnish: Blanch leeks in boiling water for 1 minute; strain and dry thoroughly with paper towels. Heat oil over medium-high heat until hot. Fry leeks until golden; drain on paper towels and set aside. For Lemon Cilantro Sauce: In medium saucepan, combine wine, shallot, ginger, lemon juice and half of the cilantro (leaves and stems) over medium-high heat. Reduce by until about 3 tablespoons liquid remains. Add cream; bring to a boil. Whisk in 2 pieces of butter at a time, waiting until melted before adding more. Remove from heat; strain sauce through a strainer into another saucepan; set aside and keep warm until ready to serve. Chop remaining 1/2 bunch cilantro (leaves only). Stir in cilantro just before serving. For Red Snapper: Season fish filets with salt and pepper, as desired. Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat.

Top with fish filet. Place mound of fried shallots over filet; spoon lemon cilantro sauce around the center of plate.
