Blanch the green beans by dropping them into boil water for 2 minutes, then strain and put them in an ice water bath to stop the cooking. (If you use frozen beans then blanching is not necessary, just thaw them completely). Put everything into a large re-sealable plastic bag or large Tupperware and shake/toss to get everything coated and mixed together. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours. Toss the bag several times while it marinates. Serve cold or at room temperature.
