Cut cucumber in half lengthwise and gently scrape out seeds with a spoon. Cut each half crosswise into 2-inch pieces. Cut each piece lengthwise into thin, uniform strips and transfer to a bowl. Toss cucumber with 1 teaspoon salt and let stand 15 minutes. Meanwhile, cut green onions and bell peppers into thin, uniform strips, about 2 inches long. Transfer cucumber to a fine-mesh sieve, rinse, and drain well. Whisk together vinegar, sesame oil, crushed red pepper, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Add cucumber, green onions, bell peppers, and cilantro, and toss well.
