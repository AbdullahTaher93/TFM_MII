In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the milk, egg, sugar, shortening, salt and 2 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn on a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; shape into 32 pieces. To form knots, roll each piece into a 10-in. rope; tie each into a knot and tuck ends under. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 25 minutes. Bake at 400 degrees F for 13-16 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks.
