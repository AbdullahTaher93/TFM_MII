Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Combine russet potato and sweet potato cubes with onion soup mix and olive oil in a bowl, stirring to mix thoroughly. Spread out into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and golden brown, stirring occasionally, about 40 minutes.
