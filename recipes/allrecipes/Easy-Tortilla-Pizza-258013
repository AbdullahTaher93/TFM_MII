Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place tortilla on a baking sheet. Brush with olive oil; sprinkle garlic powder, salt, and pepper on top. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove tortilla from the oven and spread tomato sauce on top. Arrange chicken breast, green bell pepper, and green onions over tomato sauce; cover with mozzarella cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle oregano over cheese. Slice pizza into wedges using a pizza cutter.
