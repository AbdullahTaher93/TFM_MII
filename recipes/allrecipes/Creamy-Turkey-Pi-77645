For filling, heat CRISCO(R) Oil in small saucepan; add onion and saute until tender. In a large bowl, mix sour cream, soup, cheese, salt and pepper; stir to combine. Add sauteed onions, vegetables, green onions and turkey; mix well. Spoon filling into unbaked pie crust. Cover pie with top crust; flute edges. Cut slits in top crust to allow steam to escape.
