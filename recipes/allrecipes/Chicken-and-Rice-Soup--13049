Cook celery, onion, rice, bouillon, and water about 20 minutes or until most of the water is absorbed by the rice. Remove from the heat. Make a cream base: Combine butter and flour in a small skillet, making a paste. Add 2 cups milk and stir to make a smooth sauce. Add cream base to the rice mixture. Add chicken and 1 cup milk. If the soup seems thick, add more milk. Add pepper to taste and serve hot.
