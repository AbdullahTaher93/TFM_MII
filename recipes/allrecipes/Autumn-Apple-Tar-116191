In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Cut in butter until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Combine egg and milk; gradually add to flour mixture, tossing with a fork until dough forms a ball. With lightly floured hands, press dough onto the bottom and up the sides of a 12-in. fluted tart pan with removable bottom. Arrange apple slices in a circular pattern over dough, starting at the outer edge and overlapping slices. For topping, combine the sugar, flour and spices in a small bowl. Cut in butter until crumbly. Sprinkle over apples. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until apples are tender. Serve warm or cold.
