Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix walnuts, garlic, honey, olive oil, rosemary, and salt together in a bowl until walnuts are coated; spread onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until walnuts are lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
