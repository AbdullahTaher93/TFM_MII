Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 18 muffin cups with cooking spray. Stir yellow cake mix, corn bread mix, pumpkin, milk, egg, and cinnamon in a bowl until batter is thoroughly combined; fold in pineapple and raisins. Scoop batter into prepared muffin cups, filling them about 2/3 full. Sprinkle each muffin with 1/2 teaspoon sugar for a crunchy top. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean or with moist crumbs, about 15 minutes.
