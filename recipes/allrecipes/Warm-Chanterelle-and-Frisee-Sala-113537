In a large, deep skillet, heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil until shimmering. Add the shallot and garlic and cook over moderately high heat, stirring, until softened, about 1 minute. Add the chanterelles and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is evaporated and they begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Add the stock and soy sauce, season with salt and pepper and cook until the mushrooms are almost dry, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the frisee to the skillet and season with salt and pepper. Toss well. Add the lemon juice and toss just until the frisee is lightly wilted, about 1 minute. Transfer the warm salad to a platter, scatter the cheese on top and serve.
