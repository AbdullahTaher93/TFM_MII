Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute celery and onion in hot oil until onion starts to turn translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add chili powder and cumin; saute until onion is soft, about 5 minutes more. Stir garlic into onion mixture and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir tomatoes into onion mixture; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium, and cook and stir until liquid is mostly evaporated and mixture is thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix cannellini beans and red kidney beans into tomato mixture; cook until bean filling is heated through, 5 to 10 minutes. Season filling with lime juice, hot sauce, salt, and black pepper. Spoon filling in a line across the middle of a tortilla. Fold opposing edges of the tortilla to overlap the filling. Roll 1 of the opposing edges around the filling into a burrito. Repeat with remaining filling and tortillas.
