Whisk together milk, cinnamon and eggs in 8x8-inch baking pan. Place crushed cereal in another baking pan or plate; set aside. Spread 4 slices of bread with cream cheese and preserves; top with remaining bread. Dip each sandwich in egg mixture, soaking each side. Coat soaked sandwich in crushed cereal. Meanwhile, spray nonstick skillet or griddle with cooking spray and heat until hot. Cook each sandwich over medium heat 2 to 4 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Cut diagonally in halves or quarters. Serve with your favorite syrup, if you like.
