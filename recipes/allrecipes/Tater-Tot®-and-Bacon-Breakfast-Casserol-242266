Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels. Spread bacon into the bottom of a 13x9-inch baking dish to cover. Spread potato nuggets over the bacon. Beat eggs, milk, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; pour over the layer of potato nuggets; top with Cheddar cheese. Bake in preheated oven until hot in the center, about 1 hour.
