Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Combine ground beef, dried cranberries, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; form into 4 patties. Cook patties on the preheated grill until browned and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). Spread 1 tablespoon peanut butter onto the bottom layer of each roll; top with 1 burger. Spread 1 tablespoon strawberry jam on the top layer of each roll; sprinkle with 1 tablespoon goat cheese. Place strawberry jam-goat cheese-layered bun atop burger to make a sandwich.
