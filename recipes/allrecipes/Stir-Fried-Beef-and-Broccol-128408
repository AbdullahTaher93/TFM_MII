In a medium bowl, combine the broth, sherry or broth, orange juice, orange peel (if desired), soy sauce, ginger, sugar, cornstarch, sesame oil, and red-pepper flakes. Stir to mix. Add the beef, tossing to coat evenly. Allow to marinate for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the rice according to package directions. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Coat with 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of the vegetable oil. Lift the beef from the marinade into the skillet. Reserve the marinade. Cook the beef, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until browned. Remove to a plate. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon vegetable oil to the skillet. Add the broccoli, scallions, and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons (25 mL) water. Cover the pan and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the broccoli is crisp-tender. Add the reserved marinade. Cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes, or until the mixture boils and thickens slightly. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Return the beef to the pan. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes, or until the beef is heated through. Serve over the rice.
