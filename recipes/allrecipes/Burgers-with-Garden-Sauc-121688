Add tomatoes, ketchup, brown sugar, lemon juice, vinegar, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper. Cover and simmer for 1-1/2 hours. Meanwhile, soak bread in water; squeeze dry and crumble into a bowl. Add the eggs, onion, parsley, salt and pepper. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Shape into eight patties. Broil or pan-fry until no longer pink; drain. Add to sauce. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes or until heated through. Serve on rolls.
