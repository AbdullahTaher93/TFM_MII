Heat 1 tablespoon butter and olive oil together in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add chicken broth, butternut squash, ginger, and cumin to onion and simmer over medium heat until squash is very soft, about 20 minutes. Pour squash mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Season soup with salt and pepper. Bring salted water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir 1 tablespoon butter into cooked quinoa and season with salt. Spoon quinoa into soup.
