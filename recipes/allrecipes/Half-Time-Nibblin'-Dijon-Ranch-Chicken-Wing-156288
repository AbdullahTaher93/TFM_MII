Arrange one oven rack in the center of the oven and one in the lower-third. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line 2 large, rimmed baking sheets with aluminum foil. (This will make clean-up easier.) In a large bowl, mix together the mustard, seasoning mix and pepper. Toss the wings or drummettes in the mustard mixture until well coated. Arrange the chicken, without touching, in a single layer on the prepared baking sheets. Bake until cooked through and browned, about 25 minutes. Serve hot or keep warm until ready to serve.
