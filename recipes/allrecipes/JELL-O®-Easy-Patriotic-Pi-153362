Stir 3/4 cup of the boiling water into dry blue gelatin at least 2 minutes or until completely dissolved. Add 1/2 cup of the ice cubes; stir until ice is completely melted. Pour into pie crust; refrigerate 5 to 10 minutes or until gelatin is set but not firm. Meanwhile, stir remaining 3/4 cup boiling water into dry red gelatin in separate bowl at least 2 minutes or until completely dissolved. Add remaining 1/2 cup ice cubes; stir until ice is completely melted. Let stand at room temperature 5 minutes or until slightly thickened.
