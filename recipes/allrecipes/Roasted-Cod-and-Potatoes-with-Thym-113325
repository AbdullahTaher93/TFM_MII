Heat the oven to 450 degrees F. In a large roasting pan, toss the potatoes with 3 tablespoons of the oil, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper. Scatter the thyme sprigs or 1 1/2 teaspoons of the dried thyme on top. Roast the potatoes for 10 minutes. Stir and continue cooking for 10 minutes longer. Meanwhile, coat the fish with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and sprinkle the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme or 1 1/2 teaspoons of the chopped fresh thyme on the fish. Remove the pan from the oven. Stir the potatoes and push them to one side of the pan. Put the fish on the other side of the pan and return the pan to the oven. Roast the fish and potatoes until just done, about 10 minutes longer. Remove the fish. Toss the potatoes with the remaining 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, if using. Serve the fish with the potatoes alongside.
