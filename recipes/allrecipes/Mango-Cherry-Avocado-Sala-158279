Divide lettuce evenly onto 4 salad plates. Set aside. In a small bowl, whisk together cherry juice, vinegar, mustard, coriander seeds, honey, olive oil and salt/pepper. Set aside. Layer evenly atop each of the lettuce heaps, the diced red onion, the avocado slices, the mango chunks and the cherries. Drizzle the dressing over the top and serve immediately.
