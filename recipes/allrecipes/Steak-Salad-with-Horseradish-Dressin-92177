Place steak on a lightly oiled rack in a broiler pan; sprinkle with salt. Broil about 6 inches below heat, turning once, until well browned on both sides and done to your liking; cut in thickest part to test (10 to 14 minutes for medium-rare). Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir together sour cream, mayonnaise, horseradish, lemon juice, and pepper. Stir in cheese. Set aside. In a large bowl, toss together lettuce, tomato, artichokes, and onion; divide among 4 to 6 individual plates. Cut steak across the grain into thin, slanting slices. Arrange steak over salads. Drizzle salads with dressing and garnish with lemon peel.
