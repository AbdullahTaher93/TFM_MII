Preheat oven to 225 degrees F. Oil or spray a rimmed baking sheet. In a small bowl, whisk egg white until foamy. Add sugar and salt, whisking until well blended. Add nuts; stir with a fork until coated. Pour onto prepared baking sheet. Spread in an even layer. Bake for 1 hour, turning and stirring with a spatula after 30 minutes. Nuts will be slightly soft, but will firm up as they cool. Cool completely. Break apart any nuts that stick together. Store in an airtight container.
