Preheat grill to medium-high. Place 1/2 of vegetables in center of one sheet of Reynolds WrapÂ® Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil; repeat with remaining vegetables on 2 sheet of foil. Combine garlic, oil, lemon juice, basil, seasoned salt and thyme in small bowl; drizzle over vegetables. Bring up sides of foil over vegetables; fold down two times. Double fold both ends of foil to seal packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside. Repeat to make two packets. Place packets on baking sheet with 1-inch sides. Slide packets off of baking sheet onto preheated grill. Grill 10 to 12 minutes on medium-high in covered grill. Slide packets off of grill onto baking sheet. Open packets carefully by cutting beside top fold with a sharp knife, allowing steam to escape. Transfer grilled vegetables to plates, and sprinkle with grated cheese, if desired.
