Use a vegetable peeler to remove long strips of peel from the lemon or orange; set aside. In a large saucepan, combine 3 cups of the LACTAID(R) Whole Milk, the sugar, and egg yolks. Add lemon or orange peel to saucepan. Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture just coats a metal spoon (mixture may appear slightly curdled). Remove from the heat. Stir in remaining LACTAID(R) Whole Milk. Cover the surface with plastic wrap. Refrigerate several hours or overnight until well chilled. (Or, place the saucepan in a sink of ice water to chill quickly.) Remove lemon peel from mixture. Freeze in a 4- or 5-quart ice cream freezer according to the manufacturer's directions.
