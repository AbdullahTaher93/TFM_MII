In the container of a food processor, combine the jalapeno peppers, horseradish, garlic and mayonnaise. Set aside 3/4 of the mixture in the refrigerator. Brush or spread the remaining 1/4 onto the salmon fillets. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to marinate. Preheat a grill for medium-high heat. When hot, lightly oil the grate. Grill the salmon fillets until they are able to be flaked with a fork, about 7 minutes per side. Baste occasionally with the remaining marinade.
