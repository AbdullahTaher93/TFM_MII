Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Poke about 10 holes into spaghetti squash; place in a baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until spaghetti squash is softened and partially cooked, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven; cool until easily handled. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut spaghetti squash in half and seed. Pull the squash flesh from the peel with a fork. Heat oil in a braising pan over medium-high heat. Add zucchini, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add bell pepper, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until flavors combine, about 3 minutes. Stir in green beans; cook until bright green, about 2 minutes. Stir diced tomatoes and Italian seasoning into the pan; simmer until tomatoes are warm, about 5 minutes. Add spaghetti squash; toss until combined. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until spaghetti squash is tender, about 10 minutes.
