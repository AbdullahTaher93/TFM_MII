Bring 1-1/2 quarts water to boil in large saucepan. Add pecans and boil 2 minutes; drain thoroughly. Meanwhile, spray large, shallow baking pan with cooking spray; set aside. Combine corn syrup, soy sauce, onion and garlic powders and red pepper in same saucepan. Cook, over medium-high heat, until mixture begins to boil, stirring constantly. Stir in pecans and cook, stirring, 3 to 4 minutes, or until sauce is absorbed by nuts. Turn pecans out onto prepared baking pan, spreading to separate pecans in a single layer. Bake in 250 degrees F oven 40 minutes, stirring and turning nuts over every 15 minutes. Remove pan from oven; stir pecans to spread in single layer. Cool completely, in pan, on wire rack. Store in tightly covered container.
