Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour one 9x5 inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder and salt. Mix in the shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center, and pour in eggs, milk, pumpkin and vanilla. Mix well, then stir in nuts. Bake in preheated oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
