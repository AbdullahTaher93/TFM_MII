Place the tablespoons of peppercorns and allspice in a cloth bag; pound to a powder with a hammer. Mix in salt; rub over roast. Set aside. In a large Dutch oven, cook bacon for 3-4 minutes or until fat begins to cook out. Push bacon to edge of pan. Add roast; brown on all sides. Add vinegar, water, whole peppercorns and allspice, onion and bay leaves; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 2 hours. Stir in preserves and gingersnaps; cook 1 hour longer or until meat is tender. Chill roast overnight in cooking liquid. The next day, skim off fat. Heat roast slowly in cooking liquid until heated through, about 1 hour. Remove roast and keep warm. Strain cooking liquid; return 3-1/2 cups to pan. Combine broth or wine and flour; stir into cooking liquid. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly; cook and stir 1 minute more. Slice roast and serve with gravy.
