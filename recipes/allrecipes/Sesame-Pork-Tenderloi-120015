Place pork in a large resealable plastic bag. Add the soy sauce, oil, ginger and garlic; seal and turn to coat. Refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight, turning occasionally. Drain and discard marinade. Place pork on a greased rack in a foil-lined shallow roasting pan. Combine honey and brown sugar; spoon over pork. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 30-40 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let stand for 5-10 minutes before slicing.
