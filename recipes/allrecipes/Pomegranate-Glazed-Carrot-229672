Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir carrots in the hot butter until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes; season with salt and black pepper. Stir orange juice and pomegranate juice into carrots, bring to a simmer, and reduce heat to low. Simmer carrots until tender, stirring occasionally, 10 to 12 minutes.
