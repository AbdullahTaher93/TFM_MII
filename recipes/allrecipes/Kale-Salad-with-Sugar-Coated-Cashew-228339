Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spread cashews onto a baking sheet. Toast cashews in preheated oven until browned, about 5 minutes. Pour sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat while the cashews are toasting; cook and stir until melted. As soon as it is melted and the nuts are done toasting, pour the nuts in the saucepan; stir to coat. Spread cashews onto baking sheet to cool completely, about 15 minutes. Massage kale and soy sauce together in a bowl until kale softens. Fold raisins and sugar-coated cashews into the kale. Refrigerate 30 minutes before serving.
