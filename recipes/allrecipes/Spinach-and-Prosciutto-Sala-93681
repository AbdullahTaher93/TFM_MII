Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the prosciutto and tomatoes cut side up onto a baking tray. Drizzle with the olive oil and season well. Cook for 25 minutes or until just soft. Arrange the spinach and asparagus onto the serving plates and top with the tomatoes and prosciutto. Mix the salad dressing ingredients together and season to taste. Pour over the salad just before serving. To make the Parmesan shavings use a vegetable peeler or a thin-slicing cheese slice. Use one of the flavored Filippo Berio olive oils to replace the plain oil.
