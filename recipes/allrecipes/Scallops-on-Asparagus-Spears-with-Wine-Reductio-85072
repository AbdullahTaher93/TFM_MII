Combine flour, Old Bay, and paprika in a shallow pan. Stir to blend thoroughly. Add scallops and coat evenly with flour mixture. Dry skillet with a paper towel, if necessary, and place over medium-high heat until hot. Add 2 tablespoons of butter. When butter is melted, add scallops and cook 4 minutes, turn and cook 4 minutes longer or until opaque in center. Top asparagus with scallops and cover to keep warm. Add wine and dill weed to pan residue. Bring to a boil and cook 1-2 minutes or until liquid measures about 1/3 cup.
