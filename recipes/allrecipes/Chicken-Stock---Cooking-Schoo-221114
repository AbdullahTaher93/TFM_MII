Place chicken drumsticks, chicken wings, onion, carrots, celery, parsley, bay leaf, thyme, and peppercorns in a stockpot and fill the pot with enough cold water to cover the chicken by about 2 inches. Bring the water to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat, skimming off any fat that rises to the surface. Simmer without stirring until stock is flavorful, about 4 hours. Strain stock through a fine-mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth into a clean container. Place container in a sink filled with ice water, and stir occasionally until cooled. Cover the container and refrigerate overnight. Once completely chilled, remove any fat that has solidified on the surface.
