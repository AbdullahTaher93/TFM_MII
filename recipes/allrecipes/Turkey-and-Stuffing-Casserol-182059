Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Combine the first 4 ingredients, and set aside. Separate the 2 soups in separate bowls and add 1/2 soup can of water to each; stir these well and set aside. Place 1/3 of the stuffing mixture into a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer 1/2 of the chicken or turkey and pour the celery soup over this. Layer another 1/3 of the stuffing mixture, followed by the remaining chicken or turkey. Pour the chicken soup over the casserole, and top with the remaining stuffing mixture. Drizzle with butter and pack the mixture firmly into the dish. Bake 20 to 30 minutes.
