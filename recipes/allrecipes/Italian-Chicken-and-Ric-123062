In a large resealable plastic bag or shallow bowl, combine the first four ingredients. Place 1/3 cup milk in another bowl. Dip chicken in milk, then coat with the cheese mixture. In a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish, combine water, rice, salt if desired and remaining milk; mix well. Top with chicken. Drizzle with butter. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until the rice is tender and chicken juices run clear.
