In a small dish, combine the salt, pepper and coriander. Sprinkle over salmon. In a nonstick skillet, cook salmon in oil over medium heat for 4 minutes on each side. Add the garlic, lime juice and hot pepper sauce. Reduce heat; cover and cook 3-4 minutes longer or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
