To prepare pickled onions: Whisk vinegar, brown sugar, salt and allspice in a medium glass bowl. Microwave on High until the mixture boils, 2 to 3 minutes. (Alternatively, bring the mixture to a boil in a small saucepan on the stove.) Add onions and toss to coat. To prepare burgers: Preheat grill to high. Place turkey in a medium bowl and gently mix in cilantro, cumin, ground chipotle, salt and allspice until distributed throughout the meat. Form the mixture into 4 patties. Brush with oil. Grill the burgers until cooked through and no longer pink in the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Meanwhile, toast buns on the grill, if desired. Drain the onions, discarding the marinade. Spread 2 teaspoons mayonnaise on each bun; top with a burger and pickled onions.
