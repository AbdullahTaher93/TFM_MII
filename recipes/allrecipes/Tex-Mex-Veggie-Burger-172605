In a small bowl, stir together mayonnaise, chilies, and cilantro. Set aside. Split each piece of bread horizontally. Then arrange bread, cut sides up, on a large baking sheet. Broil about 3 inches below heat until golden (about 2 minutes). Remove to individual plates. Spread cut surfaces of bottom halves of bread with mayonnaise mixture, using about half of it. Arrange veggie burgers on baking sheet; broil about 3 inches below heat, turning once, until hot through and golden on both sides (4 to 6 minutes). Top each burger with 2 slices of cheese. Continue to broil until cheese is melted (about 2 more minutes). Cover bottom halves of bread with lettuce leaves; then top each piece with a burger, an onion slice, 4 avocado slices, and a fourth of the remaining mayonnaise mixture. Add top halves of bread and serve hot.
