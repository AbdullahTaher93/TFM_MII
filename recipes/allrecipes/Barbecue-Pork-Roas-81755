Randomly pierce the surface of the roast with a sharp knife. In a heavy skillet over medium-high heat, add the oil and brown the roast on all sides. In a mixing bowl, combine the water, barbeque sauce, Worcestershire sauce, seasoning, chili powder and Liquid Smoke. Mix well. Pour sauce over roast and bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer 2 hours or until pork is fork-tender. Baste roast with sauce during cooking time. Remove pork from pan, cool slightly and slice or chop to serve.
