Combine the onion, garlic, ground coriander, cayenne pepper, black pepper, salt, and sweetened condensed milk in the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse 4 to 5 times, until the mixture forms a smooth paste. Scoop the spice paste into a large bowl, and stir in the corn, chives, peas, rice flour, all-purpose flour, egg, water, shrimp, and red chile pepper. Mix together to form a thick batter. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Drop batter about 1/4 cup at a time into the hot oil, and fry 2 to 3 minutes per side until golden brown. Remove the fritters from the hot oil, and drain on paper towels.
