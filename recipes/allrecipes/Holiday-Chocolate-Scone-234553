Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. In a medium bowl, combine muffin mix, flour, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. Cut cold butter into cubes and blend into flour using a fork or pastry cutter until butter resembles small peas. Add dried cherries and orange zest, stir to combine. Add half and half, stir until dough begins to come together (dough will seem dry). Turn the dough onto a flat surface lightly dusted with cocoa powder and knead dough for 1-2 minutes. Shape dough into an 8-inch circle. Cut into 8 wedges and place 2 inches apart on baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes until firm in the center. Cool on a wire rack. While scones bake, prepare the glaze: In a small bowl, combine all glaze ingredients and whisk together until smooth. Drizzle glaze onto cooled scones.
