Place the potatoes in a pot with enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Cook for about 20 minutes, or until tender. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle. Cut into medium dice and place in a large bowl. Meanwhile, place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 minutes. Drain, run under cold water, peel and dice. Add to potatoes. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and add to potatoes and eggs. Add red onion, celery, mayonnaise and red wine vinegar to the potato mixture. Season with salt and pepper to taste; toss and refrigerate until ready to serve.
