In a blender or food processor, combine the basil, garlic, pine nuts, Parmesan, parsley, water, and oil. Process until smooth. Season with the salt and pepper. Preheat the broiler. Coat a broiler pan with no-stick spray. To make a pocket for the stuffing, slice the fish through its side, cutting nearly to the skin. Be careful not to cut the fish in half. Stuff the fish with the pesto, reserving a few tablespoons of pesto. Spread the reserved pesto on the top and bottom of the fish. Place the fish on the prepared pan and broil 4" from the heat for 10 minutes per 1" thickness of fish, or until the fish flakes easily when tested with a fork; turn the fish over halfway through the cooking time.
