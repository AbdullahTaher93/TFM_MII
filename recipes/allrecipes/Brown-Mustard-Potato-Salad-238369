Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain potatoes and run under cold water to cool. Mix potatoes, eggs, mayonnaise, onion, brown mustard, pickle relish, parsley, dill, black pepper, and paprika together in a bowl until evenly coated.
