Preheat an outdoor grill for low heat and lightly oil the grate. Cut the onions into 1/2 inch slices. In a large bowl, combine the onions with the dressing, cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least one hour. Cook over low heat, turning once, to desired tenderness. Apply more dressing, if desired.
