Whisk egg yolks, black pepper, tarragon Dijon mustard, tarragon vinegar, water, and salt in a metal mixing bowl or small saucepan. Place over low heat and whisk until mixture foams, small wisps of steam appear from the sauce, and sauce is hot and thick, 1 to 2 minutes. Raise and lower the pan over the heat to increase or reduce heat. Remove from heat and whisk a few more seconds to make sauce slightly fluffy. Serve immediately.
