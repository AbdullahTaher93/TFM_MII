For vinaigrette, stir together mustard, garlic, sugar, lemon juice and vinegar in a medium bowl. Gradually whisk in olive oil until mixture is smooth and glossy. For candied almonds, preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Place a sheet of well-oiled foil on countertop. Place sugar in a very clean medium saucepan and cover with 2 tablespoons water and lemon juice. Place almonds on a baking sheet and place in oven. Bring sugar and water to a boil, and boil until sugar turns deep golden brown, swirling occasionally to ensure even color. Stir in warm almonds, and immediately spread coated almonds onto prepared foil. (Take care not to touch them--caramelized sugar is extremely hot.) Cool completely, then chop roughly or break into small pieces. To assemble salad, place spinach, candied almonds, cranberries and goat cheese in a large bowl. Toss lightly with dressing and serve immediately.
