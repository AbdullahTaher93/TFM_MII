In a large skillet over moderately high heat, heat oil until hot. Add onion, garlic and apples and saute 3 minutes. Stir in meat, salt, pepper and curry powder. Saute for 2 minutes or until lightly browned. Stir in flour, cooking until absorbed. Stir in chicken broth and cranberries. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 to 6 minutes or until thickened slightly and meat is cooked through. Serve with rice or couscous, chutney and peanuts, if desired.
