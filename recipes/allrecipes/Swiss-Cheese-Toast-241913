Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix Swiss cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream, and Italian-style salad dressing mix in a bowl until well blended. Spread cheese mixture onto one side of each bread slice. Sprinkle green bell pepper over the cheese mixture. Arrange bread onto a baking sheet. Bake bread slices in preheated oven until the cheese is bubbly and the bread toasted, 10 to 12 minutes.
