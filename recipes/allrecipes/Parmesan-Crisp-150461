Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or use a nonstick baking sheet. (Do not use cooking spray.) Mound level tablespoonfuls of cheese about 2 inches apart on the baking sheet. Bake until the cheese is melted, soft and a very light golden color, about 6 minutes. Remove from the oven and do not disturb until completely cooled and firm to the touch, about 20 minutes. Using a thin spatula or knife, lift the crackers from the baking sheet.
