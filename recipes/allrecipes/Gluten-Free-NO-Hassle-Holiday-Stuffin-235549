Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Spread bread cubes onto 2 baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until completely dry, about 2 hours. Transfer bread cubes to a large bowl. Melt 1/2 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; saute onions, apples, and celery, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes. Add chicken broth and poultry seasoning and simmer until flavors blend, about 5 minutes. Pour mixture over bread cubes and toss to coat; season with salt and pepper. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and set aside for liquid to absorb, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove cover from bowl and transfer bread cube mixture to a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Drizzle 1/2 cup melted butter over bread cube mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
