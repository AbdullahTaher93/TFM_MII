In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the milk, 1/4 cup butter, 1 cup sugar, salt and 3 cups flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a firm dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled, about 1-1/2 hours. Melt remaining butter; pour into a greased 10-in. fluted tube pan. Sprinkle walnuts over bottom of pan. Combine cinnamon and remaining sugar; sprinkle 1/4 cup over nuts. Punch dough down. Divide into six portions; divide each portion into eight pieces. Roll each piece into a b all; dip in remaining cinnamon-sugar. Place in prepared pan. Sprinkle remaining cinnamon-sugar over top. Cover and let rise until almost doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 5 minutes before inverting onto a serving plate. Combine glaze ingredients; drizzle over bread.
