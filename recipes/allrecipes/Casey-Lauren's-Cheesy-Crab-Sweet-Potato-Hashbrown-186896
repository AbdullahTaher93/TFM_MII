Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl; whisk in the mayonnaise, mustard, seafood seasoning, and chili powder. Add the sweet potatoes, crabmeat, mozzarella cheese, and lemon zest. Season to taste with salt and pepper; mix until evenly combined. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Scoop heaping spoonfuls of the sweet potato mixture into the heated pan. Flatten into 3-inch circles and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining sweet potato mixture. Sprinkle with parsley to garnish.
