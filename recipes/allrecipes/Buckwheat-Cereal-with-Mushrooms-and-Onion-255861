Heat olive oil in the skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and carrot until onion is golden, 5 to 10 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook and stir for 5 minutes more. Melt butter in a pot over medium heat; add buckwheat and stir to coat. Add onion mixture, water, salt, and pepper; bring to a boil.
