In large resealable plastic bag, pour 3/4 cup Lawry's(R) Hawaiian Marinade With Tropical Fruit Juices over salmon; turn to coat. Close bag, and marinate in refrigerator 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in medium bowl, combine 1/4 cup Marinade with remaining ingredients. Let stand at room temperature up to 1 hour. Remove salmon from Marinade, discarding Marinade. Grill or broil salmon, turning once and brushing frequently with remaining 1/4 cup Marinade, 12 minutes or until fish flakes with a fork. Serve salmon with pineapple salsa.
