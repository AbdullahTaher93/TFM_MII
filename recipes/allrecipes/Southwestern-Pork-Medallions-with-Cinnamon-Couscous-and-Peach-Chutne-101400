In lightly oiled skillet, saute bell pepper, garlic, onion and jalapeno for 2 minutes, stirring, until vegetables are wilted. Stir in peaches, brown sugar and vinegar. Simmer briefly, until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and let stand at room temperature, up to 2 hours, until serving. In large saucepan, bring water, cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon salt and butter to a boil; stir in the couscous, cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, cut pork into medallions about 3/4-inch thick. In small bowl stir together remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, cumin and chili powder; rub this mixture over all surfaces of medallions. Broil medallions 4-5 inches from heat for 4 minutes; turn and broil 4 minutes more. Serve medallions with couscous and chutney.
