Coat a 9 X 13-inch (3-liter or 22 X 34-cm) glass baking dish with nonstick spray. Add the apples. In a large bowl, combine the oats, flour, raisins, and cinnamon. Drizzle with the apple juice, honey, and oil. Combine well. Sprinkle over the fruit. Bake at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) until the apples are hot and tender, 30 to 40 minutes.
