Rinse spinach with cold water (even if ready to eat). Drain, but do not dry in any way. Melt butter in large deep skillet over medium heat. Cook wet spinach in butter for 1 minute, stirring occasionally, until wilted. Cover and cook an additional 4 to 5 minutes or until tender but still bright green. Stir in simmer sauce and cheese; heat until hot. Cheese will not melt, but remain as softened cubes. Remove from heat and serve at once.
