Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; spray with cooking spray. Toss potatoes with vegetable oil in a large bowl. Add Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, basil, salt, and black pepper; toss to coat. Arrange seasoned potatoes on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until fries are tender and lightly browned, 30 to 35 minutes.
