In a pot over medium heat, mix the beef broth, water, tomato paste, garlic, and bay leaves. Stir in the beef bouillon until dissolved. Season with pepper. Bring to a boil, and mix in the rice. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook 25 minutes, until rice is tender. Remove bay leaves, and serve warm with a sprinkling of Cheddar cheese.
