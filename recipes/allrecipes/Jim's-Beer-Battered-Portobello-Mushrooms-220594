Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Whisk ale, flour, sesame seeds, cornstarch, and baking powder in a large bowl. The batter will be thick and slightly lumpy. Dip 7 to 8 strips of mushroom at a time into the batter, shaking off excess. Fry mushrooms in batches in the preheated oil until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.
