Sift together flour and brown sugar; set aside. In a large mixing bowl, beat egg whites, salt and cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Add vanilla and maple flavoring. Add sugar a little at a time, beating until stiff. Gradually fold in flour/sugar mixture, about 1/4 at a time. Spoon half the batter into an ungreased angel food cake pan; sprinkle with nuts. Cut through batter with knife; spoon in remaining batter. Bake at 375 degrees F for about 35 minutes. Cool inverted on a wire rack.
