To a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium heat, add orange olive oil. When oil is hot, add nuts and fruit (either from salad package or the substitute amounts). Cook, stirring, until nuts are golden and fruit is puffed and warm. Add spinach and green onion. Gently fold spinach and cook just until wilted, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Spoon mixture onto 4 salad plates or one platter. Scatter croutons and cheese over salad; serve at once.
