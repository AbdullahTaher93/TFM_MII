Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x4 inch loaf pan. Remove skins from potatoes, and discard. Place the potatoes in a large bowl, and mash. Mix in onion eggs, salt, pepper and cheese with your hands, or as you would meatloaf. Form into a loaf shape and place into the prepared pan. Bake for 90 minutes in the preheated oven. Let cool for 5 minutes, then remove from the pan, slice and serve.
