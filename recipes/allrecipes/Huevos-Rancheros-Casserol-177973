Arrange half of the chilies, spread open, in a single layer on the bottom of a shallow 2 1/2- to 3-quart round or square baking dish. Evenly sprinkle half of the jack and longhorn cheeses over chilies. Lightly sprinkle with pepper. Repeat layers, using remaining chilies and cheeses. In a bowl, beat together eggs and sour cream until blended. Pour evenly over chilies and cheese. Bake in a 350 degrees F oven until custard is set and jiggles only slightly in center when gently shaken and edges have begun to brown, about 30 minutes. Let cool 5 to 10 minutes. Garnish with diced tomatoes. 3. To serve, cut through all layers with a knife or spoon. Offer salsa to pour over individual portions, if desired.
