Place couscous in a small bowl. Cover with 1 cup boiling water. Cover bowl with plastic wrap; let couscous sit 10 minutes to soften. Fluff with a fork, and set aside. Heat tomato sauce, cinnamon, and cumin in a saucepan over medium heat. Add chickpeas, raisins, and almonds, and heat until hot. Season with salt and pepper. Serve couscous topped with sauce, and garnish with parsley, if using.
