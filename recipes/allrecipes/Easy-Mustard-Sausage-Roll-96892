Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Unfold puff pastry and cut in half. On a lightly floured board, roll each half into a 8x5 inch rectangle. Beat egg and water together in a small bowl. Brush mustard on each pastry half, leaving a 1 inch unbrushed border on one long side. Cut the sausage in half to make two, approximately 8 inch, segments. Roll pastry around sausages. Brush the pastry borders with egg wash and overlap to seal seams. Place seam side down on the prepared baking sheet. Use a sharp knife to make slits in the top of pastries at one inch intervals. Brush egg wash over sausage rolls. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Slice at slits to serve.
