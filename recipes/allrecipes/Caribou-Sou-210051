Place the caribou in a 12-quart stockpot with enough water to cover by 2 inches; add the potatoes, tomatoes, garlic, carrots, onion, bay leaf, and crushed red pepper. Season with salt and pepper, and bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the rice and reduce heat to medium-low. Continue cooking until the rice is tender, about 40 minutes. Remove bay leaf to serve.
