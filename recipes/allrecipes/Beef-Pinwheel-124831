In a bowl, combine oil, water, soy sauce, lemon pepper, Worcestershire sauce and hot pepper sauce; set aside. Pound flank steak on each side. Cut into 1/2-in strips on the diagonally; add to marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. Divide meat strips into eight portions. Roll and shape strips, using larger strips around edges, into pinwheels. Secure each with a skewer. Grill over hot coals for 5-6 minutes per side or until done.
