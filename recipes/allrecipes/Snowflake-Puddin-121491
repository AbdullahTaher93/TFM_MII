In a small bowl, combine gelatin and 1/4 cup milk; let stand for 1 minute. In a saucepan, combine sugar, salt and remaining milk; heat just until sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat; stir in gelatin mixture and vanilla. Refrigerate until partially set. Fold in coconut and whipped cream. Pour into dessert dishes or small bowls; refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Meanwhile, strain raspberries to remove seeds. Combine cornstarch, raspberry pulp and currant jelly in a saucepan; stir until smooth. Bring to a boil; boil and stir for 2 minutes. Chill for at least 1 hour. Pour sauce over pudding just before serving.
