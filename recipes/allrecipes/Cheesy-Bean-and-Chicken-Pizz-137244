Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly grease 14-inch pizza pan with shortening or cooking spray. Unroll dough; place in pan. Starting at center, press out dough to edge of pan. Bake 8 to 10 minutes or just until crust begins to brown around edge. Meanwhile, in small bowl, mix mayonnaise, lime juice and chiles. Gently spread mayonnaise mixture over partially baked crust. Top with beans, chicken and cheese. Bake 10 to 14 minutes longer or until crust is golden brown. Sprinkle with cilantro before serving.
