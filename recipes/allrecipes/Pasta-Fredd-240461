Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and cool to room temperature. Combine tomatoes, bocconcini, olives, olive oil, basil, and oregano in a large bowl; toss to evenly coat. Add pasta to tomato mixture and toss.
