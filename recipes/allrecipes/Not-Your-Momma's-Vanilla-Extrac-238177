Cut each vanilla bean lengthwise with a sharp knife or scissors, leaving 1 inch uncut at each end of the bean. Place split beans into the bottom of a glass jar or bottle. Pour vodka over the beans to cover completely. Screw or fasten the lid on the jar and shake. Store, shaking the jar occasionally, in a cool, dark place for at least 2 months.
