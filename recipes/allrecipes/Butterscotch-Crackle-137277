Let cookie dough stand at room temperature to soften slightly. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray cookie sheets with cooking spray. In large bowl, break up cookie dough. Stir or knead in crushed cereal, butterscotch chips and coconut until well blended. Shape dough into 1-inch balls; roll in powdered sugar. On cookie sheets, place balls 2 inches apart. Bake 11 to 15 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Cool 1 minute; remove from cookie sheets to cooling racks.
