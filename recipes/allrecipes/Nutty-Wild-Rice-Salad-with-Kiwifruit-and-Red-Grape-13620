Place broth in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil. Add rice, reduce heat to low, and simmer, covered, for 45 minutes, or until tender. Drain excess liquid, cover and let cool. Whisk together lemon juice, oil, and honey in a small bowl until honey is dissolved. Season with salt and pepper. Place cooled rice in a salad bowl, along with kiwi, red grapes and pecans. Add dressing, and gently toss.
