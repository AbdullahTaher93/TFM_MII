Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Rinse the potatoes under cold running water, scrubbing them lightly with a brush if they are dirty. Prick each one several times with a fork, so it wont burst in the oven. Bake for 65 to 75 minutes or until the skins are dry and crackly, and a small, sharp knife pierces each potato easily. Remove potatoes from the oven and let them stand until they are cool enough to handle. (If you wish, this initial baking can take place hours - or even a day or two - ahead of time. In that case, refrigerate the cooled potatoes until you are ready to continue with final scooping and stuffing process detailed below.) Heat oven to 375 degrees F for the second baking. Split each potato lengthwise, scoop out the inside from each half, leaving the outer potato shell 1/4 to 1/3-inch thick. Using a large fork or potato masher, mash the scooped-out potato coarsely, then add the sour cream, chives, bacon, 1/4 cups cheese and the salt and pepper. Mix with a fork until blended, but don't worry about making it perfectly smooth. Divide the filling among the potato shells, using about 1/2-cup in each. Sprinkle each with about 1 tablespoon of the remaining cheese. Place the potatoes side by side in a 13 x 9-inch baking pan or any baking dish that holds them comfortably. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes or until the cheese has melted and the tops are lightly browned.
