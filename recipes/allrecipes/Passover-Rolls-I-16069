Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet. In a large mixing bowl, combine matzo meal, water, oil, sugar, and salt. Mix well then let mixture cool. Add eggs to the mixture. Drop rolls by rounded tablespoons onto the prepared cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for one hour, checking to make sure they are golden brown and not burned.
