Combine biscuit mix, milk and butter in large bowl. Stir to blend well; refrigerate dough for 30 minutes. Divide dough into 2 equal portions; roll one on a piece of parchment or waxed paper to a 1/8 inch thick rectangle about 10inches x 7 inches. Spread half the uncooked sausage evenly over the dough and top with half the peppers and onions if desired. Roll lengthwise into a long log. Repeat the process with remaining ingredients. Wrap logs and place in freezer until very firm - about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 400 F. Cut each log into 24 slices; place on non-stick baking sheets and bake 15 minutes or until golden brown.
