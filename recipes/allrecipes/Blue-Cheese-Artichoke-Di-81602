Drain the liquids from the artichokes. Finely chop the artichokes and add to a small bowl. If fixing the cold version, then zap the artichokes in the microwave for about 1 minute, stir and then zap another minute. If fixing the baked version then you can skip the microwave zapping. Mix into the artichokes the mayonnaise, sour cream, blue cheese, garlic and pepper. Stir well. If serving cold then refrigerate until needed, garnish with the chopped walnuts (they can be raw or roasted). If serving it baked then place it in a casserole dish and bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes. If you would like a crusty top then add 1/3 cup of grated Romano or Parmesan cheese before baking. Let cool for 5 minutes then garnish with the chopped walnuts.
