Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine the cracker crumbs, salt, pepper, and butter in a bowl until evenly moistened. Butter a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish and sprinkle about 1/3 of the cracker crumb mixture into it. Drain the oysters, reserving the liquid. Add enough clam juice to the oyster liquid to make 3/4 cup; set aside. Layer half of the oysters into the casserole dish and sprinkle with half of the cracker crumbs. Arrange the remaining oysters atop the crumbs. Whisk together the oyster liquid, cream, Worcestershire sauce, and hot pepper sauce. Drizzle over the oysters and sprinkle with the remaining cracker crumbs. Bake in the preheated oven until hot in the center and golden on top, 40 to 50 minutes.
