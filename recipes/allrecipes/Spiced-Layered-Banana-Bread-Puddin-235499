Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter an 11 x 8-inch glass baking dish. In a large bowl, combine cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt. Whisk in 1/2 cup sugar, eggs, milk and vanilla; set aside. Slice bananas and arrange evenly in the bottom of the baking dish. Butter bread slices on both sides and cut into cubes; sprinkle over top of bananas to cover. Pour egg mixture evenly over top and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup of sugar. Bake in preheated oven for about 1 hour or until knife inserted in centre comes out clean and top is golden brown and slightly puffed. Let cool slightly before serving.
