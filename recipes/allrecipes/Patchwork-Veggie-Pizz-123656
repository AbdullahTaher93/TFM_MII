Unroll crescent dough and place on an ungreased baking sheet; press seams together to form a 15-in. x 12-in. rectangle. Bake at 375 degrees F for 11-13 minutes or until golden brown; cool completely. Combine cream cheese and salad dressing; spread over crust to within 1 in. of edge. With a knife, mark off 20 squares. Fill each square with one vegetable to make a patchwork design or the quilt pattern of your choice. Refrigerate or serve immediately.
