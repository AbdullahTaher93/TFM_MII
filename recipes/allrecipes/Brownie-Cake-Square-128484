Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease an 8 inch x 8 inch (20 x 20-cm) baking pan. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, granulated sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. In another bowl, combine the milk, butter, egg, and vanilla extract. Stir in the flour mixture. Spread into the prepared pan. Bake for 30 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan on a rack. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
