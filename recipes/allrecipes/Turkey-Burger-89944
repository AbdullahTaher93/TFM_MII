Adjust oven rack to middle position, and preheat the oven broiler. Mix together turkey, spinach, goat cheese, and salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Divide into equal portions, and form into 4 patties about 4 1/2-inches in diameter. Arrange patties on a foil-lined broiler pan, or a wire rack set over a lipped cookie sheet. Broil, turning once, until cooked through, about 20 to 25 minutes.
