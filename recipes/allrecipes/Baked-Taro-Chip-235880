Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place taro disks in a 1- to 2-inch deep dish. Brush disks evenly with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Bake in the preheated oven until tops of chips are crisp, about 15 minutes; flip chips and continue baking until second side is crisp, about 15 more minutes.
