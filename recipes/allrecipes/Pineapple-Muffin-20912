Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. In a bowl, combine flour and baking powder. Stir in cereal, milk, applesauce and egg. Fold in pineapple and nuts. Scoop batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of a muffin comes out clean.
