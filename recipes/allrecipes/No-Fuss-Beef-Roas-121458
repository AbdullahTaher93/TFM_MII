Combine the first four ingredients; rub over roast. Place roast, fat side up, in a roasting pan. Dot with butter. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1-3/4 to 3 hours or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F). Let stand for 10-15 minutes before carving. Thicken pan drippings for gravy if desired.
