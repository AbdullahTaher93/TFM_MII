Prepare and bake cake mix as directed on package in two 8- or 9-inch round layers. Run knife or metal spatula around sides of pans to loosen cake layers. Cool 15 min. Stir boiling water into dry gelatin mix at least 2 min. until completely dissolved. Add cold water. Pierce cake layers with large fork at 1/2-inch intervals. Carefully pour half of the gelatin mixture over each cake layer. Refrigerate at least 3 hours. Mix sour cream and powdered sugar; gently stir in whipped topping. Dip one cake pan in warm water 10 sec.; unmold onto serving plate. Spread with 1 cup of the whipped topping mixture. Reserve a few cherries for garnish. Chop remaining cherries; sprinkle over cake. Unmold second cake layer; carefully place on first cake layer. Frost top and sides of cake with remaining whipped topping mixture. Drizzle with melted chocolate; garnish with reserved cherries.
