Stir the orange zest, orange juice, lemon zest, lemon juice, lime zest, lime juice, coriander, red pepper flakes, olive oil, and honey together in a shallow dish. Remove about 1/4 cup of the mixture and set aside for later. Add the chicken breasts to the remaining marinade, turning to coat both sides. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, turning occasionally, 1 to 4 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the chicken breasts from the marinade; discard the marinade. Basting frequently with the reserved sauce, cook the chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
