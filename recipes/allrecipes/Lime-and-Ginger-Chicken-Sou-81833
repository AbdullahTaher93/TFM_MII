De-bone the roasted chicken and cut meat into small bite size pieces. (Reserve the bones and skin to make stock). In a soup pan, melt butter on medium heat. Add the garlic, coriander and cayenne and saute for 1 minute. Add ginger and saute 1 minute (careful not to burn). Add chicken stock, bring to a boil and add the chicken, then reduce heat and simmer for at least 10 minutes. Taste test and add salt if needed. Just before serving, stir in the lime juice and cilantro.
