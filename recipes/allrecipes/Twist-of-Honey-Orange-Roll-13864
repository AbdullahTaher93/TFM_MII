Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a small bowl, combine butter, pecans, orange peel and honey. Mix well. Separate dough into 10 biscuits. Separate each biscuit in half. Spread top of ten layers with 1 teaspoon of honey-orange mixture. Top each biscuit with other half and press together to form 10 filled biscuits. Place rolls in ungreased 8 or 9 inch square pan. In a small saucepan, combine sugar, orange juice and vanilla. Cook over high heat until sugar is dissolved and syrup begins to boil. Stir constantly; spoon over rolls in pan. Bake for 10 minutes or until golden brown. Allow to cool for 2 minutes and invert on serving plate. Serve warm.
