Bring 4-quarts of salted water to a boil over high heat; add pasta and cook until al dente stage is reached. Drain pasta; rinse with cold water and return to pan. Place salad dressing, chili sauce, peanut butter, orange juice and zest in a small bowl; whisk to combine. Stir in 1 teaspoon chili oil. Taste. If more heat is desired, add additional chili oil, a teaspoon at a time, until seasoned to taste - exercise caution as chili oil is very hot. Pour sauce over noodles. Add chicken, broccoli slaw, cucumbers, bell pepper, and 1/2 cup cilantro; toss to combine. Add salt and pepper to taste. Line a platter with lettuce leaves, top with noodles and garnish with reserved 2 tablespoons cilantro and chopped peanuts. Serve at room temperature.
