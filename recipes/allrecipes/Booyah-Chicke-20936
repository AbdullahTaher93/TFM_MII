Combine the chicken, beef, pork, water and broth in a large pot and bring to a boil. Add whole cloves of garlic and bay leaves, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 2 hours. Remove chicken, beef and pork. Strip meats from bones and cut into bite size pieces. Strain stock in pot and add water to yield 8 cups of stock. Return meats to broth. Heat oil in a medium skillet and saute the onion, carrot, celery and minced garlic for about 5 minutes. Add saute mixture to pot along with the potatoes, beans, tomatoes, salt, rosemary, pepper and thyme. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for about 10 minutes. Stir in the peas, lemon zest and red pepper. Heat through and serve garnished with parsley.
