To Brine: Combine Morton(R) Kosher Salt and sugar in cool water in a large, clean stockpot until completely dissolved. Place the turkey breast in the brine until completely submerged. Cover and refrigerate for 5 hours. Remove the turkey breast from the brine, rinse inside and out under cool running water; pat dry with paper towel. To Roast: Mix the softened butter with the pepper. Place turkey breast on rack in roasting pan. Rub the seasoned butter under the breast skin. Brush the skin with the melted butter. Pour the 1/2 cup liquid (wine, broth or water) over the pan bottom to prevent drippings from burning. Roast turkey breast at 450 degrees F for 15 minutes, then rotate the roasting pan. Continue roasting until the skin turns golden brown, an additional 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F; continue to roast, rotating the pan once about halfway through cooking, until the * internal temperature in the deepest part of the breast registers 170 degrees F, 30 to 45 minutes longer*. Remove the turkey breast from the oven. Let stand 20 minutes before carving.
