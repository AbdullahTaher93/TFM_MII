In a small saucepan, combine heavy cream and corn syrup. Stir to combine, and bring just to a boil over medium-high heat. Remove from heat, and add chocolate and peppermint extract. Whisk until chocolate is melted. If necessary, adjust consistency with additional corn syrup. Pour over ice cream, and garnish with chopped peppermint candy. Serve immediately.
