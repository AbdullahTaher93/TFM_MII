Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Combine olive oil and garlic in a bowl; brush over both sides of the eggplant slices. Arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to cool on a wire rack. Reduce oven heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 1-quart baking dish. Arrange half the eggplant slices in the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with 1 1/2 teaspoons basil and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese. Spread ricotta cheese over eggplant. Pour tomatoes over ricotta cheese and sprinkle with remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons basil. Season with Worcestershire sauce. Top with remaining sliced eggplant and spread with mozzarella cheese and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes and remove foil. Continue baking until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes more.
