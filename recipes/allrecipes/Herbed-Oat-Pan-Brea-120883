Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a saucepan, bring water to a boil; stir in oats. Remove from the heat. Stir in 3 tablespoons butter; cool to 120 degrees F (130 degrees F). In a mixing bowl, combine 1-1/2 cups flour, sugar, yeast and salt; set aside. Beat in oat mixture until moistened. Add egg. Beat with electric hand mixer at medium speed for 3 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a stiff dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes. Punch dough down. Press dough into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Brush with 4 tablespoons melted butter. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Brush with remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Combine the Parmesan cheese, basil, garlic powder and oregano; sprinkle over bread. Bake 10-15 minutes longer or until brown.
