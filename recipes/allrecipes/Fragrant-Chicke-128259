In a 1-quart (1-L) plastic bag, combine the lime juice, basil, mint, cilantro, tamari or soy sauce, the oil, garlic, and curry powder. Place the chicken between two pieces of waxed paper. Using a chef's mallet, pound the chicken pieces to a uniform thickness. Add the chicken to the mixture in the bag. Close the bag securely and turn the bag to coat the chicken with the marinade. Refrigerate overnight, turning the bag occasionally. Grill the chicken over hot coals, 6 to 8 minutes per side. Or broil the chicken 2 inches (5 cm) from the heat, 5 to 6 minutes per side.
