Heat grill. Rub pork chops all over with steak seasoning. Grill, turning once, 12 to 16 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F. Meanwhile, stir together remaining ingredients. Butter may set if sauce cools to room temperature, making sauce cloudy. If this happens, heat in microwave a few seconds at a time until butter just melts.
