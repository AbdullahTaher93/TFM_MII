Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spread the cream cheese in a layer in a 9 inch square baking dish. Spread a layer of pizza sauce over the cream cheese, followed by layers of shredded cheese, green chilies, black olives, jalapenos, and pepperoni. Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until heated throughout.
