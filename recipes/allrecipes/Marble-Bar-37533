Microwave semi-sweet and white chocolates in separate microwavable bowls on HIGH 2 minutes or until chocolates are almost melted, stirring halfway through heating time. Stir until chocolates are completely melted. Stir 1/2 cup of the nuts into each bowl. Alternately spoon melted chocolates onto wax paper-lined cookie sheet or tray. Swirl chocolates with knife several times for marble effect. Refrigerate 1 hour or until firm. Break into pieces.
