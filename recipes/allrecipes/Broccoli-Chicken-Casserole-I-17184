Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken and broccoli in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. In a medium saucepan combine cream of chicken soup, mayonnaise, curry powder and lemon juice. Bring all to a boil over low heat, stirring constantly. Pour soup mixture over chicken/broccoli mixture and top with shredded cheese. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 20 minutes or until cheese is melted.
