Sprinkle both sides of fillets with salt and pepper. In a large nonstick skillet, cook salmon in oil over medium heat for 10-15 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork, turning once. Remove and keep warm. Combine the water, vinegar, lemon juice and brown sugar; pour into skillet. Bring to a boil; cook until liquid is reduced to about 1/3 cup. Serve over salmon.
