Stir together espresso and sugar until sugar dissolves. Transfer to an 8-by-8-inch glass or metal baking dish and place, uncovered, in the freezer. After 45 minutes, stir mixture with a fork to break up the ice forming on the sides and freeze for another 2 1/2 hours, stirring every half hour. It should become slushy. Whip the cream with an electric mixer until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes. Add confectioners' sugar and beat until well blended, about 1minute more. Scoop granita into four tall glasses and top with a generous dollop of whipped cream. Garnish with crushed espresso beans or chocolate curls.
