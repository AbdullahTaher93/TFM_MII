Combine kidney beans, corn, and tomatoes in a salad bowl. Whisk together vinegar, brown sugar, cumin, onion flakes, salt, and black pepper in a separate bowl. Spoon liquid from bowl of kidney bean mixture into dressing if needed for extra moisture. Mix until brown sugar has dissolved. Pour dressing over bean mixture and stir to combine. Refrigerate at least 1 hour.
