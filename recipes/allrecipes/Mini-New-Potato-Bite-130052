Place potatoes in large saucepan; add enough water to cover. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook 15 min. or until potatoes are tender. Meanwhile, mix cream cheese, sour cream and Parmesan cheese; cover. Refrigerate until ready to use. Drain potatoes. Cool slightly. Cut potatoes in half; cut small piece from bottom of each potato half so potato lies flat. Place on serving platter. Top each potato half with 1 tsp. of the cream cheese mixture. Sprinkle with bacon and chives.
