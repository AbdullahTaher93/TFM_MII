Coat a pot with nonstick spray and warm it over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Add onions and garlic and saute for 3 minutes. Add eggplant, zucchini, tomatoes, beans, sweet peppers, basil and black pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. Stir in parsley before serving.
