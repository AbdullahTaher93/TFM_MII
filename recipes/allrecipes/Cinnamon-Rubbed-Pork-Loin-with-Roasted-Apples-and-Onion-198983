Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Coat a large roasting pan with non-stick cooking spray. In a small bowl, combine lemon peel, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, and nutmeg. In another small bowl, combine oil and half of the spice mixture. Season pork with salt and pepper, and rub with the oil mixture. Set aside. In a large bowl, toss apple wedges and onion wedges with lemon juice and remaining spice mixture. Place in the reserved pan with pork and 1/4 cup water. Roast, tossing the apple mixture once, for about 50 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted into the thickest portion registers 155 degrees F and juices run clear. Remove from oven and allow to stand for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, bring apple juice and SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat. In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, puree two-thirds of the apple mixture with the pan liquids until smooth. Add to the juice mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper, if desired. Cook on medium-low heat until warm. Cut pork into thin slices. Garnish with remaining cooked apple and onion wedges. Serve with the sauce on the side.
