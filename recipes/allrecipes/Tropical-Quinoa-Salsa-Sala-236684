Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, about 15 minutes. Refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour. Stir cooled quinoa, watermelon, bell pepper, cucumber, red onion, mango, pineapple, and chopped cilantro leaves together in a large bowl. Whisk wine vinegar, honey, pineapple juice, lime juice, and garlic together in a small bowl; drizzle in canola oil, whisking constantly. Pour dressing over quinoa mixture; toss gently to combine. Place salad in a serving bowl; garnish with lime slices, jalapeno slices, and reserved cilantro leaves.
