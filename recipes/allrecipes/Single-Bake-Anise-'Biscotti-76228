Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a cookie sheet or jellyroll pan with baking spray and set aside. Mix the oil, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and sugar together in a large mixing bowl. Add eggs and egg white, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add anise extract. Stir until blended. Set aside. Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, nonfat dry milk and anise seed in a medium size mixing bowl. Pour the flour mixture into the oil and egg mixture and stir until blended. Divide dough in half. Shape each half into a log approximately 3 1/2 inches wide by 12 inches long. Place the logs on the prepared pan 2 inches apart. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F oven for 20-25 minutes. Remove from oven and cool for 5 minutes. Slice the loaves with a sharp knife into 48 slices, approximately 1/2 inch wide. Cool and store in airtight containers. Cookies will stay fresh up to 5 days.
