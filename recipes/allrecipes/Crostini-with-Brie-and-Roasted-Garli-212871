Place bread slices on ungreased baking sheet. Bake in preheated 350 degree F oven, 3 to 5 minutes on each side or until lightly toasted on top and bottom but still soft inside. Spread thin layer of tomato paste on bread slices; spread with cheese. Bake 2 to 3 minutes or until cheese just begins to melt. Serve warm.
