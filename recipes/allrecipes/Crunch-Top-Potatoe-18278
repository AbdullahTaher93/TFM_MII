Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Pour butter into a 9x13 inch pan. Arrange potato slices in a single layer over the butter. Combine the cheese, cornflakes and paprika in a bowl and sprinkle the mixture over the potatoes. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 20 minutes or until heated through.
