In a bowl, combine the first six ingredients. Cut in butter until crumble. Combine egg and milk; stir into crumb mixture just until moistened. Turn onto a floured surface; knead 10-15 times. Roll out to 1-in. thickness; cut with a 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter. Place on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 450 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or until golden brown.
