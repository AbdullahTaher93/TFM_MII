In a large skillet, saute ham and onion in butter until the onion is tender. Combine soup and milk; stir into ham mixture. Add broccoli; heat through. Pour into an ungreased shallow 2-1/2-qt. baking dish. Combine biscuit mix and water until a soft dough forms. On a lightly floured surface, knead dough 10 times. Roll out into a 12-in. square; sprinkle with parsley. Roll up jellyroll style. Cut into 12 pieces; place over the ham mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until biscuits are golden and the ham mixture is bubbly.
