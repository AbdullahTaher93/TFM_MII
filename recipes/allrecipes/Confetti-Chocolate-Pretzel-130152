Place chocolate in 1-cup glass measuring cup; microwave as directed on package. Let stand 5 minutes to cool. Dip pretzels halfway into chocolate, tilting cup to evenly coat each pretzel. Scrape off excess chocolate. Holding pretzels over plate, immediately sprinkle with cereal. Place on waxed paper-lined tray. Refrigerate 15 minutes or until set.
