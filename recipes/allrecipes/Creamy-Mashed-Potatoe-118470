In a large saucepan, bring water and milk to a rolling boil. Remove from the heat. Add the contents of both envelopes from the potato package. Let stand for 1 minute; whip with a fork. Place the cream cheese in a microwave-safe bowl; cover and heat at 70% power for 45 seconds or until softened. Stir into the potatoes. Transfer to a greased 1-qt. baking dish. Sprinkle with cheese. Broil 4 in. from the heat for 3-4 minutes or until cheese is melted.
