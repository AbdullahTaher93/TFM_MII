Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray. Microwave squash on high for 2 minutes. Cut squash in half lengthwise and scoop out seeds. Peel squash with a vegetable peeler. Cut into quarters. Cut quarters into 4x3/4 inch sticks. Mix together the cornflake crumbs and the seasoning salt in a shallow dish. Pour the maple syrup into a second shallow dish. Dip the squash sticks into the syrup and then coat with the crumb mixture. Place coated sticks in a single layer on the prepared pan. Bake for 45 to 60 minutes, or until squash sticks are fork tender.
