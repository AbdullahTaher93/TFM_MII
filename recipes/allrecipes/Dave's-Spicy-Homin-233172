Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels, reserving bacon grease in the skillet. Crumble bacon. Cook and stir onion in reserved bacon grease over medium heat until caramelized, about 15 minutes. Stir hominy, jalapenos, and garlic into onion. Season with red pepper flakes, white pepper, and black pepper. Continue to cook and stir until flavors are combined, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir bacon and tomatoes into onion mixture; cook and stir until tomatoes are heated through, about 5 minutes.
