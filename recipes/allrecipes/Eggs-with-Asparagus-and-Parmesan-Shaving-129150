Break up any large bunches of spring salad, then put into a mixing bowl. Thinly slice the endive on the diagonal, discarding the last 1/2 inch of the bottom. Add to the spring salad mix together with the chives and toss together; set aside. Put all the ingredients for the dressing in a screw-top jar and season with salt and pepper to taste. Shake together to mix. Steam the asparagus until just tender, about 4 minutes. Alternatively, cook the asparagus in a wide pan of simmering water 3 to 4 minutes. To test, pierce the thickest part of the stalk with a thin, sharp knife. If cooked in simmering water, carefully lift out the spears with a slotted spoon; drain thoroughly on paper towels. While the asparagus is cooking, half fill a skillet with water and bring to a boil. Add the vinegar, then reduce the heat so the water just simmers. Carefully crack 4 of the eggs, one at a time, and slip into the water. Cook until the yolks have just set, about 1 minute. Remove the poached eggs from the water with a slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. Keep warm while poaching the remaining eggs. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss together. Spread the salad out on a large serving platter. Arrange the asparagus on the salad and place the poached eggs on top. Sprinkle the Parmesan shavings and grind a little pepper on top.
