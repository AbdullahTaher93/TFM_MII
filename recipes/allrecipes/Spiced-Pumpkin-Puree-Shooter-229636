In a 3 quart soup pot heat oil. Add onions and saute 4-5 minutes. Add pumpkin puree and chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer soup 10-12 minutes. Season soup with salt and pepper. Remove soup from heat (can be made in advance up to this point). In a bowl combine yogurt, and spices, mix well. Whisk in 1 cup of the spiced yogurt into the soup. Set 16 3-oz shot glasses (or votive candle holders) on a clean work surface. Divide soup among the glasses and top each with a teaspoon of remaining yogurt. Sprinkle with toasted seeds if desired and serve.
