Place adzuki beans in a medium saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 30 to 45 minutes, until tender. Heat olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat, and saute garlic about 1 minute. Mix in kale and 2 tablespoons water. Season with tamari, cumin, and coriander. Thoroughly blend in adzuki beans. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer about 20 minutes, until kale is tender. Season with salt and pepper.
