Preheat a grill or a grill pan to medium-high. Drizzle the mushrooms with EVOO and season with grill seasoning. Grill the mushrooms until fork-tender and well marked but not entirely soft, 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Meanwhile, drizzle the bread with EVOO and grill until lightly toasted, 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Rub the garlic all over the bread and cut into dice. Place the bread in a large bowl and add the tomatoes, Cubanelle peppers, roasted peppers, onion, cheese, arugula, basil and parsley. Dress the salad with the red wine vinegar, lemon juice and a liberal drizzle of EVOO. Season the salad with salt and pepper to taste. Pile the salad evenly on top of the mushroom caps.
