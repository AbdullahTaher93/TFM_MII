Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute shrimp shells in melted butter until pink and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Add water; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and simmer until flavors combine, about 20 minutes. Heat 1/3 cup olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute zucchini and eggplant with a pinch of salt and pepper in hot oil until soft, 6 to 7 minutes. Clear a space in the center of the skillet. Add tomato; saute in the center of the skillet until slightly caramelized, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic to the skillet; cook and stir all vegetables together until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute shrimp in hot oil until shrimp are pink, about 1 minute per side. Combine vegetable mixture, shrimp, couscous, tarragon, and dill together in a bowl. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and pat mixture into a flat shape. Pour hot shrimp stock through a strainer into couscous mixture, discarding strained shells. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil and let sit until couscous is tender and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Toss.
