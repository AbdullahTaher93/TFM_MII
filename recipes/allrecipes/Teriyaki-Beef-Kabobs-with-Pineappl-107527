In a small bowl, mix the teriyaki sauce, honey, garlic and ginger. Place beef and bell peppers in a large, resealable plastic bag. Pour in marinade, seal and refrigerate for 1 hour or overnight. Preheat grill for medium-high heat. Thread a piece of beef, then bell pepper and pineapple onto skewers, leaving a small space between each item, until all ingredients are used up. Discard marinade. Place kabobs on hot grill; cover and cook, turning once, until grill marks form on both sides and beef is cooked through, about 8 minutes. Serve.
