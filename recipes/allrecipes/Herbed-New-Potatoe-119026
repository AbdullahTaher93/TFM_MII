Remove a strip of peel from the middle of each potato. Place potatoes in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until tender. In a small bowl, combine the remaining ingredients. Drain potatoes; add butter mixture and toss gently.
