Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir pork in hot oil until browned on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir water, beef bouillon, and chicken bouillon together in a large pot over medium-high heat until bouillon dissolves. Add pork, rutabaga, carrots, and celery; bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until vegetables tender, about 40 minutes. Stir hominy and kidney beans into pork-vegetable mixture and simmer until hominy and meat are tender, about 30 minutes more. Season with salt and ground black pepper.
