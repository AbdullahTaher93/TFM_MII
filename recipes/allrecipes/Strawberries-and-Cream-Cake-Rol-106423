Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease bottom and sides of a 15x10x1-inch jellyroll pan; line pan with waxed paper; grease and flour waxed paper. Set aside. Beat egg yolks at high speed of an electric mixer until thick and pale; gradually add 1/3 cup SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, beating constantly. Stir in oil and vanilla extract. Whip egg whites at high speed until foamy; gradually add remaining 1/3 cup SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and corn syrup, beating until stiff but not dry. Fold beaten egg whites into egg yolk mixture. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt; gradually fold into egg mixture. Spoon batter into prepared pan; spread batter evenly.
