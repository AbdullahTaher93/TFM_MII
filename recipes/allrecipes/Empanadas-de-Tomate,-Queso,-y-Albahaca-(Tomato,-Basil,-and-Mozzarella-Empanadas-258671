Combine tomatoes and basil in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Mix in mozzarella cheese and olive oil. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top. Let marinate at room temperature, about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets with cooking spray. Arrange pastry discs on a flat work surface. Dab a little water around the rims. Place a large tablespoonful of the tomato mixture in the center; fold pastry over and press with a fork to seal. Transfer empanadas to the prepared baking trays. Brush mustard over tops; sprinkle sesame seeds over mustard. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
