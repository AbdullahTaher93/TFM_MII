Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a medium pot, warm the broth over medium heat. In a large, deep skillet or a medium Dutch oven, heat 3 tablespoons EVOO, 3 turns of the pan, over medium to medium-high heat. Stir in the rice to coat with the oil, and toast for 2 minutes. Add the beets, onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Pour in the wine and cook until absorbed into the rice, then begin adding broth a couple of ladles at a time, stirring with each addition, until the rice is cooked, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. While the risotto is working, on a baking sheet, toss the asparagus with the remaining 2 tablespoons EVOO, season with salt and pepper and roast for 10 minutes. Serve shallow bowls of beet risotto with the roasted asparagus and crumbled cheese on top.
