Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add apple, fennel and onion. Cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in thyme, sage and nutmeg. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in broth and vermouth (or wine), stirring to scrape up any browned bits. Bring to a simmer. Add mussels and stir to combine. Return to a simmer. Cover, reduce heat and simmer until the mussels open, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir; discard any unopened mussels before serving.
