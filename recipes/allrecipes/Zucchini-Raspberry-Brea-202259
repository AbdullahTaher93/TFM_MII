Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Combine flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Mix sugar, egg, zucchini, vegetable oil, and lemon peel in a separate bowl, then stir in to the flour mixture. Gently fold in the walnuts and raspberries. Pour batter into the loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes, then cover with aluminum foil. Continue baking until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
