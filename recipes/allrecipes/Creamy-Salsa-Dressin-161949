In a food processor, pulse tomato, onion, cilantro, serrano, garlic, pepper, and salt until finely chopped. Transfer salsa to a sieve; drain 5 minutes, gently pressing with a spoon to remove excess liquid (discard liquid). Transfer salsa to a small bowl; stir in mayonnaise, seasoned rice vinegar, lime zest and juice, and cumin. Adjust heat level with serrano or cayenne pepper to taste. Use to dress taco salad, tossed greens, tacos, or tostadas.
