Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Heat olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and cook and stir garlic in the hot oil just until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir artichoke hearts, peppers, and olives into the skillet until flavors are blended, about 5 minutes. Gently fold the spinach into the mixture and stir just until slightly wilted and dark green. Remove from heat and stir in penne pasta until thoroughly combined; lightly toss pasta mixture with feta cheese. Place a lid over the skillet and let the pasta and vegetables steam for 10 minutes before serving.
