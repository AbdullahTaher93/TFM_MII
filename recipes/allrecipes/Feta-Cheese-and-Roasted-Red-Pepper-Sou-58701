Preheat your oven's broiler. Place red bell peppers a few inches from the heat, and broil until blackened, turning frequently to roast evenly. Remove from the oven, cool slightly, and peel. Remove seeds, and chop into 1 inch pieces. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat, and spray with cooking spray. Add onions, garlic and celery, and saute with the cumin, coriander, cayenne pepper and salt until onions and celery are tender. Stir in the sour cream, Merlot, milk, soy sauce, lemon juice, feta cheese, roasted pepper, and mint leaves. Transfer portions of the soup to a blender, and process until smooth. Do not fill the blender more than halfway to prevent overflow. Heat puree in a saucepan until warm.
