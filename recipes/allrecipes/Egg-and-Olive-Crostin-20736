Place eggs in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet. In a medium bowl, thoroughly blend cream cheese, lemon juice, prepared Dijon-style mustard and ground black pepper. Stir in chopped eggs, olives and chives. Cut each bread slice into 4 triangles. Lay triangles flat and create a shallow hollow on the face of each. Brush with olive oil and fill with mixture from the bowl. Arrange slices on baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven 10 minutes, or until bread is lightly toasted. Garnish with paprika before serving.
