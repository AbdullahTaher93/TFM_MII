Cut up the chicken and veggies into bite sized pieces. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the water and garlic powder and bring to a boil. Add the broccoli, zucchini and mushrooms. Cover and cook for 3 minutes. Add the chicken and the cream. Cook uncovered about 5 minutes, stir occasionally. The cream will reduce (boil down) and become a thick sauce. Remove from heat. Stir in the pesto sauce. Serve garnished with the Parmesan cheese.
