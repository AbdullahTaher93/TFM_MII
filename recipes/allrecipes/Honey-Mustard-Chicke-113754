Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. On 2 large rimmed baking sheets, toss the chicken and olive oil; season with salt. Roast until nearly cooked through, about 20 minutes for the breasts and 25 minutes for the legs, thighs and wings. Pour off the fat on the baking sheets. Preheat the broiler and position a rack just below center. In a saucepan, bring the honey, mustard, pepper and a pinch of salt to a boil. On 1 of the baking sheets, toss all of chicken with the honey mixture. Turn the chicken skin side down and broil for about 5 minutes, basting with the honey and shifting the baking sheet, as necessary, until the pieces are browned. Turn the chicken skin side up and broil for 5 minutes longer, basting occasionally. The chicken is done when it's cooked through and the skin is deeply glazed but not blackened. Transfer the chicken to a platter. Pour the juices from the baking sheet into a heatproof bowl and skim off the fat. Serve the chicken, passing the juices on the side.
