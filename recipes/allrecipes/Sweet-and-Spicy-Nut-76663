Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Line baking sheet with foil; spray with CRISCO(R) No Stick Cooking Spray. In a large saucepan, combine the nuts, water and sugar. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Boil and stir for 5 minutes. With a slotted spoon, carefully remove the nuts; spread nuts on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Bake 10-13 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from oven and transfer nuts to a large mixing bowl, breaking apart any that are stuck together. Drizzle with CRISCO(R) Canola Oil and vanilla. In a small bowl, mix together salt, cinnamon and cayenne pepper; sprinkle over nuts. Toss to evenly coat. Return coated nuts to baking pan and bake for 10 minutes or until browned and crisp. Cool completely, then store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.
