Place one tortilla in a small non-stick saute pan over medium heat, sprinkle 3 tablespoons (or 1/2 ounce) cheese over one half of tortilla. Once tortilla is warmed through fold tortilla over cheese to form a half circle quesadilla, only toasting on one side. Remove from saute pan, toasted side down, and layer bottom half of quesadilla with one tomato slice, one folded (1/2 oz.) turkey slice, 2 teaspoons of alfalfa sprouts, and 2 avocado slices, fold quesadilla over to enclose fillings, using a sandwich pick to hold closed if needed. Repeat with remaining tortillas and fillings.
