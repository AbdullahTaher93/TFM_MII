Put a pizza stone on the oven floor and preheat the oven to 500 degrees F, allowing at least 45 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium skillet, heat the 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add the tomatoes and cook over high heat, stirring a few times, until slightly thickened, about 4 minutes. Season with salt. Cut the pizza dough into 4 pieces and pat each one into a disk. Transfer the disks to a floured baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 20 minutes. On a lightly floured work surface, roll 1 disk of dough into a 9-inch round. Transfer it to a floured pizza peel or flat cookie sheet. Spoon about 1/4 cup of the tomatoes over the dough. Top with one-fourth of the mozzarella and drizzle with olive oil. Slide the pizza onto the hot stone and bake for about 4 minutes, or until browned around the edges and bubbling. Transfer the pizza to a work surface and sprinkle with 4 basil leaves. Cut it into 4 wedges and serve immediately. Repeat with the remaining pizza dough, tomatoes, cheese, olive oil and basil.
