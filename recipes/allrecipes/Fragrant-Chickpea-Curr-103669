Heat oil in a Dutch oven over low heat while preparing onions and garlic. Increase heat to medium and add onions; cook until tender, about 4 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for about 1 minute. Stir in cinnamon sticks, cloves, ginger, cumin, turmeric and cayenne pepper; cook until fragrant, stirring constantly for about 1 minute. Stir in chickpeas and tomatoes; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 10 minutes to blend flavors. Remove cinnamon sticks and stir in cilantro. Season with salt to taste.
