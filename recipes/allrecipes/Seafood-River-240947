Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a pot over medium-high heat. Saute scallops and shrimp in hot butter until shrimp are pink, about 5 minutes. Stir tomatoes, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and pesto into shrimp mixture; cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes. Pour clam juice, whipping cream, Romano cheese, white wine, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and linguine into shrimp mixture. Roll remaining butter in flour and add to shrimp mixture and mix well. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until hot throughout and flavors blend, about 10 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Ladle pasta into bowls and spoon shrimp mixture over the top.
