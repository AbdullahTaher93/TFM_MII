Follow basic recipe for Creamy Macaroni and Cheese, but use pepper Jack cheese, not cheddar. Heat a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Cook ground beef, seasoning lightly with salt and pepper, until most of the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Stir in chili powder, salsa and chilies; simmer, 2 to 3 minutes. Add cilantro, then stir mixture into macaroni. Serve hot.
