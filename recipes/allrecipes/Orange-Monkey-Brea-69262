Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch Bundt pan. Toss the sugar and orange zest together in a small bowl. Whisk the orange juice and melted butter together in a separate small bowl. Roll the biscuit dough pieces into balls. Dip each ball into the orange juice mixture and then roll in the sugar mixture. Arrange the coated balls evenly in the prepared pan. Pour the remaining orange juice mixture over the biscuits. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Allow to cool in the pan for a few minutes before turning out onto a serving platter. Serve warm.
