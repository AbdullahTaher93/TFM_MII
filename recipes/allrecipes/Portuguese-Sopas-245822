Place pot roast, onion, mint, garlic, cinnamon, allspice, and bay leaves in a large pot. Season with salt and pepper. Pour in enough water to cover the roast. Cook over medium heat until roast is tender, adding more water if needed, about 4 hours. Stir cabbage wedges into the pot. Simmer until cabbage is tender, about 30 minutes.
