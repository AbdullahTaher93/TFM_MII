Spread half of the peanut butter on one side of each tortilla, spreading from the center to within an inch of the edge. Distribute apple slices evenly on one tortilla to cover the peanut butter. Sandwich together the two tortillas. Grill on a lightly oiled griddle or skillet over medium heat, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Cut into wedges and serve.
