Select 24 whole Shreddies for each Inukshuk. Stack 6 Shreddies for each leg, using a dab of chocolate icing in between to hold the stacks. Stand legs about 1/2-inch apart. Stack 5 Shreddies, using a dab of chocolate icing in between; centre body over top of both legs. Stack 3 Shreddies over a piece of fruit leather (approx. 2-inches long x 1/2-inch wide) using icing to stick Shreddies to fruit leather to make arms. If desired, instead of fruit leather, use 2 straight pretzel sticks to support Shreddies. Attach arms to body using icing. Stack remaining 4 Shreddies to form head, using icing to hold the Shreddies together. Repeat to make desired number of Inukshuks.
