Place the chicken in a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle with minced onion, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Top each with a slice of cheese. In a small bowl, combine the soup, sour cream and milk; pour over chicken. Toss the cracker crumbs and butter; sprinkle over chicken. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30-40 minutes or until chicken juices run clear and crumbs are golden.
