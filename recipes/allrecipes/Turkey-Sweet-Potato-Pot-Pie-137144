Heat oven to 400 degrees F. In large bowl, mix all ingredients except pie crust. Divide mixture evenly into 4 (1 1/4 to 2 cup) ungreased individual ramekins.** Remove pie crust from pouch; place flat on cutting board. Cut crust into 4 wedge-shaped pieces. Top each filled ramekin with 1 crust piece. With kitchen scissors or knife, trim crust edges. Pinch and flute edge, filling in areas with trimmed pie crust pieces where needed. With knife, cut several small slits in crusts for steam to escape. Place ramekins on cookie sheet. Bake 25 to 33 minutes or until filling is bubbly and crust is deep golden brown. During last 10 to 15 minutes of baking, cover crust edge with strips of foil to prevent excessive browning. Cool 5 minutes before serving.
