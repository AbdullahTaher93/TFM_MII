Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the garlic 1 minute. Pour in the chicken broth and half-and-half. Cook and stir until heated through. Mix the Parmesan cheese and American cheese into the skillet. Cook and stir until American cheese is melted. Season the mixture with basil, parsley, and pepper. Mix in the imitation crabmeat, and continue cooking until heated through. Serve over the cooked pasta.
