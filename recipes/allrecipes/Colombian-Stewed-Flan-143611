Heat the corn oil in a skillet over medium heat. Gently lie the steak in the oil and cook each side until brown. Remove the steak to a plate. Add the onions, garlic, tomatoes, salt, pepper, and cumin to the skillet; cook and stir until the onions are tender. Return the steak to the skillet. Pour the water into the skillet. Stir in the crumbled bouillon. Bring the water to a boil and drop the heat to low; cover. Allow to simmer until the meat easily pulls apart with a fork, about 2 hours. Remove the steak to a cutting board. Use two forks to shred the meat. Transfer to a serving plate. Pour the onion and tomato mixture from the skillet over the shredded beef.
