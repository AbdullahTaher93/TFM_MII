Conventional method: Line bottom of 13x9 inch baking pan with cooking parchment. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Melt chocolate and butter with pepper over low heat. Leave to cool. Beat eggs with sugar and vanilla until blended. Stir in cooled chocolate mixture, then Kahlua. Resift flour, salt and baking powder into mixture and stir well until blended and then add nuts and turn into baking pan. Bake for approximately 25 minutes, until wooden pick inserted into center comes out clean. Be careful not to over bake. Leave in pan to cool. Prepare Kahlua Quick Fudge Frosting: Melt chocolates with butter over a low heat. Heat Kahlua and heavy cream together. Combine chocolate and Kahlua mixtures with powdered sugar and beat until well blended and thick. If necessary, beat in a little extra powdered sugar for good spreading consistency. Frost brownies immediately as mixture stiffens upon cooling. Sprinkle with additional nuts, if desired. Cut in about 30 squares or bars.
