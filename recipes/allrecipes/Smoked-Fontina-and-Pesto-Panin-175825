Lay 4 of the bread slices out on a cutting board or other work surface. Spread slices equally on both sides (top and bottom) with half the butter. Then spread the top of each slice with 1 teaspoon of the pesto sauce. Place equal amounts of cheese on top of pesto on each slice. Spread remaining 4 bread slices equally on both sides with remaining half of the butter and place on top of cheese. Grill sandwiches, 2 or 3 at a time, in a panini maker or electric indoor grill (see notes) according to manufacturers directions until sandwiches are golden brown and cheese is melted, about 2 to 3 minutes. Let sandwiches cool, then cut in half and transfer to individual plates.
