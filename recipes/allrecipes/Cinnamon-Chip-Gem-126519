In large bowl, beat butter and cream cheese until well blended; stir in flour, sugar and almonds. Cover; refrigerate about 1 hour. Divide dough into 4 equal parts. Shape each part into 12 smooth balls. Place each ball in small muffin cup (1 3/4 inches in diameter); press evenly on bottom and up sides of each cup. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In small bowl, beat eggs. Add EAGLE BRAND(r) and vanilla; mix well. Place 7 cinnamon chips in bottom of each muffin cup; fill generous three-fourths full with EAGLE BRAND(r) mixture. Bake 18 to 20 minutes or until tops are puffed and just beginning to turn golden brown. Cool 3 minutes. Sprinkle about 10 chips on top of the filling. Cool completely in pan on wire rack. Remove from pan using small metal spatula or sharp knife. Cool completely. Store leftovers tightly covered at room temperature.
