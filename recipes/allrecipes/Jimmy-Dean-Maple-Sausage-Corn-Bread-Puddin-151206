Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place corn bread in 8x8 glass baking dish. Saute onions in butter until translucent remove from heat and sprinkle over cornbread cubes. Sprinkle thyme over top. Sprinkle corn and sausage over bread cubes. In separate bowl, whisk together eggs, cream, salt and pepper. Pour over breads cubes until almost covered. Press protruding bread cubes down to submerge. Let sit for 10-15 minutes so that bread can absorb egg mixture. Place on middle or lower rack in oven and cook for 40 minutes until golden (the center should be almost completely set). Remove from oven and let rest 10-15 minutes before cutting.
