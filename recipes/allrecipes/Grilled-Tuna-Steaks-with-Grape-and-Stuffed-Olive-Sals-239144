Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Mix grapes, olives, shallot, and olive oil together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Brush lemon juice over tuna steaks. Cook tuna on preheated grill until the flesh flakes easily with a fork but still is pink in the center for medium, 4 to 6 minutes per side.
