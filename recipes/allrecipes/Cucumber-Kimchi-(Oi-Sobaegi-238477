Cut cucumber into 4-inch pieces and cut each piece into quarters. Place cucumber pieces in a bowl, add salt, and mix until coated. Let cucumbers stand at room temperature until liquid has been extracted, about 30 minutes; drain. Combine scallions, vinegar, garlic, ginger, chile oil, Korean chile powder, sugar, and fish sauce in a non-reactive bowl. Stir cucumbers into the vinegar mixture; cover bowl with plastic wrap. Refrigerate cucumber mixture until chilled and flavors have blended, at least 30 minutes.
