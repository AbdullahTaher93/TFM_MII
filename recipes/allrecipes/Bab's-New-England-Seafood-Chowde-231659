Melt butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir bacon in melted butter until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towel, reserving drippings in the pot. Add onion and celery to the reserved drippings; cook and stir until the onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir garlic, thyme, pepper, seafood seasoning, and paprika into the onion mixture. Sprinkle flour over the mixture and stir; cook for 2 minutes. Fold potatoes into the mixture. Pour seafood stock over the mixture. Add bay leaves. Bring the stock to a simmer; cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender and the liquid thickens to your liking, 20 to 30 minutes. Stir evaporated milk into the simmering stock; add cod, bay scallops, clam meat, and shrimp. Continue cooking the mixture at a simmer until the seafood is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Garnish with parsley to serve.
