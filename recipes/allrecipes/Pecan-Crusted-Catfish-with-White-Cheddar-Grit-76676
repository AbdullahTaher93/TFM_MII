For the Catfish: Mix together the dry ingredients in a shallow dish. In another shallow dish, whisk together the eggs and milk. In a third shallow dish, mix the thyme, pecans, and salt and pepper to taste. Coat each catfish fillet in the flour mixture, then egg, then nuts, coating completely. For the Grits: Bring broth to a boil in a two-quart saucepan. Reduce heat to simmer. Whisk in grits and cook until grits are soft but not mushy, about 12 to 15 minutes. Stir in heavy cream, cheddar cheese, salt and pepper. In a large, heavy skillet, heat the CRISCO(R) Pure Canola Oil to 350 degrees F. Carefully place the catfish filets into the hot oil, cook about 8 minutes, turning occasionally, until both sides are golden brown. Divide grits between 4 large bowls. Top each with a catfish filet. Garnish with sliced green onions and serve.
