In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add buttermilk, sugar, shortening, eggs, salt, baking soda and 2 cups flour; beat until blended. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Divide into 18 pieces. Roll each into a 9-in. rope; coil the ends of each rope toward center in opposite directions to form an S shape. Place 3 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 40 minutes. In a small, beat egg and water; brush over rolls. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
