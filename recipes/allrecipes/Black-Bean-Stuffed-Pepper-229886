Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour water into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Stir cream cheese in a bowl until smooth. Fold brown rice, spinach, diced tomatoes with green chiles, black beans, minced onion, cumin, and oregano into the cream cheese until evenly mixed. Halve bell peppers lengthwise. Remove and discard stem, seeds, and membranes. Fill each pepper half with about 3/4 cup of rice mixture; arrange into baking dish. Sprinkle cheese evenly over stuffed pepper halves. Bake in preheated oven until peppers are tender, 35 to 45 minutes.
