Combine oil, marmalade, apple juice, brown sugar, raisins, pumpkin pie spice and curry powder in a large bowl. Add sweet potatoes, cranberries and pecans; mix to coat well. Pour into prepared pan. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, stirring occasionally until potatoes and cranberries are tender. Pour into a serving bowl. Serve immediately.
