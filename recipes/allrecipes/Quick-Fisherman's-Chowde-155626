In Dutch oven, combine onion, stewed tomatoes, broth, clam juice, tomato paste and potatoes. Bring to boil; reduce heat. Cover and simmer 15 to 20 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Add remaining ingredients and simmer additional 5 minutes or until fish is cooked. Garnish with chopped parsley and serve with French bread, if desired.
