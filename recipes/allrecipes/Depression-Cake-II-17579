Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Sift together the flour, baking soda and baking powder. Set aside. In a large saucepan combine the coffee, sugar, butter, raisins, allspice and cinnamon. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside to cool to room temperature. Stir in flour mixture until well combined. Pour into a 9x13 inch pan. Bake in preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of cake comes out clean.
