Stir the cornstarch and water in a small cup until smooth. Set the mixture aside. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a 6-quart saucepot over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until it's well browned, stirring often. Remove the chicken. Add the remaining oil to the saucepot. Add the carrots, beans and onions. Cook over medium heat until the vegetable are tender-crisp. Stir in the broth. Heat to a boil. Add the tortellini and parsley, if desired. Cook for 10 minutes or until the tortellini is tender. Return the chicken to the saucepot and heat through. Stir the cornstarch mixture and stir it into the saucepot. Cook and stir until the mixture boils and thickens slightly.
