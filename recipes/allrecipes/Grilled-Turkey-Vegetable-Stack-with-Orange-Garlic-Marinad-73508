In a medium bowl, combine orange peel, orange juice, olive oil, vinegar, garlic, thyme, and pepper. Whisk together until well blended. Place turkey roast in self-closing plastic bag. Pour 1-1/2 cups marinade over turkey and turn to coat. Close bag and marinate in refrigerator overnight. Place zucchini and onion in shallow baking dish. Pour remaining 3/4 cup marinade over vegetables, cover and marinate in refrigerator 1 to 4 hours. Prepare outdoor grill for cooking. When the grill is ready, remove roast from marinade; discarding marinade. Lift and shift string netting on roast for easier removal after cooking. Place roast on grill rack over drip pan, cover grill and cook 1-1/2 to 2 hours or until no longer pink in center and the center internal temperature is 170 degrees F. Let stand 10 to 15 minutes; remove netting. Meanwhile, remove vegetables from marinade, shake off excess liquid and season with salt. Grill vegetables 2 to 3 minutes per side or until just cooked through. To serve, cut roast into thin slices. To make each stack, layer 3 slices of turkey with vegetables in-between the slices. Or to simplify, cut roast into thicker slices and top each slice with grilled vegetables.
