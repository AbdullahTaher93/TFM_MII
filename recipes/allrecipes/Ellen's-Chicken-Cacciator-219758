Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and brown the chicken thighs in the hot oil, about 5 minutes per side. Set the chicken aside. In the same skillet, cook and stir the onion and mushrooms until the mushrooms have softened, about 10 minutes. Mix in the garlic, and cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 more minutes. Pour in the tomatoes with their juice, white wine, orange juice, rosemary, salt, and black pepper, and stir until thoroughly combined. Stir in the chicken pieces and any accumulated juices, cover the skillet, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the chicken is tender and no longer pink inside, 30 to 40 minutes.
