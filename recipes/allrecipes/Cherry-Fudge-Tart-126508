In heavy saucepan, over medium heat, melt chocolate, sweetened condensed milk and salt. Cook and stir rapidly until very thick and bubbly, 5 to 8 minutes. Add water and egg yolks; cook and stir rapidly until mixture thickens and bubbles again. Remove from heat; stir in almond extract. Cool 15 minutes. Chill thoroughly, about 30 minutes; stir. Fold in whipped cream. Spoon into crusts. Chill 1 hour or until set. Divide cherry filling evenly among tarts immediately before serving. Store leftovers covered in refrigerator.
