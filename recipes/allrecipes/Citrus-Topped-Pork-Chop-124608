In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high. Brown chops on both sides. Season with salt, pepper and paprika. Combine jelly, juices, mustard and ginger. Pour over chops. Simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. Turn chops; cover and simmer 15 minutes. Top each chop with an orange and lemon slice. Cover and cook 6-8 minutes longer or until chops are done.
