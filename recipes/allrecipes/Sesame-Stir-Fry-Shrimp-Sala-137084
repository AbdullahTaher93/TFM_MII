With kitchen scissors or sharp knife, cut loops of dried noodles into 3- to 5-inch-long pieces; place in 1-quart bowl. Pour boiling water over noodles; let soak 5 to 7 minutes or until flexible but still slightly firm. Drain in colander; rinse and set aside. Meanwhile, in large bowl, reserve 3 tablespoons sesame sauce from meal starter. Spray 12-inch skillet or wok with cooking spray; heat over medium-high heat. Add remaining sesame sauce and frozen vegetables from meal starter. Cover; cook 5 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently, just until vegetables are crisp-tender. Remove from heat; cover to keep warm. To reserved sauce in bowl, stir in cilantro, vinegar, lime juice and ground red pepper. Add drained noodles, coleslaw blend and shrimp; toss to coat. Add cooked vegetables and sauce from skillet; toss. Top with peanuts.
