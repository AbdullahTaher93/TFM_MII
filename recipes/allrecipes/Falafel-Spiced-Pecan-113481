Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl, toss the pecans with the melted butter until evenly coated. In a small bowl, combine the falafel mix with the sugar and cayenne. Pour the spice mix over the pecans and toss to coat. Spread the spiced nuts on a lightly greased baking sheet and toast for about 9 minutes, stirring once or twice, until golden. Let cool.
