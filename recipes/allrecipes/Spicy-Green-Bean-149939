Heat the olive oil in a large skillet set over medium-high heat. Add the shallot and jalapeno; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Add green beans and season with salt. Cook and stir until tender but still bright green, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat and stir in lemon juice to loosen any bits from the bottom of the pan. Serve immediately.
