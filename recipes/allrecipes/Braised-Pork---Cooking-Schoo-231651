Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Pat pork roast dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook roast until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Pour tomatoes and beer over the roast. Arrange onions, garlic, bay leaves, and rosemary around the roast. Cover and bring to a simmer. Transfer pot to the preheated oven and cook until roast is tender and meat shreds easily with a fork, about 4 hours. Remove rosemary sprigs and bay leaves; discard. Serve roast with pan juices, onion, shallots, and tomato poured over the top.
