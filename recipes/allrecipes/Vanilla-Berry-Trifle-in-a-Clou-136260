Gently press 16 of the wafers into whipped topping around side of bowl. Pour milk into medium bowl. Add dry pudding mixes. Beat with wire whisk 2 min. or until well blended. Spoon half of the pudding evenly into prepared bowl; top with layers of half each of the remaining wafers and berries. Repeat layers; cover. Refrigerate at least 3 hours or until wafers begin to soften. Store leftover trifle in refrigerator.
