For pesto, combine the first five ingredients in a blender or food processor; cover and process until smooth. While processing, add oil in a steady stream. Place tortillas on two ungreased baking sheets. Spread each with about 1 tablespoon pesto. Sprinkle with chicken, tomatoes, olives and cheese. Bake at 450 degrees F for 5-8 minutes or until cheese is melted.
