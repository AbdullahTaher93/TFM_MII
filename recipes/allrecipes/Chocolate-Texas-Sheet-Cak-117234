In a large saucepan, bring the butter, water and cocoa to a boil. Remove from the heat. Combine the flour, sugar, baking soda and salt; stir into butter mixture. Combine the eggs and sour cream; stir into butter mixture until blended. Pour into a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. For frosting, in a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and confectioners' sugar. Add cocoa, vanilla and enough milk to achieve desired consistency. Spread over cake.
