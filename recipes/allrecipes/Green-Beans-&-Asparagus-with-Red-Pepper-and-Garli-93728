Cut the beans and asparagus into 2-inch pieces. Bring a large saucepan three-fourths full of water to a boil. Add the beans and asparagus and cook until they turn bright green and are tender-crisp, 1-3 minutes. Drain the vegetables then plunge them into a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Drain against and set aside. In a large frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the bell pepper and toss and stir for about 1 minute. Add the beans and asparagus and saute for 1 minute longer. Add the chili paste, ginger and garlic and toss for 1 minute longer. Drizzle with the homemade sesame oil and season with the salt and black pepper. Serve immediately. Combine ingredients for sesame oils in a food processor and set aside. Drizzle white and black homemade sesame oil around plate.
