Place noodles in a large bowl and cover with very hot water. Let stand until softened, about 15 minutes. Drain and chop into shorter lengths. Grind peanuts into a coarse, chunky meal using a food processor or mortar and pestle. Combine noodles, peanuts, lettuce, cucumber, carrots, bean sprouts, cilantro, mint, and green onions in a large bowl. Serve soy sauce and wasabi paste alongside.
