Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Toast bread slices until golden and crunchy, 3 to 5 minutes. Rub toasted bread with garlic cloves until evenly covered; rub with cut side of tomato until evenly covered. Spread olive oil evenly over slices with a pastry brush or by hand. Season with salt and pepper.
