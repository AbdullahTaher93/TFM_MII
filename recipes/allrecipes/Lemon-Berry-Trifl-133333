In a small microwaveable bowl, stir together the jam and 1/4 cup water and microwave for 1 minute at full power. Stir until slightly cool. Using an electric mixer, beat the cream at medium-high speed until stiff. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the lemon curd until incorporated. Cut the cake shells in half to form semi-circles. Lay 8 halves in an even layer in the bottom of a 10-cup trifle bowl (or other straight-sided, clear glass bowl). Drizzle 1/4 cup of the melted jam mixture onto the cake. Spoon one-third of the lemon cream on top and spread evenly. Sprinkle a half-pint of berries on top. Repeat the layering twice, mounding the last batch of berries in the center of the trifle.
