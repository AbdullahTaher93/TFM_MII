Rinse wild rice and wheat berries under cold running water. Drain well. In a medium saucepan, cook onion and garlic in olive oil over medium heat about 4 minutes or until tender. Stir in drained wild rice and wheat berries, chicken broth, sage and pepper. Bring to boil. Reduce heat. Simmer, covered, 30 minutes. Stir brown rice into wild rice mixture. Return to boil. Reduce heat. Simmer, covered, about 45 minutes, or until grains are tender. (If excess liquid remains in saucepan after grains are tender, remove lid and simmer until liquid evaporates.) Stir cherries and toasted pecans into rice mixture. Serve warm.
