Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Drizzle the olive oil over the cut sides of the tomatoes, and sprinkle with garlic, salt, and black pepper. Place tomatoes, cut sides up, onto the preheated grill, and grill until the tomatoes start to sizzle and show blackened grill marks, about 4 minutes. Flip the tomatoes over and grill until the garlic turns golden brown, about 3 more minutes.
