Heat olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in the hot oil until onion is tender, 2 to 5 minutes. Stir chicken broth, tomato juice, diced tomatoes and their juice, spinach, zucchini, carrots, celery, cannellini beans, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Bring soup to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cover pot. Simmer soup for 45 minutes. Bring soup back to a full boil and stir in rotini pasta. Reduce heat to low and simmer until pasta is tender, 10 to 15 more minutes.
