Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until potatoes are tender and split open, about 20 minutes. Drain and return potatoes to pot. Mash potatoes with butter, nutmeg, and salt using a potato masher or fork until well incorporated; stir in sour cream until mashed potatoes are creamy.
