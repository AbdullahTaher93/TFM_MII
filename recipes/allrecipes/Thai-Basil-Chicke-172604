Combine garlic and oil in a 10- to 12- in. frying pan. Stir often over medium-high heat until garlic is golden, 1 to 2 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer garlic to a small bowl. Add chicken to pan. Cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add 1/2 cup sliced basil to pan with garlic, lemon juice, water, soy sauce, sugar, and pepper. Cover and simmer until chicken is white in thickest part (cut to test), 6 to 7 minutes, spooning juices over chicken often. Put chicken on a platter; keep warm. Boil pan juices, uncovered, over high heat until reduced to 1/4 cup. Stir in remaining sliced basil; pour over chicken.
