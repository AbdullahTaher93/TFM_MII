Place apples in a 1-1/2-qt. microwave-safe dish. Combine the sugar, flour and cinnamon; sprinkle over apples and toss to coat. Cover and microwave on high for 3-4 minutes or until apples are tender. Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the biscuit mix, 2 tablespoons sugar and milk. Drop by tablespoonfuls over hot apple mixture. Combine cinnamon and remaining sugar; sprinkle over topping. Microwave, uncovered, for 4-6 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Serve warm.
