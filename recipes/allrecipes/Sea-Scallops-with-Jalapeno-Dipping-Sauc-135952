In a medium bowl combine the mustard, kosher salt, pepper, and fresh tarragon. Add the cleaned and cut scallops and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Place a large, dry, nonstick saute pan or skillet over high heat for 3 minutes. Add the butter and heat until melted. Pat the scallops dry with paper towels and place in the pan, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. If necessary, cook the scallops in 2 batches. Sear the scallops on one side for about 2 minutes, then turn them with tongs and cook for 2 minutes on the other side. Remove the scallops from the pan and set aside. In the skillet used to cook the scallops melt the butter. Add the shallots and jalapeno. Saute the shallots and jalapeno over medium heat 3 to 5 minutes until softened. Increase the heat to high and add the sherry, stirring with a wooden spoon to deglaze the pan. Add the orange juice, cream, tarragon, salt, and pepper, and cook until combined. Wash and dry the spinach leaves and divide evenly in the middle of the plates. Ladle the sauce around the sides of the plates, and place the seared scallops on top. Decorate each plate with slices of fresh mango and a sprig of fresh tarragon.
