Combine olives, tomato, cheese and basil; set aside. Beat together eggs, water, salt and pepper. Melt butter in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until sizzling; tilt pan so butter covers bottom of pan evenly. Add egg mixture; cook for 2 minutes or until eggs begin to set on bottom. Gently lift edges of omelet with a spatula to allow uncooked portion of eggs to flow to edges and set. Continue cooking for 3 minutes or until center is almost set. Sprinkle olive mixture over omelet, leaving a 1-inch wide border around the edge. Use a large spatula to fold one edge over the filling; cook 1 to 2 minutes longer or until cheese is melted and center is set. Cut omelet in half; transfer to two warm serving plates.
