Place chicken breasts in a large skillet. Pour enough water to almost cover, add bay leaf. Cover; simmer over medium-low heat until cooked, about 30 minutes. Drain. Cool 30 minutes. Wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes or until cold. Steam asparagus until tender-crisp, about 3 minutes. Cool in a colander under cold running water. Drain well. Cut asparagus on the diagonal at 1 1/2 inch intervals. Slice chicken into 1/4 inch thick slices. On a lettuce-lined serving plate, arrange chicken slices, asparagus and mango slices. To prepare vinaigrette: whisk the chutney, canola oil, vinegar and soy sauce in a small bowl. Drizzle dressing over salad and sprinkle with chopped pecans.
