In a large skillet, cook sausage, onion, cumin and chili powder over medium-high heat, stirring frequently until meat is thoroughly cooked and no longer pink. Stir in garlic, remove from heat; set aside to cool 5 minutes. Transfer sausage to a large mixing bowl; stir in lime juice and cheese. For each chimichanga, place 2 rounded tablespoons of mixture on egg roll wrapper; roll according to package instructions. To cook: in a wok, Dutch oven or fryer, add oil to a depth of 3 inches; heat to 375 F. Fry 3 or 4 at a time about 3 minutes or until deep golden brown; drain on paper towels. Serve with sauce if desired (see recipe below).
