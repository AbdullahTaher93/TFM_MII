In a large mixing bowl, cream together shortening and sugar. Beat in the eggs, Herman starter and milk. In a separate bowl, mix together flour, baking soda, salt and nutmeg. Stir flour mixture into the starter mixture until well blended. Turn dough out onto a well floured surface and roll out or flatten to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut out doughnuts with a doughnut cutter. Cover the donuts and let them rise for 1 hour. Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Carefully slide doughnuts into hot oil. Fry until golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels, sprinkle with confectioners' sugar and serve hot.
