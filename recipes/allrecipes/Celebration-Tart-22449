Place cookie sheet in oven; heat oven to 375 F. Roll out pastry on lightly floured surface. Cut out 6 circles about 5-3/4 inches in diameter, rerolling scraps as needed to make 6 circles. Press pastry circles evenly into 4-3/4-inch tart pans with removable bottoms, allowing pastry to extend 1/4-inch above edges of pans; set aside. In small saucepan, stir together cocoa, sugar and water; add 2 tablespoons butter. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly with whisk, until butter melts and mixture is smooth. Cool to room temperature, about 10 minutes. Spread cocoa mixture on bottom of tart shells, dividing evenly. Spoon pie filling over mixture, dividing evenly. In small bowl, stir together egg, corn syrup, brown sugar and melted butter; stir in pecans. Spoon over pie filling, dividing equally. Place tart pans on preheated cookie sheet. Bake 30 minutes or until set and filling is bubbly. Cool completely in pans on wire rack. Remove tarts from pans. Garnish with whipped cream.
