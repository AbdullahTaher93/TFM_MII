Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add linguine, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the shrimp, garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until garlic is lightly browned and shrimp is hot, about 5 minutes. Mix in the artichoke hearts, black olives, lemon juice and salt; cook until heated through. Toss with pasta in a serving dish and top with Parmesan cheese before serving.
