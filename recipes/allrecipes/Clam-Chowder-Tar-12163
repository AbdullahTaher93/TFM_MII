Place oven rack on highest level. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Chop the clams finely, and reserve 1/2 cup of the liquid. Beat the eggs well, and add clam liquid, cream, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Beat until smooth, and stir in the clams. Fry the bacon over moderate heat until crisp, and then remove from pan. Leave a thin layer of fat in the pan, and fry the onions until clear. Scrape onions and bacon fat into the clam mixture. Crumble the bacon into mixture, then pour into mixture into pastry shell. Bake on the top rack of preheated oven for 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Serve warm.
