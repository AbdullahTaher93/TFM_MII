Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place bread on a baking sheet; toast in oven 3 to 5 minutes. Spoon pizza sauce evenly over toast. Sprinkle with oregano and garlic powder. Use olive slices to make 2 eyes near one end of the toast. Place strips of string cheese across toast to make "mummy wrap." Bake in preheated oven until cheese melts, 3 to 5 minutes.
