Combine peanut butter and honey in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until melted and smooth, about 30 seconds. Add oats, raspberries, flaxseed meal, and chia seeds and mix well. Line an 8-inch baking dish with parchment paper. Press oat mixture into the prepared baking dish, using your fingers to flatten into the corners. Refrigerate until set, about 3 hours. Cut into bars.
