Cook the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until brown. Drain on paper towels and set aside. Cook the ground chuck in the same skillet over medium heat until no longer pink. Drain and return the ground chuck to the skillet. Stir in bacon, cream of mushroom soup, and American cheese until cheese has melted; serve immediately.
