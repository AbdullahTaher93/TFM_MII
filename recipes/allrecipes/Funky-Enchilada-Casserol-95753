Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and season with cumin, Mexican seasoning and cayenne pepper. Stir in the onion and garlic and cook until chicken is browned, about 5 minutes. Add red, yellow and orange peppers; cook and stir for another 5 minutes, then mix in the black beans, kidney beans and corn. Remove from the heat. Line the bottom and sides of a 9x13 inch baking dish with corn tortillas. Pour in the skillet mixture then top with cilantro and pepperjack cheese. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until the cheese is starting to brown on top. Let stand for 10 minutes, then serve with your favorite Mexican food toppings.
