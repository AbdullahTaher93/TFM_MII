Place ingredients in the bread machine in the order suggested by the manufacturer. Select Dough setting, and Start. When the dough has risen once in the breadmaker, transfer it into an oiled, 8 inch, round baking tin. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk. Poke it all over with your finger, right to the bottom of the tin. Allow to rest for another five or ten minutes. Pour olive oil over the top of the loaf, and sprinkle with parmesan cheese. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) in center of oven for approximately 20 minutes, until golden.
