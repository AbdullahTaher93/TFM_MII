In a small bowl, combine the buttermilk or yogurt, mayonnaise, cheese, and chives or scallion greens. Heat a large nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray over medium-high heat. Add the tomatoes and onion and cook for 3 minutes per side, or until lightly charred. Layer the roast beef, onion, tomatoes, and lettuce on the bottoms of the buns. Drizzle with the blue cheese dressing. Cover with the bun tops.
