With the ground beef, make 8 thin hamburger patties. Fry in a skillet for 3 to 4 minutes on both sides or until done. Set aside. In the same pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Saute the green peppers, onion, and mushrooms for 1 minute. Cover and let cook in the juices for 5 minutes. Place the hamburgers on the buns, top with vegetables and an ounce of low fat mozzarella cheese. Drizzle Italian dressing to taste.
