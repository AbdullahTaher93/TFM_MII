Set chicken in a shallow bowl. Add the combined vinegar, chicken stock, sugar, garlic and seasoning. Allow chicken to marinate 10 minutes on each side. Remove chicken and set marinade aside. Place marinade in small saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer. Briefly heat the Enova(TM) brand oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken breasts. Cook each chicken breast 4 minutes each side (or until browned). Add the marinade to the skillet and continue cooking for an additional 3-4 minutes while turning the chicken breasts until they are cooked through.
