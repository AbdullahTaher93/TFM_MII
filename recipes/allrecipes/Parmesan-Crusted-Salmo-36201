In a shallow, medium bowl mix Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoned bread crumbs, tarragon and dill. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, blend white wine, teriyaki sauce, butter, red onion and garlic. Cook and stir until onions are tender. Press one side of each salmon steak into the Parmesan cheese mixture. Place steaks crust side up in saucepan with white wine mixture. Cook over medium high heat until most of the liquid is reduced, 10 to 15 minutes, then flip with a spatula. Continue cooking until crust is golden brown and fish is easily flaked with a fork.
