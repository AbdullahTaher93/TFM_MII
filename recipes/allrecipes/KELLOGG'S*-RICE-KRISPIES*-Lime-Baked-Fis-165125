In large plate or shallow pan, mix together crushed cereal, almonds and parsley. Place flour on second plate. In small bowl, mix together egg whites, 30 mL (2 tbsp) of the lime juice, salt and seasonings. Dip fish in flour, shaking off excess. Dip in egg mixture, draining slightly, then coat with cereal mixture. Place in single layer on foil-lined baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray. Drizzle with remaining lime juice. Bake at 200 degrees C (400 degrees F) about 15 minutes or until fish flakes in thickest part, when tested with fork.
