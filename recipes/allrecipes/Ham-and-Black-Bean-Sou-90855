Heat oil in a 5- to 6-quart pan over medium-high heat. Add ham, onion, and bell pepper; cook, stirring often, until vegetables are tender to bite (4 to 5 minutes). Meanwhile, pour one can of the beans and their liquid into a food processor or blender; whirl until pureed. Pour puree into pan; stir in broth, water, and vinegar. Reserve 1/4 cup of the carrots for garnish, if desired; to pan, add remaining carrots, sugar, mustard, lemon peel, and hot pepper seasoning. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until flavors are blended (4 to 5 minutes). Reduce heat to medium-low and add remaining can of beans and their liquid. Cook stirring occasionally, until soup is bubbly and heated through (5 to 7 minutes). Sprinkle with parsley and, if desired, reserved carrots.
