Cook tortellini according to package directions. Run under cold water to stop the cooking; drain well. Place in a large bowl and toss with olive oil, basil, and salt to taste. To make sauce, in a food processor or in a blender, mince garlic. Add red peppers; process until pureed. Add cheese, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste and process until smooth. Refrigerate until chilled. To serve, place tortellini on toothpicks with frills or decorative short skewers, 2 per pick. Arrange on a platter with a bowl of the sauce.
