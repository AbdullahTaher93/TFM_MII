Put lentils in a small pot with enough water to just cover; cook on medium heat until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Set lentils aside to cool. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Cook salmon under the preheated broiler until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Chop salmon and set aside to cool. Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat; cook bacon in skillet until crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Chop bacon and set aside to cool. Mix cooled lentils, salmon, bacon, red onion, mozzarella, and cucumber together in a large bowl. Whisk balsamic vinegar, olive oil, garlic, mustard, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl; drizzle over the lentil mixture and stir gently to coat.
