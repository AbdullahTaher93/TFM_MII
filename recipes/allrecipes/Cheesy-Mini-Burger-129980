Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Mix meat, 2/3 cup of cheese, 1/4 cup of the ketchup and garlic powder. Shape into 12 balls. Place on foil-covered baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray. Flatten each ball into patty, about 1/2-inch thick. Bake 15 min. or until cooked through; drain. Spread remaining ketchup on each patty; sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake an additional 5 min. or until cheese melts. Serve over rice.
