Place peas in a 5-quart Dutch oven, add cold water to cover, and bring to a boil over high heat; cook for 2 minutes. Remove peas from the heat and let stand, covered, for 1 hour. Drain peas and rinse; return to the Dutch oven and add water and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat to moderately low, and simmer, covered, for 30 minutes. Drain peas, reserving 1 cup liquid. Puree 1 cup peas in a blender at high speed or in a food processor, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons of the reserved liquid, if necessary. With sharp kitchen scissors and with bacon slices stacked, cut bacon crosswise into 1/2-inch strips. (This step is easiest if the bacon is placed in the freezer for 1/2 hour before cutting.) Add bacon to Dutch oven and cook over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp, 5 to 8 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towelling to drain. In bacon drippings, saute onions, celery, carrots, garlic, bay leaves, and thyme over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until vegetables soften -- 8 to 10 minutes.
