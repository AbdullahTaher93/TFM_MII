Pour evaporated milk in a mixing bowl; place in freezer until ice crystals form (about 30 minutes). Sprinkle gelatin over water and lemon juice in a small saucepan; let stand 1 minute. Stir in SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, 2 minutes or until gelatin dissolves. Stir in lemon rind and lemon extract. Beat evaporated milk at high speed with an electric mixer until soft peaks form (about 5 minutes). Gradually add gelatin mixture, beating at high speed until mixture is combined. Do not over beat. Pour mixture into crust; cover and chill 1 hour or until set.
