Lightly butter bottom only of 10-inch springform pan or spray with cooking spray. In medium bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs, toffee bits, brown sugar and 1/4 cup melted butter with fork until crumbs are coated. Press in bottom of buttered pan. In 1-quart saucepan, heat whipping cream over medium-low heat until hot. Stir in liqueur. With wire whisk, stir in chocolate chips until smooth. Remove from heat. Place 1/4 cup chocolate mixture in small microwavable bowl; set aside for drizzle. Pour and carefully spread remaining chocolate mixture over crust. Freeze 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat oven to 325 degrees F. In large bowl, mix brownie mix, 6 tablespoons melted butter and the water; beat 50 strokes with spoon (mixture will be thick). In small bowl, beat egg whites with electric mixer on high speed 1 to 2 minutes or until soft peaks form. Add to brownie mixture, beat with electric mixer on low speed just until blended, about 30 seconds (batter will appear lumpy). Remove crust from freezer. Spread batter over chocolate layer. Sprinkle almonds evenly over top. Bake at 325 degrees F for 45 to 60 minutes or until center is puffed and set and edges are firm (middle will be soft). DO NOT OVERBAKE. Cool on wire rack 2 hours.
