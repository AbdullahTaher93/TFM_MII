Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking dish with cooking spray. Bring water and butter to a boil in a saucepan; add stuffing mix and cover saucepan. Remove saucepan from heat and let stand for 5 minutes; fluff stuffing with a fork. Scoop the flesh from eggplant and dice, reserving shells. Mix eggplant pulp, stuffing, Parmesan cheese, mayonnaise, and egg together in a bowl. Fill each eggplant shell with stuffing mixture and top with paprika. Bake in the preheated oven until filling is cooked through and crisp on the top, 30 to 35 minutes.
