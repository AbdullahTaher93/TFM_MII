Rub filets evenly with 1/2-teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cover and chill. Place onion slices on an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Drizzle with 1-tablespoon oil, vinegar and remaining salt and pepper; toss to coat. Bake onions at 375 degrees F for 20 minutes or until onions are tender, stirring occasionally. Remove from oven; keep warm. Cook filets in remaining 1-tablespoon hot oil in a large skillet coated with cooking spray over medium-high heat 5 to 7 minutes on each side or to desired degree of doneness. Top steaks evenly with onion mixture and cheese. Serve immediately.
