Put coleslaw mix in a large bowl. Break ramen noodles into small pieces and add to the coleslaw mix; add sunflower seed kernels, almonds, green onions, and water chestnuts. Whisk ramen noodle seasoning, canola oil, vinegar, and sugar together in a separate bowl until the sugar is dissolved into the liquid; drizzle over the salad and toss to coat.
