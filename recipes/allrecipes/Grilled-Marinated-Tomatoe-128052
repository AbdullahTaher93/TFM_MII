Grill or broil the tomatoes about 6 inches (15 cm) from heat source, 5 minutes on one side and 2 minutes on the other. The skins will be blistered and slightly charred. In a 9-inch (2.5 L) glass dish, combine the vinegar, oil, bay leaves, garlic, and thyme or basil. Place the grilled tomatoes in a single layer in the marinade and spoon some marinade over them. Cover and marinate for at least an hour. The marinated tomatoes will keep, refrigerated, for about 5 days. Serve on the bread.
