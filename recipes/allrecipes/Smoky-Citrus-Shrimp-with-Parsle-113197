In a medium bowl, toss the shrimp with the chipotle powder and 1 teaspoon of kosher salt. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil. Add the shrimp and cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until they begin to turn pink but are still raw in the center, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the shrimp to a plate. Reduce the heat to moderately high. Add the garlic to the skillet and cook until lightly golden, about 1 minute. Add the orange, lemon and lime juices and boil until slightly thickened, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the skillet, about 2 minutes. Return the shrimp to the pan and toss to coat with the sauce. Cook until the shrimp are white throughout, about 1 minute. Stir in the parsley and season with salt. Transfer to bowls and serve with baguette toasts.
