In a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat, cook beef, onion and green pepper until the meat is no longer pink; drain. Add the soup, tomato sauce, 1 cup cheese and salt. Stir in pasta. Transfer to a greased 2-1/2-qt. baking dish. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes or until bubbly.
