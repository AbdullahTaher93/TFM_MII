Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place rack in upper third of oven. To make filling, in a medium skillet, preferably nonstick, saute sausage over moderate heat, breaking up with a spatula until cooked through and crumbled. Drain off fat. Add mushrooms and thyme and saute over high heat until all liquid has evaporated and mushrooms begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in mustard and sour cream. This makes 1 1/2 cups filling. Remove half package of rolls and place on a lightly floured board. Press together at perforations to seal the dough together. Turn over and press together perforations on other side. Roll lightly into an approximately 15- by 4-inch rectangle. Spoon half the filling into a log down center of pastry. Fold pastry over and roll up. Crimp ends. Transfer to an ungreased baking sheet, seam side down. Repeat with remaining filling and rolls. Bake for 14 to 18 minutes or until golden. Remove from oven and cool slightly. Transfer to cutting board and slice into 1-inch pieces.
