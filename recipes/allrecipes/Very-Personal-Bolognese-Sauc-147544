Crumble the ground beef into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring to break up large chunks, until no longer pink. Drain off excess grease. Mix in the tomato paste, harissa and Worcestershire sauce until blended. Stir in the tomato sauce and garlic; reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes. Stir in the mascarpone cheese, and simmer for another 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, and season with dried basil.
