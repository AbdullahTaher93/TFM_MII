Mix Cajun spices and black pepper in small bowl. Reserve half of the mixture for the onions. Season chicken thighs with 1/2 of spice mixture and refrigerate 2 hours. Light grill using Kingsford briquets. When coals turn to a white ash, add a handful of pre-soaked Kingsford Hickory Chips. Brush grill grate with oil or coat with nonstick spray. Place chicken on grill over indirect heat, covered for 25 - 30 minutes, or until temperature reaches 175 degrees F - 180 degrees F. Rub reserved spice mixture on both sides of onion rings and place on grill with chicken for the last 15 - 20 minutes, until tender but still crispy. Remove chicken and onions from grill. Discard chicken skin and remove meat from bone, leaving it in large pieces. Set aside. In a large bowl, mix lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, olives and cheese. Top with chicken and onion rings. Drizzle with BBQ sauce and ranch dressing and line potato chips around outside of bowl. Serve immediately.
