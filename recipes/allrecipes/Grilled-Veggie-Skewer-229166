Soak skewers in water for 10 to 20 minutes. Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Alternately thread zucchini slices, yellow squash slices, mushrooms, onion, tomatoes, pineapple, and bell pepper onto the skewers. Whisk olive oil, basil, oregano, salt, and black pepper in a bowl; brush mixture over vegetables. Cook skewers on preheated grill until vegetables are tender, turning and basting vegetables with olive oil mixture occasionally, 10 to 15 minutes.
