Preheat oven to Grill/Broil. Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Add chicken and garlic and saute until chicken juices run clear, about 7 to 10 minutes. Drain fat from skillet and stir in sauce. Place chicken mixture on a cookie sheet and broil in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes, or until browned. Let sit about 5 minutes to allow sauce to thicken.
