Coat a grill rack or broiler-pan rack with cooking spray. Preheat the grill or broiler. Finely chop the tuna to the consistency of ground meat. Place in a bowl. Add the teriyaki sauce, scallion, ginger, and garlic. Stir just until blended. Shape into 4 burgers. Coat lightly with cooking spray. Grill or broil the burgers 6 inches from the heat for 6 minutes, turning once, or until no longer pink. Remove to a plate and keep warm. Place 1/2 slice cheese on the bottom half of each bun. Place, cheese side up, on the rack and grill or broil for 1 minute, or until the cheese melts. Top each with lettuce, a burger, and a slice of pineapple.
