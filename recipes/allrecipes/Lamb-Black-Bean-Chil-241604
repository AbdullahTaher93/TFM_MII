Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir lamb, onion, and garlic together in the hot skillet until lamb is completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir black beans, tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, refried black beans, green chiles, cocoa powder, chili powder, cumin, chicken bouillon, and cayenne pepper with the lamb mixture; cook until the beans are tender, 20 to 30 minutes.
