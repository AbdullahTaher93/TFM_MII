Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil. Spread cream cheese onto each slice of bread, and set cheese side up on the cookie sheet. Place the tomato slices over the cream cheese. Top with alfalfa sprouts, then a generous sprinkle of mozzarella cheese. Bake for about 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until the cheese is melted, and sandwiches are warm.
