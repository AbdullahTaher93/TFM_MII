Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large sized bowl, thaw the spinach in the microwave. Do not drain off the liquids. Mince the broccoli as finely as you can. A food processor makes this quick work. (Frozen broccoli works fine here too). Add to the spinach. Also add the diced ham and the chopped scallions. Add about 2/3 of the cheese (save the rest for the topping) and toss well. Grease an 8x8 casserole dish with butter or oil. Distribute the spinach, broccoli, and ham mixture evenly. In the bowl, whip together the eggs, cream, mustard and a pinch or two of salt and pepper. Pour over the mixture in the casserole dish. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top. Bake uncovered at 350 degrees F for 40 minutes. Let cool for about 5 minutes. Cut into 6 servings.
