Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Wash chicken breasts, pat dry with paper towels, and cut each breast in half. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear chicken briefly, turning until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in another large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat. Stir in mushrooms, onions, and garlic, if using; cook until they are nice and soft, about 5 minutes. Pour contents of both skillets into a baking dish, sprinkle cheese over the top, and bake about 5 minutes.
