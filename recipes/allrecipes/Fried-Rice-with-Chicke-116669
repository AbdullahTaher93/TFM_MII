In a large skillet, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp. Remove to paper towels. In the drippings, saute the chicken, carrots and celery until chicken juices run clear; remove and keep warm. In the same skillet, scramble eggs over medium heat, breaking into small pieces. Stir in the chicken mixture, rice, soy sauce and bacon.
