In a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove to paper towels and cover to keep warm. While bacon is cooking, in a medium bowl, whisk together mayonnaise and dressing; set aside. Toast bread. Spread mayo mixture onto 4 slices of bread. Top with tomatoes, a generous sprinkle of salt and pepper, bacon, turkey, lettuce, and remaining bread.
