Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Toss broccoli, peppers and onions with 2 tablespoons soybean oil and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Place on foil-lined baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes until vegetables are tender and lightly browned. Meanwhile, cook couscous according to package directions. Place cooked couscous and roasted vegetables in large bowl. Pour vinegar and remaining soybean oil over salad and sprinkle with remaining salt and pepper; toss lightly until combined. You may substitute 3 cups cooked regular couscous, brown rice or quinoa.
