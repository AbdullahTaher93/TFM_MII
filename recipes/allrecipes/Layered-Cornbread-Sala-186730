Mix sour cream and salsa; set aside. Place half cornbread in 2-quart glass bowl or on serving platter. Top with half the corn, beans, cheese, tomato and onion. Repeat layers with remaining cornbread, corn, beans and cheese. Spread salsa mixture over cheese. Top with remaining tomato and onion. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to 8 hours. Sprinkle with chopped fresh cilantro, if you like. Spoon onto individual salad plates or toss salad just before serving.
