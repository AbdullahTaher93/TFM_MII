Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. In a salad bowl, combine the bacon, lettuce, almonds, sesame seeds, green onions and chow mien noodles; toss and refrigerate. In a glass jar with a tight fitting lid, combine the oil, sugar, vinegar, salt and pepper. Shake well and chill for 1 hour. Before serving, shake dressing and pour over salad; toss and serve.
