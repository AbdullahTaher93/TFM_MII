Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour a 10-inch fluted tube pan; set aside. In a large bowl stir together cake mix, flour, sugar, drink mix, baking powder and soda. Add oil, eggs, LUCKY LEAF Cherry Pie Filling, sour cream and almond extract. Beat with an electric mixer on low to medium speed for 2 minutes (batter will be stiff). Fold in chopped sweet chocolate. Spoon into prepared pan. Bake for 60 to 70 minutes or until wooden toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pan on wire rack for 20 minutes. Loosen sides and remove from pan. Cool completely. For ganache, in a small saucepan heat cream just to boiling. In a medium bowl pour hot cream over bittersweet chocolate; let stand 5 minutes. Stir until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth; stir in rum. Place bowl with chocolate in a bowl of ice water and let stand about 20 minutes or until thickened, stirring occasionally. Transfer cake to serving plate. Spread ganache over cake. Let stand 1 hour before serving to set up.
