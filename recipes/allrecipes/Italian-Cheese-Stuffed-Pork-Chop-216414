Cut a horizontal pocket in the side of each pork chop (or ask your meat retailer to do this for you). Combine 3/4 cup cheese, croutons and thyme; stuff into pockets and pinch edges together to close pockets. Combine salt, paprika and pepper; sprinkle over chops. Heat a 12-inch ovenproof skillet (wrap handle in foil) coated with cooking spray over medium-high heat until hot. Add chops; cook 3 minutes per side or until browned. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup cheese over chops. Transfer skillet to a preheated 375 degrees F oven. Bake until chops are no longer pink in center, 8 to 10 minutes depending on thickness of chops.
