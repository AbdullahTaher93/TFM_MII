Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct, high heat (you can hold your hand 1 to 2 inches above the cooking grate only 2 to 3 seconds; visit Safeway.com for complete instructions). Meanwhile, sprinkle steaks on both sides with salt. Seal peppercorns in a resealable plastic bag, and using a rolling pin or heavy-bottomed frying pan, coarsely crush. Press crushed peppercorns onto both sides of each steak to coat. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, boil balsamic vinegar until reduced by about half and put in a small bowl. Lay steaks on oiled cooking grate; cover gas grill. Cook, turning meat once with a wide spatula, until well browned on both sides and done to your liking in the center (cut to test), about 8 minutes total for rare (still reddish pink) and about 10 minutes total for medium-rare (still pink). Transfer steaks to a platter and drizzle with reduced vinegar. Cover loosely with foil and let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
