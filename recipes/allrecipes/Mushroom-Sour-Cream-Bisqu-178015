In a 5- to 6-quarts pan over medium-high heat, stir bacon until fat begins to render, 1 to 2 minutes. Add onion, celery, and garlic; stir until onion is limp, about 3 minutes. Add mushrooms and cover pan tightly; cook until mushrooms exude their juice, about 5 minutes. Uncover pan and cook, stirring often, until liquid is evaporated and mushrooms begin to brown, 7 to 10 more minutes. Add cognac and stir to scrape up browned bits from pan bottom and sides; boil until most of the liquid has evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Add broth and return to a boil, then cover, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally to blend flavors, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from heat. In a blender, holding down lid with a towel, whirl mixture, a portion at a time, until smooth. Return pureed soup to pan, then whisk in 1 1/2 cups sour cream and salt and pepper to taste. Heat over medium-low heat just until steaming; do not boil. Ladle soup into six soup bowls. Garnish each serving with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of minced parsley
