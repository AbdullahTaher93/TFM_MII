Coat pork with flour; sprinkle with pepper. Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat. Add pork and carrots; cook 4 minutes. Turn pork over. Add green onions, mushrooms and rosemary; cook until mushrooms are just softened, about 1 minute. Stir in cooking wine and broth. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Simmer until pork is tender and no longer pink, about 3 to 5 minutes.
