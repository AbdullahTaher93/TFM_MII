Combine tomato and red onion in a food processor; blend, slowly adding queso fresco, until a paste forms. Fold corn tortillas in half and fill them with the tomato and red onion paste. Beat egg whites in a bowl with an electric mixer until foamy. Add egg yolks one by one, mixing thoroughly until blended into the egg whites. Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip 1 filled tortilla into the egg mixture to coat both sides, letting excess drip back into the bowl. Cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining oil and filled tortillas.
