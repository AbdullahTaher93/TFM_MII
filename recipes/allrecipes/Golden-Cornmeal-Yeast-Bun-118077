In a saucepan,combine the milk, butter cornmeal, sugar and salt. Cook and stir until butter is melted. Cool to 110 degrees F-115 degrees F. In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add 3 cups flour and milk mixture; beat until blended. Add eggs; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough (dough will be slightly sticky). Turn onto a heavily floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down; turn onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into four portions; divide each portion into six pieces. With lightly floured hands, shape into buns. Place on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 40 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-22 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
