Fill a large saucepan with water; bring to a boil. In a small saucepan, combine vinegar, wine, peppercorns, and shallot. Place over medium-high heat; cook until almost all the liquid is evaporated, about 2 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons water; reduce heat to low. Add yolks; whisk until thickened, about 4 minutes. Turn off heat; whisk in the butter until fully incorporated and the sauce thickens, about 3 minutes. Season with salt. Strain sauce into a medium heat-proof bowl; discard solids. Stir in dill. Keep bearnaise warm over very gently simmering water, whisking occasionally. Fill a shallow dish with warm water. Reduce heat under saucepan to medium, so water is just simmering. Break 1 egg at a time into a small heat-proof bowl. Gently tip bowl into water; carefully slide in egg. Repeat until all eggs are in saucepan. When first eggs become opaque, begin to remove them with a slotted spoon, in the order in which they were added. This process should take about 3 minutes. Transfer the eggs to the dish of warm water. Divide salmon into 8 portions; place each over a half of a toasted crumpet. Using a slotted spoon, remove eggs from warm water; set the spoon, with the egg inside, briefly on a clean cloth to drain. Gently place 1 egg on each crumpet; spoon dill bearnaise over the top. Serve two crumpet halves to each person, and garnish with snipped dill.
