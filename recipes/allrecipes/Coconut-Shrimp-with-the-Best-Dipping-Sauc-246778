Rinse shrimp in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Set up 3 shallow bowls. In the first, stir together 1/4 cup flour, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt. In the second, add eggs and lightly beat with a fork. In the third, combine 1 1/2 cups coconut flakes and 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs. Dredge shrimp in flour, dip in beaten egg and then finally dip in coconut crumb mixture using your hands to press the mixture onto the shrimp. Transfer to a Reynolds(R) Parchment Paper lined baking sheet and repeat with remaining shrimp. Once all of the shrimp are breaded, saute right away. Place a large non-stick pan over medium heat and add enough oil to generously cover the bottom. Once oil is hot, add shrimp and saute 2 to 3 minutes, flip and saute another 2 minutes until golden brown on both sides and shrimp is firm and pink. Cook in batches and don't overcrowd the pan. Stir together the sweet chili sauce and apricot preserves and serve with coconut shrimp.
