Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Arrange tomato slices on prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Drizzle tomatoes with 1 tablespoon of olive oil; sprinkle lightly with sea salt and freshly ground pepper. Bake the tomatoes in the preheated oven until they become leathery, a bit brown, and crunchy around the edges, approximately 2 hours. Remove from oven and let cool completely. Combine the cooled roasted tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, basil, and roasted garlic in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the vinegar and the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil; mix well.
