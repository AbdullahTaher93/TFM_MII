Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Whisk the flour, 1/2 cup of sugar, baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl; set aside. Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Beat the egg, butter, and milk in a bowl until smooth. Stir in the flour mixture until moistened, then spread into the prepared baking dish. Stir together the rhubarb, 2 cups of sugar, and the water; pour into the baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the dough has set and the rhubarb is bubbly, about 40 minutes.
