In a medium bowl, combine oil and pepper. Cut potatoes lengthwise into 1/2-in. strips. Add to oil mixture; toss to coat. Place on a 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan that has been coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown and crisp. Meanwhile, combine flour and pepper in a shallow dish. In a second dish, beat egg substitute and water. In a third dish, combine cornflakes, cheese and cayenne. Dredge fish in flour, then dip in egg mixture and coat with crumb mixture. Place on a baking sheet that has been coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 425 degrees for 10-15 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Serve with chips and tartar sauce if desired.
