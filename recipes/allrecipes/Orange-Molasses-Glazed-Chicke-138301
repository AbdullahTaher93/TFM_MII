Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Squeeze 5 to 6 oranges to yield 3 cups of juice. In a large skillet, combine juice, 1/2 cup red-wine vinegar, and 1/4 cup molasses. Boil over high heat, skimming foam occasionally, until mixture is reduced to 1/2 cup, 10 to 15 minutes. Reserve half the glaze for serving. Place 4 bone-in skinless chicken breast halves (8 ounces each) on a rimmed baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Season generously with coarse salt and ground pepper, and brush with glaze. Bake chicken, brushing with glaze twice, until juices run clear when pierced, 35 to 40 minutes. Serve hot with reserved glaze.
