Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for 10 minutes or until well browned on both sides. Stir the soup, milk, dressing mix and carrots in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the carrots are tender. Serve the chicken and sauce with the rice.
