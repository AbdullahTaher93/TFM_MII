Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a medium bowl combine tomato sauce, mushrooms and tofu. Stir in cooked pasta. In a separate, small bowl combine mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. In a small casserole dish layer pasta mixture and cheeses. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until lightly browned.
