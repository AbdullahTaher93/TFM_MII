Warm waffles in oven. To serve, lay one waffle on each plate. Top with burger, sliced ham, 2 slices thick cut bacon, cheese sauce and egg. Sprinkle with smoked paprika. To make Beer, Sausage, Cheese Sauce, cook breakfast sausage and garlic in pot. When cooked through, add butter, mustard, red pepper flakes and cheese. Stir until melted. Once mixed together, add Worcestershire sauce. Let cook for 5 minutes (make sure to keep stirring, so cheese does not stick to bottom of pan). Add some more heavy cream if sauce is too thick. Set aside.
