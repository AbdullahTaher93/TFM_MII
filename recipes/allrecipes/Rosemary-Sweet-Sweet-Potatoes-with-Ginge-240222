Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly butter a large baking dish. Whisk honey and milk together in a bowl until smooth. Place sweet potatoes in a large bowl. Add honey-milk mixture to sweet potatoes and toss to coat; soak for 10 minutes. Drain 1/2 of the liquid from the bowl. Mix ginger, rosemary, grapeseed oil, cardamom, black pepper, cloves, and salt with the sweet potatoes until coated. Spread potatoes in a single layer in the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Flip potatoes and continue cooking until tender and browned, about 20 minutes more.
