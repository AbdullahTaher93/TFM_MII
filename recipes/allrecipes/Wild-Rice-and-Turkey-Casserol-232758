Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring 2 1/4 cups water, rice mix plus seasoning pack, and 1 tablespoon butter to a boil in a covered saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 25 minutes. Stir turkey, cream of chicken soup, celery, 1 cup water, water chestnuts, onion, and soy sauce into wild rice until well mixed. Transfer turkey mixture to a 3-quart baking dish. Pour 2 tablespoons melted butter over crumbs in a bowl, stirring to coat crumbs with butter. Sprinkle buttered bread crumbs over turkey mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and golden brown, about 30 minutes.
