Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Spray 9-inch pie plate with cooking spray; set aside. Combine 1/4 cup tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and pepperoni in medium bowl; set aside. Unroll pizza dough; press into a 15x9-inch rectangle. Cut into 24 square pieces. Divide cheese mixture evenly and place in the center of each piece. Pull edges of each piece of dough up and around cheese mixture to enclose completely; pinching seams to seal. Place seam-side down in pie plate. Brush top of dough with Parkay. Sprinkle evenly with Parmesan cheese and garlic powder. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until top is golden brown. Meanwhile, place remaining sauce in microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on HIGH 1 minute or until hot, stirring halfway. Serve pizza bites with sauce.
