Heat a waffle iron. In a large bowl, beat the margarine, honey, and molasses with a wire whisk until well-blended. Beat in the egg substitute and milk. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, and allspice. Stir the dry ingredients into the margarine mixture just until all ingredients are moistened. In a medium bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer at high speed until stiff. Gently fold the whites into the batter. Bake in the waffle iron until lightly browned, abut 5 to 7 minutes.
