In a large sauce pan, add the onions, salt and pepper and the wine. Place on medium-high heat until it boils. Reduce heat to low, add the fish, cover and leave for 5 minutes. Carefully remove the fish from the pan onto a serving platter and cover with aluminum foil. The fish will continue to cook a bit more. Bring the cooking liquids to a boil, stirring occasionally until reduced to about 1/2 cup. Turn off heat and add the sour cream, stir until well blended. Pour the sauce over the fish and garnish with the chives. Serve immediately.
