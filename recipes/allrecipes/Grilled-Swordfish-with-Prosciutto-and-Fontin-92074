Mix cornstarch with 1 tablespoon water. In a 1- to 1 1/2-quart pan, combine cornstarch mixture, broth, wine, lemon peel, and sugar; set aside. Rinse fish, pat dry, and lay on a lightly oiled barbecue 4 to 6 inches above a solid bed of very hot coals or on a gas grill on high (you can hold your hand at grill level only 1 to 2 seconds). Cover gas grill. Cook until fish is lightly browned on bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn steaks over and top each equally with prosciutto strips, then lay cheese on prosciutto. Cover grill, open vents, and cook until fish is no longer translucent but is still moist-looking in the center of the thickest part (cut to test), about 4 minutes longer. Transfer swordfish to a platter and keep warm. Quickly stir broth mixture over high heat until boiling. Add capers and lemon juice, and pour sauce over fish; sprinkle with pepper.
