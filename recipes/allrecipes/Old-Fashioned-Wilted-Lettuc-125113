In a small bowl, beat eggs, milk, vinegar, salt and pepper until smooth; set aside. In a skillet, cook bacon until crisp. Remove bacon to paper towels to drain, reserving drippings; reduce heat under skillet to medium. Whisk egg mixture into drippings; cook and stir until thickened, about 3-4 minutes. Place lettuce, onion and bacon in a large salad bowl. Pour dressing over and toss well. Serve immediately.
