Dump all the ingredients into a large resealable bag, seal, and shake until the chicken is evenly coated. Refrigerate the bag for 1 to 2 hours. In the meantime, tear off four 15-inch-long pieces of foil. When the chicken is ready, place one breast in the center of each piece of foil and fold the edges of the foil up to form a bowl. Pour one-quarter of the remaining marinade inside each bowl, then press the foil together to seal the chicken inside. Place all four bowls on a broiler pan and cook for about 12 minutes.
