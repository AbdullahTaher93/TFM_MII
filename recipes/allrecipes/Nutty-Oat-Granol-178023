In a large bowl, stir oats, sugar, wheat germ, coconut, and sunflower seeds to blend. In a small pan, heat oil, honey, and vanilla, stirring, until bubbling. Thoroughly mix the liquids with the dry ingredients. Grease two 10- by 15-inch rimmed baking sheets, then divide cereal mixture between pans, spreading it out evenly. Bake, uncovered, in a 325 degrees F oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until coconut is lightly browned, stirring two or three times with a wide spatula. Remove pans from oven; stir granola several times as it cools to prevent sticking. When thoroughly cool, store in an airtight container.
