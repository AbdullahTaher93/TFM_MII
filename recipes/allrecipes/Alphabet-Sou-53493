Place the meat in a large stock pot, and cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain the meat, except for about 2 tablespoons of the juices. Dissolve the bouillon cubes in 3 cups of hot water, and add to the stock pot with the meat. Stir in spicy vegetable juice cocktail, mixed vegetables, alphabet pasta, and 6 cups of water. Simmer 20 minutes, or until pasta is tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve.
