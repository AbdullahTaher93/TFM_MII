Place everything except the bell pepper and cilantro into a food processor and pulse a few times until it is a blended chunky relish. Do not over process into a smooth paste. Remove the stems and cut the bell peppers in half. Remove the seeds and membrane. Cut each half into 4 pieces. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of tapenade onto each pepper square. Garnish with 2 or 3 whole leaves of cilantro. As a variation, use Greek olives and garnish with crumbles of feta cheese.
