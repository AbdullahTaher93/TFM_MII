Place ribs in two ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pans. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 45-55 minutes or until juices run clear and meat is tender. In a small bowl, combine the remaining ingredients. Brush over ribs. Grill, uncovered, over medium-hot heat for 6-8 minutes on each side or until lightly browned, brushing occasionally with herb mixture.
