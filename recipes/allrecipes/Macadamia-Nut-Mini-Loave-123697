Finely chop enough of the macadamia nuts to measure 1/3 cup; set aside. Coarsely chop remaining nuts; toss with coconut and 1 tablespoon sugar. Set aside. In a mixing bowl, cream butter and remaining sugar on high until fluffy. Add eggs; mix well. Combine flour and baking powder; add alternately with milk to creamed mixture. Stir in lemon juice and peel, vanilla and reserved finely chopped nuts. Spoon into six greased 4-1/2-in. x 2-1/2-in. x 1-1/2-in. loaf pans. Sprinkle with reserved coconut mixture. Bake at 325 degrees F for 50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool in pans for 10 minutes; remove and cool on a wire rack.
