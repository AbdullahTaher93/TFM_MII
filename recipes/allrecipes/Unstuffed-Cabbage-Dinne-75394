Crumble the ground beef into a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, an d season with garlic powder and pepper; cook and stir until the beef is evenly browned. Drain off the excess grease. Pour the beef broth and onion soup mix into the skillet with the beef, and stir to blend. Bring to a boil, then add the rice, cabbage and vegetable juice cocktail. Stir together, then cover and simmer over low heat for 30 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed.
