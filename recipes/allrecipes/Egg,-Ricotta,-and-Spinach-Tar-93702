Use 1/2 tablespoon of oil to rub over the bottom and 1 inch up the sides of a 10-inch springform pan. Dust the pan with the bread crumbs. Shake excess crumbs into a small bowl; add 1 tablespoon of the oil and 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan. Toss with a fork; set aside. Heat the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the onion. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the spinach. Cover and cook over high heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until it wilts. Drain any liquid. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a bowl, beat the ricotta, 2 of the eggs, salt, nutmeg, and the remaining Parmesan. Spoon into the pan. Top with the spinach mixture. With the back of a tablespoon, make 4 oval indentations, radiating from the center like flower petals, in the ricotta mixture. Break 1 egg into each indentation. Sprinkle with the reserved crumb mixture. Bake for about 45 minutes, or until set. Remove tart to a rack to cool for at least 30 minutes before removing sides of pan. With a serrated knife, cut into wedges.
