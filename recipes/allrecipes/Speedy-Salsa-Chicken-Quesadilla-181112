Mix salsa, dressing and chili powder; spread evenly onto tortillas. Layer chicken and cheese evenly on half of each tortilla; fold in half to enclose filling. Heat large skillet sprayed with cooking spray on medium heat. Add quesadillas, two at a time; cook 4 to 5 min. on each side or until lightly browned on both sides. Repeat with remaining quesadillas. Cut each quesadilla into three wedges to serve.
