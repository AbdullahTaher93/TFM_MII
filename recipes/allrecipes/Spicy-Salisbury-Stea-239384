Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Coat the inside of a roasting pan with about 1 tablespoon oil. Mix flour, grill seasoning, seasoned salt, garlic powder, and black pepper to together in a shallow bowl. Dredge steak in the flour mixture until all sides are coated, shaking off excess. Place coated steak on a plate and let rest for 5 minutes. Heat enough oil in a skillet to coat the bottom of the pan over medium-high heat. Add steak, a few pieces at a time, to the hot oil; fry until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer browned steak to the prepared roasting pan. Mix beef broth, cream of mushroom soup, and diced tomatoes with green chile peppers together in a bowl; pour into the roasting pan. Top broth mixture with onion slices. Bake in the preheated oven until steak is tender, about 90 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
