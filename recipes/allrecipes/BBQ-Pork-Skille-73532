Heat a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add pork and cook 3 minutes or until no longer pink. Remove; keep warm. Add oil and onion. Cook over medium-high heat about 3 minutes or until tender. Blend in tomatoes, BBQ sauce and brown sugar. Add carrots and pork; mix well. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes or until carrots are tender. Remove lid and cook an additional 5 minutes or until sauce thickens. Serve over noodles and garnish with parsley, if desired.
