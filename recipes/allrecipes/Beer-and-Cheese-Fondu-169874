Heat beer to boiling in medium saucepan. Reduce heat to simmer. Meanwhile, toss shredded cheeses and flour in large bowl. Add cheese to beer, by the handful, stirring until melted after each addition. When all cheese has been added, heat 1 minute longer to thicken slightly. Stir in remaining ingredients. Keep warm while serving, using fondue pot or heatproof dish on candle warmer. Serve with chunks of French bread, slices of apples, cubes of ham and chunks of dill pickle for dipping
