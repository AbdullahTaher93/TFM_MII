Prepare Chocolate Petal Crust: Beat butter, sugar, egg and vanilla in large bowl until fluffy. Stir together flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt; beat into butter mixture. Shape soft dough into two rolls, about 7-1/2 inches long. Wrap each roll in wax paper or plastic wrap; refrigerate several hours or overnight. Heat oven to 375 F. Grease 9-inch pie plate. Cut one roll into 1/8-inch-thick slices; edges touching, on bottom and up side of prepared pie plate. (Spaces between slices of dough in crust fill in during baking.) Bake 8 to 10 minutes. Cool completely. NOTE: Remaining roll of dough may be frozen up to 6 weeks for later use. For the Hershey's Chocolate Pie: Microwave Mini Kisses with milk in large microwave-safe bowl at HIGH (100%) 1 minute; stir until well blended. Stir in marshmallows. Microwave 30 seconds; stir. If necessary, microwave an additional 15 seconds at a time, stirring after each heating until marshmallows are melted. Cool to room temperature. Beat whipping cream in medium bowl until stiff; carefully fold into chocolate mixture. Spoon into prepared crust. Refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours. Cover; refrigerate leftover pie.
