Whisk the soy milk, soy sauce, honey, and Cheddar cheese together in a small bowl; set aside. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook the zucchini, squash, and bell pepper in the hot oil, stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes. Pour the soy milk mixture over the vegetables. Increase heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook and stir until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to serve.
