Trim and discard fat and any silvery membrane from pork. Sprinkle meat lightly with salt and pepper, then with cayenne to taste. Set a wide frying pan over high heat. When hot, add oil and swirl to coat pan. Add pork and brown on all sides, turning as needed (about 4 minutes total). Set pan aside. Transfer meat to a 9- by 13-inch baking pan. Bake in a 400 degree F oven until a thermometer inserted in center of thickest part of meat registers 155 degrees F (about 15 minutes). Transfer meat to a platter, and let stand for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, add rum to the unwashed frying pan. Stir over medium heat to free browned bits, then pour these drippings into the roasting pan. Stir over low heat, mixing in chutney, until hot. Cut pork on the diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Accompany with chutney mixture.
