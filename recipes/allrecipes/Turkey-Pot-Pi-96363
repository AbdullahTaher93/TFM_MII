Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Melt butter in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Place flour, salt and pepper in a plastic or paper bag. Add turkey; shake to coat. Add to skillet; cook 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add cream; mix well. Add vegetables; simmer uncovered 5 minutes (mixture will be very thick). Remove from heat; stir in parsley. Transfer mixture to a 10-inch deep dish pie plate or quiche dish. Cut 4 slits in pastry to allow steam to escape. Place pastry over dish; seal edges. Brush egg lightly over pastry. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until pastry is golden brown and mixture is bubbly. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
