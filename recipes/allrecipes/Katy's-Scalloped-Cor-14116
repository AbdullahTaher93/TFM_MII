Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease an 8 or 9-inch casserole dish. In a small frying pan, saute onion, green pepper, and celery in butter or margarine and vegetable oil. Saute vegetables until tender. Remove vegetables from oil. In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine cream style corn, niblet corn, egg and cheese. Mix onion and celery mixture into the corn mixture. Spread into prepared casserole dish. Bake for 25 minutes. Remove casserole from oven and sprinkle cracker crumbs onto the top. Return casserole to oven and bake another 10 minutes. Serve hot or warm.
