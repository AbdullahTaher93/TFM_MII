Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Grease baking sheet or spray with cooking spray. Stir together cream cheese, shredded cheese and salsa for filling. Press each biscuit into a 4-inch round. Place about 1 rounded teaspoon filling on center of each round; fold dough over filling. Press edges to seal and crimp with a fork. Brush milk over biscuits and sprinkle with spicy salt. Place empanadas on prepared baking sheet. Bake 10 to 13 minutes or until light golden brown. Serve warm with additional salsa for dipping.
