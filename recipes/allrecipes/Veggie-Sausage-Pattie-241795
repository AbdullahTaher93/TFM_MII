Put pinto beans and lentils into two separate pots of water; bring both to a boil, turn off heat, cover, and let stand 1 hour. Drain and rinse beans. Prepare a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-low heat; cook and stir mushrooms, onion, and bell pepper in hot skillet until onion is soft and mushrooms are darkened, 25 to 30 minutes. Spread mushroom mixture onto a platter to cool. Process pinto beans, egg, sage, rosemary, basil, marjoram, salt, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper in a food processor until smooth; transfer to a bowl. Mix lentils, cooled mushroom mixture, oats, Cheddar cheese, and sunflower kernels with the processed pinto bean mixture until somewhat evenly mixed. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight. Prepare a large skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Divide and shape mixture into 16 patties. Cook patties in batches in hot skillet until browned and heated through, about 7 minutes per side.
