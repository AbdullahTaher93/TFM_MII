Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion in hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir quinoa into onion; saute until toasted and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Pour broth into quinoa mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover the pot with a lid, and simmer until liquid is completely absorbed, about 20 minutes. Stir black beans, tomato, bell pepper, and avocado together in a bowl. Blend cilantro, lime juice, 2 tablespoons olive oil, Greek yogurt, chipotle pepper, 1 tablespoon reserved adobo sauce, honey, cumin, salt, and black pepper together in a blender until dressing is smooth. Pour dressing over black bean mixture; add quinoa and toss to coat.
