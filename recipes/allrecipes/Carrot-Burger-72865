Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place carrots into a bowl, cover, and heat in the microwave until tender, 2 to 3 minutes. In a large bowl, stir together the eggs, mayonnaise, onion, olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, and carrots. Mix in bread crumbs until evenly blended. Shape into 12 patties. Pour the cereal onto a plate, and dip the patties into the cereal to coat. Place the patties on a greased baking sheet. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, turning once, until golden brown.
