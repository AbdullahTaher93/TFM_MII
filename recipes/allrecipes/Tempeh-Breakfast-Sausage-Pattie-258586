Combine tempeh, tamari, garlic, sage, paprika, black pepper, and red pepper flakes in a saucepan. Simmer, stirring tempeh frequently, until completely reduced, about 7 minutes. Stir flour into tempeh mixture. Let cool in the saucepan until safe to handle, about 15 minutes. Shape into 2-inch patties. Heat a skillet over medium heat and grease with olive oil. Pan-fry the patties until well-browned, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
