Place sweet potato in a small saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and cook for 20-25 minutes or until tender. Drain. Place potato in a bowl; mash. Stir in the sugar, milk, egg, butter and vanilla until blended. Transfer to a 3-cup baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Combine topping ingredients; sprinkle over sweet potato mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until heated through.
