Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat, and stir in the onion, garlic, and horseradish. Cook and stir until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes, then mix in the ground beef. Cook and stir the ground beef until evenly browned, no longer pink, and crumbly. Drain excess fat, and transfer the cooked beef mixture into a large soup pot. Mix in the tomatoes, water, potatoes, mixed vegetables, carrots, corn, butter-flavored granules, dill seasoning, hot pepper sauce, and cinnamon, and stir to thoroughly combine. Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 1 hour. Stir occasionally. Before serving, season to taste with Parmesan cheese, salt, and black pepper.
