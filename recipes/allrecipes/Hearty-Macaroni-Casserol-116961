Prepare macaroni and cheese according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, cook the beef, green pepper and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Add to prepared macaroni. Stir in tomatoes. Spoon a quarter of the mixture into each of two greased 1-1/2-qt. baking dishes; sprinkle each with 1/2 cup cheese. Top with remaining macaroni mixture. Sprinkle remaining cheese over one casserole. Cover and freeze for up to 3 months. Sprinkle the second casserole with french-fried onions. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 40 minutes or until heated through.
