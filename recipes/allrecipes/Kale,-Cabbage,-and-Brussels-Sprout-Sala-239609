Pour pepitas into a bowl and coat with cooking spray. Sprinkle cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper over pepitas and toss to coat. Cook and stir coated pepitas in a skillet over medium-low heat until lightly toasted and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and allow pepitas to cool. Combine Brussels sprouts, curly kale, lacinato kale, napa cabbage, dried cranberries, mandarin oranges, green onions, strawberries, and toasted pepitas in a large bowl. Mix poppy seed dressing and orange juice together in a bowl; pour over Brussels sprouts mixture and toss well.
