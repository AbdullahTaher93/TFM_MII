Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms, bell pepper, and onion until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in water, rice, bouillon granules, salt, garlic powder, and black pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, 14 to 16 minutes.
