Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine cornstarch and sour cream until smooth; set aside. In a small saucepan, combine the broth, grape juice and onions. Bring to a boil; cook for 4-5 minutes or until liquid is reduced to 1 cup. Gradually whisk in the sour cream mixture. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened.
