In a large kettle, blanch peppers in boiling water 3 minutes. Drain and rinse in cold water. Set aside. In a large skillet with a nonstick finish, brown the turkey. Remove and set aside. In the same skillet, combine tomato liquid, onion, celery, garlic and herbs. Simmer until vegetables are tender and the mixture has begun to thicken. Stir in tomatoes, turkey and rice. Stuff into peppers and place in a baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes. Top each pepper with about 1 tablespoon cheese. Return to oven for 3 minutes or until the cheese has melted.
