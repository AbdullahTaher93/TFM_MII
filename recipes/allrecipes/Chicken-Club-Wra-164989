Spread 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise over each tortilla. To build 1 wrap: place lettuce on the center of the wrap. Top lettuce with tomato, onion, bacon, avocado and sliced chicken. Fold in the left and right sides of the wrap towards the center, and roll the bottom edge of the tortilla into a burrito shape. Slice the wrap in half and serve.
