Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Slowly cook and stir celery and onions until onions are translucent, about 10 minutes. Stir in oysters, poultry seasoning, bread and enough turkey drippings to keep the mixture moist but not soggy. When bread pieces are thoroughly coated, transfer the mixture to a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover and bake in the preheated oven 30 to 45 minutes, until lightly browned.
