Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Peel shallots and slice vertically into 4-inch pieces. Clean artichokes, drain, and pat dry. Halve baby artichokes lengthwise; for large ones, halve and then slice into two pieces. Place oil in a 12-inch ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add artichokes and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add shallots and saute until artichokes are golden on edges, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add thyme and chicken broth, and bring to a boil. Transfer skillet to oven; roast, turning once or twice, until artichokes are just tender, 20 to 25 minutes. (Check halfway through. Add a little water if the broth has evaporated.) Remove from oven, season with salt and pepper, and serve.
