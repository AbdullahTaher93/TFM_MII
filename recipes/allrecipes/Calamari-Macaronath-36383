Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. In a small sauce pan, boil the squid in 3 cups of water mixed with the red wine vinegar for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, cut into bite-sized rings/pieces, and set aside. Heat the olive oil in a large heavy skillet. Saute the onion and garlic until onion is tender, but not brown. Stir in the squid, and saute for 2 minutes. Pour in the crushed tomatoes, white wine and lemon juice. Season with cinnamon stick, bay leaves, basil, oregano, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 15 to 20 minutes partially covered, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat, and mix in cooked pasta. Serve topped with grated cheese.
