In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat and add cabbage, onion, salt, ground black pepper and garlic; cook for 20 to 30 minutes or until tender. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add perogies and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or according to package directions; drain and stir in butter. Just before cabbage is done, stir in tomatoes; heat through. Gently stir perogies into cabbage mixture; serve.
