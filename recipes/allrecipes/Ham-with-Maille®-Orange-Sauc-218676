Combine all ingredients in small saucepan. Bring to a gentle boil, stirring until thoroughly combined. Use as a sauce for sliced ham (also good with pork chops or pork tenderloin). This is also excellent as a glaze. Just spoon over entire ham about 30 minutes before ham is done, basting two or three times.
