Cook celery and onion in margarine or butter in a small saucepan until tender. Remove from heat. Stir in sage, thyme, and pepper. Place dry bread cubes in a mixing bowl. Add celery mixture, macadamia nuts, and cranberries. Add the 1/2 cup chicken broth, tossing to moisten. Use mixture to stuff one six to eight pound turkey. (Transfer any remaining stuffing to a casserole dish, adding the 1 to 2 tablespoons chicken broth, if desired, for extra moistness; cover and chill casserole dish until ready to bake.) Bake the stuffing, covered, in a 325 degrees F oven during the last 30 to 45 minutes of turkey roasting until stuffing is heated through.
