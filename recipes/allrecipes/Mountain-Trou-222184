Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Combine flour, paprika, rosemary, garlic powder, parsley, dill, salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Shake bag to mix contents. Place trout into bag, one at a time, seal bag, and shake to thoroughly coat with seasoned flour. Lay each trout onto a large piece of aluminum foil. Insert 1 tablespoon butter, a few lemon slices, and a few slivered almonds into the cavity of each trout; press the cavities closed. Top fish with more lemon slices and almonds. Sprinkle fish with a pinch of paprika, rosemary, garlic powder, parsley and dill. Place trout on aluminum foil sheets onto preheated grill and cook until fish are browned and the flesh is opaque and flakes easily, about 8 minutes per side.
