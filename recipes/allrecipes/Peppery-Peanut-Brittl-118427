Coat a 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. pan and metal spatula with nonstick cooking spray; set aside. In a bowl, toss the peanuts, hot pepper sauce and allspice until evenly coated; set aside. In a 2-qt. microwave-safe glass bowl, combine sugar and corn syrup. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 4 minutes; stir. Add peanut mixture; stir until blended. Heat on high 4-5 minutes longer or until mixture turns a light amber color (mixture will be very hot). Stir in butter. Microwave 45 seconds longer. Quickly stir in baking soda and vanilla until mixture foams and becomes light-colored. Immediately pour mixture onto prepared pan and spread as thin as possible with prepared spatula. Cool. Bread into pieces.
