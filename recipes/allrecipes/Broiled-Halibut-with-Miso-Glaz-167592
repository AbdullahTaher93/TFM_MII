Whisk miso, sake (or rice wine) and mirin in a small bowl into a smooth paste. With a large sharp boning knife, remove skin from halibut steaks. Following the natural divisions created by the bone and cartilage, cut fish from the bone to create 4 small boneless steaks (also called medallions). Trim any dark areas. Preheat broiler. Line a heavy baking sheet with foil and coat the foil with cooking spray. Place the halibut medallions on the prepared baking sheet and brush the tops with half the miso glaze. Broil, 3 to 4 inches from the flame, until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the medallions over and brush with the remaining miso mixture. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top and broil until the fish is opaque in the center, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve with lime wedges and pickled ginger.
