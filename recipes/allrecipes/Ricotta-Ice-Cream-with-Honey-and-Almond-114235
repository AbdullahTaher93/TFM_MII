In a small frying pan, toast the almonds over moderately low heat, stirring frequently, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Or toast them in a 350 degrees F oven for 5 to 10 minutes. Let cool completely. Put a large metal bowl in the freezer. Let the ice cream stand at room temperature until just beginning to soften but still frozen. In a food processor, puree the ricotta and honey until smooth. Remove the bowl from the freezer and put the ice cream in it. Stir until smooth. Stir in the ricotta mixture. Transfer the ice-cream mixture to a shallow stainless-steel pan and then return it to the freezer, covered, until firm enough to scoop, about 60 minutes. Serve the ice cream topped with the toasted almonds.
