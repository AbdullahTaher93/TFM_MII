In a heavy saucepan, combine the chocolate, butter, sugar, water, and corn syrup over medium heat. Stir the mixture continually until the chocolate and butter have melted and the sugar has dissolved. When the sauce comes to a boil, lower the heat and continue boiling gently for 10 minutes. Remove the thickened sauce from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Use immediately or store covered in the refrigerator
