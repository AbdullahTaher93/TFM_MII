In a small bowl, combine honey, sage, garlic, juniper berries, and pepper. Place pork in a shallow baking dish and add honey mixture to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. Place pork on a roasting rack in a shallow roasting pan and insert a meat thermometer in thickest part. Roast, uncovered, in a 350 degrees F oven until thermometer registers 155 degrees F for pork that's slightly pink in center, 1 to 1 1/4 hours. Meanwhile, make chutney: In a medium bowl, combine apples, lemon, onion, bell pepper, ginger, and garlic; set aside. In a 2- to 3-quart saucepan, combine vinegar and brown sugar. Place over high heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Add apple mixture, cayenne, and salt. Bring to a boil, and then reduce heat to medium-low; boil gently, uncovered, stirring often, until chutney has thickened and is reduced to about 2 cups, 20 to 30 minutes. Let chutney come to room temperature. (If making ahead, cover and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.) Lift cooked pork onto platter and keep warm. Spoon off and discard any excess fat in roasting pan. Place pan over medium-high heat; add cider and beef broth, stirring to loosen any browned bits. Boil, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 1/2 cup, 3 to 5 minutes. Slice roast thinly across the grain, then drizzle with sauce and serve with chutney to taste.
