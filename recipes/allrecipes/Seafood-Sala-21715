Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. In a large mixing bowl, combine cooked pasta, crabmeat, tuna, shrimp, carrots, and onion. In a separate small mixing bowl, combine creamy salad dressing, French dressing, milk, and sugar. Pour dressing mixture over pasta mixture and toss well. Refrigerate until well chilled, or overnight.
