Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly spray a 13x9 inch baking dish with cooking spray. Spread 4 tablespoons of the cooking sauce to coat the bottom of the baking dish. Mix the chopped chicken, corn, onion, and 1/2 cup of the cooking sauce in a bowl. Spread 3 tablespoons of the chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Sprinkle lightly with cheese, reserving at least 1/2 cup to top all of the enchiladas. Roll up the tortillas and place seam side down in the prepared dish. In a separate bowl, mix together the cream cheese, 1/2 cup of the Herdez sauce, and half and half until blended and smooth. Top each enchilada with some of the cream sauce. Bake uncovered in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the enchiladas and continue baking until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Garnish with sour cream, olives, and cilantro, if desired.
