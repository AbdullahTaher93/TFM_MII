Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, spread the baked beans in a casserole dish. Toss the corned beef with the tomato puree and Worcestershire sauce in a bowl and sprinkle over the beans. Spread the onions overtop, followed by the mashed potatoes. Finally, sprinkle with the shredded Cheddar cheese. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes until the casserole is hot and bubbly.
