Pour bean with bacon soup into a large saucepan and cook over medium-low heat until warmed through, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir tomatoes, sausage, onion, mushrooms, and hot sauce into the soup. Reduce heat to low and cook soup at a simmer, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are breaking down, about 1 hour.
