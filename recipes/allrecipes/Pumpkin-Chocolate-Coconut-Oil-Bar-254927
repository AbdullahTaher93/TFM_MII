Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch baking pan or glass dish with cooking spray. Combine almond flour, coconut sugar, pumpkin puree, coconut oil, dairy-free chocolate chips, tapioca flour, egg white, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, and almond extract in a bowl; stir until well mixed. Pour into prepared baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until chocolate chips are melted and top is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Cool until set, about 15 minutes. Cut into bars.
