Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic; cook and stir for a few minutes then add the green beans. Stir to coat with the flavors in the pan. Season with soy sauce and fish sauce and let simmer for about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour in the water and let simmer for about 10 minutes, or until green beans are tender. Stir in tomato and season with salt and pepper before serving.
