Add your choice of pasta to boiling water. In a saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil and Savory Market Oven Roasted Garlic Flavor. Add half of the walnuts and all of the rosemary and allow the mixture to heat for a few seconds. Cook until the pasta is al dente, drain and transfer to a warmed serving dish. Immediately pour the sauce over the pasta and add the remaining walnuts. Season the dish to taste with salt and ground, green pepper and toss well. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese and serve.
