Combine the olive oil, garlic, chopped thyme, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a large mixing bowl. Season the chicken tenders with salt and pepper. Toss chicken with the olive oil mixture; allow to marinate for 5 minutes. Spray a non-stick skillet with cooking spray, and place over medium-high heat. Cook chicken tenders in the hot pan until lightly browned and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side.
