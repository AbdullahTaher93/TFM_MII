Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix egg beat and milk in a shallow dish or bowl; place crushed chips in a separate shallow dish or bowl. Dip chicken first in egg mixture, then in crushed chips to coat. Place coated chicken on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes; turn sides and bake for another 10 minutes.
