Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large casserole dish. In a large bowl, mix the bread cubes, cranberry sauce, apples, raisins, lemon zest, and orange zest. Season with salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. In a separate bowl, beat together the eggs, cider, and butter. Toss the egg mixture with the bread mixture until evenly moist. Transfer to the prepared casserole dish. Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until lightly browned.
