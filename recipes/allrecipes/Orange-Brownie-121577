In a small saucepan, melt butter. Stir in cocoa until smooth. Remove from the heat. In a bowl, beat eggs until frothy. Without stirring, add the sugar, flour, pecans, orange juice concentrate, peel and salt. Pour cocoa mixture over the top; mix well. Transfer to a greased 8-in. square baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 28-32 minutes or until edges begin to pull away from sides of pan. Cool completely on a wire rack. For frosting, combine confectioners' sugar, butter and orange juice concentrate; mix well. Spread over the brownies. Cut into bars; garnish with orange peel if desired.
