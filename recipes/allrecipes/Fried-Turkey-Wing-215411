Season the turkey wing pieces on all sides with seasoned salt, seafood seasoning, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder. Place into a plastic bag, and refrigerate 4 hours to overnight. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook the turkey wings in the hot oil for 15 minutes, then turn the wings over, and continue cooking until the meat is no longer pink at the bone, 10 to 15 minutes.
