Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. In 1 1/2- to 2 1/2-quart pan, bring half-and-half and sugar to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. In a medium bowl, whisk egg yolks just until broken up. Slowly whisk in half-and-half. Pour mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a pitcher or bowl. Place six 1/2-cup souffle dishes or ramekins in a shallow baking pan. Fill dishes with custard. Place pan on oven rack and pour about 1 inch of hot water into pan. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the centers jiggle slightly and a toothpick inserted into the center of one custard comes out almost clean. Remove dishes from water and cool to room temperature. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until well chilled. Before serving, sprinkle 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar over the top of each custard to cover by about 1/8 inch. (Be sure to remove any hard lumps of sugar.) Caramelize under a broiler (about 3 minutes, watch carefully) or with a propane torch or brulee iron.
