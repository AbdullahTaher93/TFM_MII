To make the verde sauce: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Remove and discard the husks from the tomatillos. Line a baking sheet with foil and place the tomatillos and chili peppers on it. Bake for 10 minutes; turn the pieces and bake for 15 minutes. Place the peppers in a brown paper bag and let stand for 5 minutes. Remove and discard the skins and seeds. Puree the peppers in a food processor. Add the tomatillos and pulse until the mixture is chunky. Transfer to a bowl and add the onions, cilantro, garlic, and salt. To make the burritos: Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat a 13 inch x 9 inch (32.5 x 23-cm) baking dish with nonstick spray. Warm the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the scallions, zucchini, squash, and red peppers; cook for 2 minutes. Add the cumin and chili powder; cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until crisp-tender. Add the beans, salsa, and rice; stir until well combined. Season with the black pepper. Lay a tortilla on a flat surface and place 1/2 cup (120 ml) of the filling in the center. Top with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the Monterey Jack. Roll into a tight cylinder. Place, seam side down, in the prepared baking dish. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, filling, and Monterey Jack. Mist the burritos with nonstick spray. Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes, or until the filling is hot. To serve, top the burritos with the sauce and sour cream.
