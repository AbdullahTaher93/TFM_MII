Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine the lemon zest, Truvia(R) Baking Blend, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a smaller bowl, combine sour cream, eggs, vanilla, butter, and lemon juice and whisk together until smooth. Add the sour cream mixture to the flour mixture. Gently mix together until just combined, then fold in the poppy seeds. Divide batter evenly into paper lined muffin cups. Bake for 18 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Prepare glaze by mixing lemon juice with ground Truvia(R) Baking Blend. Brush or drizzle glaze on muffins.
