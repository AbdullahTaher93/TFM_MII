In a large bowl, whisk 1/4 cup of the olive oil with the lemon juice, rosemary and two-thirds of the garlic; season with pepper. Add the pork chops and turn to coat. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour. Meanwhile, in a food processor, pulse the remaining garlic with the capers, mustard and vinegar just to combine. Add the parsley, basil and mint and pulse to chop. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and pulse just to combine. Transfer the salsa to a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Light a grill. Remove the pork from the marinade and season with salt. Grill over high heat, turning once, until just cooked through, 8 to 9 minutes. Let the chops rest for 5 minutes, then serve with the salsa.
