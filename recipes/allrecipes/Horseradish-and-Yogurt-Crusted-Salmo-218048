Preheat oven 400 degrees F. In a bowl combine yogurt, horseradish, Dijon, chives, and lemon zest; mix well. Place salmon filets on a foil-lined baking sheet. Top each fillet with 3 Tbsp. yogurt mixture. Sprinkle 1 Tbsp of bread crumbs on each filet, and lightly spray with cooking spray. Roast salmon for 10-12 minutes or until golden and cooked through.
