Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray bottom only of 13x9" glass baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Cook pasta according to package instructions; drain. Rinse with cold water; drain. Meanwhile, reserve 1 tablespoon pasta sauce; pour remaining sauce into baking dish. In medium bowl, mix egg, ricotta cheese, Mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, basil and garlic powder. Fill each cooked pasta shell with about 2 tablespoons of the cheese mixture. Arrange filled shells, cheese mixture up, in dish over pasta sauce. Press 1 meatball in the center of each cheese-filled pasta shell to resemble an eye. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes or until bubbly. Let stand for 5 minutes. Use drop of reserved pasta sauce to attach olive slice to each meatball for the pupil of the eye.
