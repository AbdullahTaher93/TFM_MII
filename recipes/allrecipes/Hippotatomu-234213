Scrub your potato, prick it all over with a fork, and cook it in the microwave for about 6 minutes with 2 tablespoons of water or until it is tender inside. Once the potato is cool to the touch, cut a small slit at one end for the hippo's mouth. The size of the slit will depend on the size of your potato! Chop the green end of the scallion (or chives) into 1/2-inch pieces and push a few of them into the potato towards the front of the mouth; these will be the teeth. Add the pat of butter inside the slit (mouth) for the tongue! Cut two small triangular pieces of the potato skin at the top of the head and fold forward to make the hippo's ears. Add 2 peppercorns for the eyes. Enjoy your Foodimal . . . hello, Hippotatomus, how cute are you!
