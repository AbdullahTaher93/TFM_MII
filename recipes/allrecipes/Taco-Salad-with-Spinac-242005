Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, onion, red bell pepper, mushrooms, salt, and chili powder together in the hot skillet until the beef is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes; drain and discard grease. Spread spinach leaves into a salad bowl; top with beef mixture. Add black beans and chopped tomato.
