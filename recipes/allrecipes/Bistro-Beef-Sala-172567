In a medium bowl, whisk olive oil, Dijon mustard, ketchup, lemon juice, Worcestershire, and the hot sauce to taste. Taste and adjust flavor of dressing, if desired; set aside. Divide romaine lettuce salad mix evenly among four dinner plates. Cut roast beef slices into thin strips and place evenly on greens for each salad. Top meat equally with green onions, cornichons, parsley, and capers. Pour dressing equally over each salad. Sprinkle with croutons and serve.
