Fry the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate; crumble once cool enough to handle. Toss crumbled bacon, spinach, and mushrooms together in a salad bowl; top with croutons and eggs. Season the salad with black pepper and drizzle with ranch dressing.
