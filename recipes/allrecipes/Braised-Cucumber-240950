Place cucumbers in a shallow baking dish and sprinkle kosher salt over the top; toss to coat and let rest, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Drain cucumbers and discard any accumulated liquid. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir cucumbers in hot butter until cucumbers are heated through and color starts to change, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer cucumbers to a serving dish and season with lemon juice, mint, and black pepper.
