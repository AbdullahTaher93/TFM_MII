Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack at about 6 inches from the heat source. Place the bread onto a baking sheet. Spread the baked beans with pork onto each slice of bread, then cut the luncheon meat into 8 slices, and place a slice on each piece of bread. Cover with a slice of cheese, then add a dollop of ketchup and mustard to each. Broil in preheated oven until the edges of the bread have toasted and the cheese is melted and golden.
