Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place onion, garlic, and tomatoes in the skillet, and season with oregano and thyme. Cook and stir 5 minutes, until onion is tender. Mix in tuna, wine, lemon juice, and remaining olive oil. Continue cooking 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add angel hair pasta. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until al dente. Drain, and transfer to a bowl. Toss the cooked pasta with Parmesan cheese. Top with the skillet mixture to serve.
