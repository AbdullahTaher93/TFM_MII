Heat the LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, cinnamon stick, lime zest and salt together over medium low heat 4-5 minutes or until warm and steaming. Remove from heat. Strain into a bowl and allow mixture to cool until tepid. Discard cinnamon and lime zest. Mix together cornstarch and water. Add egg yolks, sugar and vanilla. Mix well using a wire whisk. Slowly pour half of the cooled milk into the egg yolk mixture. Stir well. Pour remaining milk into the egg yolk mixture. Return mixture to stove-top. Cook over medium low heat, stirring constantly, until the custard begins to thicken and simmer, about 5-10 minutes. Add nuts and raisins. Serve warm or chill until ready to serve.
