In a large bowl, whisk together green onions, soy sauce, gochujang, rice vinegar, ketchup, garlic and brown sugar. Reserve 1/2 cup for basting. Add it to a plastic bag along with the chicken and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight. Once the chicken is done marinating cook on a hot grill (400 to 500 degrees F) for 4 to 6 minutes on each side while basting often with the reserved 1/2 cup of sauce set aside. Once it is done cooking, rest the chicken for 3 to 4 minutes before thinly slicing. Coleslaw: In a large bowl whisk together the rice vinegar, soy sauce, sugar and sesame oil to combine. Add in the cabbage, bell peppers, green onions, cucumbers and cilantro leaves and toss until coated. To Plate: Place a few tablespoons of sliced chicken in the center of a corn tortilla and add a few tablespoons of the dressed coleslaw. Enjoy!
