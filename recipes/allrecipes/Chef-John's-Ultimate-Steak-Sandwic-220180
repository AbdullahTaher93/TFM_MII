Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Cut steak into 6 thick strips. Season generously with salt and pepper. Grill mushrooms for 5-6 minutes over medium-high heat until they begin to wilt. Remove the stem end to separate the mushrooms. Stir mushrooms in a bowl with salt and pepper, sherry vinegar, and extra virgin olive oil. Set aside. Grill steaks for 3-4 minutes per side over medium-high heat, until medium rare or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Let rest for 5 minutes. Whisk together barbeque sauce, cider vinegar and vegetable oil. Set aside. Serve grilled steaks on hot dog buns with mayonnaise, arugula, cherry tomatoes, grilled mushrooms, and barbeque sauce mixture.
