Cook pasta according to package directions and drain. Meanwhile, cook chicken in hot oil in large skillet over medium-high heat 2-3 minutes or until no longer pink. Stir in tomato sauce, undrained tomatoes and peas. Bring to boil; reduce heat. Simmer uncovered, 5-10 minutes or until thickened. Slowly stir in cream. Serve over hot pasta. Sprinkle with finely shredded Parmesan cheese, if desired.
