Heat oven to 400 degrees F. In large bowl, beat sugar, shortening and butter with electric mixer on medium speed, or mix with spoon. Stir in vanilla and eggs. Stir in flour, baking powder and salt. On lightly floured cloth-covered surface, roll half of dough at a time 1/4 inch thick. Cut into 3x1-inch rectangles, using pastry wheel or knife, or use rectangular-shaped cookie cutter. Insert 1 inch of wooden stick into a 1-inch side of each cookie. With end of wooden spoon handle, make 3 indentations in each cookie. On ungreased cookie sheet, place cookies 2 inches apart. Bake 6 to 8 minutes or until edges are light brown. Immediately press red, yellow and green candies into indentations in each cookie. Cool 2 minutes; remove from cookie sheet to cooling rack. Cool completely, about 30 minutes.
