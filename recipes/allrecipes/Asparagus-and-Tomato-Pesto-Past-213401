Cook pasta according to package directions, omitting salt and fat. Drain pasta in a colander over a bowl, reserving 1/4 cup cooking liquid. Heat olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add red pepper and asparagus; cook 5 minutes or until asparagus is crisp-tender. Add tomatoes and garlic; cook 1 minute. Add pasta, salt, and remaining ingredients; toss well. Cook 2 minutes or until thoroughly heated, adding reserved 1/4 cup pasta water, if needed.
