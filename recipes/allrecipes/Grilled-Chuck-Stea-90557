Combine onion, ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and red pepper in medium bowl. Place beef steak and 1 cup marinade in food-safe plastic bag; turn to coat. Close bag securely and marinate in refrigerator 6 hours or as long as overnight, turning occasionally. Refrigerate remaining marinade. Preheat grill. Remove steak; discard marinade in bag. Place steak on grid over medium, ash-covered coals. Grill, uncovered, turning occasionally, 15 to 18 minutes for medium rare to medium doneness. Meanwhile, place remaining marinade in small saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer 10 to 15 minutes or until sauce consistency, stirring occasionally. Cut steak into serving-size pieces. Serve with sauce.
