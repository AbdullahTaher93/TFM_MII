Divide sweet potatoes among four greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dishes. In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine butter, sugar, milk, cinnamon and nutmeg; cook and stir until butter is melted and mixture is smooth. Remove from the heat; stir in coconut and vanilla. Pour over sweet potatoes. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes. Uncover; sprinkle each with 1-1/2 cups marshmallows. Bake 5-10 minutes longer or until marshmallows just begin to puff and melt.
