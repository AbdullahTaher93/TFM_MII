Place 2 teaspoons olive oil in a skillet and heat over medium heat. Stir in the sausage; cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool. Place the apple slices in a bowl, and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Set aside. To make the dressing, whisk together 1/3 cup olive oil, Dijon mustard, 1/3 cup lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a bowl until creamy. Place the field greens and arugula leaves in a salad bowl; toss together. Mix in the red onion, pecans, blue cheese, and apple slices. Pour the lemon dressing over the salad mixture, and toss to coat evenly. Add the sausage, and toss again.
