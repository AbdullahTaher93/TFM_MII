Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Unroll and fit one piecrust into a 9-inch pie plate. Set aside. Drain cherries, raspberries, and blueberries (if frozen), reserving 1 cup of the juice. Set berries and juice aside. Combine SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and cornstarch in a medium saucepan; gradually stir in reserved juice. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture begins to boil. Boil 1 minute. Stir in butter and reserved fruit. Cool slightly and spoon mixture into pie shell. Unroll remaining piecrust; roll to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut six 1 1/2-inch wide strips. Arrange strips in a lattice design over filling. Trim strips even with edges of bottom crust; fold edges under and crimp. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until crust is browned. Cool on a wire rack. Serve with vanilla yogurt, if desired.
