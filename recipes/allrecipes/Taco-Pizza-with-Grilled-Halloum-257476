Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef until browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; drain excess grease. Stir in taco seasoning mix and let cool, about 5 minutes. Spread pizza crust on a pizza pan or large baking sheet. Cover with pizza sauce. Sprinkle Mexican cheese blend on top. Cover cheese with beef mixture, halloumi cheese, olives, and jalapeno pepper. Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is crispy and the Mexican cheese blend is melted, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle crushed tortilla chips over pizza. Top with cherry tomatoes, lettuce, and onion. Garnish with salsa, sour cream, and hot sauce.
