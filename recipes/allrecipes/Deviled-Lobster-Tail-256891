Mix mayonnaise, tarragon, sriracha sauce, paprika, lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and salt together in a bowl. Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Set oven rack about 8 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Loosen lobster meat from the shell, leaving it attached near the tip of the tail. Place tails on a baking sheet lined with crinkled aluminum foil to help keep them in place. Spoon some of the mayonnaise mixture beneath the lobster meat and spread a generous amount on top. Broil in the preheated oven until lobster tails are browned and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes.
