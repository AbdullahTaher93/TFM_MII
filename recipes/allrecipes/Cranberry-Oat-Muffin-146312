Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Oil and flour large or mini muffin pans or use paper liners. (Smaller muffins rise better). Place berries, sweetener (maple syrup or agave nectar), oil, and cranberry juice in blender and blend slightly. Mix dry ingredients together. Add liquid to dry ingredients and stir just to combine. Fill oiled muffin tins. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes or until nicely browned.
