Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spread the drained tomatoes on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil; season with salt and pepper. Roast in preheated oven until the tomatoes start to brown and shrink slightly, about 20 minutes. Heat butter over medium-low heat in a large saucepan. Stir in the saffron, celery, carrot, onion, and garlic; cook until softened, about 10 minutes. Mix in the roasted tomatoes, reserved tomato juices, and chicken broth. Simmer until vegetables are very tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in the curry powder, lime juice, and cilantro. Use an immersion blender to puree soup until smooth.
