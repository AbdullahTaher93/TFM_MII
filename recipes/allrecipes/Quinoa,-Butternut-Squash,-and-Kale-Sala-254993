Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine 1 tablespoon olive oil, cumin, oregano, chili powder, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Add butternut squash and zucchini; toss until coated. Place butternut squash and zucchini onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven, tossing once half way through, until soft, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven; cool. Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and cool. Combine remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, butternut squash, zucchini, quinoa, kale, parsley, raisins, red onion, apple cider vinegar, and honey in a bowl; toss until salad is combined.
