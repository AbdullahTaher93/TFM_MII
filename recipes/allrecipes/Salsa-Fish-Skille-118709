In a large nonstick skillet or wok, stir-fry halibut in 2 teaspoons hot oil for 3-4 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork; remove and keep warm. Add the yellow squash, zucchini, mushrooms, garlic, cumin and remaining oil to the pan. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender. Return fish to the pan. Add salsa; heat through. Sprinkle with cilantro.
