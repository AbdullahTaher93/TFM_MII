In a large bowl, combine peaches, sugar, tapioca and lemon juice; let stand 15 minutes. Meanwhile, combine flour, brown sugar and pecans in a small bowl; cut in butter until crumbly. Sprinkle 1/3 of crumbs over bottom of pie shell; cover with peach mixture. Sprinkle remaining crumbs on top, allowing peaches to show if desired. Bake at 450 degrees F for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F and bake 20 minutes longer or until peaches are tender and topping is golden brown.
