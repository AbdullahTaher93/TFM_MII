In a soup pot, heat the EVOO, 2 turns of the pan, over medium-high heat. Add the onion, celery, carrots and bay leaf and cook for 3 minutes. Add the cabbage by the handful, season with salt and pepper and cook until wilted, about 2 minutes. Add the beer and boil until reduced, 1 minute. Stir in the chicken broth, tomatoes and the 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce. Add the corned beef and rice. Bring the stoup to a boil, then simmer until the rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Season with salt, pepper and more Worcestershire sauce; serve the stoup in shallow bowls. Pass the bread and butter around the table.
