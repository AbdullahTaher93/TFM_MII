Adjust oven rack to center position and heat oven to 250 degrees. Place cornbread cubes on a cookie sheet with a rim; bake until bread is dried out, about 30 minutes, then set aside to cool. Salt the tomatoes, stir in the garlic and let stand until juicy, about 30 minutes. Prepare remaining ingredients; toss with tomatoes. Add bread; toss. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
