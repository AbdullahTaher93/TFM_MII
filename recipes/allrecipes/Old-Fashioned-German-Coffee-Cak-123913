Dissolve yeast and 1 tablespoon sugar in water; let stand 5 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, combine shortening, sugar and egg. Gradually mix in 2 cups flour, milk and yeast mixture. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn out onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Divide in half; press each half into a greased 11-in. x 7-in. baking pan. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. For topping, combine flour, sugars, shortening, vanilla and salt; sprinkle over dough. Arrange peaches on top. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.
