Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Piece the skin of the eggplant in 6 to 10 places with a knife. This will prevent the eggplant from exploding. Place on a roasting pan. Place in a 375 degrees F oven and roast for 30 minutes. Allow to cool. Once the eggplant is cool enough to handle, peel off and discard the skin. Chop the flesh and set aside. Mince the scallions, keeping the white and green parts separate (the green part will be used as a garnish). Heat the oil in a soup pot over medium-high heat; add the onion and garlic. Cook for 1 minute. Add the chicken stock, sherry, thyme, oregano, rosemary and cayenne pepper. Bring to a boil for 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Add the eggplant. Puree the soup by using a food processor or blender (in batches) or use a hand held blender. Reheat to just under a boil, add the cream and stir well. Taste test and add salt & pepper as desired.
