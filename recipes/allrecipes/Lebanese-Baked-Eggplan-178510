Cut eggplants into half-inch slices; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and let stand for 20 minutes; blot up the liquid with a paper towel. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; brown the onion and stew meat in the hot oil. Stir in the walnuts and cook another 2 minutes; remove from heat. Arrange half of the eggplant slices in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish; spoon the beef mixture over the layer of eggplant. Top the beef mixture with the remaining eggplant slices, potatoes, and tomatoes; season with salt and pepper. Bake uncovered in preheated oven until the eggplant is soft; about 1 hour.
