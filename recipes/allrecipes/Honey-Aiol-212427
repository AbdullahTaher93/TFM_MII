In small bowl combine egg, 2 tablespoons olive oil, garlic paste and lemon juice. Using hand held mixer, process at high speed until garlic is fully incorporated. With mixer still on, slowly add remaining olive oil in a stream and blend until mixture is fluffy and creamy. (If the mixture gets too thick, you can add a little cold water and continue blending) Stir in honey, Stevia Extract In The Raw and sea salt to taste.
