Brown the chicken breasts for a couple of minutes on each side by placing in medium/high heat skillet. Divide the crescent dough into 4 equal square pieces. Place one tablespoon of cheese in the center of each square. Place a chicken breast on the top of the cheese and fold the crescent dough around the chicken, make sure to close up all the sides. Sprinkle with garlic salt and toss in a 350 degree oven for 25 minutes. Serve with a dollop of cranberry sauce.
