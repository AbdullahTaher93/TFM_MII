Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour the bundt pan, and set aside. Combine the flour, baking powder, soda and salt in a mixing bowl, and set aside. Microwave one bag of unwrapped DOVE(R) PROMISES(R) Dark Chocolate until melted (about 1-1/2 minutes), stopping to stir occasionally. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl, beat the shortening, sugar and orange zest until fluffy; then add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. In another mixing bowl, combine the milk and sour cream. With the electric mixer on low, alternately add the flour mixture and the milk mixture into the shortening mixture, beating until smooth. Stir 1 cup of the resulting cake batter into the cooled melted chocolate, and set aside. Spoon half of the plain batter into the bottom of the bundt pan. Then cover it with the chocolate batter, and top with the remaining plain batter. Bake for 55-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from oven, transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely. For the glaze: From the remaining bag, set aside 8 unwrapped DOVE(R) PROMISES(R) Dark Chocolate. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the remaining unwrapped DOVE(R) PROMISES(R) Dark Chocolate with the Karo Syrup and heavy cream. Heat for 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently until smooth. Cool slightly (about 3 minutes). Remove cake from pan, and place it on a wire rack. Then set the wire rack over a sheet pan covered with waxed paper. Spoon glaze over the cake, allowing the excess to drip. Decorate with the reserved DOVE(R) PROMISES(R) Dark Chocolate.
