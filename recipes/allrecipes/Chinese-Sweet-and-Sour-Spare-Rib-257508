Combine pork ribs, soy sauce, 1 teaspoon rice wine, and salt in a large bowl. Marinate in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. Heat oil in a wok or deep saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook ribs in the hot oil until golden brown and no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Bring remaining 1 teaspoon rice wine, sugar, and water to a boil in a saucepan. Stir in ribs; reduce heat and simmer until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Stir in black vinegar. Increase heat to high; cook and stir until sauce thickens and coats the ribs, 1 to 2 minutes.
