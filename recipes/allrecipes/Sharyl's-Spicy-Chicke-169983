Combine the salt, pepper, hot paprika, cumin, cinnamon, and brown sugar in a small bowl. Sprinkle the spices on the chicken using all of the spice mixture. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken in the hot oil for 4 minutes. Turn the chicken, and lower heat to medium-low. Pour in the orange juice; simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 7 minutes. Serve the chicken with a bit of the pan sauce spooned over the each piece.
