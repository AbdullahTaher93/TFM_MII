Set oven rack about 4 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and brush with cooking spray. Whisk miso, rice wine, and mirin together in a small bowl until smooth. Place halibut on the baking sheet and cover with 1/2 the miso mixture. Broil in the preheated oven until golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn and brush with remaining miso mixture. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top. Continue broiling until second side is golden, 3 to 4 minutes more.
