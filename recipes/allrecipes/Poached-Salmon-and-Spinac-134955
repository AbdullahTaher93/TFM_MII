Boil the water, wine, garlic, and scallions in a skillet. Add the salmon and return to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until the fish flakes easily with a fork. Cook the spinach, drain, and stir in the nutmeg. Preheat the broiler. Place the fish on a pan coated with nonstick spray, top with the spinach and chili powder, and sprinkle with cheese. Broil until the cheese melts.
