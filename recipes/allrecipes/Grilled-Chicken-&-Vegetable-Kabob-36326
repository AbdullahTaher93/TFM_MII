Marinate in refrigerator 30 minutes or longer for extra flavor. Remove chicken from marinade; discard marinade. Spear chicken and vegetables on metal skewers. Lightly sprinkle chicken and vegetables with additional Montreal Chicken Seasoning. Grill kabobs 10-15 minutes, or until chicken is done, turning frequently.
