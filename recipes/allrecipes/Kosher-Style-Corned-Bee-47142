In a large plastic bucket or tub, mix together the ice water, salt, Prague powder, sugar and pickling spice. Submerge meat in the mixture, and refrigerate for 3 to 4 days. A weight may be placed on top of the meat to keep it submerged. Cook corned beef as you normally would. Simmer or roast for about 50 minutes per pound, or until tender.
