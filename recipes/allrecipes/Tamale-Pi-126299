Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Coat an 11 inch x 7 inch baking dish with cooking spray. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bell peppers and cook, stirring frequently, for 7 minutes, or until tender. Stir in the chili powder, beans, tomatoes with chiles, and diced tomatoes. Bring to a boil. Place in the prepared baking dish. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the yogurt, cheese, egg, and oil and combine just until blended. Spoon the cornmeal mixture in spoonfuls over the filling, gently spreading it to cover. Place the baking dish on a baking pan to catch any spillover. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the crust is lightly browned and firm and the filling is bubbly. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
