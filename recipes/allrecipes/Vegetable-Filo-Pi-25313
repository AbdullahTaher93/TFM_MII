Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch casserole dish with olive oil. Place vegetables in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water, and cover. Cook until tender but still firm, about 2 to 6 minutes; drain. Meanwhile, in a large bowl combine egg, 1 tablespoon olive oil, garlic, feta cheese and melted butter. Stir in salt, pepper, dill and onion powder. Fold steamed vegetables into egg mixture. Lay 4 sheets phyllo dough in the prepared dish and brush with olive oil. Lay 4 more sheets of dough in the dish, so that the edges overlap in the pan but most of the dough extends beyond the sides of the dish. Spoon vegetable mixture into dish and fold dough across the top. Brush with olive oil. Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes.
