In a large bowl, beat together eggs and buttermilk. In another bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the egg mixture, beating well to make a smooth batter. Stir in melted butter and cooked wild rice. Heat a large heavy skillet over medium high heat. Drizzle in about 2 teaspoon canola oil, swirl pan around to coat bottom. Scoop batter by 1/4 cup into skillet. Cook until bottom is browned, about 1 minute. Turn over; cook until cooked in the middle and bottom is browned, about 1 minute. Add more oil if needed to cook next batch.
