Quarter sausages lengthwise; slice into 1/2-inch pieces and put in a slow cooker. Blend peas in a blender until smooth; add to slow cooker. Stir water, cucumbers, evaporated milk, vegetarian patties, bell pepper, green onions, garlic, chicken bouillon, dill, Italian seasoning, parsley, curry powder, thyme, cayenne, celery salt, and bay leaf into the slow cooker. Cook on High for 2 hours or on Low for 5 hours. Alternately, simmer covered in a pot over low heat until the cucumbers mash easily against the side of the pot, about 2 hours. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over individual servings.
