Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease three 8x4 inch loaf pans. In a large bowl, beat together white sugar, brown sugar and oil. Stir in the pumpkin. Mix in the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition. In a separate bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, coriander and salt. Stir dry ingredients into pumpkin mixture until smooth. Stir in cream sherry. Beat till thoroughly blended, 1 to 2 minutes. Fold in nuts. Spoon batter into 3 greased 8x4 inch loaf pans, filling no more than three quarters full. Bake in preheated oven until a tester inserted into center of a loaf comes out clean, about 65 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes in pans before turn out onto wire racks to cool completely. Can be kept at room temp. for 4 days or frozen.
