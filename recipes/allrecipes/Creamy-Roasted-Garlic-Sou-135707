Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Slice off top third of garlic and discard. Wrap garlic in foil and roast 40 minutes. Let cool. Squeeze roasted garlic from papery skin into small bowl and discard skin. Heat oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook 5 minutes or until translucent. Add broth and one-third of the garlic. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 5 minutes. Working in 2 batches, puree potatoes and onion-broth mixture in blender until smooth. Return to pan. Stir in carrots, rosemary, basil, and remaining garlic and cook over medium heat 10 minutes, stirring often. Add chard, return to a simmer, and cook, stirring, 5 minutes.
