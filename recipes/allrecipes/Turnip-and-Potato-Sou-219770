Cook the bacon in a large saucepan over medium heat until the fat begins to render, about 4 minutes; remove from heat, and drain most of the rendered bacon drippings, reserving about 1 tablespoon in the skillet. Return the pan with the bacon and reserved drippings to medium heat; cook and stir the onion in the bacon and fat until translucent, about 4 minutes more. Stir the potato and turnip into the bacon mixture; cook and stir until the potato and turnip pieces are warmed, about 2 minutes. Add the thyme to the saucepan with enough water to cover the vegetable mixture; bring the water to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a brisk simmer until the potato and turnip are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Heat butter in a small skillet. Cook and stir the kale leaves until they wilt, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, and cook another 1 to 2 minutes. Stir the kale and the cream into the simmering soup; allow to simmer together another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove thyme sprigs before serving.
