Whisk red wine vinegar, red wine, garlic, bay leaves, cloves, black pepper, salt, and thyme together in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the pork, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 2 to 4 days, turning occasionally. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Drain the pork, reserving 1/2 cup of marinade. Put pork and reserved marinade in a baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until the pork is completely warmed, about 20 minutes. Drain as much liquid from the pork as possible. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the pork to the skillet in batches to prevent crowding; cook and stir in hot oil until completely browned and no longer pink in the center, 10 to 15 minutes.
