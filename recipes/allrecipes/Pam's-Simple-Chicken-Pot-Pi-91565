Adjust oven rack to low-center position; preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat two deep dish pie plates with cooking spray. Heat oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook onions, carrots, and celery in oil until just tender, about 5 minutes. While vegetables are cooking, remove the meat from the chicken; shred into bite-size pieces. Discard skin and bones. Transfer cooked vegetables to bowl with chicken; set aside. Heat butter over medium heat in the empty skillet. Mix flour into melted butter, and cook for about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in chicken broth and milk, and season with thyme. Bring to simmer, then continue to simmer until sauce fully thickens, about 1 minute. Stir in sherry. Pour gravy over chicken and vegetables; stir to coat. Mix in peas and parsley. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide mixture into prepared pie plates. Top each with pie dough, and press onto the edge of the pan to seal. Flute the edges or press with the tines of a fork. Use a small knife to make a few cuts in the top to vent steam. Bake until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly, about 30 minutes.
