Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Pour coconut flour into a bowl. Whisk egg whites and water together in a bowl. Combine almond meal, Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, and pepper in another bowl. Dredge batches of zucchini in coconut flour using tongs. Dip in beaten egg whites; toss in almond meal mixture until coated. Arrange on the lined baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until slightly golden, about 20 minutes. Garnish with parsley.
