Bring the rice, pineapple juice, water, pineapple, butter, lime zest, and salt to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir in the cilantro, green onions, and lime juice to serve.
