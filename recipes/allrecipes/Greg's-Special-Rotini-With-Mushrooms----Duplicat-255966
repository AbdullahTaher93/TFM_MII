POUR whole box of pasta into a large skillet (approximately 12 inches in diameter). POUR 2 1/2 cups of cold water into the pan, ensuring that the water covers the pasta. ADD mushrooms and wine and turn the burner to high, then set your timer for 10 minutes (optional: add a bit of salt to taste). COOK on high, stirring occasionally, until almost all of the liquid has evaporated. ADD Barilla(R) Mushroom sauce and gently heat through, stirring to combine. REMOVE from heat and stir in cheese and parsley. Serve immediately.
