In a small bowl, stir sour cream with brown sugar and refrigerate until serving. Position rack in center of oven and preheat oven to 450 degrees F. In a small bowl, whisk eggs until combined. Whisk in milk, salt, and flour. Place butter in a 9 1/2-inch pie dish with a fluted rim or a 9-inch nonstick skillet with an ovenproof handle. Place in oven for 2 minutes or until butter is melted and sizzling, but not brown. Remove from oven and quickly tilt dish to coat bottom and halfway up sides with melted butter. Immediately pour in batter. Bake for 15 minutes. If bottom puffs up, prick it with a fork. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F and continue baking until puffed and golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove dish from oven, lift out pancake bowl, and place on serving plate. Spoon fruit into center and top with sour cream. Cut pancake into wedges, scooping fruit and cream onto each wedge.
