Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Rinse the asparagus; snap off the hard ends and discard them. In a medium bowl, toss the asparagus in the oil to lightly coat the spears; add salt and pepper. Spread the asparagus on a nonstick or parchment-covered baking sheet and roast until tender and beginning to brown, about 20 minutes. If you want to roast the asparagus faster, turn the oven up to 400 degrees F and roast for about 15 minutes. Adjust the time according to the stalk thickness. Add lemon juice and zest for extra flavor.
