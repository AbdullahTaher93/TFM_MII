Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Cook mushrooms and garlic in oil until soft (do not brown). Stir in tomato, pineapple, celery and sugar and cook until tomatoes begin to soften. Stir in chicken broth and water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and stir in lime juice and soy sauce; simmer 5 minutes. Stir in shrimp and red pepper and simmer 3 minutes more, until shrimp are pink. Stir in bean sprouts, onion and reserved noodles. Heat through and serve.
