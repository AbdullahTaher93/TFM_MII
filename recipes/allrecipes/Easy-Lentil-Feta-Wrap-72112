Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Wrap the tortillas in aluminum foil, and warm in the oven about 10 minutes, until soft. Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat, and saute the garlic, shallots, and mushrooms 5 minutes, until lightly browned. Pour in the wine, and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the saucepan. Mix in the lentils, and cook 2 minutes, just until heated through. Fill each tortilla with a portion of the lentil mixture, and fold or roll. Top with feta cheese, olives, and tomatoes.
