In a small bowl, mix together the ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and the oregano, set aside. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the celery, scallions and peppers and saute for a minute or two. Add the cauliflower and saute for a minute or so, stirring occasionally until it soaks up all the butter. Do not over-cook. Then splash in the water to let the cauliflower steam a bit (30 seconds or so). Grate the cauliflower. This is accomplished best by using your grating wheel in your food processor. But you can do this by hand also with a cheese grater. Mince the celery, scallions and peppers quite finely. Drizzle the ketchup mixture over the veggies (do not dump it all in one spot) and stir well. Taste and add salt or pepper as needed.
