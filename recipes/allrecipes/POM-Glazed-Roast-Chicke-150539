Prepare fresh pomegranate juice.* Make glaze by combining pomegranate juice, orange juice, vinegar, parsley and mustard and half of the fresh thyme, leaves only. Rinse chicken; pat dry. Place on a roasting rack in a shallow pan; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Use half of the glaze mixture to coat the chicken. Place remaining thyme leaves in the chicken cavity with onion and orange. Cover the chicken loosely with foil and roast for 30 minutes at 350 degrees F. Remove foil and coat chicken with the remaining glaze. Increase oven temperature to 375 degrees F and continue to bake. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until a meat thermometer in the thigh of the chicken reads 165 degrees F and juices run clear.
