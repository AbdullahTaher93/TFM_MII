Remove and discard stems from mushrooms; rinse mushrooms, pat dry, and slice. Place a wide nonstick frying pan over high heat; stir in mushrooms, onion, and ginger. Cook, stirring, until onion is soft but not brown (3 to 5 minutes). Add broth, 2 cups water, and noodles. Bring mixture to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until noodles are barely tender to bite (6 to 8 minutes). Rinse fish and pat dry. Place another wide nonstick frying pan over high heat. Add tuna to hot pan and cook, turning once, until fish is lightly browned on outside but still red in thickest part; cut to test (4 to 5 minutes). Meanwhile, stir pea pods into noodle mixture and cook for 1 more minute. Stir in oyster sauce and half of the sesame oil. Spoon noodle mixture onto plates and top with tuna. Mix soy sauce and remaining sesame oil; drizzle over tuna.
