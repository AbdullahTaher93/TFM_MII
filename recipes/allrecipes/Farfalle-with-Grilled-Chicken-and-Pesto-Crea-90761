Pour 4 quarts of hot tap water into a 6- to 8-quart pan. Add salt, if desired. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Add farfalle and cook until pasta is just tender to bite, about 15 minutes. While water heats and pasta cooks, whisk together pesto and wine in a deep 12- to 14-inch nonstick frying pan. Place over medium-high heat and stir often until simmering, about 3 minutes. Whisk in half-and-half. Stir often until sauce returns to a simmer. Gently stir in chicken and roasted peppers; simmer until hot throughout, 1 to 2 minutes. Keep warm over low heat until pasta is ready. When pasta is done, drain well and then add to sauce in frying pan. Gently mix to coat pasta evenly. Transfer pasta to a large serving bowl and garnish with basil sprigs, if desired. Offer parmesan to add to taste.
