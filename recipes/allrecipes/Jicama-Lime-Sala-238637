Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Stir 1/4 teaspoon salt into the water and return water to a rolling boil. Reduce heat to low, cover the saucepan, and cook until the moisture is absorbed completely, about 15 minutes. Remove pan from heat and let pan sit covered for 5 minutes more. Spread quinoa in a thin later on a platter and refrigerate to cool completely, at least 15 minutes. Mix jicama, coconut, pineapple, raisins, sweet onion, lime zest, lime juice, cilantro, and jalapeno pepper together in a large bowl; add cooled quinoa and toss. Season salad with salt and black pepper. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until salad is completely chilled, about 30 minutes.
