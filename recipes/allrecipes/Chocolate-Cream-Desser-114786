In a bowl, combine vanilla crumbs, butter, sugar and cinnamon; mix well. Set aside 1/3 cup for topping. Press remaining crumb mixture into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. pan; refrigerate until firm. In a saucepan, heat the candy bar, marshmallows and milk over medium-low heat until chocolate and marshmallows are melted, stirring often. Remove from the heat; cool to room temperature. Fold in whipped cream and vanilla; pour over crust. Chill for 3-4 hours. Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture and almonds if desired.
