Preheat oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange the tomatoes, onion, and jalapeno pepper on the prepared baking sheet. Roast the vegetables under the broiler until the skins are blackened, about 10 minutes. Combine the roasted vegetables, garlic, cilantro, lime juice, salt, and chipotle peppers in a blender; blend to desired consistency. Store unused portions in refrigerator up to 1 week.
