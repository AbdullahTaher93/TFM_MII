Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large pan. Lightly brown the chicken on all sides in the oil. Turn heat to low, then stir in the tomato, ginger paste, serrano peppers, crushed peppercorn, and salt. Cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Pour in the water and turn the pieces of chicken over. Cover, and continue cooking until the chicken is done, about 15 minutes more, adding additional water as necessary.
