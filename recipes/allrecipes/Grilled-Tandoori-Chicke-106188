In a medium bowl, mix together yogurt, oil, paprika, curry powder, cumin, ginger, garlic, cinnamon and salt and pepper. Add chicken thighs; toss to coat. Set aside for 20 minutes or overnight. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Place chicken on grill. Cover and cook turning once until well seared on both sides or until internal temperature is 180 degrees F (80 degrees C), about 5-6 minutes per side. Remove from grill and serve.
