Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a medium bowl, toss the celery, olives, parsley and capers and stir in the olive oil. Spread the rolls open on a cookie sheet and bake for about 3 minutes, or until lightly crisp. Arrange 2 arugula leaves on the bottom half of each roll and top with 2 ounces of prosciutto, 2 mozzarella slices and 3 tomato slices. Top each sandwich with a layer of pickled peppers and about 1/4 cup of the olive relish. Close the heroes and serve at once.
