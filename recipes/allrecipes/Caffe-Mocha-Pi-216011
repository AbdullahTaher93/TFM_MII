In bowl, whisk together granulated sugar, cornstarch, salt and egg yolks. In saucepan, heat milk with 1 tablespoon of the espresso powder to just under a simmer, whisk into egg yolk mixture. Pour back into saucepan; cook, whisking constantly, until thick. Add chocolate; whisk until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Pour into crust and press plastic wrap onto surface of filling; refrigerate at least 1 hour or until set. Just before serving, whisk cream with confectioners sugar, vanilla and remaining 1/2 teaspoon espresso powder until soft peaks form. Cut pie into 8 slices; top each slice with a dollop of the whipped cream. (If you prefer, mound the whipped cream on top of the pie and spread it with a spatula before cutting.)
