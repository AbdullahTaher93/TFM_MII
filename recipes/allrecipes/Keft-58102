Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix together the parsley, onions, lamb, allspice, lemon zest, salt and butter until well blended. Use your hands for best results. Place in a baking dish, or pat into a 2 inch tall round on a baking sheet with sides. Arrange tomato slices on top. Bake uncovered for 50 minutes in the preheated oven, until no longer pink and the internal temperature has reached at least 160 degrees F (72 degrees C). Serve with pita bread or rice.
