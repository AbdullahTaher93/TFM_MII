Put green beans in a large pot. Pour enough water into the pot to cover about 2/3 of the beans. Sprinkle sugar over the green beans. Add bacon and onion to the pot. Bring the water to a simmer over medium-low heat and cook until the beans are soft, about 2 hours. Season with salt and pepper to serve.
