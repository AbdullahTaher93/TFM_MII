Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease 12 muffin cups. Combine chicken soup, chicken, vegetables, Cheddar cheese, onion powder, and garlic salt in a large bowl; stir. Place 1 biscuit dough segment into each muffin cup, pressing into the bottom and up the sides. Spoon chicken soup mixture into dough cups. Bake in preheated oven until hot in the middle and the dough is cooked, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool cupcakes 3 minutes before serving.
