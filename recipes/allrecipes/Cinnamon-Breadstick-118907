In a bowl, combine roll mix and contents of yeast package. Add the water, oil and egg white; beat until smooth. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Roll into a 16-in. x 12-in. rectangle. Cut widthwise into sixteen 1-in. strips. Cut strips in half widthwise, forming 32 strips. Twist each strip 5-6 times; place on a baking sheet coated with nonstick cooking spray. Combine sugar and cinnamon. Spray dough sticks generously with refrigerated butter-flavored spray; sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 25 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
