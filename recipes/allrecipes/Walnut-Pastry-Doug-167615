Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spread walnuts in a pie pan and bake for 5 to 7 minutes, or until fragrant. Let cool. Combine the walnuts, flour, sugar and salt in a food processor; process until the walnuts are finely chopped. Add butter and process until incorporated. Transfer to a large bowl. Drizzle oil over the flour mixture. Use your fingertips to rub the oil into the mixture. One tablespoon at a time, add water and mix with a fork until dough is crumbly and holds together when pressed. Divide dough into 2 pieces, 1 slightly larger than the other, and form each into a disk.
