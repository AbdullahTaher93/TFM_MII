Stir 1/3 cup soup and 1/4 cup milk in a shallow dish. Coat the chicken with the flour. Dip the chicken in the soup mixture. Coat the chicken with the stuffing. Place the chicken on the baking sheet. Drizzle with the butter. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Heat the remaining soup, remaining milk, cheese and ham in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat until the cheese is melted, stirring often. Serve the chicken and sauce with the noodles.
