Heat oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onions and garlic in hot oil until fragrant and softened, 4 to 6 minutes. Stir chili sauce, beer, honey, Worcestershire sauce, and dry mustard into onion mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until sauce thickens and flavors develop, 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake ribs in a baking dish in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Spread sauce over ribs and return to oven; bake until sauce bubbles and ribs are tender, 1 hour.
