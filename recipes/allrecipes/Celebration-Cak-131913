Using serrated knife, split cake horizontally to make 2 layers. Whip cream and powdered sugar until stiff peaks form. Spread 1/3 of whipped cream over the bottom layer of cake. Chop 4 of the truffles; sprinkle on whipped cream. Reserve 8 raspberries for garnish. Arrange remaining raspberries evenly over whipped cream and chocolate. Replace top layer and frost cake with remaining whipped cream. Garnish top of cake with the remaining truffles and reserved raspberries. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
