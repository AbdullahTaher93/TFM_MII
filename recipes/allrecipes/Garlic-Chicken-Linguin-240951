Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain and transfer to a serving bowl. Combine olive oil and garlic in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes; cover saucepan and simmer until tomatoes are cooked down into a sauce, 7 to 10 minutes. Mix chicken, prosciutto, and basil into tomato sauce; cook and stir until chicken is heated through, about 3 minutes. Spoon sauce over pasta and top with Romano cheese.
