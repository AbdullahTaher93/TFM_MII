Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line muffin cups with paper liners. Mix rice flour, sugar, oat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Beat egg, milk, vegetable oil, yogurt, and vanilla together in a separate bowl until smooth; add to the dry ingredients and mix by hand until mostly smooth with only small lumps and you cannot see any patches of dry material in the batter. Gently stir walnuts, raisins, and pumpkin puree into the batter; spoon into prepared muffin cups to about 2/3 full. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
