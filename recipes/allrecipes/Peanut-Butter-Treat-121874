In a mixing bowl, cream peanut butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition (dough will be sticky). With floured hands, roll tablespoonfuls into 1-1/4-in. balls. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 14-16 minutes or until tops are cracked. Remove to wire racks. Immediately press a chocolate star in the center of each. Cool.
