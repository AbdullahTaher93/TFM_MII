To Make the Marinade: Combine all ingredients. Cover and refrigerate until it's time to marinate. To Prepare the Kabobs: Place the shrimp in a 1-gallon (4-L) plastic food-storage bag; place the vegetables and cheese in another 1-gallon (4-L) plastic food-storage bag. Pour half the marinade over the shrimp and half over the vegetables; seal the bags and shake. Refrigerate the bags for at least 30 minutes, shaking them occasionally. Thread the shrimp on six metal skewers; arrange the vegetables on six metal skewers. Grill over medium-hot coals or broil 6 inches (15 cm) from the heat source until shrimp and vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes for the shrimp and 12 minutes for the vegetables, turning halfway through the cooking time. Thread the cheese on the skewers with the shrimp and heat for 30 seconds on each side. Serve with the rice.
