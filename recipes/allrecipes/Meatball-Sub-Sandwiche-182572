Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Stir water into stuffing mix in medium bowl; let stand 5 minutes. Add meat, egg and Parmesan cheese; mix lightly. Shape into 12 meatballs, each about 2 inches in diameter using a small (2-inch) ice cream scoop, if desired. Place in 15x10x1-inch baking pan. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked through. Meanwhile, cut a thin slice off the top of each roll; set aside. Remove the bread from insides of rolls, leaving 1/4-inch-thick shells. Reserve removed bread for another use. Fill each roll with 2 Tbsp. of the sauce and 3 meatballs; drizzle with an additional 2 Tbsp. sauce. Sprinkle evenly with mozzarella cheese. Replace tops of rolls. Bake 2 to 3 minutes or until mozzarella cheese is melted.
