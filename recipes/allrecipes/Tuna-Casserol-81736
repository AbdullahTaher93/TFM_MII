Cook the pasta in boiling water according to the directions on the package except reduce time by 1 minute. Try to be precise. If the package specifies a range such as 8 to 9 minutes, then cook 7 minutes for this recipe. Meanwhile; melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions and celery and cook for about a minute. Add the mushrooms, broccoli and parsley and cook for another 3 minute or so. Add the tuna and sour cream and heat through. Drain the pasta and add to the skillet just to mix it together. Add about 1/3 of the cheese and stir again. Pour the mixture into a casserole dish and top it with the remaining Cheddar cheese. Place in a 350 degrees F oven for about 15 minutes or until the cheese melts. Alternatively you can place the casserole under the broiler for about 3-5 minutes to brown the cheese with crispy bubbles. Also try this with leftover chicken or turkey.
