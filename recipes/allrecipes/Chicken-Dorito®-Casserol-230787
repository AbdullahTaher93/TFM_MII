Bring saucepan of water and Creole seasoning to a boil; cook chicken in the seasoned boiling water until no longer pink in the center, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and shred chicken. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix mushroom soup, tomatoes with green chile peppers, and corn together in a bowl. Spread half the tortilla chips in the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish; top with half the chicken, half the mushroom soup mixture, half the Mexican cheese blend. Repeat layering with the remaining ingredients. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling and cheese is melted, about 30 minutes.
