Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare one or two cookie sheets by lining them with either aluminum foil or parchment paper. Cut the wings at the joints. Discard the point sections or save them in the freezer for when you next make stock. In a shallow bowl, mix together the parmesan cheese, oregano, paprika and garlic powder. In another bowl, melt the butter by zapping it in the microwave for about 1 minute until completely melted. Dip a few pieces in the butter. Shake off the excess butter and then roll them in the cheese mixture coating them well. Place on the baking sheet. Repeat until all the pieces have been coated. Arrange them on the cookie sheets so that they are not too crowded. Bake for 30 minutes turn them over and bake another 30 minutes. Serve hot.
