In a mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Beat in the applesauce, eggs and buttermilk. In a bowl, combine the orange slices, pecans, coconut, cherries, dates and 1 cup of flour; toss to coat. Combine the baking soda, salt and remaining flour; add to the buttermilk mixture. Fold in orange slice mixture. Pour into a greased and floured 10-in. tube pan. Bake at 300 degrees F for 1-3/4 to 2 hours or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely.
