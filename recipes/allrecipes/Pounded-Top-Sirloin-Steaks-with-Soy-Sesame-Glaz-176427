Cut steak into 4 equal portions. Place each piece between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. With a heavy, flat-sided mallet, pound meat firmly but gently all over to a thickness of 1/3 to 1/2 inch. In a small bowl, stir together broth, sherry, soy sauce, ginger, and cornstarch. Set aside. Melt butter in oil in a wide nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. When butter sizzles, add steak. Cook, turning once, until steak is well browned on both sides and still pink in center; cut to test (2 to 3 minutes). Transfer to a platter and keep warm. Stir broth mixture, then add to pan, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil, stirring. Then continue to boil and stir until slightly thickened (1 to 2 minutes). Pour sauce over steak; drizzle with sesame oil to taste, then sprinkle with green onions.
