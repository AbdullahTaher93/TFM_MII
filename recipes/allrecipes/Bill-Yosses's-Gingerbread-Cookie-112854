Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Heat molasses, margarine or butter, brown sugar, and SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, in a saucepan until it boils, stirring to blend well. Remove from heat and allow cooling. Combine flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and nutmeg in a large bowl. Add egg to molasses mixture and stir this into the flour mixture until smooth. Cover dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours. Roll dough out between two pieces of floured plastic wrap, from 1/8 to 1/4 inch thickness, and cut out gingerbread man shapes with floured 4x6 shaped cookie cutter. Re-roll dough as little as possible for consistent texture. Lift cookies with thin spatula onto a greased cookie sheet and bake for 12-14 minutes. Remove from sheet and allow to cool. Decorate gingerbread cookies as desired.
