Heat the oil in a large saute pan or skillet, over a medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, about 3 minutes. Add the celery, green or red bell pepper, garlic, ginger, cayenne, chile powder, and rice, and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Pour in the hot stock and stir well, then reduce the heat so the stock is slowly simmering. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and simmer 15 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes with their juice and 2 tablespoons of the parsley, then add the shrimp and salmon. Cover again and simmer until the seafood is just cooked and the rice has absorbed most of the liquid and is tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the Tabasco sauce, if using, and salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon chopped parsley.
