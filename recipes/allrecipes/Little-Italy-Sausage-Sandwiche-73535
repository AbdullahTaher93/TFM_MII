Cook sausage and onions over medium-high heat in a nonstick skillet until sausage is no longer pink and onions are soft. Blend in paste and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and cook for 10 minutes. Season sauce to taste. Toss salad greens with dressing. Fill each roll with equal amounts of greens and sausage with sauce. Serve immediately.
