Melt butter in a 3- to 3 1/2-quart pan over medium heat. Add leek, fennel, carrot, and ginger; cook, stirring occasionally, until leek is soft and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in paprika, savory, allspice, and nutmeg. Then mix in 1 cup of the chicken broth. Bring to a boil, then cover, reduce heat, and boil gently until carrot slices are tender when pierced, about 10 minutes. Transfer leek mixture to a blender or food processor; whirl until smoothly pureed. Return puree to pan and stir in pumpkin and remaining 3 cups broth. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes to blend flavors. Season to taste with salt and white pepper. Ladle soup into coffee mugs to serve, then top with steamed milk and dust with fresh-ground nutmeg, if desired.
