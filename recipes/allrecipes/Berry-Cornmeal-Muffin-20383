Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 12 muffin cups or use paper liners. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl gently toss strawberries in 1/2 cup of flour mixture. Whisk yogurt, melted butter, and egg together. Stir the yogurt mixture into the flour mixture; stir just to moisten. Fold in strawberries. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, or until a tooth pick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
