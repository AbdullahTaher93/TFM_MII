In a bowl, combine dry ingredients. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. With a fork, stir in milk until the mixture forms a ball. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead five to six times. Roll to 1/2-in. thickness; cut with a 2-in. heart-shaped cookie or biscuit cutter. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 450 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. For honey spread, combine butter and honey in a mixing bowl; beat until smooth. For cinnamon spread, combine butter, sugar and cinnamon in a mixing bowl; beat until smooth. Serve with the warm biscuits.
