Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, for 4 minutes, or until soft. Add the rice, cardamom, and cinnamon and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes, or until the rice just starts to brown lightly. Add the broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 50 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is very tender. Stir in the cashews. Remove from the heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Remove and discard the cardamom pods and cinnamon stick.
