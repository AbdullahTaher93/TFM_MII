Mix poultry seasoning, salt and pepper with flour. Dredge chicken in seasoned flour and set aside. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat; when wisps of smoke start to rise from the pan add chicken and sausages and cook in 2 batches, turning once, until well browned, about 8 to 10 minutes per batch. Transfer to a plate; set aside. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of oil and add onion, carrots, mushrooms, garlic, rosemary and thyme to the hot skillet; cook until vegetables are soft and golden, about 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in wine and tomatoes then arrange chicken and sausage over the vegetables. Simmer covered until chicken is cooked through and flavors deepen, about 30 to 35 minutes. Adjust seasonings, including salt and pepper, to taste. Serve.
