Bring sugar and water to a boil, without stirring, in a saucepan until syrup is 238 degrees F (114 degrees C) or until a small amount of syrup dropped in cold water forms a soft thread, 7 to 10 minutes. Slowly pour syrup over egg whites in a bowl; stir in vanilla extract and continue to beat until thick and cold. Add baking powder and beat until filling/frosting is thick enough to spread without running. Fold almonds, figs, and raisins into filling/frosting.
