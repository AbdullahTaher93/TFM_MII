Make the dressing first. Mix the orange zest and juice with the olive oil, sesame oil, and basil in a large salad bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cut the peel and pith away from the oranges with a sharp knife. Holding them over the salad bowl to catch the juice, cut between the membranes to release the orange segments. Add the segments to the bowl. Add the melon, tomatoes, olives, cucumber, scallions, and prosciutto. Toss until the ingredients are well blended and coated in dressing. Sprinkle the feta cheese over the top and serve.
