Mix ground turkey, bread crumbs, egg, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and Italian seasoning by hand in a large bowl. Form mixture into 1 1/2-inch meatballs. Place beef broth in a microwave-safe container and microwave on high until hot, about 2 minutes. Whisk flour into beef broth until smooth. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add meatballs, in batches if necessary, and cook until browned on all sides, about 2 minutes per side. Reduce heat to low. Pour in beef broth slowly over meatballs. Stir in heavy cream, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until meatballs are cooked through, about 10 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes; drain. Serve meatballs and sauce over noodles.
