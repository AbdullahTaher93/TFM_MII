Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Bake the bread 8 to 10 minutes or according to the package directions; remove the bread from the oven and keep warm. Heat a ridged, cast-iron grill pan or nonstick skillet until hot. Season the steak with salt and pepper to taste. Brush the pan with the oil, then add the steak slices, in batches if necessary, and cook 30 seconds on each side for rare, or 1 minute on each side for medium to well done. Quickly split each loaf in half lengthwise. Spread the bottom halves with the olive paste. Cover with sliced tomatoes and top with the steak. Quickly split each loaf in half lengthwise.
