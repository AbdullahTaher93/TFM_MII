Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix together the vanilla wafer crumbs and butter in a bowl until thoroughly combined, and press the crust into the bottom and up the sides of a 10-inch pie dish. Beat the sweetened condensed milk, Key lime juice, egg yolks, vanilla extract, and Key lime zest in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth; pour the filling into the prepared cookie crust. Bake the pie in the preheated oven until center of pie is slightly jiggly, about 15 minutes. Allow to cool for 10 minutes, then refrigerate. Mix the rhubarb, strawberries, sugar, water, and pectin in a saucepan over medium heat, and bring to a boil. Stirring often, boil until the rhubarb and berries break down and the glaze begins to thicken and resemble jam, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat; cool to lukewarm. Glaze will thicken as it cools. Spread the glaze over the pie, and refrigerate until chilled. For best texture, allow pie to chill at least 8 hours before serving.
