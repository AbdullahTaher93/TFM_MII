In a shallow plate or glass bowl mix together the yogurt, soy sauce, olive oil, lemon juice and ginger. Lay the salmon on top and turn over to coat with the marinade. Cover and set aside for 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from the marinade and broil the salmon about 3 inches from the heat until browned on top and cook until just done (4 to 5 minutes). Remove and place on warm plates. Serve immediately sprinkled with chives if desired.
