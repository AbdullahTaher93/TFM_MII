Remove bones and skin from chicken. Cut chicken into 3/4-inch pieces. (For easier cutting, partially freeze chicken about 1 hour.) Mix chicken and remaining ingredients except Peanut Sauce in glass bowl. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Soak 14 to 16 bamboo skewers in water at least 30 minutes before using to prevent burning. Make Peanut Sauce. To Make Peanut Sauce: Heat oil in a 1 1/2 quart saucepan over medium heat. Saute onion in oil, stirring occasionally, until tender; remove from heat. Stir in peanut butter, water, lemon juice, coriander and hot pepper sauce. Simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, just until blended (sauce will separate if overcooked). Remove from heat and set aside to serve with chicken kabobs when ready. Set oven control to broil. Remove chicken from marinade; reserve marinade. Thread 4 or 5 chicken pieces on each skewer. Brush chicken with marinade. Broil chicken with tops about 4 inches from heat 4 to 5 minutes. Turn; brush with marinade. Broil 4 to 5 minutes longer or until chicken is no longer pink in center. Discard any remaining marinade. Serve chicken with Peanut Sauce.
