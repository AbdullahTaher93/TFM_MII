Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Place sweet potatoes on microwaveable plate. Microwave on HIGH 8 minutes. Turn potatoes over; continue microwaving 9 to 10 minutes or until very tender. Let stand 5 minutes. Cut potatoes in half lengthwise. Scoop pulp into large bowl; discard skins. Add cream cheese, brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg to potato pulp. Mash with potato masher to desired consistency. Spoon into 9-inch square glass baking dish. Mix cereal and butter in medium bowl until well blended. Stir in marshmallows. Sprinkle evenly over potato mixture. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until topping is golden brown and mixture is heated through.
