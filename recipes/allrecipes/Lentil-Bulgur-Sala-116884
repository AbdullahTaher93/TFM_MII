In a large bowl, pour boiling water over bulgur; let stand until the liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add lentils. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain. In another large bowl, combine bulgur and lentils; cool completely. Add the peppers, onions and parsley. In a jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine the vinegar, oil, basil, dill, salt and pepper. Pour over salad; toss to coat. Crumble feta cheese over top; toss again. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or until serving.
