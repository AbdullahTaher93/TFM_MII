To make the stuffed sole: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Warm the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, fennel, scallions, parsley, Italian herb seasoning, and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of the shallots. Cook for 4 minutes, or until the fennel is just tender. Add the shrimp and scallops; cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the shrimp and scallops are opaque and cooked through. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and stir in the bread crumbs, egg substitute, and lemon juice. Season with the pepper. Place the sole, skin side up, on a work surface. Divide the stuffing into four equal portions. Slightly mound the stuffing in the center of each fillet and roll up the fillets jelly-role style. Coat a shallow 1-quart baking dish with nonstick spray. Sprinkle the dish with the remaining 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of shallots and place the fillets, seam side down, on top of the shallots. Pour the sherry or wine around the fillets. Cover with a piece of wax paper. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the fish is opaque and flakes easily when tested with a fork. Remove from the baking dish and keep warm on a covered serving platter. Reserve the cooking liquid. To make the saffron sauce: Warm the oil in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Mix the saffron with 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of the water. Add to the skillet. Stir in the mustard, capers, and the reserved cooking liquid. Cook until the liquid is reduced to about 2/3 cup. Place the arrowroot or cornstarch in a cup. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of water and stir until smooth. Stir into the skillet and cook over medium heat until slightly thick. Remove from the heat and whisk in the sour cream. Season with the salt and pepper. Spoon 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of the sauce over each fillet. Sprinkle with the parsley (if using).
