Prepare the falafel mix according to package directions. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Shape the prepared falafel mix into 1/2-inch rounds. Place in the skillet in batches, and fry until evenly browned. Drain on paper towels. In a large bowl, mix the falafel, cucumber, tomatoes, onion, green bell pepper, celery, and carrots. In a separate bowl, mix the Ranch dressing, garlic powder, and cumin. Toss with the salad to coat. Serve over lettuce.
