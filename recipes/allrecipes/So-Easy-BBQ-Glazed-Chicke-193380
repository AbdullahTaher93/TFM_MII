Heat grill to medium heat. Pour 1/4 cup dressing over chicken in shallow dish; turn chicken over to coat both sides. Refrigerate 10 minutes. Meanwhile, mix barbecue sauce, marmalade and remaining dressing. Remove chicken from dressing; discard dressing. Grill chicken on covered grill 12 to 15 minutes or until done (165 degrees F), turning occasionally and brushing with barbecue sauce mixture the last few minutes.
