Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Over medium heat in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring milk, cream and sugar just to a boil. Remove from heat; stir in vanilla and let sit for 10 minutes. In medium bowl, with fork, mix together yolks and egg just to break them up without incorporating a lot of air. Slowly add milk mixture, stirring with wooden spoon. Strain mixture through sieve into a pitcher; stir in nutmeg, cloves, and if desired, rum and brandy. Let mixture rest, without stirring, for 1 minute. Skim off any bubbles or foam remaining on surface. Pour scant 1/2 cups of mixture into 6, 4-ounce pots de creme cups or 3-inch ramekins. Set custards in a baking dish; fill dish with very hot tap water to come about two-thirds up sides of cups. If using pot de creme cups, cover with lids, otherwise cover pan with aluminum foil. Bake 50 to 60 minutes or until custards are set. Remove from oven and water bath to cooling rack. Cool to room temperature; cover and refrigerate 3 hours or overnight. Serve lightly chilled.
