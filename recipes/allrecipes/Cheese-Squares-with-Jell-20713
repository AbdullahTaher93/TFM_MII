Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). In a mixing bowl, combine the processed cheese food, butter, brown sugar, flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside 1/4 of the mixture. In a greased 8x8 inch baking pan, place the remaining mixture. Cover the mixture with jam. Crumble the reserved 1/4 mixture over the layer of jam. Bake for 25 minutes. Place the baked mixture in the refrigerator for 2 hours or until chilled. Cut into squares and serve.
