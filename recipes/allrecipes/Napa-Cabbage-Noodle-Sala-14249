Place the cabbage in a large bowl, cover, and place in the refrigerator to chill for 30 minutes. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the ramen noodles, sesame seeds, almonds until lightly browned; set aside to cool. Prepare the dressing by mixing the canola oil, soy sauce, sugar, balsamic and white vinegars in a blender until smooth. About 30 minutes before serving, toss the dressing and cabbage mixture together; chill. Just before serving, toss the noodle mixture with the cabbage mixture.
