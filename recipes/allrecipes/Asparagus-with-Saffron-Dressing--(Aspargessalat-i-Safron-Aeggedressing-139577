Steep saffron threads in water until the water turns deep orange, and has cooled to lukewarm, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add trimmed asparagus and cook until just tender, about 2 minutes. Once cooked, remove asparagus from boiling water and immediately plunge into ice water. Leave the asparagus in the ice water until completely cold, then drain well, and set aside. Place egg yolks into a large mixing bowl. Pour in half of the saffron water and garlic; whisk until the eggs become creamy, about 1 minute. Slowly drizzle in 1/4 cup olive oil while continuing to whisk eggs vigorously. Whisk in remaining saffron water, then continue slowly incorporating the olive oil. Add a little water if needed to achieve a pourable consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pat asparagus dry, and place onto a serving platter; pour saffron dressing over to serve.
