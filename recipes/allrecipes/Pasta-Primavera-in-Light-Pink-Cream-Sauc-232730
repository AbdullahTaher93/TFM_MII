Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Mix carrots, broccoli, onion, zucchini, and yellow squash in a large bowl; drizzle with olive oil. Season with Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Toss to evenly coat vegetables. Spread coated vegetables on 2 baking sheets. Roast vegetables in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Stir and continue roasting until tender, about 10 more minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook farfalle at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes; drain and return farfalle to pot. Heat butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir garlic in the melted butter until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Pour chicken stock into garlic mixture; bring to a boil. Add light cream; reduce heat and simmer. Stir tomato sauce and Parmesan cheese into sauce. Combine sauce, roasted vegetables, and cherry tomatoes with farfalle; toss well.
