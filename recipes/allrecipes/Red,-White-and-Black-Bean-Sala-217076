Pour the corn into a microwave-safe dish; cook in the microwave until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain any excess liquid, and set aside to cool completely. Blend the cider vinegar, lime juice, garlic, cumin, Dijon mustard, black pepper, salt, olive oil, and cilantro together in a blender until combined. Toss the cooled corn with the black beans, butter beans, red onion, and red bell pepper in a large bowl; pour the blended dressing over the bean mixture. Refrigerate overnight; allow to come to room temperature before serving.
