Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. In a large bowl, combine the bacon, broccoli, cauliflower, onion, olives, mushrooms and pimento. Stir to mix. Whisk together the salad dressing, sugar, salt and pepper. Pour over salad, toss, and refrigerate until chilled.
