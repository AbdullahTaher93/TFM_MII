Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add pork chops; season with onion and garlic powder. Cook until pork chops are no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer pork chops to a plate; top each one with 2 slices of Cheddar cheese. Place a bowl over the plate to trap in heat. Place bacon into the skillet; cook until crisp and no longer pink, about 6 minutes. Wrap 3 slices of bacon around each pork chop.
