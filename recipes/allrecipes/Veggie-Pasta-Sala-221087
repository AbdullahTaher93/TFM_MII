Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the pasta spirals at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Rinse pasta with cold water until cool; drain. Toss drained pasta, sweet onion, green bell pepper, chile pepper, tomatoes, and cucumber together in a large bowl. Whisk olive oil, tomato sauce, lime juice, red wine vinegar, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a separate bowl; drizzle over the pasta mixture and stir to coat. Chill in refrigerator 2 hours; stir to serve.
