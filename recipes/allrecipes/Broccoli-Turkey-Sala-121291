Drain the pineapple, reserving 2 tablespoons juice; set aside (discard remaining juice or save for another use). In a large bowl, combine the greens, spinach, broccoli, green pepper, onion, turkey and pineapple. In a small bowl, combine oil, vinegar, poppy seeds, sugar, mustard and reserved pineapple juice; mix well. Pour over salad and toss to coat. Serve immediately.
