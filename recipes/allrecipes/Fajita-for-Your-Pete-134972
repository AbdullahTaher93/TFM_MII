Mix soy sauce and pineapple juice; set 1/4 cup aside for basting. Place the steak in the marinade and refrigerate for 6 hours. Grill steaks, basting with leftover marinade, and slice thin when done. Combine fruit and vegetables in an ovenproof casserole dish. Add steak, douse with rum, and ignite (see "How to Light Your Fire," below, for warming and torching instructions). Snuff it, then stuff it.
