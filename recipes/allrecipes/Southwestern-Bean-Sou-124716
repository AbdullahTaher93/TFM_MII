In a medium saucepan, cook bacon until crisp; remove to paper towel to drain. Crumble and set aside. In the drippings, saute the onion and celery; sprinkle with the garlic powder. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Add beans, picante sauce, broth, parsley and bacon; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 5-10 minutes. Season to taste with hot pepper sauce if desired. Ladle into bowls and top with cheese. Serve with tortilla chips.
