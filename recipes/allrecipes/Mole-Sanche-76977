Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Seed and devein the dried chilies. Place all the chilies on a sheet pan and toast them in the oven for 2 minutes, until they start to release an aroma. Remove from oven quickly and submerge in a bowl of hot water. Set aside. Preheat the broiler. Place the onions, tomatoes, tomatillos and garlic on the sheet tray and roast under the broiler for about 5 minutes. Remove and set aside. In a medium saucepan, combine the raisins, apricots, prunes and wine. Cook until the fruit has absorbed all the wine, about 10 minutes. Set aside. In a hot pan, toast all the spices; turn them quickly to prevent burning and remove as soon as you see them smoking. Grind in a spice grinder, or pound in a mortar or cast-iron skillet, and set aside. Drain the chilies. In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, combine the chilies, roasted vegetables, wine-soaked fruit and toasted spices. Add the chicken stock, and simmer 30 minutes. In a saute pan with 3 inches of hot vegetable oil, fry the plantains until golden. To the large pot, add the plantains, chocolate and tortillas. Cook 15 minutes. Remove from heat and puree until smooth. Serve with turkey.
