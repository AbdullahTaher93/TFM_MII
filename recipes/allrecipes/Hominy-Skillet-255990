Cook and stir beef and green bell peppers in a large skillet over medium heat until beef is well browned and reduced to small pieces, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Stir hominy, tomatoes, salsa, salt, cumin, and pepper into the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer hominy mixture until flavors combine, 10 to 15 minutes.
