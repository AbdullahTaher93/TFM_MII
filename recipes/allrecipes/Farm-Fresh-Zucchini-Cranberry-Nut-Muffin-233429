Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare 12 muffin cups with liners. Mix 6 tablespoons flour and brown sugar together in a bowl; cut butter into the flour mixture until you have pea-sized crumbs. Beat margarine and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat egg and vanilla into the butter mixture. Mix 1 1/2 cups flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl; gradually beat into the butter mixture. Fold zucchini, cranberries, and walnuts into the mixture; spoon into prepared muffin cups, filling nearly to the top. Sprinkle topping mixture onto the batter. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.
