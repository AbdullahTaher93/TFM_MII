Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the eggs, lower the heat and simmer for 12 minutes. Remove the eggs, run cold water over them, then cover with ice-cold water for 10 minutes, cracking each shell lightly to let some water in. Drain and peel. Halve the eggs lengthwise. Remove the yolks to a bowl, mash with a fork, then stir in the mustard, mayonnaise and lemon juice. Add the jalapenos, onion and celery and season to taste with salt and pepper. Mound the egg-white halves with the filling and sprinkle with paprika.
