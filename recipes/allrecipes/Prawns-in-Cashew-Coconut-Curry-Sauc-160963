Season the shrimp with turmeric powder and chile powder, and set aside. Toast the cashews, cardamom, cinnamon, and peppercorns in a skillet over medium heat until toasted and fragrant, about 7 minutes; remove from the skillet and set aside. Heat the sunflower oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger; cook and stir until the onion has softened and begun to lose its red color, about 5 minutes. Stir in the shrimp and toasted spice mixture along with the salt, garam masala, bay leaf, tomatoes, and green pepper. Cook and stir until half of the shrimp has begun to turn pink, then pour in the coconut milk, cover, and bring to a simmer. Cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until the shrimp are opaque and the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes.
