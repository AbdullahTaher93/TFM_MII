To prepare marinade, combine orange juice, teriyaki sauce and red pepper flakes in a small bowl. Reserve 1/4 cup marinade. Wash hands. Place chicken, vegetables and remaining marinade in large resealable plastic bag. Marinate in refrigerator 30 minutes or longer. Wash hands. Preheat grill to medium-hot. Grill chicken 15 to 20 minutes or until done (internal temp 170 degrees F). Grill bell peppers, zucchini and mushrooms 5 minutes or until crisp-tender, turning once. While chicken is cooking, prepare rice according to package directions. Stir in reserved marinade. Keep warm.
