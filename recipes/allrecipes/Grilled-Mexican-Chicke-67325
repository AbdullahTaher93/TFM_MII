In a large bowl, mix the water, pineapple juice, lime juice, garlic, saffron, salt, and pepper. Place the chicken in the bowl, and marinate 45 minutes in the refrigerator. Turn chicken, and continue marinating 30 minutes. Preheat grill for high heat. Lightly oil the grill grate. Discard marinade, and grill the chicken, turning occasionally, 45 minutes, or until juices run clear.
