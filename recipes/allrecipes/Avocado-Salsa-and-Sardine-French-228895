Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine avocado, chopped lettuce, chopped green pepper, and lemon juice in a small bowl. Brush extra-virgin olive oil on bread slices and toast in the preheated oven until browned, about 5 minutes on each side. Remove bread slices from oven. Spread with avocado mixture; top with sardines and canned tomatoes.
