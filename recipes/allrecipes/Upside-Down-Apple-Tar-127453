Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Melt butter in 10-inch ovenproof nonstick skillet on medium heat. Add dry gelatin mix and cinnamon. Cook and stir until gelatin is dissolved. Arrange single layer of apples, cut-sides down, on bottom of skillet. Top with any remaining apples. Cook apples on medium-low heat 20 min. or until apples begin to soften and gelatin mixture starts to thicken. Place pie crust over apples. Place skillet in oven. Bake 20 min. or until crust is golden and apples are tender. Cool 3 min. Using oven mitts, place large serving plate on top of skillet. Carefully turn skillet over onto plate. Serve warm. Cut into 10 slices. Top each serving with about 2 Tbsp. whipped topping.
