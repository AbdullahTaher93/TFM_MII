In a large skillet, brown pork chops in oil over medium heat. Place in an ungreased 3-qt. baking dish. Place onion rings over the chops. Sprinkle with two-thirds of the raisins. Arrange the apple slices on top and sprinkle with remaining raisins. Combine the apple juice, brown sugar, salt, basil, nutmeg and cloves; pour over all. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour. Uncover and bake 30 minutes longer or until meat is tender.
