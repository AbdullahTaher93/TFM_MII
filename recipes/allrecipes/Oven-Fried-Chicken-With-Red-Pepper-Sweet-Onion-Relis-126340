To make the chicken: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Coat a large baking sheet with sides with cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine the buttermilk or yogurt, lime juice, salt, and pepper. Place the cornmeal in a pie plate. Dip the chicken in the buttermilk mixture, turning to coat well. (The chicken may be marinated in the buttermilk mixture in the refrigerator for up to 1 day.) One at a time, roll the chicken pieces in the cornmeal, pressing to coat thoroughly. Place the chicken, skinned side up, on the prepared baking sheet. Discard any remaining buttermilk mixture and cornmeal. Coat the chicken well with cooking spray. Bake for 40 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted in the thickest portion registers 170 degrees F and the juices run clear. To make the relish: Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the bell pepper, onion, cilantro, lime juice, oil, and salt. Cover and let stand at room temperature. Serve the chicken with the relish.
