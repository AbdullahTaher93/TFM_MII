Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners. Whisk pumpkin puree, coconut flour, coconut oil, agave nectar, eggs, cinnamon, vanilla extract, nutmeg, baking powder, and pumpkin pie spice together in a bowl until batter is smooth; fold in walnuts. Spoon about 3 tablespoons batter into each muffin cup. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 15 to 17 minutes.
