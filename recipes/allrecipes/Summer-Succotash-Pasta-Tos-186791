Cook and drain pasta as directed on package. Meanwhile, heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic and cook about 4 minutes, stirring constantly, until crisp-tender. Stir in tomatoes, corn and lima beans and cook 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are just tender. Remove from heat. Add drained pasta and basil to vegetables in either skillet or a warmed serving bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper; toss.
