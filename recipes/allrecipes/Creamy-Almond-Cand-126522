In heavy saucepan, over low heat, melt candy coating, sweetened condensed milk and salt. Remove from heat; stir in almond extract, then almonds. Spread evenly into wax-paper-lined 15x10-inch jellyroll pan. Chill 2 hours or until firm. Turn onto cutting board; peel off paper and cut into triangles or squares. Store leftovers tightly covered at room temperature.
