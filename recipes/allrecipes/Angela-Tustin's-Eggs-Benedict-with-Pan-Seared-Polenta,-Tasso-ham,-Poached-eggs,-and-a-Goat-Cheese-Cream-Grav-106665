Boil 3 cups of water in a large sauce pan and reduce to medium heat. Stir in SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and minced rosemary then return to a boil. Slowly start to add polenta a little at a time, and cook until all is incorporated and polenta is smooth and creamy. Remove from heat and stir in butter and cream. Transfer polenta to a small loaf non-stick (or lined with plastic wrap) pan and refrigerate until set. Once set, remove polenta from loaf pan and slice into 12 slices. Set aside until ready to serve. Sweat onions and celery in a large skillet over medium high heat. Once onions and celery are translucent, add milk and chicken stock and reduce mixture by 1/3. Mix cornstarch and water and add to reduced sauce and simmer until thickened. Add crumbled goat cheese and whisk until smooth and incorporated. Season the gravy to taste, and strain before using. Sear polenta slices in a pan with a little bit of oil until golden brown on both sides or simply place on a cookie sheet and bake in the oven. Top each warmed piece of polenta with a portion of tasso ham and then top the ham with the poached eggs. Pour hot goat cheese cream gravy over eggs. Garnish with chopped chives or fresh rosemary.
