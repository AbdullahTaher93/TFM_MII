Season salmon with Nature's Seasons(R) seasoning blend and salt. Combine oil, minced garlic and lemon juice; pour over fish. Cover and marinate in refrigerator at least 2 hours or overnight. Discard any leftover marinade. Spread Seasoned Roasted Garlic on each steak or fillet. Grill to desired doneness or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Serve immediately with Gingered Pepper Sauce and Nature's Vegetable Medley.
