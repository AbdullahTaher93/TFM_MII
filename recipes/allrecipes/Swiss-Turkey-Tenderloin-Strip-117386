Season turkey with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, saute turkey in oil for 6-8 minutes or until no longer pink. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. In the drippings, saute garlic until tender. Stir in the flour, broth and wine until blended. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until thickened. Reduce heat to low. Slowly add cheese; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until cheese is melted and sauce is blended. Add turkey; heat through. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan or Dutch oven, cook spinach in water for 3-5 minutes or until wilted; drain. Serve turkey mixture over spinach.
