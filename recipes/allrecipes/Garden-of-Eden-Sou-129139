Pour the boiling water into a saucepan. Stir in the bouillon cube or powder, the tomato juice, garlic, scallions, potato, and carrot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and cover the pan. Simmer the soup about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Using a sharp knife, cut any large frozen broccoli florets into smaller pieces, then add them to the soup with the cabbage, green beans, peas, and fava beans. Bring the soup back to a boil. Reduce the heat slightly, but keep the soup simmering. Cook until the vegetables are just tender-crisp, about 5 minutes. Taste and season the soup. Ladle the soup into 4 warm bowls. Use scissors to snip half the basil leaves into shreds and sprinkle over the soup. Add a whole basil sprig to each portion and serve at once.
