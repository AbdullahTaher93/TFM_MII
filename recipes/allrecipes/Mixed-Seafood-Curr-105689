Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion, ginger, and garlic in hot oil until onion starts to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir coconut milk, lime juice, curry paste, and brown sugar into onion mixture, bring to a simmer and cook until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Stir shrimp, scallops, asparagus, cilantro, and salt into onion mixture; cook until shrimp and scallops are no longer transparent in the center, about 5 minutes.
