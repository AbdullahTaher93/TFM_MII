Melt fat in a skillet over medium-high heat. Whisk flour into beef fat; cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens, about 3 minutes. Pour beef broth into fat mixture; increase heat to high and bring mixture to a boil. Boil mixture until it thickens slightly; season with salt and pepper to taste.
