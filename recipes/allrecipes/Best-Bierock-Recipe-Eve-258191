Cook and stir onion in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until tender, about 5 minutes. Add ground chuck; cook and stir until browned, about 8 minutes. Drain well. Season with monosodium glutamate, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to low; simmer, stirring often, until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Bring a lightly salted pot of water to a boil. Add cabbage; reduce heat to low. Simmer, covered, until cabbage is just tender, about 15 minutes. Drain well and let cool, 5 to 10 minutes. Fold into the ground chuck mixture. Place bread flour, milk, all-purpose flour, egg, sugar, butter, bread machine yeast, and salt in the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Run "Dough" cycle. Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Cut in half; roll each piece of dough to 1/3-inch thickness. Cut each piece into 5 smaller pieces. Place a large spoonful of ground chuck-cabbage mixture in the center of each piece of dough. Fold dough over and seal around filling. Arrange bierocks on greased baking sheets. Cover with a clean dish towel and place in a warm, dry place to rise for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake bierocks in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
