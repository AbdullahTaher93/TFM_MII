On a flat surface, place the flour, sugar, salt & butter to create a well. In a separate bowl place lukewarm water and yeast. Mix well together. Incorporate the water/yeast mixture into center of your well. Knead your dry and wet ingredients together until it takes the shape of a ball. Let the dough rest for approximately 2 hours. Divide your ball into 2 ounce sections. Roll out each 2 ounce section into a circular flat surface. Place Pepperoni, Mozzarella and Mushroom slices in the center. Fold over your dough, creating a half moon shape. Optional: brush with egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds and thyme. Bake for 8-10 minutes at 425 degrees. Cut into 3 strips and serve.
