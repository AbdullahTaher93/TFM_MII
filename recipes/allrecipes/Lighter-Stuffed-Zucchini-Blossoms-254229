Chop 2 zucchini blossoms finely. Transfer to a bowl. Stir tofu, feta cheese, olives, garlic, thyme, oregano, and seasoned salt into the bowl. Pour filling into a food processor; pulse until very crumbly. Increase speed blend until smooth and golden, about 3 minutes. Pipe filling into remaining 6 blossoms using a pastry bag or a resealable plastic bag with the corner snipped off. Twist blossom ends carefully to seal in filling. Arrange on a plate; transfer to the freezer. Mix whole wheat flour and egg substitute together in a bowl until batter is the consistency of pudding. Spread bread crumbs in a shallow dish. Dip a stuffed blossom in batter and roll in bread crumbs. Repeat with remaining blossoms. Spray a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray; heat over medium-high heat. Cook blossoms until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes.
