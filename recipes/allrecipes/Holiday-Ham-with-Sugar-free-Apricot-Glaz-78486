When heating your precooked ham, follow these guidelines from Hormel (www.hormel.com): To avoid drying out ham, heat it slowly in a 325 degrees F oven. Do not use sharp utensils that may pierce the ham, since piercing allows valuable juices to escape. Using a thermometer is the most accurate method for testing doneness. Do not let the thermometer touch a bone - it will result in an inaccurate reading. Remove the ham when it has reached a temperature that is 5 to 10 degrees lower than the recommended temperature for doneness. During the 10 to 15 minute resting period, the ham will continue cooking and will reach the proper temperature. Following this method will ensure that the meat will not be overcooked. (Overcooked pork tastes dry and tough.) Letting it stand will also make it easier to carve.
