Place rice and water in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 45 to 60 minutes. In a medium bowl, mix the sour cream, red wine vinegar, lime juice, honey, cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to use. Place bacon in a skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside. In a large bowl, mix the rice, dressing mixture, bacon, bell pepper, green onions, peas, almonds, and cilantro. Chill at least 1 hour before serving.
