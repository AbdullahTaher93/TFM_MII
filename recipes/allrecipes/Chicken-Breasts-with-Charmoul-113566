In a small frying pan, toast the 1 tablespoon paprika with the cumin over low heat, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Put in a blender and puree with the garlic, cilantro leaves, parsley, 6 tablespoons of the oil, the orange zest, lemon juice, cayenne, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Leave in the blender. Put 1 tablespoon oil in a nonstick frying pan over moderate heat. Season the chicken with 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon paprika, and 1/8 teaspoon black pepper. Brown 5 minutes. Turn; cook until just done, 4 to 5 minutes longer. Blend the sauce to re-emulsify; serve over the chicken. Sprinkle with the tomatoes and top with the cilantro sprigs.
