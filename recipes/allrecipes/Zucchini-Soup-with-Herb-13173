Heat the butter in a large saucepan. Add the zucchini, potatoes and onion. Cover and cook for 2 minutes on high heat, shaking pan occasionally to prevent sticking on bottom. Add chicken broth. Lower heat to medium low. Simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. Add the freshly chopped herbs and milk. Heat. Serve hot with a spoonful of sour cream on top of each serving.
