Stir the ketchup with teriyaki sauce, lime juice, sesame oil and brown sugar until well blended. Reserve. Place the salad greens in a large bowl. Separate the salmon into large chunks. Add salmon to the bowl along with the carrot, cucumber, coriander leaves and radish. Toss gently with enough dressing to coat the ingredients. Add more dressing to taste. Sprinkle with sesame seeds just before serving.
