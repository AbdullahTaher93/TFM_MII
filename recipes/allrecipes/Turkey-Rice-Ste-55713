In a 4- to 5-quart pan over high heat, combine the broth, onion, rice, carrot, and celery. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer broth mixture 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a bowl, mix turkey, bread crumbs, parsley, egg, thyme, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Increase heat under broth mixture to high and drop turkey mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, into the pan. Bring the soup to a boil again, reduce heat to low, cover pan, and simmer until meatballs are no longer pink in the center (cut to test) and rice is just tender to bite, 8 to 10 minutes longer. Add peas and stir until hot, about 2 minutes. Add salt to taste. Ladle into soup bowls.
