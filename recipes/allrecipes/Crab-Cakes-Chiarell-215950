Heat oven to 425 degrees F. In medium bowl, mix 1 1/2 cups bread crumbs, the mayonnaise, parsley, chives, lemon juice, mustard, pepper, pepper sauce and egg yolks. Using rubber spatula, gently fold in crabmeat, keeping pieces as large as possible. Shape mixture by 1/4 cupfuls into 18 patties, 2 1/2 inches in diameter. In medium bowl, mix remaining ingredients. Dip crab cakes into crumb mixture, coating both sides. Place in 2 ungreased 15x10-inch pans with sides. Bake both pans on separate oven racks 12 to 15 minutes, turning patties once after 6 minutes, until golden brown. Serve warm.
