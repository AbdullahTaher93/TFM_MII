In a large bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Using an electric mixer or a pastry cutter, cut in the butter until the mixture forms pea-size pieces. Press two-thirds of the crumb mixture into the bottom and 1 inch up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Core and peel the apples. Cut into thin slices, and place in a large bowl. Toss the apple slices with the remaining teaspoon cinnamon and the lemon juice. Arrange apples in the prepared pan; they will come up over the sides of the pan. Sprinkle the remaining crumb mixture over the apples. Place pan on an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet, and bake until cooked through and golden brown on top, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the pan, and let the cake cool in the pan to set. Serve, or refrigerate for 2 hours to set more firmly. Serve at room temperature.
