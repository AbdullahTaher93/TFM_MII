Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Prepare stuffing as directed on package, substituting apple juice for the water. Cut 1 of the apples into 1/2-inch chunks; stir into prepared stuffing. Spoon 1/4 cup of the stuffing mixture into pocket in each chop. Sprinkle chops with pepper; set aside. Spoon remaining stuffing into 13x9-inch baking dish. Heat large nonstick skillet on medium-high heat. Add half of the chops; cook 2 min. on each side or until browned on both sides. Remove chops from skillet, reserving drippings in skillet. Place chops over stuffing in baking dish. Repeat with remaining chops. Core remaining apple; cut crosswise into 12 rings. Place 2 apple rings over each chop. Brush evenly with 1 Tbsp. of the dressing. Bake 20 to 25 min. or until chops are cooked through (160F). Meanwhile, mix remaining 1/3 cup dressing, the sugar and mustard in same skillet; cook on medium-high heat 1 min. or until bubbly and thickened. Serve spooned over the apples and chops.
