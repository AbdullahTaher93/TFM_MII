Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place the parsnips into a mixing bowl and toss with the olive oil. Sprinkle in the garlic, honey, salt, and black pepper to taste. Toss until evenly coated, and spread out evenly onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the parsnips are tender, about 30 minutes. Scrape into a mixing bowl, and toss with the mint and sage.
