Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Generously grease a loaf pan with butter. Grind buckwheat and millet in a food processor until very fine. Add sunflower seeds, chia seeds, baking soda, and salt; pulse in the processor until incorporated. With the processor on, slowly pour buttermilk into buckwheat mixture until a thick dough forms. Stir prunes into dough, transfer dough to prepared loaf pan, and cover the loaf pan with parchment paper. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 390 degrees F (199 degrees C), remove parchment paper from the loaf pan, and continue baking until bread is crusty but still soft on the inside, about 45 minutes more.
