Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl combine soup, undrained tomatoes, and corn; set aside. Sprinkle one-third of tortilla strips over bottom of an ungreased 3-quart rectangular baking dish. Spread half of the Grilled & Ready(R) Fajita Chicken Strips over tortilla strips; spoon half of the soup mixture on top. Repeat layers, ending with a layer of tortilla strips. Bake, covered, 40 minutes or until bubbly around the edges. Uncover; sprinkle with cheese. Bake 5 minutes or until cheese is melted. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
