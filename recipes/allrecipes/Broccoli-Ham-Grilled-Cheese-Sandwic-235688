In a bowl, combine grated Cheddar Cheese, Parmesan Cheese, ham, steamed broccoli, onion powder, garlic powder, salt and black pepper. Layer mixture over one slice of bread, then top with additional slice of bread and gently pressing down. Heat a non-stick fry pan over medium low heat then drizzle 1/2 tablespoon olive oil into pan. Tilt the pan back and forth to evenly coat, then immediately place sandwich in pan and cover pan with lid. Cook 2-3 minutes until bottom becomes golden brown. Carefully lift sandwich out of pan with a spatula then add remaining 1/2 tablespoon olive oil to pan and tilt to coat. Carefully flip sandwich returning to pan, cover pan with lid, and cook opposite side until bottom is golden brown and cheese has melted about 2-3 minutes. Serve warm.
