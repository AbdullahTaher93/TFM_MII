Line a 9x9-inch baking pan with aluminum foil. Combine sweetened condensed milk and chocolate chips together in a microwave-safe bowl; melt in the microwave until smooth, 1 to 3 minutes. Stir until smooth. Pour mixture into the prepared pan. Refrigerate until set, at least 1 hour. Lift fudge out of pan by pulling up by the foil. Flip fudge onto a work surface and cut into 12 to 16 pieces.
