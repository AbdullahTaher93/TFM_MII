In a mixing bowl, beat all of the crust ingredients until well mixed. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Pat into an ungreased 9-in. pie pan. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Cool. Drain the raspberries, reserving syrup; set aside. Combine the sugar and cornstarch in a saucepan; add water and raspberry syrup. Simmer until thick, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and fold in berries. Pour into the crust. Chill for 2 hours or until firm. Garnish with whipped cream.
