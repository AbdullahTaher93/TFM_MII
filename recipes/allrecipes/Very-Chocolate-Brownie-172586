In a 2- to 3-quart pan, combine butter and 1 cup of the chocolate chips. Place over low heat, stirring occasionally, until butter is melted, 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, coat a 9- by 13-inch baking pan with cooking oil spray, then set it aside. Remove chocolate mixture from heat and stir until it is smooth. To chocolate mixture in pan, add condensed milk and vanilla; mix well. Add egg and beat until mixture is smooth. Stir in flour, then mix in walnuts and remaining chocolate chips just until combined. Spread mixture in prepared baking pan. Bake in a 350 degrees F oven until top feels firm when pressed lightly and a pick inserted in center comes out with a few moist crumbs, 20 to 25 minutes. Place pan on a rack and let stand until barely warm to touch, about 30 minutes. Cut into bars and serve warm or at room temperature.
