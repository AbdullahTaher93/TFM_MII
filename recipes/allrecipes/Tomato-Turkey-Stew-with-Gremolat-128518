To make the stew: Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the scallions, carrots, garlic, celery, and lemon peel. Cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes. Add the turkey and cook, stirring, for 10 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the tomatoes (with juice), wine, lemon juice, Italian herb seasoning, salt, and pepper. Bring to boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. Uncover and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the sauce thickens. To make the gremolata: In a small bowl, combine the parsley, lemon peel, garlic, and salt. Sprinkle over each serving of the turkey mixture.
