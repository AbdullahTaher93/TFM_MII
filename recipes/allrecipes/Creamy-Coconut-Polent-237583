Bring Silk and salt to a boil in a medium saucepan. Slowly stir in cornmeal. Return to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes until very thick, stirring often to prevent polenta from sticking to pan. Remove from heat and stir in cream cheese and margarine until fully incorporated. Spoon into a serving dish or press gently into a large oiled bowl, then turn over for molded polenta. Garnish with parsley, chives or other chopped herbs.
