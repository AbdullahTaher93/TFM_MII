Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place pizza crust on a baking sheet and spread tomatoes onto crust. Layer spinach, broccoli, yellow bell pepper, orange bell pepper, eggplant, pepperoni, and oregano onto crust; top with mozzarella cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 7 to 10 minutes.
