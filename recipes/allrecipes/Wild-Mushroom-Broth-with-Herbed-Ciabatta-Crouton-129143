Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large saucepan. Add the onion and fennel and cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until slightly soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and mushrooms. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, 5 minutes longer. Pour in the boiling water and stir in the bouillon cubes or powder. Bring back to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer the soup, uncovered, 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the broiler. Brush the slices of ciabatta bread lightly on both sides with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and toast them under the broiler until golden, about 1 minute on each side. Cut the bread into cubes and place in a bowl. Add the parsley and mint and toss well. Taste the soup and add seasoning, if necessary. Ladle the soup into bowls. Sprinkle with the parsley-and-mint croutons and serve at once.
