Put couscous, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add oil, and stir with fork to coat evenly. Bring 2 1/2 cups water to a boil; stir one-third into the couscous. Cover remaining water to keep it hot. Press couscous gently with the back of the fork. Cover with plastic wrap; let stand for 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining water in two additions. Break up any clumps with a fork or your fingers.
