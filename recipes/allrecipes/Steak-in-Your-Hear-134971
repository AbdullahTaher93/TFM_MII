Brush steaks with oil, then grill 4 to 6 minutes per side. Heat remaining oil in a skillet, add peppers, garlic, and snow peas, and saute. Put everything on a flameproof platter, douse with sherry, and light (see 'How to Light Your Fire,' below, for warming and torching instructions). Serve with brown rice.
