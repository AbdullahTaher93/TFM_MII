Preheat oven to 475 degrees F. Cut 4 sheets of foil into 12-inch squares. Spray the center of each with nonstick coating. Place one fish steak in center of each square. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon 2 tablespoons plum sauce over each piece of fish. Top with green onions and parsley leaves. Fold foil over fish to enclose it. Place folded side up on baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. Open packets carefully because steam will escape. Remove fish with a spatula and place on plates. Serve with additional plum sauce.
