For the Topping: In a small bowl, stir together the flour and brown sugar. Then use your fingers to rub the margarine into the flour mixture until crumbly. Stir in the pecans and set aside. For the Potato Casserole: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat a shallow 2-quart (2-L) casserole or an 8 X 8-inch (2-L) baking dish with butter-flavored nonstick spray and set aside. In a medium bowl, stir together the egg whites, egg, milk, brown sugar, margarine, vanilla, orange peel (if desired), and salt until well-combined. Then gently stir in the sweet potatoes. Transfer the potato mixture to the prepared casserole. Sprinkle with the topping mixture. Then generously coat the topping with the butter-flavored nonstick spray. Bake about 35 minutes or until heated through and golden on top.
