Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place chicken pieces in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour oil and stock over chicken and sprinkle with garlic. Season with oregano, salt and pepper and top with cheese. Bake in the preheated oven for about 45 to 60 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside. Pour vinegar over chicken and serve.
