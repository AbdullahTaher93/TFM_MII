For the marinade; in a small bowl combine the lemon juice, olive oil, garlic and tarragon. Place pork chops in plastic bag; pour marinade over chops; seal bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 6-8 hours or overnight. Drain chops, discarding marinade. Place chops on rack in broiler pan so the chops are 4-5 inches from heat. Sprinkle the chops with a little paprika. Broil for 5-6 minutes or until brown. Turn chops and sprinkle with paprika. Broil for 5-6 minutes more or until chops are just done to your liking (I suggest internal temperature of 150 degrees F for the slightest hint of pink, but no more than 160 degrees F of it will become too dry).
