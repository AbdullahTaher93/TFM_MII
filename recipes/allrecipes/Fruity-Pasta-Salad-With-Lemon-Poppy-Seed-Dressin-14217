Cook pasta in boiling water until al dente. Drain, and rinse in cold water until cool. In a salad bowl, combine macaroni, lettuce, pears, strawberries, and celery. Set aside. In a small bowl, stir together yogurt, orange juice, and poppy seeds. Add to the macaroni mixture, and gently toss until well coated.
