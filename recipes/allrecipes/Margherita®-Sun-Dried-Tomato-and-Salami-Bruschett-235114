Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Cut bread crosswise into 1/2-inch thick slices; arrange on a baking sheet. Combine oil and garlic; spoon over bread slices. Bake about 15 minutes or until bread is lightly toasted. Meanwhile, combine salami, sun dried tomatoes, cheese, olives and basil; mix well and set aside. (If mixture seems dry, add 1 teaspoon oil from bottled sun dried tomatoes). Just before serving, spoon salami mixture over toasts. Makes 12 servings (about 24 pieces).
