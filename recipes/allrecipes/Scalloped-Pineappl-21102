Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x10 inch casserole dish. In a medium bowl combine butter, sugar, pineapple, salt, pepper, cinnamon and nutmeg; mix well. Place bread cubes in the bottom of the casserole dish and pour pineapple mixture on top. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes or until golden brown and set throughout. If the top browns too fast, before the center is set, cover the dish with aluminum foil until it sets. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
