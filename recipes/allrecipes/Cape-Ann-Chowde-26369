Cook onions and thyme in butter until onions are soft. Whisk in flour all at once to form a paste, cook 1 to 2 minutes more. Whisk in clam mixture. Stir in potatoes, reduce heat and simmer 15 to 20 minutes, until potatoes are tender. (At this point the soup can be cooled and stored for later use, if desired.)
