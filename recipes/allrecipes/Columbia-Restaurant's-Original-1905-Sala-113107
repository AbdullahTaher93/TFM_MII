In a large bowl, toss together the lettuce, tomatoes, Swiss cheese, ham and olives. In a small bowl, whisk together the garlic, oregano and Worcestershire sauce. Gradually whisk in the olive oil, continually beating to form an emulsion. Stir in the vinegar and lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss well. Add the pecorino, toss and serve.
