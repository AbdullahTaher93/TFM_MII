Combine soy sauce, sugar, and sesame oil in a shallow dish to make the marinade. Add meat, and refrigerate for 4 hours. Place a large skillet over medium high heat, and cook meat until done. Pour the marinade into a medium saucepan, and place over medium high heat. Bring to a boil, and cook for 5 minutes. Add cooked meat, green onions, and wine to the boiling marinade. Transfer the entire contents of the saucepan to a large bowl, and serve hot.
