Cook manicotti shells according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a skillet, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain and set aside. In the same skillet, saute onions and garlic in butter until tender. Add mushrooms; heat through. Drain shells and set aside. Transfer mushroom mixture to a bowl; stir in the sausage, soup, sour cream and pepper. Stuff into manicotti shells. Place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. For sauce, in a saucepan, heat the milk, mushrooms and parsley. Remove from the heat; add 1-1/2 cups cheese, stirring until melted. Pour over stuffed shells. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes. Uncover; sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake 5-10 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.
