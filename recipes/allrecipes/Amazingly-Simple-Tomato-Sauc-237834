Heat olive oil in a large, heavy pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water with the onion mixture until smooth; add sugar, parsley, basil, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel, and pepper. Stir the mixture, bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened and the seasonings have permeated the sauce, 1 hour to 90 minutes.
