Cook the rice according to package directions, omitting salt and fat. While the rice is cooking, combine the water and curry paste in a medium bowl; add shrimp, tossing to coat. Place a large nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray over medium-high heat until hot. Add the shrimp mixture, and saute for 4 minutes. Add sliced asparagus and green onions; cover and cook for 3 minutes or until the asparagus is crisp-tender. Stir in salt and coconut milk. Cook for 3 minutes or until thoroughly heated, stirring occasionally. Serve over rice.
