Stir potato, parsley, tomato, chickpea flour, and egg together in a bowl until well-combined. Stir in cumin, garam masala, black pepper, and salt until batter is thick and evenly-mixed. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, drop batter by the heaping tablespoon into hot skillet and cook, turning once, until lightly browned on each side, about 6 minutes.
