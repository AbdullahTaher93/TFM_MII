Fill a saucepan with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the walnuts, and cook for 10 minutes. Drain the water from the walnuts, and stir in 1 cup of water and 1 cup sugar. Return to a boil, and cook 10 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Drain the walnuts and place on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper to dry, about 15 minutes. Remove the walnuts to a bowl and coat them with honey. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 325 degrees F (175 degrees C). Drain the walnuts of excess honey, and deep fry them until brown, about 5 minutes. Remove the walnuts from the oil with a slotted spoon, and set aside. Dry the shrimp well with paper towels. Whip egg whites in a medium bowl until foamy. Dip shrimp into the beaten egg whites, and then into the cracker crumbs, coating them well. Gently toss between your hands so any crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place the breaded shrimp onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack. Reheat the oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and fry the shrimp in the hot oil until golden brown, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan, and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Cover, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add the broccoli florets, recover, and steam until just tender, 2 to 6 minutes depending on thickness. Set the broccoli aside. Whisk together mayonnaise, 1/4 cup sugar, vanilla extract, lemon juice, and sweetened condensed milk in a large bowl until smooth. Add the candied walnuts, shrimp, and steamed broccoli florets, and stir lightly to combine. Serve with hot cooked rice.
