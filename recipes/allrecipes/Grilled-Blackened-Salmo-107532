Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Mix Cajun seasoning, thyme and basil on a plate. Dip each salmon fillet in butter and dredge in spice mix. Place salmon on hot grill; cook, turning once, until fish is blackened and easily flaked with a fork, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from grill, let rest for 5 minutes and serve.
