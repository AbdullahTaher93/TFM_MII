Season the salmon fillets on all sides with Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM), pressing the spices into the flesh. Brush salmon lightly with olive oil and set aside. Meanwhile, prepare the Mango Salsa. In a bowl, combine the mango, red onion, red pepper, green onions, orange juice, cilantro, olive oil and 1/2 teaspoon of Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM). Set aside. Preheat grill to medium-high. On a seasoned grill, grill the salmon for 6 to 8 minutes per side until lightly charred and just cooked through. Serve with Mango Salsa.
