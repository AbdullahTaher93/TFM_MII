Heat oven to 350 degrees F for shiny metal pans (or 325 degrees F for dark or nonstick pans). Place paper baking cup in each of 24 regular-size muffin cups. Make and bake cupcakes as directed on box, using water, oil and eggs. Cool 10 minutes; remove from pan. Cool completely, about 30 minutes. Frost cupcakes with vanilla frosting. Pipe designs on cupcakes with yellow and green icings. Decorate as desired with candy sprinkles. With toothpick, poke hole in side of each cupcake. Tie ribbon bow in center of each lollipop stick. Add gumdrop to one end of each stick. Insert other ends of sticks into sides of cupcakes, just below frosting, to form rattles.
