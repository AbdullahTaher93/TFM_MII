Grease a baking sheet. Combine sorghum flour, quinoa flour, cornstarch, tapioca flour, potato starch flour, baking soda, xanthan gum, salt, and yeast together in a bowl. Stir water, olive oil, cider vinegar, and honey together in a separate bowl until honey is dissolved; pour over flour mixture and mix until dough comes together in a ball. Place 1/4 cup dough between 2 sheets waxed paper or plastic wrap and roll until very thin using a rolling pin or tortilla press. Place on the prepared baking sheet and repeat with remaining dough; let rise for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes.
