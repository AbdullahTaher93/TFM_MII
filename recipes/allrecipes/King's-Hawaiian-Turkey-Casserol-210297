Place bread, turkey and cheese in a large bowl, blend with a large spoon gently. In another bowl, whisk eggs. Add flour to egg mixture and continue to whisk till blended. Then add mustard, melted butter, milk, salt and pepper. Whisk thoroughly. Pour milk mixture over the bread, turkey and cheese; stir gently to blend (be careful not to over-stir as the bread can become overly moist and break apart). Let stand for five to ten minutes for bread to absorb liquid. Pour into a buttered 2-quart baking dish. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Bake for 50 minutes (should be lightly golden and puffed). Test with a knife inserted into center - it should come out clean with little liquid on the knife. For a lighter dish, consider using low-fat mild Cheddar cheese and low-fat milk.
