In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugars, baking powder and salt. Set aside 1 tablespoon baby food for glaze. In another bowl, beat the egg, milk, oil, extract and remaining baby food. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in almonds and apricots. Pour into a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-65 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from the pan to a wire rack. For glaze, combine the confectioners' sugar, milk, extract and reserved baby food until smooth. Drizzle over cooled bread.
