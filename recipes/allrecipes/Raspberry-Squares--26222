Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt. Cut in the butter until the lumps are smaller than peas. Mix in the egg and milk to form a dough. Press into the bottom of a 9x13 inch pan. Spread a layer of jam over the crust. In a medium bowl, cream together the confectioners' sugar and remaining butter. Beat in the egg and vanilla then stir in the coconut. Spread evenly over the layer of jam. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until top is lightly browned. Cool before cutting into squares.
