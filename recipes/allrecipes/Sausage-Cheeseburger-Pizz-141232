Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Crumble and cook sausage in medium skillet until browned; drain well on paper towels. Place pizza dough on lightly greased 12 inch pizza pan or baking sheet. Spread mustard over dough; top with mozzarella cheese, sausage and onions. Place pickle slices evenly on top; sprinkle with cheddar cheese. Bake 12 minutes or until crust is cooked through and cheese is bubbly. Cut into thin wedges or squares and serve hot. Refrigerate leftovers.
