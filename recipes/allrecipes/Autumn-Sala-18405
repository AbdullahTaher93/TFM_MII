In a medium bowl, combine carrots, pecans, raisins and enough French dressing to moisten. Mix lightly and chill. Drain pears, reserving 2 tablespoons syrup. In a small bowl, combine reserved syrup, dates and softened cream cheese and mix until well blended. Fill each pear half with cream cheese mixture. Spoon the carrot mixture onto 6 salad plates covered with lettuce leaves and place one pear half on each plate.
