Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Put spinach into a microwave-safe bowl. Pour water over the spinach. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Cook in microwave oven on High, stirring occasionally, until the spinach is heated through, 9 to 11 minutes; transfer to a colander to drain, pressing to remove as much moisture from the spinach as possible. Melt 1/2 cup butter in a saucepan over medium heat; add spinach, cream cheese, water chestnuts, and garlic powder. Cook and stir until the cheese melts, 5 to 7 minutes. Spread artichoke hearts into the bottom of a baking dish. Spread spinach mixture over the artichoke hearts. Sprinkle bread crumbs over the spinach mixture. Dot top of casserole with butter pieces. Bake in preheated oven until heated through, 20 to 25 minutes.
