Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. If using fresh spinach, remove stems and chop coarsely. Rinse well and while still wet place in a large skillet on high heat. Stir occasionally for about 2 minutes or until wilted. Once it cools, drain off liquids and set spinach aside. If using frozen spinach, defrost according to directions on the package. Drain off any excess liquid and set aside. Butter the bottom and sides of a gratin dish or souffle dish. Using 1/3 cup of the Parmesan cheese, dust the pan so that the sides and bottom of the pan is coated with cheese. Separate the eggs. Set the whites aside. Beat the yolks with a whisk until very well beaten. Add the cream, salt and pepper and whisk again. Add the spinach, ham and 1/3 cup of the cheese. Stir. Beat the egg whites until firm yet still a little soft (not dry peaks). Gently fold (not stir) eggs whites into spinach mixture and slowly pour into baking dish. Sprinkle the remaining 1/3 cup of cheese on top. Bake at 375 degrees F, uncovered, for about 35 minute until the souffle is set and the top is brown and puffy. Turn off oven, open the door, but leave souffle in the oven for about 10-15 minutes. Serve immediately by spooning directly from the baking dish onto individuals plates.
