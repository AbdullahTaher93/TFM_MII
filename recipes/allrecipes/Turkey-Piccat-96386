In a shallow dish, mix wheat germ, bread crumbs and thyme. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Dip turkey slices in egg; dredge in wheat germ mixture until evenly coated. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons margarine. Add turkey and cook until it is no longer pink in center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove to serving plate and keep warm. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon margarine, lemon juice, parsley and capers until hot. Pour over turkey. Garnish with fresh thyme, sugar snap peas, almonds and carrot slices.
