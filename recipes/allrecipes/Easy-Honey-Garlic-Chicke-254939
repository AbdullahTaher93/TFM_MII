Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine orange juice, honey, Dijon mustard, garlic powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Add chicken; coat thoroughly. Place chicken, skin side down, in a baking pan. Reserve the honey mixture. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; remove from oven. Turn chicken skin side up; baste with honey mixture. Bake, basting once, until chicken is no longer pink and an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 30 minutes.
