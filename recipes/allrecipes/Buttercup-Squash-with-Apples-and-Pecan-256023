Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place buttercup squash halves in a baking dish. Place apples in a large bowl; cover with lemon juice. Stir in all but 1 tablespoon of the pecans, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Spoon apple mixture into the buttercup squash halves. Sprinkle remaining pecans on top. Dot 1 1 1/2 teaspoon butter over each squash. Bake in the preheated oven until squash is tender, about 45 minutes.
