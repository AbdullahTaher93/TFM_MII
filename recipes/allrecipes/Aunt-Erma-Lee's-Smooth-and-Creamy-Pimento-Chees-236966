Combine cheese food, pimento peppers, tarragon vinegar, mayonnaise, butter, and sugar in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over low-heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until the cheese and butter are melted completely, about 20 minutes. Pour mixture into sealable containers and refrigerate at least 4 hours before serving.
