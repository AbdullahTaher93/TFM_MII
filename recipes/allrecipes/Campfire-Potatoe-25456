Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. On a piece of heavy foil approximately 20x20 inches, place the potatoes and onion. Dot with butter. In a medium bowl, mix Cheddar cheese, parsley, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper. Sprinkle the mixture over the potatoes. Fold edges of foil. Cover potatoes with chicken broth. Seal foil tightly and place on the prepared grill. Cook 35 to 40 minutes, or until potatoes are tender.
