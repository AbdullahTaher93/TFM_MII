Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix oats, eggs, blueberries, applesauce, brown sugar, skim milk, flax seed meal, wheat germ, baking powder, cinnamon, vanilla, and salt together in a large bowl; pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until the moisture is absorbed and the oats are tender, 25 to 32 minutes.
