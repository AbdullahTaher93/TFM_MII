Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the turnip in a pot with enough cold, salted water to cover. Bring the water to a boil and cook until the turnips are soft, about 7 minutes; drain. Transfer the turnips to a shallow baking dish. Dot the top of the turnips with pieces of butter. Pour enough of the beer into the dish to cover the turnips. Season with savory and salt. Bake in the preheated oven until the beer is mostly cooked off and the turnip is tender, about 1 hour.
