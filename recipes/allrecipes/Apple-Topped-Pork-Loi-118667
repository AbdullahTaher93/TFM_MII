In a small bowl, combine the first seven ingredients; rub over roast. In a large skillet, heat oil; brown roast on all sides. Place on a rack in a shallow baking pan. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours. Combine the topping ingredients; spread over top of roast. Bake 1 to 1-1/2 hours longer or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
