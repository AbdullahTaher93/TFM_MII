Season the chops with salt and pepper and put them briefly on the grill to mark them on both sides. In the middle of four heavy-duty aluminum foil squares, place three apple slices and a few fennel slices, and top with the chops. Top each chop with three more apple slices and two more fennel slices. Wrap the foil around the chops to create a packet. Grill packets over moderate heat away from direct flame for 20 to 25 minutes (turning once) with the grill cover on, until internal temperature of the chops reaches 165 degrees F.
