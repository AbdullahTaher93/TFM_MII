In a 3- to 4-quart pan over high heat, bring rice and 3 cups water to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until rice is tender to bite, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a 14-inch wok or an 8- to 10-quart pan, set a rack over at least 1 inch boiling water. In a 9-inch pie pan or rimmed dish at least 1 inch smaller than the diameter of the wok or larger pan, combine beef broth, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, sherry, black beans, ginger, garlic, brown sugar, chile flakes, and pork. Turn the meat over in the seasonings. Cover pork pan with foil and set on rack in wok; cover wok. Steam over high heat until pork is no longer pink in center (cut to test), about 12 minutes. Carefully lift pie pan from wok (if necessary, slip a wide spatula under pan to lift, then grasp dish with pot holders). Keep pork warm. Add enough water to wok to make 1 inch deep and bring to a boil. Add bok choy, cover, and boil until just tender when pierced, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain. Serve pork, its seasonings, and bok choy atop cooked rice. Add soy sauce to taste.
