Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Slice off the top 1/4-inch of the Brie wheel; set aside. Hollow out the center of the cheese, leaving a 1-inch shell all around. Place in an ovenproof serving container slightly larger than cheese. Save left over cheese for another use. Break up cranberry sauce with a fork and place in center of cheese. Cover with top of cheese. Spoon apricot preserves over top; sprinkle with almonds. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until soft and slightly melted. Serve with crackers.
