Place bacon in a large skillet or Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in carrot, onion, and olive oil cooking until tender, about 5 minutes. Cover bacon mixture with chicken broth, water, and salsa; mix in lentils, bay leaf, cumin, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until lentils are tender, 40 to 50 minutes. Stir in spinach and potatoes; simmer until spinach is wilted and potatoes are cooked, 10 to 15 minutes longer.
