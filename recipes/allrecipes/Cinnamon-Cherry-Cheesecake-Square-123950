Combine all crust ingredients and press into the bottom of a 12-in. x 7-1/2-in. x 2-in. baking pan. For filling, beat cream cheese and sugar in a mixing bowl. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla. Pour into crust; bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, for topping, combine the sour cream, sugar and vanilla. Spread over pie and bake an additional 5 minutes. Cool to room temperature; chill at least 4 hours. Cut into squares and top each serving with a spoonful of cherry filling.
