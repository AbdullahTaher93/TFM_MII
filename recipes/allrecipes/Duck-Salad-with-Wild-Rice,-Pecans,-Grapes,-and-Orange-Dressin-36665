Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Place a large nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray over medium-high heat until hot. Add duck; cook 2 minutes on each side or until lightly browned. Place duck in an 11 x 7-inch baking dish coated with cooking spray. Bake at 450 degrees for 20 minutes or until done. Let cool. Cut into 1/4-inch-wide strips. Combine duck, rice, green onions, grape halves, and pecans in a large bowl. Toss well; set aside. Combine orange rind and next 4 ingredients (orange rind through pepper) in a small bowl; stir well. Pour over duck mixture; toss well. Serve salad on 7 lettuce-lined plates. Serve at room temperature.
