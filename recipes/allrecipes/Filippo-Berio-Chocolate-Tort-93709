Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 10-inch round springform pan with oil. Put the chocolate in a small microwaveable bowl. Microwave for 2 minutes. Stir. If lumps remain, microwave for about 20 seconds. Stir and set aside. On a sheet of waxed paper, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir to mix; set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the oil and sugar until combined. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Add the melted chocolate and the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low. Add the reserved dry ingredients. Mix just to incorporate. Spoon into the prepared pan. Spread evenly. Bake for about 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove to a rack to cool. Remove the outer ring of the pan. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar just before serving.
