In a small bowl, combine the lemon zest, sugar, salt, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and dill. Place fillets in a shallow, nonreactive container. Cover with lemon-dill marinade, and refrigerate 3 hours. Remove fish from container; set marinade aside. Heat a large saute pan coated with olive oil. Saute fillets until golden and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from heat; transfer fillets to a platter. Cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Turn heat to high; add reserved marinade. When it bubbles and browns, add remaining lemon juice. Cook 1 minute. Reduce heat to low. Add butter, swirling pan to melt. Remove pan from heat. Pour sauce over fillets, and serve.
