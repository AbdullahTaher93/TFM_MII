Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Whisk pineapple juice, brown sugar, and dry mustard in a bowl until brown sugar has dissolved. Place ham in a baking dish with cut side down and arrange pineapple rings and maraschino cherries onto the ham; secure with toothpicks if needed. Push cloves into ham and baste ham and fruit with pineapple juice glaze. Bake in the preheated oven until glaze has baked onto ham, 1 1/2 to 2 hours; baste with glaze every 30 minutes. Turn on oven's broiler. Broil ham until the glaze forms a crust and the pineapple slices are browned, about 5 minutes.
