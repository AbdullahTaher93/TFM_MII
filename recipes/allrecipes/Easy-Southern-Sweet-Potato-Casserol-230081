Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Toss sweet potatoes with brown sugar in a bowl until coated; arrange in the prepared casserole dish. Top sweet potatoes with marshmallows. Bake in the preheated oven until sweet potatoes are tender and marshmallows are browned, 35 minutes.
