Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Beat eggs with milk, vanilla and cinnamon in shallow bowl until well blended. Dip bread slices into egg mixture, then dip into cereal, turning to evenly coat both sides of bread. Gently press cereal into bread to secure. Place on lightly greased baking sheet. Bake 20 minutes or until golden brown. Cut each slice into four strips to serve.
