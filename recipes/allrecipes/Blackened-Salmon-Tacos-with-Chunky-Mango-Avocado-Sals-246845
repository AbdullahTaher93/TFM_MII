Combine mangoes, avocado, orange bell pepper, and jalapeno in a large bowl to make salsa. Add lime juice, cilantro, and salt; mix to combine. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Sprinkle seafood rub, chili powder, salt, and black pepper over 1 side of each salmon steak; rub in with your fingers until evenly distributed. Coat the bottom of a large skillet with olive oil and heat over medium-high heat. Add salmon skin-side down and cook until skin is crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip salmon and carefully peel off skin. Season top with seafood rub, chili powder, salt and black pepper. Continue cooking until lightly browned on the second side and salmon flakes easily with a fork, 4 to 5 minutes. Slice each salmon fillet lengthwise to create 6 pieces. Lightly oil another skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry corn tortillas, one at a time, until heated through and pliable, about 30 seconds per side. Place 1 piece of salmon on each tortilla. Top with salsa. Squeeze a wedge of lime on top.
