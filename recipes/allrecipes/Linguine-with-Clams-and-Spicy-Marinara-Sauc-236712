Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Saute garlic in olive oil for 1-2 minutes or until slightly yellow in color. Add wine and clams. Cover and cook over high heat until clams are opened. Discard any unopened clams. Let cool and discard the clam shells leaving the meat. Filter clam juice by draining through a cheesecloth, reserving juice. Return clams and juice to skillet. Add Spicy Marinara Sauce and simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes. Cook Linguine for 4 minutes. Drain reserving 2-3 cup of pasta cooking water. Add linguine to clam sauce and continue cooking pasta in sauce, adding additional reserved pasta cooking water until desired thickness. Top with chopped parsley and drizzle with additional olive oil if desired
