In a large saucepan coated with nonstick cooking spray, cook celery and mushrooms in butter until tender. Stir in rice; cook 1 minute longer. Stir in the contents of the rice seasoning packet, broth and water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5-6 minutes or until rice is tender. Stir in the water chestnuts, cranberries, onions and soy sauce. Stuff into hens. Place on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake at 375 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until juices run clear and a meat thermometer inserted into stuffing reads 165 degrees F. Cut each hen in half lengthwise to serve.
