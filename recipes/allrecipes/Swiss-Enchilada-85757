Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a bowl, mix together chicken, chilies, and salsa. In a wide, shallow dish stir together salt and whipping cream. Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Fry each tortilla for a few seconds, until it blisters, and immediately dip into cream and salt. Fill fried tortillas with chicken mixture. Roll and place flap side down in a baking dish. Pour remaining cream over tortillas, and sprinkle with cheese. Bake, uncovered, in a preheated oven until cheese has melted, about 15 to 20 minutes.
