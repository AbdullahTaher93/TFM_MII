Place potatoes in medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a gentle boil, and cook 15 minutes or until tender. Drain and return to pan. Briefly mash potatoes until broken up. Fold in half-and-half, sour cream, butter, salt, and enough milk to reach desired consistency.
