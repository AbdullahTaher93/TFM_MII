Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the chicken wings in a roasting pan. Season with salt. In a medium bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, peach chutney, onion soup mix and hot water. Pour this over the chicken wings. Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is brown and sticky, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.
