Remove silk from the top of the ears of corn and trim so that there is an even layer of husk around the ears. Tie the husk in 1 or 2 places. Soak in a large bowl of water for 2 to 3 hours. Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Cook corn in the husk, turning every 10 minutes, until husks look blackened, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool corn until easily handled, about 5 minutes. Pull off husks and any remaining husks. Cut kernels from the ears of corn and place in a bowl. Scrape any pulp remaining on the cobs into a blender. Add shallot, liquid egg substitute, 3 tablespoons half-and-half, cornmeal, flour, salt, baking powder, and cayenne pepper; blend until smooth. Thin batter with remaining 1 tablespoon half-and-half if needed. Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Drop 6 tablespoonfuls of batter into the hot oil; cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer fritters to an ovenproof plate lined with paper towels and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with remaining batter.
