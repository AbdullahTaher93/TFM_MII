Prepare frozen puff pastry cups according to package directions. While pastry cups are baking, lightly brown sausage slices in a large skillet over medium heat. Fill baked pastry cups as follows: about 2 teaspoons shredded Swiss cheese, one slice sausage, 1 1/2 teaspoons sauerkraut, and top with a bit of Dijon mustard. Adjust amounts according to your taste.
