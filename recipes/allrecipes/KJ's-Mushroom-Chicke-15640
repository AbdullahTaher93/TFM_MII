In large skillet melt butter or margarine. Season chicken with salt and pepper to taste. Add chicken to skillet and brown on both sides. Remove from platter and keep warm in oven. Reduce heat under skillet to medium low. Add flour to pan drippings, stirring constantly for 2 minutes to form a roux that is golden brown. Stir in broth gradually; continue to stir until thickened. Stir in the lemon juice, mushrooms, artichoke hearts with liquid, and Worcestershire sauce. Let simmer for several minutes. Return chicken to skillet. Cover and simmer for another 20 minutes, spooning the sauce over the chicken occasionally.
