Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place pizza crust on a baking sheet or pizza pan. Spread tzatziki sauce over crust and top with beef, cucumber, olives, feta cheese, and mozzarella cheese, respectively. Brush egg yolk over exposed pizza crust. Bake in the preheated oven until cheeses are melted and crust is shiny golden brown, about 15 minutes.
