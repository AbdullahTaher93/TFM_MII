Heat the broiler to medium. Place the sausages under the broiler and cook, turning regularly, until evenly brown all over and cooked through, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the potatoes and parsnip in a saucepan of boiling water until tender, about 15 minutes. At the same time, put the tomatoes with their juice, the kidney or pinto beans, chutney or relish, and paprika in a saucepan and heat slowly until bubbling. Remove the sausages from the broiler (leave the broiler on). Leave to cool slightly, then cut each one diagonally into 4 thick slices. Add them to the tomato and bean mixture; pour into a baking dish. Drain the potatoes and parsnip, and mash with the milk and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon the mashed potato mixture evenly over the top. Brown under the broiler until golden and crisp, about 5 minutes. Serve hot.
