Place the pecan pieces in a skillet over medium heat, and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly toasted. In a large bowl, mix the pecans, cabbage, 8 fresh peaches, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, green onions, and celery seed. Cover and chill 45 minutes in the refrigerator. In a blender or food processor, blend the 1/2 cup chopped peaches until smooth. Transfer to a bowl, and mix with the oil, honey, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Chill until slaw is ready to be served, then toss with slaw to coat. Garnish slaw with mint sprigs.
