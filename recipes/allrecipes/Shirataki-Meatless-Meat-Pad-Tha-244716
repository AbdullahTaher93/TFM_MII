Place shirataki noodles in a bowl of hot water; set aside. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir tofu until lightly browned and cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer tofu to a plate, keeping skillet over heat. Whisk soy sauce lemon juice, sugar, peanut butter, and sriracha sauce together in a small microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until peanut sauce is melted and smooth, about 20 seconds. Stir well. Cook and stir eggs in the hot skillet until cooked through and scrambled, about 5 minutes. Mix mushrooms and tofu into eggs; add 1/2 of the peanut sauce and mix well. Drain shirataki noodles and add to egg mixture; pour in the remaining peanut sauce. Sprinkle 1/4 cup cashews into tofu-noodle mixture and mix well. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce thickens, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer tofu-noodle mixture to a serving bowl and top with remaining cashews, bean sprouts, and lime wedges.
