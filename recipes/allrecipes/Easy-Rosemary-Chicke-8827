Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine the soup, sour cream and rosemary. Mix well. Place chicken pieces in a 9x13 inch baking dish, in a single layer. Pour rosemary mixture over chicken and bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Let cool 10 minutes and serve.
