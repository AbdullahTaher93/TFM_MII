In small bowl, whisk together Sesame Ginger Marinade and 1 tablespoon pineapple juice; reserve 1/4 cup. In large Ziploc(R) bag, combine steak and 1/2 cup marinade mixture. Marinate in refrigerator for 1 hour, turning several times. Remove beef from bag, discarding used marinade. On skewers, alternate steak with vegetables and pineapple chunks until all are used. Place kabobs on grill, about 4 inches from heat source. Cook to desired doneness, turning and brushing with reserved marinade mixture.
