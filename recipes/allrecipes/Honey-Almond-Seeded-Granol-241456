Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Mix oats, pumpkin seeds, sunflower kernels, sliced almonds, flaked coconut, and sea salt together in a large mixing bowl. Beat coconut oil, honey, maple syrup, and vanilla extract with a whisk until smooth; pour over the dry ingredients and mix to coat. Spread the granola onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes. Use a spatula to stir the granola, rotate sheets in the oven, and continue baking until golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Let granola cool on the pans to room temperature.
