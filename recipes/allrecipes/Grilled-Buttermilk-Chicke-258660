Whisk buttermilk, hot sauce, salt, red pepper flakes, Italian seasoning, pepper, and sugar in a bowl until salt is dissolved. Place chicken in a large stockpot. Add buttermilk mixture and toss until each chicken thigh is evenly coated. Place chicken in resealable bags; squeeze the air out. Marinate in the refrigerator, 2 hours to overnight. Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill chicken, turning occasionally, until grill marks form, about 5 minutes per side.
