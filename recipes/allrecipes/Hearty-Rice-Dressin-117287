In several large Dutch ovens or stockpots, cook the beef, pork and onions over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the celery, green pepper and pimientos. Combine water and soups; stir in the Creole seasoning, salt, pepper and cayenne. Stir into meat mixture; bring to a boil. Stir in the rice. Carefully transfer mixture to three greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dishes. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes; stir. Cover and bake 30-40 minutes longer or until rice is tender.
