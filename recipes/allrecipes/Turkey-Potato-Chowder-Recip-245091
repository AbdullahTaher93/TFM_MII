Combine potatoes, mixed vegetables, onions, celery, parsley and Swanson(R) Chicken Broth in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat; reduce heat, cover, and simmer gently until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in turkey and poultry seasoning. Whisk flour and the half-and-half together until smooth. Stir mixture slowly into the saucepan. Stir until slightly thickened, or until mixture reaches a chowder-like consistency. Add sriracha sauce, salt, and pepper, mixing well. Ladle into soup bowls; garnish with crumbled bacon.
