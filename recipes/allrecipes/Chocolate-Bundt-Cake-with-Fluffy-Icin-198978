For the cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 10-cup non-stick Bundt pan or tube pan with non-stick cooking spray. Sift flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a large bowl. Stir to combine. In another large bowl, whisk together egg, egg whites, buttermilk, and margarine. One at a time, add SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend, applesauce, corn syrup, and vanilla, whisking well after each addition. Scatter dry ingredients over top and gently stir in with rubber spatula (batter will be wet). Scrape batter into prepared pan. Bake 40 to 50 minutes, or until a tester inserted in center of cake comes out clean. Cool in pan 5 minutes, then remove to wire rack and cool completely. For the icing: In the heatproof bowl of an electric mixer, briefly whisk together egg whites, SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, water, vanilla, and salt. Set bowl over saucepan of gently simmering water and whisk gently until mixture reaches 140 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove from saucepan and, using the mixer, whip heated icing on medium speed about 2 minutes, or until icing increases in volume and cools. Transfer cake to a platter and spread icing all over it, swirling icing in a decorative pattern.
