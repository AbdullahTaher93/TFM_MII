Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Slice the squash in half lengthwise. Scoop out and discard the seeds. Place face down in a baking dish, add the water and bake for 30-35 minutes at 375 degrees F. Let cool for 5 minutes or more. (This can also be cooked in the microwave. Zap for 5 minutes, rotate and zap for another 5 minutes. Depending on your microwave in may need another 5 minutes or so.) With a fork, carefully scrape out the insides lengthwise to maintain long strands. They should come out easily, if not it is under-cooked. Place strands in a bowl and add about 1/2 of the dressing (slightly heated, 1 minute in the microwave). Toss. Taste and add more dressing as desired.
