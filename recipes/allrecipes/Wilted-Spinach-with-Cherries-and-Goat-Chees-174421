Heat olive oil in a large skillet over very low heat. Add garlic, onion, cherries, and mushrooms; cook and stir, without browning garlic, until onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Toss in spinach, and cook and stir until spinach is just wilted, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Top with crumbled goat cheese just before serving.
