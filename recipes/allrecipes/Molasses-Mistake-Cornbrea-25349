Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8 inch baking pan. In a large bowl, stir together cornmeal, flour, baking powder and salt. In a separate bowl, stir together egg, milk and molasses. Stir egg mixture into flour mixture; mix until blended. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into center of pan comes out clean.
