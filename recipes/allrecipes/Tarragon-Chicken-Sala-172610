In a 5- to 6-quart pan, bring about 3 quarts water to a boil. Add chicken; return water to a boil. Cover tightly and remove from heat; let stand until chicken is white in thickest part (cut to test), 10 to 12 minutes. Lift out and cool. Tear chicken into shreds. Meanwhile, make dressing: In a separate bowl, mix together tarragon, lemon juice, olive oil, and garlic until well blended. Mix shredded chicken with celery, olives, and tarragon dressing. Add salt and pepper to taste. Spoon onto lettuce-lined platter or plates.
