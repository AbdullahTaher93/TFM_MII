Mix the sugars, flour, and milk. Pour into crust. ( Grandma always mixed the ingredients directly in the unbaked pie crust, but I have better luck mixing it with a mixer and transferring it to the crust. ) Dot with butter and sprinkle with nutmeg to look pretty. Bake 300 - 325 degrees F (150 - 165 degrees C) for 1 hour.
