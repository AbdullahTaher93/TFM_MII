Heat butter and 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; stir in shallots. Cook and stir until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let cool, 20 to 25 minutes. Combine pears, 1 teaspoon olive oil, thyme, salt, and pepper with the shallots; stir until evenly mixed. Cover and refrigerate shallot mixture for about 2 hours. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Slice baguette into rounds. Rub with garlic and brush with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Place on a baking sheet. Toast in the preheated oven until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Top baguette rounds with shallot mixture and Parmesan cheese. Turn oven's broiler on. Return crostini to oven and broil until golden and bubbly, 1 to 2 minutes.
