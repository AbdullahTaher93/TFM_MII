Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain. Mash the potatoes with a potato masher; mash in butter and cream cheese. Stir in milk, bacon bits, Colby-Jack cheese, and steak seasoning. Season to taste with salt.
