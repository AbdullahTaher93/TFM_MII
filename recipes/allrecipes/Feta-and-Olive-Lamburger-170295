Combine the lamb, feta cheese, egg, and olives in a mixing bowl. Season with cumin and black pepper, and mix until well combined. Form the mixture into 4 patties, and place onto waxed paper. Refrigerate for 15 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil grate. Cook the lamburgers on the preheated grill to your desired degree of doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium. Serve on toasted buns with the condiments of your choice.
