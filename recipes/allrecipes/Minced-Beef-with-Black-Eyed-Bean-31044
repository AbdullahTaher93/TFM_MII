Heat oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, and saute until light golden, then throw in the garlic, and cook for 1 minute. Put in 1/4 cup of the water and tomato, then season with salt, red chili powder, cumin, and turmeric. Simmer for 1 minute. Add beef and cook for at least 10 minutes, adding another 1/4 cup of the water when it gets dry. When the beef mixture is dry, pour in the black-eyed peas. Cook for 3 minutes. Stir in the remaining 1/4 cup of water, and reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer until all of the water has cooked down, and you can see the oil. Remove from the heat and mix in the garam masala. Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle the lemon juice, cilantro, and green chilies over the top.
