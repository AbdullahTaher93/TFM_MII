Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners or coat with cooking spray. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, ginger, cinnamon, salt, baking powder, nutmeg, cloves, and baking soda. Stir well. In a small bowl, combine the egg, molasses, maple syrup or honey, applesauce, and oil. Pour the liquid mixture into the dry mixture, stirring just enough to incorporate the ingredients. Be careful not to overmix. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin. Bake for 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out with moist crumbs. Remove from the tin and cool on a wire rack.
