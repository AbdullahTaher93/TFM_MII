Spray a cereal bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Crack the eggs into the bowl, add the salsa, and stir. Microwave on high for 1 minute, stir, and cook for another minute or until the mixture firms up. Place the cheese in the center of the tortilla and top it with the egg mixture. Wrap it all up like a burrito and head for the car.
