Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8x4 inch loaf pans, or line with parchment paper. Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a bowl, and set aside. In a large bowl, mix together the sugar and shortening. Beat in the eggs and vanilla. Toss the walnuts and dates with the dry ingredients, and stir into the sugar mixture alternately with the hot coffee. Divide the batter evenly between the two loaf pans. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
