Cook ground turkey, onion and garlic over medium heat in a large skillet until meat is brown and onion is tender; drain off fat. Stir in undrained canned tomatoes, lentils, cumin and ground chipotle pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. To serve, spoon about 1/4 cup meat mixture into each taco shell. Top with sour cream, romaine, cheese, avocado and/or radishes.
