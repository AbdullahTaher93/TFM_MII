In a covered 5- to 6-quart nonstick pan over high heat, bring 3 quarts water to a boil. Meanwhile, rinse chicken and pat dry. Thinly slice chicken crosswise into 1/4-inch strips; set aside. Stir fettuccine into boiling water; cook, uncovered, until pasta is barely tender to bite, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain pasta, rinse with hot water, then drain again and set aside. Rinse pan and set over medium-high heat. Stir in 1/2 cup coconut milk, peanut sauce, and curry powder. Add chicken; stir until no longer pink in center (cut to test), 3 to 4 minutes. Add remaining coconut milk, 1/2 cup water, 2 tablespoons fish sauce, sugar, and vinegar; mix. Add fettuccine to pan; mix until noodles are hot throughout, about 4 minutes. Add more fish sauce, if desired, and the basil leaves. Mix gently, then serve.
