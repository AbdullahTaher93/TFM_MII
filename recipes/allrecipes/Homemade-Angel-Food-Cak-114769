Sift flour and confectioners' sugar together twice; set aside. In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites, cream of tartar and salt on medium speed until soft peaks form. Add vanilla. Gradually beat in sugar, about 2 tablespoons at a time, until stiff peaks form, scraping bowl occasionally. Gradually fold in flour mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time. Pour into an ungreased 10-in. tube pan. Bake at 325 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until lightly browned and entire top appears dry. Immediately invert cake pan onto a wire rack; cool completely, about 1 hour. For frosting, melt the candy bar in a microwave or double boiler; cool for 5 minutes. In a mixing bowl, beat cream and sugar until stiff peaks form; stir in vanilla. Fold in melted chocolate. Run a knife around sides of cake and remove to a serving plate; frost top and sides. Garnish with chocolate shavings if desired. Store in the refrigerator.
