In a large bowl, stir the cider vinegar and sugars until sugars are dissolved. Add cabbage; toss to coat. Let stand for 5-10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon, reserving drippings. In the drippings, saute apple and onion until tender. Add water and cabbage mixture. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 30-35 minutes. Stir in the remaining ingredients. Simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until tender. Sprinkle with reserved bacon just before serving.
