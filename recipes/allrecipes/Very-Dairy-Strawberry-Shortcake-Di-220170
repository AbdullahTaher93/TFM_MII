Beat heavy cream in a large bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Cream together cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, milk, and 1 1/2 teaspoon strawberry jam in a separate large bowl. Fold whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk together flour, baking powder, white sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Cut in shortening with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Beat together egg yolk and buttermilk in a small bowl, then stir into the flour mixture until moistened. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for five or six turns. Pat or roll the dough out into a 1/2 inch thick round. Cut dough out with a 1-inch biscuit cutter and place on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool on the sheet for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. Cut the cooled biscuits in half . Skewer half a biscuit on a toothpick, followed by a strawberry slice and another biscuit half. Swirl 1 tablespoon strawberry jam decoratively into the chilled dip and serve with the strawberry shortcake skewers.
