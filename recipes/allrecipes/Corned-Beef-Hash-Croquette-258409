Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onions, yellow, red, and orange bell peppers, and 1/2 of chopped ham until onions are soft, 5 or 6 minutes. Add corned beef hash and garlic. Cook and stir until ingredients begin to brown, 3 or 4 more minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in the remaining ham, 1 beaten egg, green onions, and the cheese. Mix well. Place flour, remaining 2 beaten eggs, and panko crumbs in 3 separate shallow dishes. Shape croquettes into small ovals or rounds about the size of a golf ball. Roll croquettes in flour, then eggs, then panko crumbs. Place on a rack. Gently lower the croquettes into hot oil. Do not crowd them; you can cook in batches. Fry until nicely browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
