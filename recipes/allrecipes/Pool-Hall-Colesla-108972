In a large stock pot, combine the vinegar, mustard, white sugar and brown sugar. Season with turmeric, salt, black pepper and red pepper flakes. Stir to dissolve sugar and bring to a boil. Once it is boiling, add the cabbage, carrots, peppers and onions. Return to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring frequently.
