Saute the onions in butter or margarine in a large pan. Add the chicken broth and the cubed potatoes. Slice the smoked sausage into bite size pieces, and add to the soup. Simmer over medium heat until the potatoes are soft. Using a potato masher, lightly mash the potato mixture to break up the cubes a little bit, but not mashing as completely as you would for mashed potatoes. Add the cubed cheese, and stir until melted. Stir in the evaporated milk. Season with black pepper. The soup should be pretty thick, but you can thicken it further with a paste of cornstarch and water. Use about 1 tablespoon of cornstarch at a time, and add it to the soup until you have reached the desired thickness.
