Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Brush fish with olive oil. Mix bread crumbs, seafood seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, lemon zest, and thyme together in a bowl. Press fish in bread crumb mixture to coat all sides. Arrange coated fish on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip fish and continue baking until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes more. Stir butter, lemon juice, white wine, and basil together in a bowl; drizzle over cooked fish.
