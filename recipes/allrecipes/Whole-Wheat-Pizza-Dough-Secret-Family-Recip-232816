Stir yeast and sugar into warm water in a large bowl; set aside until liquid starts to bubble and foam, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix in oil. Add flour and salt, stirring until dough is smooth; stir in more flour as needed. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes and place in a large bowl; cover bowl with a damp towel. Allow dough to rise for 20 to 30 minutes. Place dough on a pizza stone and roll out with a rolling pin.
