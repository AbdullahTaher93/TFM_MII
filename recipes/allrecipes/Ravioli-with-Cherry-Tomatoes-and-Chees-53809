In a large bowl, toss together the cherry tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, basil, olive oil, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper. Let stand about 1 hour. Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil, and cook the ravioli about 5 minutes, until tender and heated through. Drain, and toss with the cherry tomato mixture to serve.
