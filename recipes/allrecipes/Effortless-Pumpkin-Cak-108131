Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9 inch baking pan. In a large bowl, combine pumpkin, milk, egg whites, SPLENDA(R) and pumpkin pie spice. Mix well, and pour into a 9x9 inch pan. Sprinkle dry cake mix over the top, then drizzle with melted margarine. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
