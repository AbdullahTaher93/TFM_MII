Mix mozzarella cheese and Parmesan-Reggiano cheese together in a bowl until smooth. Stuff 1 tablespoon cheese mixture into each zucchini blossom and pinch the ends closed. Mix rice flour, eggs, milk, sparkling water, sweet rice flour, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Place stuffed blossoms in flour mixture; toss gently until covered. Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Fry blossoms in oil until crisp and pale golden brown, about 2 minutes. Rest blossoms on paper towels to absorb excess oil.
