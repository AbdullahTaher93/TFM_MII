If using wooden skewers, soak in cold water for at least 30 minutes before using. In a large bowl, mix honey mustard, olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper. Add pork and mix to coat. Cover and let stand at room temperature at least 30 minutes (chill if longer). While the pork marinates, pit nectarines, and slice each into 6 wedges. Prepare a charcoal or gas grill for direct, medium-high heat (the charcoal or gas flame should be directly under the cooking area, and you can hold your hand just above grill level only 3 to 4 seconds; see www.safeway.com for complete instructions). While grill heats, thread cubes of pork and nectarine wedges onto skewers, alternating between meat and fruit. Discard any remaining marinade. Lay skewers on grill (close lid if using gas) and cook, turning occasionally, until pork is browned on all sides and almost no longer pink in the center (cut to test), about 10 minutes. Brush kebabs generously with honey and cook until pork is golden brown, about 1 minute longer.
