Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a medium saucepan over medium heat, slowly cook and stir minced clams in the lemon juice until heated and tender, abou 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Transfer clams to a medium baking dish. Mix in seasoned bread crumbs, onion, parsley, oregano, black pepper, garlic powder, margarine and approximately 3/4 of the reserved clam juice. Top with grated Parmesan cheese and paprika. Bake clam mixture in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until lightly browned.
