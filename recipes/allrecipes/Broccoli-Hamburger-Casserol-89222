Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare the broccoli according to package directions. In a skillet over medium heat, mix the ground beef, mushrooms, and onion. Cook until beef is evenly brown; drain grease. Season with salt and pepper, and mix in cream of celery soup and sour cream. Continue cooking until heated through. Transfer to a medium baking dish, and evenly layer with broccoli. Top with cheese. Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, until bubbly and lightly brown.
