Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix together the tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, parsley, basil, oregano, and salt and pepper in a bowl, working the seasonings into the cavities of the tomatoes. Place the tomatoes, cut sides up, on a baking sheet, and sprinkle each tomato with about 1 tablespoon of feta cheese. Bake the tomatoes in the preheated oven until cooked but still firm, about 15 minutes.
