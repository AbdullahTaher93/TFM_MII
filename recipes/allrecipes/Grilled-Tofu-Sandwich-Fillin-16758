Preheat your oven to broil. Cut the tofu cake into 4 pieces. Slice each piece very thinly, then lay the tofu strips on a paper towel and blot them dry to remove excess moisture. Place the dry strips in a bowl and cover them with the honey mustard sauce. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, stirring occasionally. Broil for 5 minutes, then flip the tofu and broil for another 5 minutes, or until the tofu is hot.
