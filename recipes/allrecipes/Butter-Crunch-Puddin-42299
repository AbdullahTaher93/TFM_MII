In a bowl, combine flour, coconut and sugar; cut in butter until crumbly. Spread in a 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake at 375 degrees for 15 minutes, stirring once. Cool slightly. Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, beat milk and pudding mix for 1 minute or until slightly thickened; chill 5 minutes. Spoon half of crumbs into four bowls. Top with pudding and rest of crumbs.
