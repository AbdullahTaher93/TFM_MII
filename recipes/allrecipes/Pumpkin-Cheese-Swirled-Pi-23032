Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Gradually mix in 1/4 cup light corn syrup and vanilla extract, blending until smooth. In a medium bowl, mix the pumpkin, eggs, evaporated milk, 1/4 cup light corn syrup, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger and salt. Beat the mixture until smooth. Place pie crust on a medium baking sheet and fill with the pumpkin mixture. Drop the cream cheese by rounded tablespoonfuls onto the pumpkin mixture. Using a knife, swirl the mixtures, creating a marbled effect. Bake 50 to 60 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
