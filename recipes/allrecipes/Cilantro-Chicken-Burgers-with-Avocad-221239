Mix ground chicken, cilantro, soy sauce, garlic powder, lime juice, ground ginger, and ground black pepper together in a large bowl. Form the mixture into 4 patties. Prepare a skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Cook burgers in the hot skillet until cooked through and no longer pink in the middle, 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve on hamburger buns with slices of avocado and a 1 tablespoon ranch dressing.
