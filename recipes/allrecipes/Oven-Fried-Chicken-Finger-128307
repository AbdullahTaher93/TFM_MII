Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium bowl, combine chicken with tomato juice and ketchup. Let stand for 5 minutes. Coat a baking sheet with nonstick spray. In a pie plate, combine chips, cornmeal, parsley, oregano, and pepper. Press chip mixture into chicken strips. Place chicken in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. Mist chicken with nonstick spray. Bake until chicken fingers are crispy and no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes.
