Fill the lower pot of a double boiler half way and bring to a boil. Melt chocolate, butter, and salt together in upper pot. Add the sugar, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring after each addition. Gradually add the evaporated milk, a little at a time and continue stirring until well mixed. Serve hot over ice cream. Extra sauce maybe stored in refrigerator and reheated in microwave.
