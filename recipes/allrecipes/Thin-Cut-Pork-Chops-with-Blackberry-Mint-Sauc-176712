In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat, combine the 2 cups blackberries, the 1/2 cup mint leaves, broth, brown sugar, and balsamic vinegar. Stir often until mixture boils and berries fall apart, 6 to 7 minutes. Rub berry mixture through a fine strainer into a small bowl, pressing to extract all the liquid; discard berry seeds and cooked mint leaves. If needed to thicken mixture, pour berry liquid back into frying pan and boil over high heat, stirring often, until mixture is reduced and slightly thickened, about 3 more minutes. Remove from heat. Sprinkle pork chops lightly on all sides with salt and pepper. Reserve about half the glaze; spoon the remainder over both sides of the chops. Lay chops slightly apart on a lightly oiled barbecue grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook chops, turning once, until browned and no longer pink in center (cut to test), 5 to 8 minutes total, depending on thickness. Transfer chops to a serving platter or individual plates. Drizzle equally with remaining glaze. If desired, garnish with additional berries and mint sprigs.
