Place bread cubes on two foil-lined baking sheets. Let stand for 2 hours or overnight. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine oil and garlic. Drizzle evenly over bread cubes; stir gently to evenly coat. Sprinkle with salt. Bake 10 to 12 minutes, stirring once, or until golden brown. Cool completely.
