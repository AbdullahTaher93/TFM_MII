In a small skillet over medium heat, cook the cumin and coriander, stirring often, for 2 minutes, or until fragrant and slightly darker in color. Place in a medium bowl and let cool. Stir in the sour cream, lemon juice, olive oil, flaxseed oil, orange peel, and salt. Add the carrots, currants, and onion and toss to coat well. Let stand for 15 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.
