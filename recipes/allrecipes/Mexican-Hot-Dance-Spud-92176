Pierce each potato with a fork. Microwave on high (100%) for 15 to 20 minutes, turning over once, or until potatoes are tender when pierced. Or, bake in a conventional oven at 400 degrees F until potatoes are tender when pierced (45 to 55 minutes). Meanwhile, crumble meat into a wide nonstick frying pan. Cook over high heat, stirring often, until lightly browned (about 5 minutes). Add chili powder and stir for about 1 more minute. Then mix in tomato sauce and salsa. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until flavors are blended (about 5 minutes). Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cut potatoes in half lengthwise. Spoon meat mixture equally onto cut side of each potato half, then top with cheese, tomato, onions, and olives.
