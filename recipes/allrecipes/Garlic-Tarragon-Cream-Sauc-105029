Melt the margarine in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir in the garlic, onion, and tarragon; cook until the onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Add white wine, and cook for 5 minutes. Pour in half and half and Parmesan cheese; increase heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Whisk the flour into the water, dissolving any lumps. When the sauce has come to a boil, stir in the flour mixture to thicken to desired consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
