Combine the raw sesame seeds with the 1/8 cup of sesame oil and microwave for 2 minutes. Mix the roasted sesame seeds with the bread crumbs, salt, pepper, dry mustard, nutmeg and SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend. Set aside. Heat a large frying pan or wok with the 1/4 cup of sesame oil and the vegetable oil. DREDGE the chicken pieces in the bread crumb mixture so that they are evenly coated. Drop the chicken into the hot pan and cook over medium heat. Cook for 5-6 minutes or until golden brown on each side. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Serve immediately with rice, noodles or vegetables and assorted mustards for dipping.
