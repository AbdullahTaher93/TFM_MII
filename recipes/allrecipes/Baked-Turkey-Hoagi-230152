Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Place bread on piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil (28 to 30 inches long) on large ungreased cookie sheet. In medium bowl, beat 1 cup of the cooking sauce and the mustard with whisk until smooth. (Reserve remaining cooking sauce.) Stir in turkey until well mixed. Top bottom half of bread evenly with turkey mixture. Alternate red and green bell pepper rings over turkey mixture; top evenly with cheese. Place top of bread on top. Wrap loaf loosely in foil. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until cheese is melted and sandwich is thoroughly heated. Heat remaining cooking sauce until hot; serve as dipping sauce as desired.
