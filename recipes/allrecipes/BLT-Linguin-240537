Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Place bacon in a large skillet; cook and stir over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels, reserving 1 to 2 teaspoons drippings in the skillet. Cook and stir spinach, tomato, and garlic in the reserved drippings over medium heat until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Add bacon, linguine, Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, salt, and pepper to spinach mixture and toss.
