Bring a pot of water to a boil. Place asparagus in the pot, and cook 5 minutes, just until tender. Drain, and set aside. Place the pecans in a skillet over medium heat. Cook 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until lightly toasted. In a large bowl, toss together the asparagus, pecans, red leaf lettuce, peas, and salmon. In a separate bowl, mix the olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper. Toss with the salad or serve on the side.
