In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the bow ties until just done, about 15 minutes. Drain. Rinse with cold water and drain thoroughly. In a large bowl, toss together the bow ties, fennel, oil, lemon juice, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper. Add the prosciutto and toss again. To serve, mound the salad on plates. Top with strips of Parmesan shaved from the chunk of cheese with a vegetable peeler or with the grated Parmesan. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper over the cheese.
