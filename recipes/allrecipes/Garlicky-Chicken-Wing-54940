Preheat broiler. Place chicken on rack of broiler pan; broil 4 inches from heat source 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat butter and oil in small saucepan until butter melts. Add garlic and cook over medium-low heat until golden, about 3 minutes. Strain; discard garlic. Add lemon juice, salt, and pepper flakes. Brush chicken with half garlic-flavored oil; broil 10 minutes, turning once, until browned or juices run clear when thickest part of chicken is pierced or temperature on instant-read thermometer reaches 170 degrees F. (Refrigerate leftovers.)
