In a large bowl, mix the yogurt, lemon juice, curry powder, onion powder, salt, and garlic powder. Set aside 1 cup of the mixture to use as a dipping sauce. Place the chicken in the bowl, and coat with the mixture. Marinate in the refrigerator 8 hours or overnight. In a bowl, mix the breadcrumbs and flour. Dredge the coated chicken in the breadcrumb mixture. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Discard remaining yogurt mixture. Fry the coated chicken in the skillet 15 minutes, or until juices run clear. Serve with the reserved dipping sauce.
