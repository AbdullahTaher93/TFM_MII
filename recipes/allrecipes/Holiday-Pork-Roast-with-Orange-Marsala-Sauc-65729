Pierce all sides of pork with fork and place in large plastic food storage bag. Combine half of teriyaki marinade & sauce and 1 Tbsp. Marsala; pour over pork. Press air out of bag; close top securely. Turn bag over several times to coat pork well. Refrigerate 8 hours or overnight, turning bag over several times. Place pork in shallow roasting pan. Bake at 350 degrees F 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until meat thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 155 degrees F. Let roast stand 10 minutes before slicing. Meanwhile, combine remaining half of teriyaki marinade & sauce, 1/3 cup Marsala, orange juice, cornstarch, sugar and water in medium saucepan. Bring to boil and simmer until sauce thickens; stir in cranberries and orange peel. Cut pork into slices and serve with sauce.
