Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. In a large skillet over low heat, cook corn and black beans, 2 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, reserving their juice. Season with salt and pepper, and cook 2 minutes more. Pour in enough tomato juice to cover and season with hot pepper sauce and Worcestershire. Increase heat slightly, stir in chicken, and heat through, 3 to 5 minutes. Spoon over cooked pasta.
