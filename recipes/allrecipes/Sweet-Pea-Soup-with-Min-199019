Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add peas and return the water to a simmer. (This may take 3 to 5 minutes, depending on your stove; peas will be bright green.) As soon as water starts to simmer, remove pot from heat and drain, then place peas in a blender. Add mint, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, and salt, and cover with vegetable stock. (Depending upon the size of your blender, you may need to do this in two batches.) Puree on medium-high speed. Serve hot or cold.
