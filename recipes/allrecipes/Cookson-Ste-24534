Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large oven proof pot or Dutch oven, combine cooked sausage, pinto beans, peppers, kidney beans, wax beans, baked beans, barbeque sauce, chopped tomatoes, tomato paste and brown sugar. Note that all of the juice from the cans is added as well. Bake in preheated oven for 60 minutes.
