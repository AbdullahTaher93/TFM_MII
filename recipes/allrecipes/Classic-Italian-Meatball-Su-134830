Mix the beef, crackers, onion, and garlic in a large bowl. Roll the mixture into golf ball-size meatballs. Cook the meatballs in a nonstick skillet until browned all the way around. Drain the fat from the skillet and add the tomato sauce. While it's warming, slice the loaf of French bread in half lengthwise and use a fork to scoop out some of the bread in one half, forming a shallow trench. Spoon the meatballs and sauce into this ditch, sprinkle with the shredded mozzarella, and top with the other bread half.
