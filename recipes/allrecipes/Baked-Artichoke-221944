Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare a baking dish with cooking spray. Mix bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and parsley together in a bowl. Stir olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, and garlic together in a separate bowl. Spread artichoke hearts into bottom of prepared baking dish. Pour olive oil mixture over artichokes and stir to coat. Spread bread crumb mixture over the artichokes. Bake in preheated oven until hot in the center and the bread crumb layer is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
