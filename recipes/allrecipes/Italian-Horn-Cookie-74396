In a large bowl, cut butter into flour until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in ice cream. Divide into four portions. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours. On a lightly floured surface, roll each portion to 1/8-in. thickness. With a fluted pastry cutter, cut into 2-in. squares. Place about 1/2 teaspoon filling in the center of each square. Overlap two opposite corners of dough over the filling and seal. Sprinkle lightly with sugar. Place on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees for 10-12 minutes or until bottoms are light brown. Cool on wire racks.
