Place the bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until crisp. Remove bacon and set aside, leaving the grease in the skillet. Reduce the heat to medium and add the onions to the pan. Cook and stir until transparent. In a small bowl or cup, stir together the flour and water. Mix in the evaporated milk. Pour into the pan with the onions; cook, stirring constantly, until gravy has thickened. Stir in the bouillon cube, garlic salt, chives, salt and pepper. Return the bacon to the skillet, and add the shrimp. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, until shrimp are pink and opaque. Serve over grits, biscuits or rice.
