Remove mushroom stems and discard; set caps aside. In a skillet, cook and crumble sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain and set aside. In a food processor or blender, combine the cream cheese, parsley, lemon juice, garlic and pepper. Cover and process until smooth. Place mushroom caps on lightly greased baking sheets. Fill each cap with 2 teaspoons sausage. Top with cream cheese mixture and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake at 450 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Serve warm.
