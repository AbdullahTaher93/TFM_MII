Bring chicken broth and cream to a boil in a heavy saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced by half, about 30 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add linguine and cook 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and set aside in a large serving bowl. Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. Once the cream has reduced, stir in crumbled bacon, chicken, peas, and Parmesan cheese; cook for a few minutes until hot. Pour sauce over pasta to serve.
