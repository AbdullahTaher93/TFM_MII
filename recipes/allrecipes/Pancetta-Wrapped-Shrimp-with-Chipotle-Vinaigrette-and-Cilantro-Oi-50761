Prepare cilantro oil by pureeing cilantro, canola oil, honey, lime juice, and salt to taste until smooth; pour into a bowl or bottle, and set aside. Prepare the chipotle vinaigrette by pureeing the chipotle pepper, adobo sauce, lemon juice, rice vinegar, and garlic in a blender until smooth. With the blender running, slowly pour in the canola oil, and puree until creamy. Season to taste with salt, and set aside. Preheat a grill for medium heat. Cut the pancetta slices in half. Wrap a half slice of pancetta around each shrimp to cover. Grill until the pancetta has crisped, and the shrimp has turned opaque, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. To serve, arrange cooked shrimp on a warmed serving platter or individual plates, and drizzle with chipotle vinaigrette and cilantro oil.
