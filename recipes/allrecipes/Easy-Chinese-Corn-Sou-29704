In a saucepan, combine the cream style corn and chicken broth. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. In a small bowl or cup, mix together the cornstarch and water; pour into the boiling corn soup, and continue cooking for about 2 minutes, or until thickened. Gradually add the beaten egg while stirring the soup. Remove from heat and serve.
