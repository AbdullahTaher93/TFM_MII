Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spread tortilla chips on to a 14-inch oven proof platter or on a baking sheet. Layer refried beans, chili, salsa and cheese over the chips. Bake 15 minutes or until the cheese melts and the beans and chili are warmed through. To serve, spoon sour cream and guacamole over the chips and sprinkle with ripe olives. Great as an appetizer or as an accompaniment to a side salad.
