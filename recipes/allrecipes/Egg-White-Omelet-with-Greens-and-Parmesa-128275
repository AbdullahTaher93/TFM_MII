Wash greens until free of all sand; discard tough stems. (If using Swiss chard, reserve stems for another use.) Cook until barely tender in boiling water; drain well, pressing out all liquid. Chop coarsely if not broken apart. Set aside until at room temperature. Beat egg whites until frothy. Stir in cooked greens, parsley, and/or watercress (leaves only), cheese, and salt and pepper. Heat oil in a heavy 10-inch (23-cm) nonstick skillet, and pour in egg mixture. Cook over fairly low heat, pulling back cooked edges of omelet to let uncooked portion flow underneath, about 4 minutes. When bottom is set, cover pan and cook over low heat until top is set, about 5 minutes. Cut in wedges and serve.
