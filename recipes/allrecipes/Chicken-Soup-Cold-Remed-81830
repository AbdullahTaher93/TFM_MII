Pull all the meat off the chicken bones. (Save the skin and the bones for making homemade stock when you feel better). Cut meat into bite sized pieces. Set aside. Pull most of the leaves off of the parsley and rosemary. Keep them separate and coarsely chop each. In a large soup pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onions as soon as the butter is melted and saute until translucent. About 3 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger, stirring frequently for about 1 full minute. Add the chicken stock and the rosemary leaves. Raise heat to bring to a boil for about 5 minutes. Then reduce heat to a simmer. Add chicken pieces and simmer for 5 minutes. Taste test and add salt and pepper to your liking. Add the parsley leaves for the last minute of cooking. Serve immediately. Refrigerate left-overs; it keeps for several days.
