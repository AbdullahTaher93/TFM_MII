Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Whisk together the butter, basil herb blend and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice in a small bowl. Drizzle asparagus with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper, rolling asparagus to evenly coat. Drizzle remaining lemon juice over coated asparagus. Season the salmon filets with salt and pepper and lay over asparagus. Top each piece of fish with 1/4 of the butter mixture. Cook for 20 minutes or until salmon is cooked and asparagus is crisp.
