In a large bowl combine oatmeal, brown sugar, dry fruit, and dry milk. Transfer ingredients to an airtight container or jar to store until ready to use. To serve: Place 1 cup of mixture and 1/2 to 3/4 cup boiling water (depending how thick you like your oatmeal) into a cereal bowl. Let stand until thickened.
