Place beans in a large bowl with the water, cover, and soak overnight. In a large skillet over medium to medium high heat, fry the bacon until crispy. Drain the bacon fat and crumble the bacon; set aside. In a slow cooker, combine the carrot, celery, onion, potato, Italian- style seasoning, ground black pepper, reserved beans and crumbled bacon. Pour the broth over all. Cover and cook on low setting for 7 1/2 to 9 hours, or until beans are crisp to tender. Transfer 2 cups at a time to a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. Return all to slow cooker, add the milk, cover and heat on high for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until heated through.
