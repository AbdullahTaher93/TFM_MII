Drizzle both sides of the steaks with olive oil; season with salt and pepper. Prepare a charcoal or gas grill and arrange coals for direct cooking. Lightly coat rack with cooking spray. Coals should be glowing white. Place the steaks on grill. Cook 8 minutes per side, for rare; 10 minutes for medium-rare. Let steak rest 1 to 2 minutes for juices to collect, then serve.
