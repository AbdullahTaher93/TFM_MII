Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over low heat. Meanwhile, season chicken breasts with ground black pepper and garlic salt. Increase heat to medium-high and after 1 minute add chicken; fry until golden brown and juices run clear, 5 to 6 minutes each side. Remove chicken to a plate, cover and keep warm. Add remaining tablespoon of oil to the skillet. Add onions; saute until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add tomatoes, balsamic vinegar and Italian seasoning. Simmer to blend flavors, about 5 minutes, adding up to 1/4 cup of water to keep mixture saucy. Return chicken to pan; continue to simmer until heated through, about 2 to 3 minutes longer.
