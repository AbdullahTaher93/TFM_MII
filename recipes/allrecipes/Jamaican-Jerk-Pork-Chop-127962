Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Pour the flour and jerk seasoning into a large Ziploc bag, seal, and shake to mix. Add the chops, two at a time to the bag, reseal, and shake to coat. Brown the chops in the oil and place them on a plate. Stir the leftover flour and jerk mixture, brown sugar, and vinegar into the skillet. Bring to a boil. Stir in the pineapple (with juice), bell pepper, and beans. Put the chops back in the pan. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer about 10 minutes, until the chops are no longer pink in the center.
