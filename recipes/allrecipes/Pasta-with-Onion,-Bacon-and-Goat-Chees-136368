Cook 1 pound campanelle. Drain, reserving 2 cups pasta water; return pasta to pot. Meanwhile, cook bacon in large skillet over medium, turning, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes; remove to a paper-towel-lined plate. Add onions, garlic, and thyme to fat in skillet; season with coarse salt and ground pepper. Cover; cook, stirring occasionally, until onions begin to brown, about 15 minutes. Uncover; cook until golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes more. Crumble goat cheese over pasta; add onion mixture and 1 cup reserved pasta water. Season with salt and pepper. Toss, adding more pasta water as desired. Serve immediately, sprinkled with bacon and more thyme.
