Heat grill. Thread shrimp onto metal skewers. Brush with Buffalo wing sauce, covering all sides of shrimp. Cover and refrigerate until ready to grill. When ready to grill, place shrimp kabobs on gas grill over medium heat or on charcoal grill 4 to 6 inches from medium coals. Cook 4 to 6 minutes or until shrimp are pink, turning once. Remove cooked shrimp from skewers, cool 5 minutes; coarsely chop. In medium bowl combine shrimp, dressing and celery; mix well. Heat buns on grill 2 minutes or until toasted. Cut slit in top of bun; fill with shrimp mixture.
