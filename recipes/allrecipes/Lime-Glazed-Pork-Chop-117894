For glaze, in a small saucepan, combine the marmalade, jalapeno, lime juice and ginger. Cook and stir over medium heat for 5 minutes or until marmalade is melted. Remove from the heat; set aside. Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill. Grill pork chops, covered, over medium heat for 6-7 minutes on each side or until juices run clear, brushing with glaze during the last 5 minutes of grilling. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve with lime wedges.
