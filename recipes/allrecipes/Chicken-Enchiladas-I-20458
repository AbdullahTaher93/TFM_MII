Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Shred the cooked chicken breast meat, and place in a large bowl. Mix in sour cream, shredded cheese, and green onions. Season with cumin, cilantro, salt, and pepper. Place a heaping spoonful of the mixture in each tortilla, roll up, and place rolled tortillas seam-side down in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour salsa over all. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until heated through.
