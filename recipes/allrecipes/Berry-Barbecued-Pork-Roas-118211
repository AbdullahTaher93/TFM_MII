Sprinkle roast with salt and pepper. Place with fat side up on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, combine the cranberries, sugar, orange juice and barbecue sauce. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook and stir for 10-12 minutes or until cranberries pop and sauce is thickened. Brush some of the sauce over roast. Bake 15-20 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), brushing often with sauce. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing. Serve with remaining sauce.
