Place flour on a plate. Dredge chicken in flour, shaking off excess. In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat. Add chicken, and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a bowl; set aside. Heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil in same skillet; cook onion and garlic, stirring frequently, until onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in curry powder and 3/4 teaspoon salt; cook 1 minute more. Add potatoes and 1 cup water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer; cover, and cook until potatoes are just tender but still offer slight resistance when pierced with the tip of a paring knife, about 7 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and 1/4 cup water. Return chicken to skillet along with any accumulated juices in bowl; simmer, covered, until chicken is cooked through, 12 to 15 minutes.
