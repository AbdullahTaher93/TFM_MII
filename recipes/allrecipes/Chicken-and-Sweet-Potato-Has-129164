Cut the potatoes and sweet potatoes into small bite-size chunks. Drop into a pan of boiling water, bring back to a boil and boil for 2 minutes. Add the leeks and boil 1 minute longer; drain well. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the leeks and potatoes and saute, stirring frequently, until beginning to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the chicken, corn, sun-dried tomatoes, paprika, and salt to taste, and mix thoroughly. Continue sauteing, pressing down well to make a cake in the pan, and turning it over in chunks, until brown and crispy on both sides, 3 to 5 minutes. To make the sauce, put the yogurt, garlic and paprika in a bowl and stir to mix. Serve portions of hash topped with the yogurt sauce.
