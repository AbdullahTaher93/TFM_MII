Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Slice English muffins in half and place cut side up on a large baking sheet. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, in a skillet sprayed with nonstick vegetable cooking spray, add minced green onions (optional) and red bell peppers (optional). Cook 2 minutes and add chopped mushrooms. Cook 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and add pesto sauce and ham pieces. Remove English muffins from oven and evenly top each with pesto mixture. Top with mozzarella cheese and return to the oven. Bake for 10 minutes and turn to broil. Broil 1 to 2 minutes until cheese is golden brown.
