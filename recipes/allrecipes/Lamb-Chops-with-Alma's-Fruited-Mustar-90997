Preheat a hot grill and the oven to 400 degrees F. Toss all of the vegetables in olive oil, sea salt and pepper and roast until tender, about 20-25 minutes. Remove from the oven and keep warm. Rub the chops with oil, garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Place on the grill and cook for 4 minutes on each side. Put on a baking sheet and finish in the oven, about 5 minutes, or until desired doneness. On a plate, place the vegetables in a mound and lay the chops across the vegetables.
