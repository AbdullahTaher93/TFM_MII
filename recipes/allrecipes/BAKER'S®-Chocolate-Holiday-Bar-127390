Microwave semi-sweet chocolate and white chocolate in separate medium microwaveable bowls as directed on packages. Add half each of the almonds, cranberries and apricots to each chocolate; stir until well blended. Drop spoonfuls of the chocolate mixtures onto wax paper-covered baking sheet, alternating the colors of the chocolates. Cut through the chocolate mixtures with knife several times for marble effect. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or until firm. Break into 24 pieces. Store in tightly covered container at room temperature.
