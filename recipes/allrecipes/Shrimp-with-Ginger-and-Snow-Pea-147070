Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in onions, and cook until they turn golden brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic and ginger, cook for 1 minute, then pour in wine, and bring to a boil. Add the shrimp, and cook until they begin to turn pink, about 3 minutes. Add snow peas, and cook until they begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in chopped cilantro and serve immediately.
