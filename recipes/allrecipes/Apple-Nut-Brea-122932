In a mixing bowl, cream the butter and 1 cup sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in apple. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with buttermilk. Stir in vanilla and nuts. Pour into a greased and floured 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Combine cinnamon and remaining sugar; sprinkle over batter. Bake at 350 degrees F for 60-65 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pan to wire rack.
