Combine eggs, cornstarch, sugar, garlic, rice flour, salt, green onions, and oyster sauce in a large bowl. Mix well. Stir in the chicken thighs, making sure to coat evenly. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Remove from refrigerator about 10 minutes prior to frying. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cook chicken in the hot oil in batches, until golden brown and no longer pink inside.
