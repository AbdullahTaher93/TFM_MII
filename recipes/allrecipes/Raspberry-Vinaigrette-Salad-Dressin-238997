Press raspberries through a fine-mesh sieve using a spoon to remove seeds. Whisk raspberries, rice vinegar, garlic, sugar, sea salt, and white pepper together in a bowl. Slowly drizzle avocado oil into raspberry mixture, whisking rapidly, until dressing is thick and creamy. Let sit until flavors develop, about 10 minutes.
