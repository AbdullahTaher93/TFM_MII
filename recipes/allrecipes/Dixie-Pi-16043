Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place raisins in a small saucepan. Pour in enough water to cover. Place over low heat and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, cream together butter, white sugar, and brown sugar. Beat in eggs, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Mix until smooth. Drain excess water from raisins. Fold into mixture along with nuts and coconut. Mixture will appear curdled. Pour half of mixture into each pastry shell. Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, until filling is set. Cool on wire racks. Garnish with whipped topping and chopped nuts if desired.
