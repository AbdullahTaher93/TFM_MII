Mix zucchini, onion, carrot, garlic, celery root, anise seed, celery seed, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Gradually stir in flour until you have a soft, wet dough that sticks to your hands. Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Drop dough by tablespoons into the skillet, and fry on both sides until lightly browned.
