Place the turnips into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the yellow mustard seeds, black mustard seeds, and turmeric in the oil until the mustard seeds begin to pop. Add the turnips to the skillet; cook and stir until the turnips are completely heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt to serve.
