Whisk flour, brown sugar, baking powder, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, baking soda, and 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt together in a large bowl. Combine milk, crushed pineapple, and egg in a small bowl. Stir into the flour mixture. Add melted butter; mix until a soft dough forms. Fold in carrots and coconut. Heat at least 2 inches of oil in a large pot to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a wire rack or baking sheet with paper towels. Scoop a few tablespoons of dough into the hot oil using a small ice cream scoop. Fry donut holes until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Transfer donut holes to the paper towels using a slotted spoon; let drain and cool slightly. Repeat with remaining dough. Whisk white sugar and remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a shallow bowl. Roll donut holes in sugar mixture. Beat cream cheese and 1 tablespoon butter together in a bowl until smooth. Beat in confectioners' sugar until dip is well-blended and fluffy. Stir in vanilla extract and 1 pinch salt. Serve donut holes with cream cheese dip.
