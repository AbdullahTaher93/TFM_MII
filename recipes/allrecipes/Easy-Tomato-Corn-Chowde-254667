Combine oil and flour in a pot over medium heat; cook until flour is browned, about 5 minutes. Add diced tomatoes; cook until tomatoes thicken, about 1 minute. Stir corn, chicken broth, half-and-half, green onions, parsley, sage, salt, ground black pepper, and bay leaf into the tomato mixture. Bring to a boil. Cook until heated through, about 15 minutes.
