Warm olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garlic and mushrooms; cook until mushrooms are tender. Stir in clam juice, chicken bouillon, parsley, basil, oregano, and Worcestershire sauce. Increase heat to high, and bring to a quick boil. Reduce heat to medium; simmer 30 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8-10 minutes. Drain and set aside. Stir chopped clams and butter into the sauce; simmer 15 minutes more. Pour over cooked pasta to serve.
