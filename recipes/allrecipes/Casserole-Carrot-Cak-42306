In a mixing bowl, combine the first eight ingredients. Add oil; mix well. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Stir in carrots, pineapple and pecans. Transfer to a greased 8-in. round microwave-safe casserole dish. Microwave, uncovered, at 70% power for 12-14 minutes, rotating a half turn once or until a moist area about 1-1/2 in. in diameter remains in the center (when touched, cake will cling to your finger while area underneath will be almost dry). Cool completely on a wire rack. Invert onto a serving plate. Frost cake. Store in the refrigerator.
