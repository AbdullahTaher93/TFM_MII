Spray an 11 x 7-inch baking dish with nonstick spray coating. Tear 3 slices toasted Wonder Bread into quarters and arrange in a single layer over the bottom of the baking dish. Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallots and cook, stirring frequently, until shallots are tender. Stir in spinach and seasonings. Stir to combine. Spoon spinach mixture evenly over bread. Top with 1 1/2 cups cheese. (Seal and refrigerate remaining cheese.) Tear remaining 4 slices toasted Wonder Bread into quarters and arrange in a single layer over the dish. Whisk together eggs and milk. Pour milk mixture evenly over the bread. Cover and refrigerate several hours or overnight. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Bake, uncovered, 50 minutes or until set and knife, inserted just off center, comes out clean. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Bake 5 minutes or until cheese is melted. Remove from oven and allow to stand 5 to 10 minutes. Cut into serving portions.
