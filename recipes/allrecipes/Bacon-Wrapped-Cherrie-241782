Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Wrap each cherry with a bacon half, secure with toothpick and arrange on baking sheet. Drizzle reserved cherry juice over wrapped cherries. Broil in preheated oven until bacon is crisped to your liking, 3 to 10 minutes.
