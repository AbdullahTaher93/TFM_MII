In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, 1 tablespoon of paprika, mustard, salt and pepper. In a separate dish, stir together the remaining paprika and matzo meal. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Dip each chicken breast into the eggs, then into the matzo meal until completely coated. Make sure you can see no chicken through the breading, or it may fall off. Fry in the hot oil for about 5 minutes per side, or until the chicken is firm and the juices run clear. If it starts to brown too fast, reduce the heat slightly.
