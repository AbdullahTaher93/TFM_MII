Cook bacon in a skillet until bacon is brown and crisp. Transfer bacon to paper towel and drain. Crumble bacon. Measure drippings from skillet; add enough vegetable oil to measure 1/4 cup and return mixture to skillet. Add onions and caraway seeds and saute until onions are dark brown, about 25 minutes. Add cabbage, ham, flavors and saute until cabbage wilts, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, cook pasta in heavy large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain. Return pasta to same pot; add bacon, onion mixture, and cheese to pasta. Toss over medium heat until warmed through. Season pasta to taste with salt and pepper and serve.
