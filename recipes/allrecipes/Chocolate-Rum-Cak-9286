Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease one 10 inch bundt pan. Place chopped nuts in the bottom of the bundt pan. With an electric mixer beat cake mix, pudding mix, eggs, oil, 1/2 cup of the water, and 1/2 cup of the rum on high speed for 2 minutes. Pour batter over into prepared pan over the top of the chopped nuts. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 50 to 60 minutes. Pour rum glaze over cake as soon as you remove it from the oven. Let cake stand for 30 minutes then turn out onto a serving dish. To Make Rum Glaze: In a saucepan combine the butter or margarine, sugar, 1/4 cup of the rum, and 1/4 cup of the water. Bring mixture to a boil and cook for 2 minutes. Pour immediately over still warm cake.
