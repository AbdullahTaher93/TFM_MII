Stir tomatoes, tomatillos, jalapeno pepper, and garlic together in a saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer until the tomatoes and tomatillos soften, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and let tomato mixture cool slightly. Pour cooled tomato mixture into a blender pitcher; add avocado slices, cilantro, and salt. Blend the mixture until smooth; transfer to a bowl. Stir sour cream into the blended mixture until smooth.
