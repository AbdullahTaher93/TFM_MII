In a small bowl, beat eggs with milk and vanilla or maple extract. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, wheat germ, sugar, baking soda, and cream of tartar. Pour egg mixture into the flour, and stir just enough to moisten all the dry ingredients. Heat an electric griddle to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spoon 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the hot griddle. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, then flip and cook until browned on the other side. Serve with maple syrup.
