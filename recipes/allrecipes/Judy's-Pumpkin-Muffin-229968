Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 36 muffin cups. Whisk self-rising flour, 2 1/2 cups sugar, and pumpkin pie spice in a large bowl; stir pumpkin, eggs, and vegetable oil into dry ingredients until batter is smooth. Scoop batter into prepared muffin cups. Stir 2 tablespoons sugar with cinnamon in a small bowl and sprinkle the cinnamon sugar over the muffins. Bake in the preheated oven until muffins are lightly golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
