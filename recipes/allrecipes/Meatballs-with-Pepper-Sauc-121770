In a large bowl, combine the first three ingredients. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Shape into 1-in. balls. Place on a greased broiler pan. Broil 4-6 in. from the heat for 5-8 minutes or until browned. In a Dutch oven, combine the sauce ingredients. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; add meatballs. Simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour or until the meat is no longer pink.
