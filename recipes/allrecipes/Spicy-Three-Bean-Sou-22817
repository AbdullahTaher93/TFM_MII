Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Place onion and garlic in the saucepan and slowly cook and stir until tender and browned. Place the great northern beans, red kidney beans, black beans, celery, carrots, potatoes, tomato-vegetable juice cocktail, brown sugar, thyme, water and vegetable bouillon in the saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat approximately 25 minutes. As the mixture thickens, stir in the red wine.
