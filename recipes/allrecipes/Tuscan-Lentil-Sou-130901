In a large soup pot, combine the lentils, broth, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook, partially covered, for approximately 45 minutes, or until the lentils are just tender. In a small skillet, heat the oil. Add the garlic, onion, carrot, and celery. Cook over low heat, stirring often, until the vegetables are very soft but not browned. Set aside. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook for about 5 minutes, or until just al dente. Drain and set aside. Add the sauteed vegetables, spinach, tomatoes (with juice), and parsley to the lentils. Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring often. Stir in the pasta and season with the salt and pepper. Remove the bay leaf. Sprinkle with the cheese, if desired.
