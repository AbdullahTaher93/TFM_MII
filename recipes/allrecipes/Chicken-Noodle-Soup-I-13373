Let dry 30 minutes and then cut into thin slices. Place on wax paper and let air dry. In a large stock pot add chicken broth, celery, onion, baby carrots, and garlic. Fill stock pot, 2 inches from the top with water. Simmer until vegetables are tender, about 2 hours. Add chicken and corn. Season with salt, pepper, seasoning salt and chicken bouillon granules. Simmer for 30 minutes, checking to see if water level has decreased. Add water if needed. Bring to a boil, add noodles, stirring often. Noodles should be done in 20 minutes. Serve hot.
