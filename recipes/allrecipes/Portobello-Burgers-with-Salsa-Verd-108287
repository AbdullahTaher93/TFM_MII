Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for direct heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is directly under the food). Rinse mushroom caps, pat dry, and rub lightly all over with oil. Lay mushrooms, gills down, on grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand just above grill level only 2 to 3 seconds). Keep charcoal grill uncovered; close lid on gas grill. Cook until mushroom juices start to drip, about 5 minutes. With a wide spatula, turn caps over. Spoon about 2 tablespoons salsa verde onto each mushroom, covering surfaces well. Mound about 1/4 cup shredded cheese into the center of each mushroom. Continue to cook cooking until cheese melts and mushrooms are flexible when an edge is lifted with the spatula, 5 to 8 minutes longer. Transfer mushroom caps to rolls; add more salsa verde, salt, and garnishes to taste.
