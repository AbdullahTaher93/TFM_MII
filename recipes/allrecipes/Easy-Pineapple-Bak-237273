Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add eggs and beat until smooth. Stir bread and pineapple into creamed butter mixture; pour into a 1-quart baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and eggs are set, 45 to 50 minutes.
