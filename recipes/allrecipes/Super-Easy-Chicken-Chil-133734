Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in onions, and cook until softened and translucent, about 3 minutes. Pour in chicken broth, great Northern beans, chopped chiles, and torn chicken. Season with cumin, chili powder, and cayenne pepper. Increase heat to medium-high to bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in sour cream and simmer for 5 minutes. To serve, ladle into bowls and sprinkle with Monterey Jack cheese.
