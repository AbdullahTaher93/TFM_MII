In a small skillet, heat 1 tablespoon butter until melted. Break each egg into skillet; reduce heat to low. Cook until white is completely set and yolk begins to thicken but is not hard. Meanwhile, toast bread. Spread remaining butter over one side of each slice of bread. Spread mayonnaise over buttered side of two bread slices; top with cheese slices, eggs and remaining bread.
