In a mixing bowl, combine the sugar, eggs and vanilla; mix well. Add butter; mix well. Combine the flour, cocoa and salt; add to butter mixture just until combined. Stir in nuts. Spread into a greased microwave-safe 8-in. square dish. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 6-7 minutes or until top appears dry and springs back when lightly touched, rotating a quarter turn every 2 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar if desired.
