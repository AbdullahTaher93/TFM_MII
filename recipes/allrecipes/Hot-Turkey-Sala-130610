Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Mix the turkey, celery, onion, pecans, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Stir in the mayonnaise and lemon juice until evenly blended. Spoon into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese, then potato chips. Bake in preheated oven until cheese melts, 10 to 12 minutes.
