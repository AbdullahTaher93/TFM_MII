Stir the soup, oil, vinegar, soy, ginger and garlic powder in a medium bowl and set aside. Lightly oil the grill rack and heat the grill to medium. Grill the chicken for 15 minutes or until chicken is cooked through, turning and brushing the chicken often with 1/2 cup of the soup mixture while it's grilling. Throw away any remaining basting mixture. Cut the chicken into thin strips. Arrange the salad greens, oranges and green onions on a serving platter. Top with the chicken and serve the remaining soup mixture as a dressing.
