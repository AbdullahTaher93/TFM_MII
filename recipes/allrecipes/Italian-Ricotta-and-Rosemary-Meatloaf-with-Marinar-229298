Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a large bowl, allow breadcrumbs to soak in milk until moist. Next, crumble beef and veal into bowl. Combine with eggs, onion, ricotta, Parmesan, parsley, rosemary salt and a pinch of ground pepper. Carefully mix until each ingredient is incorporated. Fold in shredded provolone last. Brush a large baking pan with 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Form multiple loaves or one large loaf from meat mixture. Arrange on pan and drizzle loaves with remaining olive oil. Cover and bake for 45 minutes. Uncover and continue baking until meatloaf is completely cooked through, about 1 hour and 30 minutes. Remove pan from oven and allow the loaf to rest for 10 minutes or more. As the meat is resting, heat Marinara in a saucepan until warm. Serve meatloaf generously topped with Marinara (and an extra sprinkle of Parmesan or shredded provolone, if desired.)
