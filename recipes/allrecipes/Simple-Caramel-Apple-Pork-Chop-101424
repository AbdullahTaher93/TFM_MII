Heat skillet over medium-high heat. Saute chops, 5-6 minutes, turning occasionally, until both sides are evenly browned. Remove; keep warm. In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, salt, pepper, cinnamon and nutmeg. Add butter to skillet; stir in brown sugar mixture and apples. Cover and cook for 3-4 minutes or just until apples are tender. Remove apples with a slotted spoon and arrange on top of chops; keep warm. Continue cooking mixture in skillet, uncovered, until sauce thickens slightly. Spoon sauce over apples and chops. Sprinkle with pecans.
