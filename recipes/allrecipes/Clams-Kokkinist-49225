In a large saucepan, saute the onion, celery, and garlic in 2 tablespoons olive oil until tender. Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste, and clams. Season with bay leaves, chili pepper flakes, oregano, and salt and pepper to taste. Cover, and simmer for 1 hour, until tomatoes begin to turn deep red in colour and the sauce thickens. Stir in remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil near the end of the cooking time.
