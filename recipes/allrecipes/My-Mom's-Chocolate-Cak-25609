Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8 inch square pan. In a large saucepan, melt together the shortening and cocoa. Remove from heat and stir in sugar and egg. Mix buttermilk with baking soda, salt and vanilla, then blend into chocolate mixture. Beat in flour. Stir in hot water. Pour into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
