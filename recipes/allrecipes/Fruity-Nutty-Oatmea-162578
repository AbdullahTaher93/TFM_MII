Bring water and 1 1/2 cups of the milk to a boil in large, heavy saucepan over high heat. Stir in oats and salt (if using). Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 3 minutes, stirring often, until oats start to soften. Stir in pear. Cover and simmer about 3 minutes more or until it is tender but still a bit crisp. Stir in cranberries and raisins. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand 1 minute to soften. Divide evenly among 4 warm bowls. Sprinkle each with 2 tablespoons of the walnuts and 1/2 teaspoon of the sugar. Top each bowl with 1/4 cup of the remaining milk.
