Preheat grill to medium-high. 2. Combine paprika, coriander, chili powder, cumin, salt, pepper and nutmeg in a large sealable plastic bag. Place each chicken breast between sheets of plastic wrap. Pound with a meat mallet or heavy skillet until flattened to an even thickness, about 1/4 inch. Brush the chicken with oil; place in the bag, seal and turn to coat. Oil the grill rack (see Cooking Tip). Grill the chicken until cooked through and no longer pink in the middle, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Serve warm with Tomato-Cucumber Raita.
