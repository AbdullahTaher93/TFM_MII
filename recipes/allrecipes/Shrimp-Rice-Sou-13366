Rinse rice and set aside for 2 hours or until moistened. Heat sesame oil in a saucepan. Add shrimp and rice wine and gently fry. Add rice and fry for 1 minute. Pour water into saucepan and boil over medium heat. When the rice and shrimp mixture is thickened, or the rice expands about 3 times, reduce the heat to low. Continue to cook for 10 minutes, or until heated through, stirring constantly. Season with salt and serve hot.
