Prick squash all over with fork or sharp knife. Microwave on high 8 minutes, turn over, and microwave another 8 minutes. When cool enough to handle, halve squash and scrape out seeds with spoon. Drag tines of fork along flesh to tease it into long, spaghetti-like strands. (You should have roughly 8 cups.) Spin squash in salad spinner to remove excess liquid. Cover and chill in refrigerator. Whisk together molasses, garlic, ginger, 3 tablespoons of the honey, and 1/4 cup of the vinegar in small bowl. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear chicken 6 minutes, flipping once. Add honey mixture to skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 10 minutes or until thermometer inserted into thickest part of chicken registers 165 degrees F. Remove chicken and let cool. Shred chicken. Combine orange juice, shallot, and remaining honey, vinegar, and oil in large bowl and stir well to emulsify oil and vinegar. Add chicken and blue cheese and toss to coat. Serve over squash and arugula.
