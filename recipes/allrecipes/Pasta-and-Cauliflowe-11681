Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and saute until golden, 7 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and saute until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes; stir in cauliflower, parsley, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Drain pasta and transfer to a large serving bowl. Toss pasta with onion-cauliflower mixture; top with Parmesan cheese.
