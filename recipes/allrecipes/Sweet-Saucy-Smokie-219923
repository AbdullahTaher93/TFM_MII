Place the pineapple chunks, pineapple juice, grape jelly, tomato paste, brown sugar, vinegar, cornstarch, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, liquid smoke flavoring, and salt into a saucepan over medium heat. Stirring constantly, bring the sauce to a simmer, and cook until the grape jelly melts, about 5 minutes. Stir in the smoked sausages, and turn the heat to low; cook the sausages in the sauce below a simmer until the sauce is thickened and the flavors have blended, about 30 minutes.
