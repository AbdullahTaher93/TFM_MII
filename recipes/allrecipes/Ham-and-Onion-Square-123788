In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in water; set aside. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt; cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add yeast mixture. Combine sour cream and eggs; stir into flour mixture until a smooth dough forms (do not knead). Cover and chill overnight. Roll dough to fit a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in baking pan. Form a rim around edges; set aside. In a skillet, saute onion in butter until tender. Remove from the heat; stir in remaining topping ingredients. Spread over dough. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes or until golden brown.
