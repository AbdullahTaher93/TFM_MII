To make the chocolate sauce: In a medium saucepan, combine the water, sugar, and cocoa. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly until the sugar and cocoa are dissolved. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Refrigerate for 30 minutes, or until cold. To make the shake: In a blender or food processor, combine the ice cream, milk, and 1/3 cup (80mL) of the chocolate sauce. Blend until smooth. Reserve the remaining chocolate sauce for another use.
