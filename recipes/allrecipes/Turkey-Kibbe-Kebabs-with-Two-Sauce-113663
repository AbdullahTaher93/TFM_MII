MAKE THE PARSLEY, LEMON AND WALNUT SAUCE: Using a sharp knife, cut the lemons into eighths and discard any seeds. Cut the lemon flesh from the peel and coarsely chop the flesh. Transfer to a small bowl and add the parsley, mint, walnuts, garlic, olive oil, water, salt and black and Aleppo peppers. Set aside for 1 hour. MAKE THE YOGURT-GARLIC SAUCE: In a small bowl, whisk the yogurt with the water. Stir in the parsley, garlic and salt. Let stand for 1 hour. MAKE THE TURKEY KEBABS: Light a grill or preheat the broiler. In a food processor, pulse the turkey meat until finely ground. Add the 2 tablespoons of olive oil, bulgur, onion, flour, salt, black pepper, allspice, cumin and Aleppo pepper and process to a paste, about 30 seconds. Form the mixture into six 1 1/2-by-7-inch logs on metal skewers. Brush the kebabs with olive oil and grill for 5 minutes over moderately high heat, turning once, until they are golden brown and cooked through. Alternatively, broil the kebabs for 5 minutes, turning once, until golden brown and cooked through. Serve the turkey kebabs with warm pita bread and the 2 sauces.
