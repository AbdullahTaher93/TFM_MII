Mix soy sauce, maple syrup, garlic, ginger, mustard, oil, pepper sauce, and beer in a medium bowl. Place steaks in a gallon-size zipper-lock bag. Pour in marinade mixture and set aside for 40 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Remove steaks from marinade and place on hot grill. Cover and cook until impressive grill marks appear on one side of the steaks, about 4 minutes. Turn and continue to grill, covered, until steaks are cooked to desired doneness, about 4 minutes for medium.
