Heat the oil in a 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, garlic, parsley and thyme and cook until the onion is tender-crisp. Add the carrots, potato and beans to the saucepan and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 15 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.
