Loosen skin from turkey with fingers, leaving skin attached along bottom edges. In a small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 tablespoon oil, garlic and seasonings. Spread under turkey skin. Combine remaining lemon juice and oil; set aside. Place turkey on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees for 2-1/2 to 3 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 170 degrees, basting every 15-20 minutes with lemon mixture. Let stand for 10 minutes. Discard skin before carving.
