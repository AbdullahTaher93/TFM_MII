Cook chicken strips, brown rice and broccoli according to each of their package instructions. Reserve hot. Warm tortillas in a microwave for 10 seconds. To build 1 burrito: Place 1/2 cup of chicken on the bottom third of each tortilla, followed by 1/3 cup of brown rice, then 1/3 cup of broccoli. Evenly sprinkle 1/2 cup of cheese over the broccoli. Repeat steps 1 through 4 using remaining tortillas and ingredients. Roll each tortilla into a burrito, forming a larger size burrito. Cut each burrito in half, on an angle, and serve hot.
