Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Whisk milk, eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and allspice together in a large bowl. Dip each slice of bread into egg mixture to coat. Place coated bread into skillet and cook until golden brown on 1 side, about 1 minute. Flip and continue cooking until second side is golden, about 1 minute more. Remove to a plate and repeat with remaining bread slices. Sift confectioners' sugar over top of the French toast, slice diagonally, and serve.
