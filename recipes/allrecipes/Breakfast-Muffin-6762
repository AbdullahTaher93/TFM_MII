Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease muffin cups, or line them with muffin liners. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add milk, egg, and butter; mix until ingredients are moistened. Do not overmix. Stir in fresh fruit. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly touched, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve warm.
