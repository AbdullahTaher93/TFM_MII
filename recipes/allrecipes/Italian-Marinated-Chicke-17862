To Marinate: Place chicken in a nonporous glass dish or bowl. Poke several holes in breasts with a fork; season with salt and pepper to taste and cover with salad dressing. Toss to coat, cover dish and refrigerate to marinate for 2 hours. Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Remove chicken from marinade (discarding of any remaining marinade) and saute in skillet for 4 to 5 minutes on each side, or until cooked through and juices run clear.
