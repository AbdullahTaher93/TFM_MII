Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 8-10 minutes or until tender. Meanwhile, crumble sausage into a large skillet; add onion. Cook over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain if necessary. Drain potatoes; arrange in an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Drizzle with butter. Add sausage mixture and stir gently. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 5-7 minutes or until cheese is melted.
