CUT jalapenos lengthwise into halves; remove seeds. COMBINE cheddar cheese, cream cheese and cilantro in small bowl. Place 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons cheese mixture into each jalapeno half; chill for 15 minutes or until cheese is firm. DIP each jalapeno in flour; shake off excess. Dip in eggs; coat with corn flake crumbs. ADD vegetable oil to 1-inch depth in medium skillet; heat over high heat for 1 minute. Fry jalapenos, turning frequently with tongs, until golden brown on all sides. Remove from skillet; drain on paper towels. Serve with salsa and sour cream.
