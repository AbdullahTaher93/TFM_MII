PREP: Preheat grill or coals to medium/medium-hot. Meanwhile, combine vinegar, sugar, pepper sauce, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder and cayenne to make hot sauce; mix well. Set aside 3/4 cup of mixture to serve as dipping sauce; use remaining sauce for basting. COOK: CLEAN: Wash hands. Place chicken on grill. (No need to thaw if using frozen.) Brush with basting sauce. Grill for 10 to 15 minutes (7 to 10 minutes for wings), basting often. Turn chicken over and baste again. Grill for 10 to 20 minutes more (4 to 14 minutes more for wings) or until internal juices run clear. (Or insert instant-read meat thermometer in thickest part of chicken. Temperature should read 170 degrees F for wings and 180 degrees F for drumsticks or thighs.) Discard leftover basting sauce. SERVE: Serve chicken with reserved hot sauce. CHILL: Refrigerate leftovers immediately.
