Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Combine carrots, cauliflower, olive oil, thyme, garlic, salt, and pepper in a roasting pan; cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove foil, stir vegetables, and continue cooking until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes more. Toss vegetables with Parmesan cheese.
