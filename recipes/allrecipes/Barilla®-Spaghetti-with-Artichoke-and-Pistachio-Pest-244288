Set aside to cool. Process pistachios, garlic, Romano cheese, and parsley in a blender until smooth. Turn the blender off. Season with salt and black pepper. Add artichokes and remaining olive oil. Pulse a few times until a coarse consistency is reached. Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain pasta and reserve 1/2 cup of pasta cooking liquid.
