Lay 2 slices of prosciutto side by side on a flat work surface. Top with mortadella, 2 slices of capicola, 2 slices of salami, and 1 slice of provolone cheese. Roll into a log. Repeat with remaining meats and cheese. Transfer to the refrigerator. Divide iceberg lettuce, celery, tomatoes, cucumber, green bell pepper, onion, and olives among serving plates. Cut meat and cheese logs into even slices; arrange on top.
