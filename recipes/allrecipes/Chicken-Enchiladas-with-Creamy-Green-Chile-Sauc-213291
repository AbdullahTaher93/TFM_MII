Stir the soup and sour cream in a small bowl. Heat the butter in a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and chili powder and cook until the onion is tender. Stir in the chicken, chiles and 2 tablespoons soup mixture. Spread 1/2 cup soup mixture in a 2-quart shallow baking dish. Spoon about 1/4 cup chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Roll up and place seam-side down into the baking dish. Spoon the remaining soup mixture over the tortillas. Sprinkle with the cheese. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes or until the enchiladas are hot and bubbling.
