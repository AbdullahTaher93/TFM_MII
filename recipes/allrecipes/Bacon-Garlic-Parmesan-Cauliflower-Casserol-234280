Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Pour water in a large bowl; add cauliflower florets. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Cook cauliflower in microwave oven on High for 4 minutes. Pour excess water from bowl. Transfer cauliflower to a 12x9-inch baking dish; add mozzarella cheese, bacon, garlic, paprika, pepper, salt, and red pepper flakes. Gently stir cauliflower mixture to season evenly. Pour cream of mushrooms soup over the cauliflower mixture; stir to coat. Spread French-fried onions over the mixture and top with Parmesan cheese. Bake in preheated oven until browned, about 45 minutes. Cool 5 minutes before serving.
