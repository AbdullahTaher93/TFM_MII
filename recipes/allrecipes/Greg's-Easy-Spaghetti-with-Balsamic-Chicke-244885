Pour whole box of pasta into a large skillet (approximately 12 inches in diameter). Pour 3 cups of cold water into the pan ensuring that the water covers the pasta. Turn the burner to high and set your timer to 10 minutes (optional: add a bit of salt to taste). After 7 minutes add chicken, tomatoes and vinegar; cook an additional 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Fold in cheese and sprinkle with basil. Serve immediately.
