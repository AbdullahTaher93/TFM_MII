Heat the oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until golden, about 1 minute. Raise the heat to medium-high, add the onion, and cook until softened, 5 minutes. Add the bell pepper and cook until the vegetables are very tender, 5 to 7 minutes. If the bottom of the pan begins to scorch, add a small amount of water. Stir in the tomatoes, kidney beans, cannellini beans, corn, water, cumin, chili powder, curry powder, and cinnamon. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve in individual bowls and top with *optional toppings as desired.
