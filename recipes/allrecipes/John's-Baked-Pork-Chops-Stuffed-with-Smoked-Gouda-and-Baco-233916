Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine Gouda cheese, bacon, parsley, and 1/8 teaspoon black pepper together in a bowl. Cut each pork chop from one side through the middle horizontally to within 1/2 inch of the other side. Open the two sides and spread them out like an open book. Stuff cheese mixture into each pocket and close; secure with a wooden toothpick. Coat each stuffed pork chop with olive oil. Whisk egg in a bowl. Mix bread crumbs, salt, and black pepper to taste together in a separate bowl. Carefully dip each stuffed pork chop in the egg; press chop into bread crumb mixture until evenly coated. Place breaded pork chops in a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Garnish pork chops with cored apple, green onion, and red grapes.
