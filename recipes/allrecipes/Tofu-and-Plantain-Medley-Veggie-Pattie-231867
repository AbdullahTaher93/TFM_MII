Blend tofu, zucchini, plantain, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, bread crumbs, olives, and garlic in a blender until mixture is a uniform, thick texture. Spoon mixture into your hand and mold into patties. Heat butter in a cast iron skillet over medium heat; cook patties, pressing on them lightly with a spatula, in the hot butter until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
