Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees. Using an ovenproof skillet*, cook the oil and garlic over moderate heat until the cloves begin to sizzle and become fragrant. Add the red pepper flakes, fennel seeds and fresh thyme and let sizzle for a few seconds. Add the olives and citrus zest, warming them in the seasoned oil. Transfer to the oven and bake approximately 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until the olives are thoroughly heated and soft*. Season with salt and lemon juice. Serve warm.
