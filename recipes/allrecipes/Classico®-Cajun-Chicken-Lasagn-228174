Preheat oven to 325 degree F. Cook noodles according to package directions. Drain; rinse. Combine Johnsonville(R) Premium Fully Cooked Andouille Sausage, chicken, Cajun seasoning, and sage. In a large skillet cook meat mixture 8 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink. Remove from skillet using a slotted spoon, reserving drippings in skillet. Set meat mixture aside; keep warm. In same skillet cook onion, celery, sweet pepper, and garlic in drippings until vegetables are tender. Stir in meat mixture, one-half of the Classico(R) Light Creamy Alfredo pasta sauce, and Parmesan cheese. Lightly coat a 13x9x2-inch baking dish or 3-quart rectangular casserole with nonstick spray. Arrange 4 noodles in bottom of dish. Spread with 2 cups of the meat-vegetable mixture. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup of the mozzarella. Repeat layers, ending with noodles.
