Trim root end of fennel; cut off and discard leaves and stems. Halve bulb vertically. Very thinly slice crosswise into bite-size strips 1/16 inch by 2 inches. Trim and discard fat from steak; cut across the grain in 1/4-inch-thick strips. In a bowl, mix meat with garlic, olive oil, pepper, and 3 tablespoons of the vinegar. Let meat marinate at least 15 minutes, or up to 1 hour. Combine remaining 3 tablespoons vinegar and sour cream and set aside. Oil and preheat barbecue grill. Place arugula, watercress, olives, and tarragon leaves on a cutting board. With a large knife, chop into bite-size pieces. In a shallow serving dish, combine arugula mixture with fennel. Place meat on grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level about 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook, turning once, until done to your liking, 4 to 6 minutes for medium rare. Chop meat into bite-size pieces. Gently fold meat, feta cheese, and vinegar-cream dressing with greens and fennel. Add salt and pepper to taste.
