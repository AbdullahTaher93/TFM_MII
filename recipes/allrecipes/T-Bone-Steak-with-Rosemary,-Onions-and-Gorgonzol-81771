In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and then add the onion slices. Stir well. Let cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the vinegar and rosemary and cook another 10 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare your grill (or broiler). Season the steaks generously with salt and pepper. Grill to your liking. Serve with caramelized onions piled on top of each steak and sprinkle each with gorgonzola cheese.
