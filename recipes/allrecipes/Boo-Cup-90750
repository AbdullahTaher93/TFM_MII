Pour milk into large bowl. Add pudding mixes. Beat with wire whisk 2 minutes or until well blended. Gently stir in 1/2 of the whipped topping and 1/2 of the crushed cookies. Spoon 1 Tbsp. of the crushed cookies into each of 15 individual cups. Spoon pudding mixture evenly into cups; top with remaining crushed cookies. Drop remaining whipped topping by spoonfuls onto desserts to create 'ghosts.' Decorate with candies to create 'eyes.' Refrigerate until ready to serve. Watch the ghosts disappear! Store leftover desserts in refrigerator.
