Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 2 loaf pans with CRISCO(R) No-Stick Cooking Spray. Combine in a medium bowl, flour, baking powder, baking soda, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the pumpkin, CRISCO(R) oil, sugar and eggs. Mix until well blended. Add dry ingredients and mix well. By hand, stir in the walnuts and raisins. Divide batter between prepared pans. Bake for 50-55 minutes, or until toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in pans on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Remove from pans and cool completely. Orange Glaze: Combine confectioners' sugar, orange peel and orange juice in small bowl. Stir with spoon to blend. Spoon over top of cooled loaves or muffins, letting excess glaze run down side. Sprinkle with additional nuts before glaze hardens.
