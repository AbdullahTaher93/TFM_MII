Place a steamer basket in a large saucepan with 1/2 inch of water. Place the cauliflower and carrots in the steamer. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 10 minutes, or until tender. Place in a bowl and keep warm. Rinse and dry the saucepan. Heat the oil in the same saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, ginger, and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 minutes, or until soft. In a cup, combine the flour and curry powder. Add to the saucepan and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Gradually stir in the broth and wine and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes, or until the sauce is lightly thickened. Add the beans or chickpeas and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes, or until heated through. Add to the vegetables in the bowl and toss gently just until combined. Sprinkle with the cilantro or parsley.
