Stir the cranberry juice concentrate and sugar together in a saucepan over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Mix in the fresh and dried cranberries, reduce heat to medium, and cook until the dried cranberries soften and the fresh ones pop, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix in the orange marmalade, orange juice, orange peel, and allspice until thoroughly combined. Allow the cranberry sauce to cool completely. Pour into glass serving dish, cover, and chill until cold, at least 2 hours. Can be made up to 2 days ahead of time and refrigerated until serving.
