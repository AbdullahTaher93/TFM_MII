Cut steak into four strips and pound them flat with a meat mallet. Sprinkle each piece with salt and pepper. Cut bacon slices in half and place one piece on each strip of beef. Place a slice of onion on top of bacon. Roll up strips and secure with toothpicks; coat meat rolls with flour. Heat oil in a pressure cooker over medium-high heat. Brown meat rolls on all sides. Pour in tomato soup; use water to dissolve any soup remaining in can before pouring it into the pressure cooker. Add bay leaf. Seal lid and bring pressure cooker up to full pressure. Reduce heat to low, maintaining full pressure, and cook for 30 minutes. Remove from heat and let pressure drop naturally.
