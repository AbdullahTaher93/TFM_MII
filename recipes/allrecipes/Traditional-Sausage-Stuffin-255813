Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. In a large skillet, cook sausage over medium heat for 5 minutes. Add celery, onions, and carrots. Cook and stir 5 to 10 minutes longer, until sausage is no longer pink and vegetables are tender. In a large bowl, combine the sausage mixture and stuffing cubes. Stir in chicken broth, eggs, and parsley; toss to combine. Spoon into a greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover and bake for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake 10 minutes longer or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 160 degrees F and top is lightly browned.
