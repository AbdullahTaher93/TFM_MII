Cut fish into serving-size pieces; place in an ungreased shallow microwave-safe dish. Cover and microwave on high for 4 minutes. Drain liquid. Combine the sour cream, mayonnaise, milk, mustard and dill; drizzle 1/2 cup over the fish. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 4 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Serve over rice with remaining sauce.
