Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place butternut squash, sweet potato, and Brussels sprouts on a baking sheet. Spray lightly with cooking spray; season with red pepper flakes, salt, and ground black pepper. Roast in the preheated oven, stirring every 10 minutes, until vegetables are soft, about 30 minutes. Whisk olive oil, vinegar, and Dijon mustard together in a small bowl. Remove vegetables from oven; toss in the vinegar mixture until coated.
