In a microwave or double boiler, melt butter and chocolate; cool for 10 minutes. In a mixing bowl, beat egg, brown sugar, vanilla and salt. Stir in chocolate mixture. Add flour; mix well. Line an 8-in. square baking pan with foil and grease the foil. Spread batter evenly into pan (batter will be thin). Bake at 350 degrees F for 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool completely on a wire rack. Cover and refrigerate until firm. Using a 3-1/2-in. x 3-1/2-in. heart pattern or cookie cutter, mark four hearts on surface of brownies; cut with a knife. Spread ice cream on two hearts; top each with a second heart. Wrap in plastic wrap; freeze in a single layer overnight. For chocolate sauce, combine water, cocoa and sugar in a saucepan; bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Reduce heat; simmer for 2-3 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat; stir in butter until melted. To serve, dust brownie hearts with confectioners' sugar and drizzle with warm chocolate sauce. Store any leftover sauce in the refrigerator.
