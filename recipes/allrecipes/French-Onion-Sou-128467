Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium low, cover, and cook for 10 minutes, or until very soft. Uncover the pan and raise the heat to medium. Cook, stirring frequently, for 30 minutes, or until the onions are golden and almost caramel colored. Sprinkle the flour and pepper over the onions and stir to combine. Pour in the broth and water, stirring well to smooth out the lumps. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the mild-pepper sauce. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (215 degrees C). Ladle the soup into 4 oven-safe soup bowls. Top each serving with the bread, cheese, and parsley. Bake for 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
