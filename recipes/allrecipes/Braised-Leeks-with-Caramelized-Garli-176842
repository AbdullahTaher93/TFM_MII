Trim off roots, tough spots, and coarse outer layers of leeks. Split leeks in half lengthwise. Rinse between layers; tie each piece with string to hold it together. In a 5- to 6-quart pan, bring 2 quarts water to a boil. Add leeks, cover, and simmer until tender when pierced, 5 to 7 minutes; drain. At once, immerse leeks in ice water. When cool, drain. Peel garlic; set aside 1 clove. Put remaining cloves and broth in the 5- to 6-quart pan. Bring to a boil on high heat; cover and simmer until garlic is tender when pierced, 15 to 20 minutes. Lift out garlic; drain until dry. Boil broth over high heat, uncovered, until reduced to 1/3 cup, about 5 minutes. Save broth; rinse and dry the pan. Place pan over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil. When hot, add the boiled garlic cloves and sugar. On low heat, shake pan often until garlic is golden brown, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, mince reserved garlic; mix with broth, remaining oil, vinegar, and shallots. Remove string from leeks and arrange 4 leek halves on each of 4 plates. Top equally with garlic cloves and dressing.
