In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, 2 tablespoons butter, chives, milk, salt and pepper until smooth. Stir in the chicken. Unroll crescent roll dough and separate into eight rectangles; press perforations together. Spoon about 1/2 cup chicken mixture onto the center of each rectangles. Bring edges up to the center and pinch to seal. Brush with remaining butter. Sprinkle with crushed croutons, lightly pressing down. Transfer to two ungreased baking sheets.

Bake remaining squares at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. To use frozen squares: Thaw in the refrigerator and bake as directed.
