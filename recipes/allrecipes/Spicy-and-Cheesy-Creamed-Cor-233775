Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir cream cheese, milk, butter, and garlic salt together in a saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until the cheese has melted completely and the sauce is smooth, about 5 minutes. Stir corn, green chilies, and jalapeno peppers into the sauce. Pour corn mixture into a baking dish. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
