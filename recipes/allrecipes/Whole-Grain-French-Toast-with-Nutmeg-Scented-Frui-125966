To make the fruit: In a large skillet over medium heat, combine the all-fruit spread, water, lemon juice, and nutmeg. Bring to a boil. Add the pears and apricots. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until the pears are tender. Cover to keep warm. To make the French toast: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray. In a shallow bowl, beat the eggs, egg whites, vanilla extract, and nutmeg with a fork. Beat in the milk. Dip the bread slices, one at a time, into the egg mixture, letting the slices soak briefly. Arrange the soaked slices on the prepared baking sheet, fitting them together tightly if necessary. Spoon any remaining egg mixture over the bread. Bake, without turning, for 20 to 25 minutes, or just until the outside slices are lightly golden. Serve with the fruit.
