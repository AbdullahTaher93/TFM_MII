Heat 1-1/4 cups milk, salt, granulated sugar, and shortening in small saucepan just to boiling; cool to lukewarm (105 degrees F to 115 degrees F). Stir in yeast; transfer mixture to medium bowl. Add one cup of the flour to milk mixture; beat well. Add eggs and vanilla; beat well. Stir in enough remaining flour to make a thick batter; beat until smooth. Let rise, covered, in warm place, free from drafts, until doubled in bulk, about one hour. Stir batter down. Pour batter into two greased nine-inch round cake pans; let rise in warm place until doubled in bulk, about one hour. Make a swirl design on top of batter with a floured spoon; fill grooves with preserves, using 1/4 cup for each coffee cake. Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Bake coffee cakes until golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from pans, cool on wire racks. Fill grooves with remaining preserves. Mix powdered sugar, with enough milk to make thin glaze consistency; drizzle over warm coffee cakes. Sprinkle with almonds.
