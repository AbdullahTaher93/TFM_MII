To make crepes, whirl 1 1/4 cups milk, 1 egg, and flour in a blender until smooth. Place over medium heat in a nonstick frying pan that measures 7 to 8 inches across bottom. When hot, add 1/4 teaspoon butter and swirl to coat pan. Pour in 1/4 cup batter, quickly tilting pan so batter flows over entire flat surface. Cook until crepe is dry on top and edge is browned, about 30 seconds. Turn crepe with a spatula and brown other side, about 15 seconds. Invert from pan onto a plate. Repeat, stacking crepes as they are made. You need 8 crepes; reserve any extras for another use. To make filling, soak raisins in hot water for 2 to 3 minutes. Beat ricotta, 1/4 cup sugar, and egg yolk until well mixed. Drain raisins and stir into ricotta mixture. Spoon 1/8 of the filling (about 1/4 cup) across lower third of each crepe, and roll to enclose. Place filled crepes, seam side down, in a lightly buttered 9- by 13-inch baking dish or shallow casserole. To make custard, whisk 1/4 cup sugar and 1 egg with half-and-half. Pour evenly over filled crepes. Bake in a 375 degrees F oven until custard at casserole edge no longer jiggles when gently shaken, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle casserole with about 1 teaspoon sugar and shredded lemon peel. Lift out crepes with a wide spatula. Serve warm with berry sauce and sour cream to taste.
