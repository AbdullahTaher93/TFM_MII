Pour the water into a large pot and add the onions, garlic, lemons, oranges, celery, black pepper, seasoned salt and jalapeno peppers. Bring to a full rolling boil and boil for 20 minutes. Add the lobsters and place a lid over the pot. Boil for 15 minutes (depending on the size of your lobsters). Remove the lobsters from the pot, and place in a colander under cool running water to stop the cooking. Serve.
