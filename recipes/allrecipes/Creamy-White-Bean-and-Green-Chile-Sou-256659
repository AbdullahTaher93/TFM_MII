Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat until bubbling and frothy. Whisk in flour until it forms a smooth, golden paste, about 45 seconds. Pour in milk slowly, whisking constantly. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook and stir until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir white beans into the saucepan. Add green chile peppers, onion powder, cumin, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.
