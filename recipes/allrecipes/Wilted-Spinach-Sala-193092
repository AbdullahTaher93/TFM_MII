Cook bacon until crisp. Remove bacon, cool, crumble and set aside. Leaving 1 tablespoon drippings in the pan, add dressing, honey and mustard. Warm over low heat to low simmer; remove. Place spinach, onion, mushrooms and tomato in a large salad bowl. Pour hot dressing over spinach, without overdressing, and toss well until slightly wilted. Add chopped egg and bacon. Serve warm.
