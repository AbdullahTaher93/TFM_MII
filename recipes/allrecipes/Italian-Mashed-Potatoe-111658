Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Return the drained potatoes to the pot. Pour the vegetable broth, thyme, rosemary, oregano, basil, onion powder, parsley, sage, and garlic over the potatoes; mash with a potato masher.
