Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir mushrooms, onion, carrots, and garlic in the hot oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour chicken broth into the saucepan; add basil. Bring broth to a boil, reduce heat to low, place a cover on the saucepan, and simmer until the basil seasons the broth, about 10 minutes. Stir kale, curry paste, salt, and pepper into the broth; bring to a boil again, reduce heat to low, and simmer until kale softens, about 10 minutes. Stir shrimp, tomatoes, kidney beans, and lemon juice into broth; cook at a simmer until shrimp is bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 10 minutes.
