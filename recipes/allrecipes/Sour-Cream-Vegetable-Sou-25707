Wash and pick through beans. Place them in a large pot with the water. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until just tender. Stir in undrained corn and tomatoes, potatoes and cabbage. Simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. At the table, stir sour cream to taste into individual servings.
