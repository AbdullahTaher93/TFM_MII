Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Brush chops with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper; set aside. In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring sugar, juice, soy sauce and ginger to a boil. Dissolve cornstarch in water and whisk into sauce until smooth. Simmer until slightly thickened. Place chops on hot grill. Cook, continuously brushing with sauce until grill marks form, about 5 minutes per side. Brush with sauce once more and continue to grill, turning once, until glaze sets or until internal temperature is 160 degrees F( 70 degrees C).
