ROLL 1 puff pastry sheet into 14 x 10-inch rectangle on lightly floured surface. Combine cream cheese and sugar in small bowl until smooth. Spread half cream cheese mixture over puff pastry, leaving 1-inch border on one long side. Sprinkle with half morsels. Roll up starting at long side covered with cream cheese. Seal end by moistening with water. Repeat steps with remaining ingredients. Refrigerate for 1 hour. PREHEAT oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly grease baking sheets or line with parchment paper. Cut rolls crosswise into 1-inch-thick slices. Place cut side down on prepared baking sheets. BAKE for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on baking sheets for 2 minutes; remove to wire racks to cool completely.
