Place each chicken breast half between 2 sheets of heavy-duty plastic wrap; flatten to 1/4-inch thickness using a meat mallet or rolling pin. Combine flour and dried oregano in a shallow dish, and dredge chicken in flour mixture. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken; cook 4 minutes on each side. Remove chicken from pan; keep warm. Add onion to pan; saute 2 minutes. Stir in broth, raisins, and lemon juice; cook 3 minutes, scraping pan to loosen browned bits. Return chicken to pan. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 8 minutes or until chicken is done. Place a chicken breast on each of 4 serving plates. Add capers to sauce in pan. Spoon 1/3 cup sauce over each serving; top with 1 tablespoon cheese. Garnish with lemon slices, if desired.
