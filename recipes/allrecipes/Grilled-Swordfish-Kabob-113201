Light the grill or heat the broiler. Thread the fish cubes alternately with the bay leaves onto four large skewers. Put the kabobs on a plate and brush them all over with 3 tablespoons of the oil. On a large plate, combine the bread crumbs, parsley, salt, and pepper. Holding the kabobs over the plate, pat the crumbs onto the exposed sides of the fish. Drizzle with the oil left on the first plate and sprinkle with any crumbs that didn't stick. Grill the kabobs over low to moderately low heat or broil them, brushing with the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil, until the bread crumbs are golden and the fish is just done, 8 to 10 minutes.
