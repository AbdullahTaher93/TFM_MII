Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Mix 2 tablespoons Greek seasoning with butter. Rub 3/4 of butter mixture under chicken skin (breasts and legs) and remaining mixture on the outside of chicken. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon Greek seasoning over outside of chicken and stuff 3 lemon halves inside the chicken cavity. Combine onions, potatoes, olive oil and 1 tablespoon Greek seasoning. Place chicken in a roasting pan and arrange vegetables around chicken. Roast 1 1/4 - 1 1/2 hours. Remove chicken from oven; let rest 10 minutes. Transfer vegetables to a large skillet. Add olives, salt and pepper. Cook 1-2 minutes over low heat. Toss in spinach just before serving. Cook 1-2 minutes or until leaves wilt. Remove from heat; gently stir in feta and juice of one-half lemon. Remove vegetables to a large platter. Carve chicken and serve over vegetables.
