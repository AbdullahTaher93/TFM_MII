In a large, heavy-bottomed soup pot set over medium heat, melt the margarine. Add the onions and garlic and sauté until softened for about 7 minutes. Sprinkle the five spice powder over the onions, stir and cook 1 minute more. Add in the squash, apple, broth and juice. Increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered for 30 minutes. Stir in the brown sugar. Purée the soup, in batches, in a blender until smooth. Return soup to the pot and heat through before serving.
