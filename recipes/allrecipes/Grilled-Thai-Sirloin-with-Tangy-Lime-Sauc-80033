In small bowl, combine 3 tablespoons soy sauce, olive oil and hot chili oil; whisk until blended. In second small bowl, combine garlic powder and 3/4 teaspoon pepper. Place beef steak in large shallow dish. Pour 1/2 of soy sauce mixture over one side of steak; sprinkle with 1/2 of garlic powder mixture and 1/2 of chopped cilantro. Rub mixture firmly into beef. Turn steak over and repeat on second side. Cover and marinate in refrigerator 20 minutes. Place steak on grid over medium, ash-covered coals. Grill, uncovered, 17 to 21 minutes for medium rare to medium doneness, turning once. When steak is almost done, in small saucepan, combine sauce ingredients. Place on grid near edge of grill to heat until hot. Carve steak crosswise into thin slices; arrange on heated platter. Spoon sauce over beef; garnish with lime slices and cilantro sprigs. Serve immediately.
