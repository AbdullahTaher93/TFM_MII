Combine berries in a large bowl; sprinkle with 1/3 cup sugar, lemon juice, lemon rind and cornstarch. Using a large saucepan over medium heat, simmer berry mixture until berries begin to soften and release juice, approximately 3 minutes. Set aside to cool. Using large bowl of mixer on high speed, whip cream with 1/3 cup sugar and almond extract until soft peaks form. Do not overbeat. Using a small bowl, combine a tablespoon of lemon curd with 2 tablespoons of whipped cream, stirring until well combined. Add remaining lemon curd and combine with whipped cream. Beat on high speed until somewhat stiffer peaks form and lemon curd is well combined. Remove Blueberry Rolls from pan and cut into 1-inch pieces. To Assemble: Spoon a layer of whipped cream filling into a large glass trifle bowl. Add a layer of Blueberry Rolls. Add a layer of berries with juice. Continue layering until you have used all of the roll pieces and berries with juice. Finish with a layer of filling. Cover tightly and refrigerate until ready to serve.
