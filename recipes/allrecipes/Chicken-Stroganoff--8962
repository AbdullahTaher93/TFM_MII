In a shallow dish or bowl, season flour with salt and pepper to taste. Dredge chicken in seasoned flour to coat. In a large skillet, brown coated chicken in melted butter or margarine until golden. In a medium bowl combine the soup, half-and-half, dry onion soup mix, parsley, garlic, mushrooms, nutmeg and browning sauce. Mix all together and pour mixture over chicken in skillet. Reduce heat to low and let simmer, covered, for 1 hour. Stir in sour cream and heat through, but DO NOT BOIL! Top with chopped green onion and serve over noodles or rice, if desired.
