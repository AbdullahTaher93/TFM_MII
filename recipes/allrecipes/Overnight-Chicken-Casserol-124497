Remove the crusts from bread and set aside. Arrange bread slices in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Top with chicken; cover with the mushrooms and water chestnuts. In a bowl, beat eggs; blend in milk, mayonnaise and salt. Pour over chicken. Arrange cheese on top. Combine soups and pimientos; pour over cheese. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Before baking, crumble crusts; toss with melted butter. Sprinkle over casserole. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 1-1/4 hours or until set. Let stand 10 minutes before cutting.
