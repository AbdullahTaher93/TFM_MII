Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray. Combine Brussels sprouts, olive oil, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes in a bowl; toss until coated. Arrange in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven until Brussels sprouts are golden brown and tender, about 25 minutes. Mix honey and Sriracha sauce together in a small bowl until combined. Place roasted Brussels sprouts in a bowl. Drizzle with honey mixture; toss until well coated.
