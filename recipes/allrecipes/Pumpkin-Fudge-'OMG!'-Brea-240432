Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a casserole dish or two 9x5-inch loaf pans with shortening. Whisk cake flour, pudding mix, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Beat pumpkin, white sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl using an electric mixer until smooth. Slowly spoon flour mixture into pumpkin mixture and mix until batter is smooth; stir in walnuts and chocolate chips. Spoon batter into the prepared dish and sprinkle raw sugar over batter. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes.
