Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray a 2-quart baking dish with cooking spray. Stir sweet potatoes, dates, 3/4 cup brown sugar, eggs, 1/2 cup melted butter, cream, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Spread the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until hot, about 20 minutes. Mix granola cereal, 1/2 cup brown sugar, pecans, and flour in a bowl until the mixture is crumbly; pour 1/3 cup melted butter into granola mixture and stir to combine. Sprinkle the granola topping over the sweet potatoes. Bake until topping is lightly golden brown, about 15 more minutes.
