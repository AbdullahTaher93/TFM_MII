Put cabbage into a large pan. Pour 2 cups water over the cabbage. Sprinkle olive oil, cider vinegar, and caraway seeds over the cabbage. Place a cover on the pot. Turn heat to medium. Cook cabbage, stirring once or twice while cooking and adding water as needed to maintain steaming action, until tender, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
