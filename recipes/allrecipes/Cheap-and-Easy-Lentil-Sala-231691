Combine lentils and water in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Cook lentils at a boil until tender, about 20 minutes; drain. Mix kidney beans, corn, and parsley in a bowl; add lentils and gently stir. Whisk olive oil, balsamic vinaigrette, sugar, salt, and black pepper together in a separate bowl; drizzle over lentil mixture and gently stir. Cover bowl with plastic wrap; refrigerate until lentils are completely chilled, about 1 hour.
