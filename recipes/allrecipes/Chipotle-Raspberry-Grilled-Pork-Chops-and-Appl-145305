Heat grill. Coat pork chops with Archer Farms Chipotle Raspberry Grill Sauce. Cut thin slice from stem and blossom ends of apple; cut apple into 4 thick slices. Coat with sauce. Place pork chops and apple slices on grill. Cover and cook over medium heat 10 to 12 minutes or until chops are no longer pink in center and apples are tender, turning both once. Place apple slices on top of chops. Serve with additional grill sauce, if you like.
