Peel, pit, and slice peaches. In large bowl, mash to texture of salsa; add lemon juice. Peel nectarine and cut flesh from pit. Cut into pieces and whirl in a blender until smooth. Add 1/2 cup of the puree to mashed peaches; discard remaining puree. Combine half-and-half and sugar in a 11/2- to 2-quart pan. Over medium heat, scald mixture (it should reach 180 degrees F; small bubbles will form around pan's edge). Remove from heat; using a wire whisk, whisk in beaten eggs, vanilla, and almond extract, if using. Add mixture to peaches; chill, covered, for at least an hour or up to 1 day. Freeze in an ice cream maker (at least 2-quart capacity) according to manufacturer's directions. Serve when softly frozen, or freeze airtight up to 2 weeks and soften at room temperature before scooping.
