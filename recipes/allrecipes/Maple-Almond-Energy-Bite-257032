Place oats and almond flour in large bowl; stir to blend well. Add combined almond butter and syrup. Stir until ingredients are well blended. Add apple juice and stir to combine ingredients, adding water as needed for shaping consistency. If desired, add salt to taste preference. Shape into 24 (about 1-inch diameter) balls. Spread chopped almonds on waxed paper in single layer. Gently press top of each ball into almonds. Refrigerate, covered, until chilled. Store leftovers in refrigerator, covered.
