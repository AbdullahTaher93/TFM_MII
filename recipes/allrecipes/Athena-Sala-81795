In a small jar add the lemon juice, water, garlic, oregano and a dash of salt and pepper each. Shake the jar. Add the olive oil (if you can, set it aside for about 30 minutes to develop deeper flavor). Divide the spinach between two plates, top them with the strips of pepper, 5 olives each and then crumble the feta cheese on top. Shake the vinaigrette jar well and drizzle over the salads. Serve at once.
