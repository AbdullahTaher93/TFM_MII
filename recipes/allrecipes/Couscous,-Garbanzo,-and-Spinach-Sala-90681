In a 2- to 3-quart pan, combine broth and dried cherries from salad mix (set aside nuts for garnish); bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in couscous, remove pan from heat, and cover and let stand 5 minutes. Meanwhile, to a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat, add olive oil, pico de gallo, shredded carrot, and garbanzo beans. Cook, stirring, just until onion in pico de gallo and carrot are tender, about 4 minutes. With a fork, stir garbanzo mixture into couscous. Add 1/3 cup of the vinaigrette, stir to combine, and set aside. To hot frying pan, add spinach and cook, stirring, just until slightly wilted, about 30 seconds (spinach should not be soft). Divide warm spinach equally between two dinner plates. Drizzle about 1 tablespoon of the vinaigrette over each serving of spinach; top evenly with couscous. Sprinkle reserved sliced almonds on top and serve. Add salt and pepper to taste.
