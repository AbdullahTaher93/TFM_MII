In a 10-in. ovenproof skillet, cook and stir red onion and sugar in oil over medium heat for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Remove 1/4 cup; set aside. To the skillet, add the green onions, mustard and thyme; mix well. Remove from the heat. In a bowl, beat the eggs, water, salt and pepper. Pour into a skillet, sprinkle with 1/4 cup cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Top with reserved onion mixture and remaining cheese. Cut into wedges.
