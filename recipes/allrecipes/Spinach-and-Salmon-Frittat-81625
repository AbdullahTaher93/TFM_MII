In a small bowl, beat the eggs with the milk, oregano, garlic powder, lemon extract, salt and lemon pepper. Set aside. Coarsely chop spinach and set aside. If you are not using fresh spinach then thaw and drain 1/3 cup frozen spinach. Cut cream cheese into cubes, set aside. Drain the salmon and flake with a fork, set aside. Measure out the Parmesan cheese and set aside. Prepare broiler, set rack as close as it can go and preheat. In a skillet over medium heat, melt the butter and saute the spinach just until wilted. Reduce heat to medium, add the egg mixture and started scraping it up from the bottom and sides (just a bit more gentle then you would for scrambled eggs). When it is about 1/2 way set (still runny) toss in the salmon and the cubes of cream cheese. Immediately remove from heat, smooth out top with your spatula and sprinkle the Parmesan cheese evenly over the top. Put under the broiler with the skillet handle propping open the door. Broil until the cheese starts to turn brown. Be sure to use a towel or pot holder to remove the skillet. If you used a non stick skillet it will slide out easily onto a plate where it can be cut into pie wedges to be served.
