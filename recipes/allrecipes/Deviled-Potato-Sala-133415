In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the potatoes until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain well and transfer to a baking sheet in a single layer to cool. In a large bowl, combine the onion, anchovy paste, mustard, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce and 1 teaspoon of the paprika. In a slow, steady stream, whisk in the EVOO. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the potatoes to the bowl and toss with the dressing. Transfer the potato salad to a wide serving dish and top with the chives, parsley and the remaining 1 teaspoon of paprika.
