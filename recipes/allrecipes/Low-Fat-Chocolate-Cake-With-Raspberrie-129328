Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly spray an 8 x 8 x 2-inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray. Dust with cocoa powder. In a medium bowl whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on low speed, beat together the sugar, applesauce, and egg until smooth. Beat in the milk and vanilla until blended. Add the flour mixture and beat until blended. Turn the batter into the pan. Bake 40-45 minutes, or until a pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Turn out onto the rack or a serving plate to cool completely. To serve, melt the jam in a saucepan over low heat. Brush over the top of the cooled cake. Top with raspberries and dust with confectioners' sugar.
