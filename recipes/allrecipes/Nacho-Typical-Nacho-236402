Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Mix ground beef, yogurt, salsa, chili beans, diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, and black olives together in an 8-inch square baking dish. Sprinkle cheese over the beef mixture. Bake in preheated oven until bubbling, about 30 minutes.
