In a 5- to 6-quart pan, combine broth, shallots, ginger, fish sauce, sugar, anise seed, and cinnamon stick. Cover tightly and bring to a boil over high heat. Then reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. While broth simmers, attractively arrange bean sprouts, sliced chilies, basil leaves, cilantro leaves, and lime wedges on a platter; set aside. Scrape gravy from meat and reserve for another use. Cut meat into thin slices, then cut slices crosswise to make pieces about 11/2 inches long. Lay meat slices on a microwave-safe platter, cover with plastic wrap, and heat in a microwave on full power (100%) until hot, 2 to 3 minutes. When broth mixture has simmered 15 minutes, pour broth through a fine strainer into a large bowl; discard ginger and spice residue. Pour strained broth back into pan and return to a boil over high heat. Add noodles and sliced onion; simmer until noodles are barely tender to bite, about 5 minutes. To serve, use tongs to divide noodles equally among 6 deep soup bowls. Top equally with pieces of warm beef, then ladle broth generously over each serving. Offer with the platter of condiments and hoisin sauce to add to taste, if desired.
