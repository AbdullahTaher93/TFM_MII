Spread mustard on one side of each bread slice. Fill bread with ham, pear slices and cheese, making four sandwiches. Butter one outside of each sandwich. Place sandwiches, buttered side down, on hot griddle or in large skillet over medium-high heat. Butter tops of sandwiches. Cook 3 to 4 minutes or until bottoms start to brown. Turn sandwiches and cook an additional 3 to 4 minutes or until cheese starts to melt and sandwiches are hot.
