Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a bowl, stir together mayonnaise and mustard. Stir in thyme, oregano, and basil. Place salmon fillets on a baking sheet, and spread with the mayonnaise mixture. Sprinkle with dill weed. Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, until the salmon is easily flaked with a fork.
