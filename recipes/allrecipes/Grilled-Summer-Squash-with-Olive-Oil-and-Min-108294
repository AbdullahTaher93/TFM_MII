Prepare barbecue grill and preheat for direct heat cooking (the charcoal or gas flame is directly under the food). Rinse and drain squash. Cut each in half lengthwise, then into 1inch pieces. In a bowl, mix vegetables with oil, garlic,1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. If cooking over charcoal, use a grill skillet or basket; if cooking over gas, use a grill sheet or basket. Pour vegetables into grill skillet, sheet, or basket. Place skillet or basket on grill over a solid bed of medium hot coals or medium high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand just above grill level for only 3 to 4 seconds). Keep charcoal grill uncovered; close lid on gas grill. Cook, gently shaking skillet once or twice to turn vegetables, until tender when pierced, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove vegetables from grill and return to bowl. Add mint leaves, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste; mix well. Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.
