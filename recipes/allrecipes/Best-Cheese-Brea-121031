In a large bowl, combine the flour, cheese, baking powder, dill and garlic powder. In another bowl, beat the eggs, milk, oil and honey. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Pour into a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-65 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean (top will have an uneven appearance). Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.
