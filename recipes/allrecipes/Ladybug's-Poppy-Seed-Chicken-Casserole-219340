Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix together the cracker crumbs, melted butter, and poppy seeds in a bowl. Layer the bottom of a 9x13-inch glass baking dish with 2/3 of the cracker mix. Mix the chicken breast pieces with cream of chicken soup and sour cream until thoroughly combined, and spoon the mixture on top of the crumb crust. Sprinkle remaining 1/3 of the cracker mix over the top of the chicken mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until the casserole is hot and bubbling, about 1 hour.
