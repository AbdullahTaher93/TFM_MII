In a small bowl, combine the fresh herbs with Nature's Seasons(R) seasoning blend, sugar and zest. Brush fish lightly with oil and lemon juice. Spread the herb mixture evenly on the fish; arrange the fillets in a large baking dish. Cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes or until fish is opaque and flakes with a fork. Keep warm. Arrange broccoli rabe on plates; place fish in center and top with Nature's Red Wine Sauce. Nature's Red Wine Sauce: In a medium saucepan combine the two wines, shallots, tarragon and parsley. Boil over high heat until reduced to a generous 1/2 cup; about 10 minutes. Strain the mixture into a small saucepan; return to boil over moderate heat. Reduce heat and gradually (one piece at a time) whisk in the butter until the sauce is slightly thickened; do not let the sauce boil. Season with Nature's Seasons(R) seasoning blend and keep warm.
