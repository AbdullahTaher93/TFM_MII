Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil; drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Place squash, onion, and thyme sprigs on prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with remaining oil and roast, tossing occasionally, until golden and beginning to brown, about 35 minutes. Remove thyme leaves from stems. Line a second rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Place bacon slices on sheet in a single layer. Sprinkle bacon with maple sugar. Bake in preheated oven until browned and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain on paper towel-lined plate. Bring Swanson(R) Chicken Broth to a simmer in a large stockpot. Add half of the roasted vegetables, thyme leaves, and goat cheese. Blend with a hand-held immersion blender. Add remaining vegetables, thyme leaves, and goat cheese. Blend until smooth. Stir in the kale. Serve topped with a slice of candied bacon.
