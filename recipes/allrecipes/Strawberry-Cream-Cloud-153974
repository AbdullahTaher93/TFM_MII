Preheat oven to 200 degrees F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment. Add egg whites and salt to bowl of electric mixer. Beat on high speed until whites hold soft peaks. Gradually beat in 1/2 cup of the granulated sugar until whites are glossy and hold stiff peaks. With small spatula, spoon whites onto baking sheets, making 8 4-inch diameter mounds. Make a small hollow in each mound with the back of spoon. Bake 1 1/2 hours. Turn off oven and let cool in oven 1 hour longer. Combine strawberries and remaining granulated sugar in medium bowl. Chill until ready to use. Place cream, confectioners' sugar, and almond extract in bowl of electric mixer just before removing meringues from oven. Beat on high speed until cream holds stiff peaks, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove meringues from oven and place on 8 small serving plates. Spoon 1/4 cup of the strawberries over each and then top with 1/4 cup of the cream. Sprinkle with almonds.
