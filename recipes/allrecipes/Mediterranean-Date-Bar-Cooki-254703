Combine dates, water, maple syrup, lemon juice, salt, and ground cardamom in a non-reactive saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until dates begin to fall apart, 15 to 20 minutes. Mash the dates with a potato masher into a thick paste. Pour the filling into a bowl; chill in the refrigerator until cool, 30 minutes to overnight. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Combine oats, flour, brown sugar, baking soda, salt, and ground cinnamon together in a large bowl; add cubed butter. Mix together with your hands until the butter is combined and crust resembles a loose, crumb-like texture. Press 2/3 of the crust into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan. Spread the cooled date mixture on top; cover with remaining crust. Pat lightly to pack together. Bake in the preheated oven until topping is lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool; cut into squares.
