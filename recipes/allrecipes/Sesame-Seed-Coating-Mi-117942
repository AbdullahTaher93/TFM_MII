In a bowl, combine first nine ingredients. Store in an airtight container in a cool dry place for up to 6 months. Yield: about 4 batches (about 2 cups total). To prepare pork chops: With a sharp knife, cut a pocket in the side of each chop almost to the bone. Stuff with ham and cheese. Place 1/2 cup coating mix in a shallow bowl. Brush both sides of chops with butter, then dip into coating. Place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes. Turn chops over; bake 10-15 minutes longer or until meat juices run clear.
