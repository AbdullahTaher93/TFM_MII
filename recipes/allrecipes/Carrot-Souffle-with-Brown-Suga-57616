Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a stockpot of salted water to a boil. Cook carrots until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat, and drain well. Place carrots in a food processor with the margarine, and pulse to puree. Add the eggs, brown sugar, flour, baking powder, and baking soda, and process until smooth. Pour carrot mixture into a 1quart, round baking dish. Place the dish inside a larger dish with 1 inch of water to prevent burning bottom of casserole. Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven for 1 hour, or until firm.
