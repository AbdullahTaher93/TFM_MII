Remove stalks from fennel bulb and finely chop 1 tablespoon of the feathery leaves. Remove outer layer from bulb and dice the rest. Set aside. Cut grapefruit in half crosswise. Using a small serrated knife, cut around the segments of one half to release from the membrane. Pop out into a bowl. Repeat with orange. Add olives, chopped fennel bulb, fennel leaves, and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and stir gently. Heat medium nonstick skillet on high until hot but not smoking. Sprinkle pan with 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Season fillets with black pepper; lay in pan skin side down. Cook until skin is crispy brown, about 3 minutes. Turn over and cook 1 to 2 minutes more. Let rest for 1 minute. Top with salsa.
