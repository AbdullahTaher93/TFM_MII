Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the apple, celery, bell pepper, and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the chicken, hot pepper paste, white wine, lemon pepper, sugar, garlic, and pepper. Cook the chicken until no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes.
