Prepare grill to medium heat. Using 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, brush both sides of peaches. Place peaches on grill; grill, turning and brushing with vinegar occasionally, until caramelized and softened (about 5 minutes). Remove from grill and place each half, face up, on a dessert plate. Top with ice cream and drizzle with remaining balsamic vinegar. Garnish with mint, if desired.
