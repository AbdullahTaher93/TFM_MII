Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 2-quart casserole dish. Alternately layer yams and apples in casserole dish; set aside. In a saucepan, heat apple juice. Mix cornstarch with water in a small bowl or cup. When juice is boiling, stir in cornstarch mixture; cook, stirring, until thickened. Stir in sugar and cinnamon. Spoon sauce over yam/apple mixture. Sprinkle wheat germ on top. Bake until the apples are tender, 25 to 30 minutes.
