Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray. Combine biscuit dough quarters and pizza sauce in a large bowl; gently toss to evenly coat the dough in sauce. Turn dough out onto the prepared sheet, leaving in a pile roughly the shape of an inverted bowl. Bake in preheated oven until dough is nearly golden brown, about 15 minutes; sprinkle mozzarella cheese evenly over the dough and continue baking until cheese melts, about 5 minutes.
