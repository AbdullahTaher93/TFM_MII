Whisk eggs, chicken broth, olive oil, parsley, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Fold in matzo meal until thoroughly mixed. Cover and refrigerate until matzo mixture softens into a soft dough, 3 hours to overnight. Roll matzo mixture gently into 12 golf-sized balls, moistening hands if dough is too sticky. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add matzo balls; cover and cook until tender, about 20 minutes.
