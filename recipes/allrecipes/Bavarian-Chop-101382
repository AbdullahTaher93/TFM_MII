Lightly flour chops. Melt butter in nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until foaming. Brown chops quickly on both sides. Remove, reserve. Add green onion, garlic, mushrooms and thyme; saute for 2-3 minutes, until onion is soft. Return chops to skillet, add beer; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer 7-8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve with buttered noodles, garnished with parsley, if desired.
