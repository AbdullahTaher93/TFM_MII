Drain bacon slices on paper towels, reserving bacon drippings in the skillet. Chop bacon. Whisk cassava flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Beat butter and coconut sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until fluffy. Add 3/4 cup coconut milk, 1/4 cup maple syrup, and egg; beat until well combined. Mix flour mixture into butter mixture until batter is smooth. Add bacon drippings, 1 tablespoon at a time, if batter is too thick. Mix chopped bacon into batter.
