Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine rosemary, garlic, salt, mustard, and pepper; press 1/2 onto beef roast. Combine remaining seasoning with oil in large bowl. Add vegetables; toss. Place roast, fat side up, on rack in shallow roasting pan. Insert ovenproof meat thermometer so tip is centered in thickest part of beef, not resting in fat. Do not add water or cover. After meat has roasted for 15 to 30 minutes, place potatoes and onions on rack around meat. Roast meat 1 3/4 hours for medium rare; 2 hours for medium doneness. Roast vegetables 1 1/2 hours or until tender. Remove roast when meat thermometer registers 135 degrees F for medium rare; 150 degrees F for medium. Tent with foil. Let stand 15 to 20 minutes. (Temperature will continue to rise about 10 degrees to reach 145 degrees F for medium rare; 160 degrees F for medium.) Carve roast. Serve with vegetables.
