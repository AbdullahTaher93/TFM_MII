In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat, cook bacon until brown and crisp, turning often. Drain on paper towels. When cool, crumble. Core pears and cut each into 16 wedges; mix fruit with lemon juice. On a platter or 8 salad plates, arrange spinach and mushrooms; top with pear slices and juice. In a small bowl or a 2-cup measure, mix ginger, olive oil, vinegar, and pepper. Moisten salad with dressing; top with crumbled bacon.
