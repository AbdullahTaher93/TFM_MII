Sprinkle flour on a clean countertop. Pull off 3 ounces of dough (use 2 if you prefer thinner crust), knead it flat, and roll it out into a pie shape. Brush both sides of the dough with olive oil and place on the grill for about 3 minutes, or until the dough browns. Flip the crust, top with the tomatoes, feta cheese, and shrimp, and cook for 2 more minutes before removing.
