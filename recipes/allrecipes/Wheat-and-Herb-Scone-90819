Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a food processor or large bowl, whirl or mix together all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, baking powder, dried basil, dried oregano, and dried thyme until combined. Add butter; whirl or rub with your fingers until coarse crumbs form. In a small bowl, beat eggs and milk to blend; set aside 2 tablespoons of this mixture. Add remaining egg mixture to flour mixture. Whirl or stir just until evenly moistened. Scrape dough onto a floured board and knead about 6 turns or until dough holds together. Divide dough in half. Pat each half into a 3/4-inch-thick round, 5 to 6 inches in diameter. Set rounds well apart on an oiled 12- by 15-inch baking sheet. With a knife, cut each round not quite through to form 6 equal wedges. Brush rounds with reserved egg-milk mixture. Bake until golden brown, about 18 minutes. Serve hot or warm, breaking along scores.
