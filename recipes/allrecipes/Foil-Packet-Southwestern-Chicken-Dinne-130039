Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Combine rice and water; let stand 5 min. Spoon evenly onto centers of four large sheets of heavy-duty foil; top each with 1 chicken breast half. Sprinkle evenly with chili powder. Drizzle with dressing; top with cheese and vegetables. Bring up foil sides. Double fold top and both ends to seal each packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside. Place in single layer in 15x10x1-inch baking pan. Bake 25 to 30 min. or until chicken is cooked through (170 degrees F). Place one packet on each of four dinner plates. Cut slits in foil with sharp knife to release steam before opening.
