Day one: In a large heavy stockpot, add meat and cover with water. Add 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, and enough water to completely cover meat. Simmer over medium heat for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Remove meat from stock; refrigerate stock for later use. Debone meat, discard bones, and place meat in a roasting pan. Roast meat for 1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven or until tender when pierced with a fork. Cover pan with aluminum foil and refrigerate. Day two: Remove stock from refrigerator; skim off and discard top layer of hardened white fat. Pour 4 cups of stock into a heavy stockpot; add potatoes, carrots, 1 can of crushed tomatoes, and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook vegetable mixture over medium-high heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Cool slightly and refrigerate. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the onion. Cook and stir until onion is transparent, 5 to 8 minutes. Set aside. Remove meat from refrigerator and add remaining stock to pan. Cover the roasting pan with a lid or aluminum foil. Cook meat for 1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven. Remove the meat from the oven and pour in the salsa, onion, tomato sauce, brown sugar, barbecue sauce, and 1 can crushed tomatoes. Continue roasting for another 1 1/2 hours. Cool slightly and refrigerate overnight. Day three: In a large Dutch oven portable roaster or large stock pot, combine meat with the vegetable mixture from the day before, corn, green beans, lima beans, okra, and tomato juice. Cook for 3 hours at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) if using a roaster, or if using a stock pot, simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally.
