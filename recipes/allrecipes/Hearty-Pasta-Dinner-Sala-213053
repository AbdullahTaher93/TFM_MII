Prepare pasta according to package directions, omitting salt. Drain; set aside. Meanwhile, whisk olive oil, vinegar, salt, and black pepper together in large bowl to make dressing; set aside. Cut franks lengthwise in half; then slice into 1/4-inch-thick half moons. Heat large skillet over high heat for 1 minute. Add franks; cook and stir 5 minutes or until lightly browned. Add tomatoes, bell pepper, and peas; cook an additional 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until peas are hot and peppers are crisp-tender. Place pasta into bowl with prepared dressing. Add frank mixture; toss to coat all with dressing. Serve hot.
