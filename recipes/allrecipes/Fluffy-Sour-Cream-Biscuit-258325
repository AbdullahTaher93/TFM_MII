Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Combine flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a bowl; cut in shortening until mixture is crumbly. Add milk and sour cream until dough comes together. Turn dough onto a floured work surface; knead 10 times. Roll out dough and cut into biscuits. Place biscuits on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
