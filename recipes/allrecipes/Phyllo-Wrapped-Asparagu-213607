Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly brush 1 sheet of phyllo dough with butter and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Roll 2 asparagus spears up with the prepare phyllo dough, and place seam-side down on a baking sheet. Repeat until all the asparagus spears are rolled. Brush each roll with butter and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until the phyllo is golden brown and crispy, 15 to 18 minutes.
