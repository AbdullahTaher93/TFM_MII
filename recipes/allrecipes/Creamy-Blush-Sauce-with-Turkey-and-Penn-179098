Place the turkey into a 3 1/2- to 5-quart slow cooker. Pour the sauce over the turkey and sprinkle with the red pepper. Cover and cook on LOW for 7 to 8 hours* or until the turkey is cooked through. Remove the turkey from the cooker to a cutting board. Let stand for 10 minutes. Remove the turkey meat from the bones. Stir the turkey meat and the half-and-half into the cooker. Spoon the turkey mixture over the pasta. Sprinkle with the cheese.
