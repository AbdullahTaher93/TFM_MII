Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray. Mix oil, ranch dressing, Buffalo wing sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt together in a a large bowl to make sauce. Add potatoes; stir to coat thoroughly. Transfer potatoes to the casserole dish. Place chicken in the sauce bowl; stir to coat with remaining sauce. Marinate in the refrigerator, about 30 minutes. Roast potatoes in the preheated oven while chicken marinates, stirring halfway, until tender, about 30 minutes. Stir in chicken. Continue roasting, stirring once or twice, until chicken and potatoes are tender, 15 to 30 minutes. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble bacon into a bowl; stir in Colby Jack cheese and green onions. Sprinkle cheese mixture over potatoes and chicken; bake until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 5 minutes.
