Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add chicken, onion, chipotle peppers, garlic, and garlic salt; cook and stir until lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir enchilada sauce, hominy, tomatoes, black beans, and water into the pot. Season with chili powder, cumin, oregano, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Bring to a gentle boil. Cover and simmer until flavors combine, about 40 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.
