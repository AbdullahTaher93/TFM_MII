Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onions in hot oil until slightly softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Place chicken in skillet and season with garlic salt and black pepper. Cover the skillet with a lid and cook until chicken is browned on one side, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn chicken and season with garlic salt and black pepper on the other side. Transfer chicken and onions to a cutting board and chop chicken. Stir bok choy into the same skillet, reduce heat to low, cover the skillet with a lid, and cook until greens are slightly tender, about 1 1/2 minutes. Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; remove from heat. Stir couscous spice packet contents and 1 tablespoon olive oil into water; add couscous. Cover saucepan and let stand until water is absorbed completely, about 10 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork. Spoon couscous onto plates, top with greens, onions, and chicken, respectively, and sprinkle tomatoes and Mizithra cheese over the top.
