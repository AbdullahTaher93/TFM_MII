Heat a 9-12 inch coated saute pan over medium heat. Add 1 Tbsp. of olive oil and add plums. Cook 1 minute, toss with sugar. Cook 1 more minute. Remove to bowl. Wipe out pan, return to heat. Add remaining olive oil, and when hot, add pork chops. Cook on each side until brown. Sprinkle with Mrs. Dash(R) Fiesta Lime Blend. When chops are almost done, about 3 minutes on each side, add reserved plums and toss.
