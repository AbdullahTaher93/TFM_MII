Combine almonds, flour and sugar in bowl of food processor. Scatter butter on top and process just until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add egg and process just until dough gathers in a ball. Divide dough into two pieces, one slightly larger than the other, and shape into flattened discs. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Combine cherry pie filling, liqueur and orange zest. Roll out the larger disc of pastry into 11-inch circle and place in 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom; trim edges.
