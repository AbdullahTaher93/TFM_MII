Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and saute onions until transparent. Stir in wheat bran and oat bran. Meanwhile, dissolve bouillon in hot water. Stir cheese, marjoram and sage into onion mixture. When cheese is melted, gradually stir in enough bouillon water to create a moist batter. Remove from heat and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Form mixture into patties and place on a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Prepare gravy according to package directions and add horseradish.
