To a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat, add olive oil, mushrooms, shallot, garlic, and raisins from salad mix package (set nuts aside for garnish). Cook, stirring often, until golden brown, about 6 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of the wine to pan; stir to release any browned bits. Continue cooking until wine evaporates. When vegetables begin to brown a second time, about 6 more minutes, add remaining 1/2 cup wine. Stir together broth, cream, and cornstarch; add to pan. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring, until reduced to 2 cups, about 4 more minutes. Divide salad mix equally between two dinner plates. Top with equal amounts of chicken. Spoon hot mushroom sauce over chicken and salad mix. Sprinkle reserved frosted pecans over mushroom sauce and serve. Add salt and pepper to taste.
