Preheat the grill for high heat. In a saucepan, mix the Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, garlic powder, seasoned salt, celery seed, Italian seasoning, and basil. Stirring constantly, bring to a boil and cook 1 minute. In a large bowl, mix the sauce, ground beef, and onion. Form into burgers. Lightly oil the grill grate. Place burgers on the grill, and cook 5 minutes per side, or until well done. Season with salt and pepper.
