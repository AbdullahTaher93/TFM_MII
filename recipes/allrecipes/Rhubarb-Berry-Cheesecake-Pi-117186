In a large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and milk until smooth. Beat in the lemon juice, lemon peel, vanilla and salt. Pour into crust. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, bring rhubarb and 1/4 cup water to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes or until rhubarb is tender. Drain. In a small bowl, sprinkle gelatin over remaining water; let stand for 1 minute. Stir gelatin and sugar into rhubarb. Bring to a boil. Remove from the heat; stir in lemon juice. Cover and refrigerate until slightly thickened. Stir in strawberries. Spoon over pie. Refrigerate for 2-3 hours or until set.
