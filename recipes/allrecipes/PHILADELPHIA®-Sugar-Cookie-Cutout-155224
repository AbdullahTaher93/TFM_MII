Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Beat cream cheese, butter, sugar and vanilla in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Add flour and baking soda; mix well. Cover. Refrigerate 30 minutes. Roll dough to 1/8-inch thickness on lightly floured surface. Cut into assorted shapes, using 3-inch cookie cutters. Place on greased baking sheets. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until edges begin to brown. Transfer to wire racks; immediately press about 1/2 teaspoon of the crushed candies into top of each hot cookie. Cool completely.
