THE NIGHT BEFORE: Grill chicken breast for about 8 minutes on each side, turning only once (make sure it's cooked through--no pink inside). Cool slightly and slice, then refrigerate. Steam or microwave asparagus until just tender. Drain, then rinse immediately under cold water. Cut each spear into four or five pieces and refrigerate. Put all the dressing ingredients in a jar, shake, and store in the fridge. THAT MORNING: Put the chicken, pasta, and vegetables in a bowl and mix thoroughly. Pour the dressing over and mix through. Put in an airtight plastic container. Take to work. Put the dish in the fridge as soon as you get there.
