In a small bowl, stir together teriyaki sauce, wasabi powder, and rice wine vinegar. Set aside for about 10 minutes to combine flavors. In a medium bowl, stir together 1 tablespoon of the teriyaki marinade and the cucumber; add sour cream. Preheat the broiler. Brush both sides of the catfish fillets with remaining marinade and place on an oiled baking pan. Broil about 4 inches from the heat for 7 minutes. Top the broiled fillets with cucumber salad. Garnish generously with cilantro leaves and serve with steamed green beans.
