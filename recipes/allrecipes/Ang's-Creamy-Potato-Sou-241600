Pour 49.5 ounce can chicken broth into a 5-quart pot; add potatoes, carrots, celery, and onions; bring to boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, and cook until the potatoes are completely tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Gently mash potatoes into the soup to thicken to your desired texture. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil; add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes. Stir broccoli, celery soup, chicken soup, Monterey Jack cheese, pepperjack cheese, pepper, and parsley into the soup; add 14.5 ounce can chicken broth. Cook and stir until the cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.
