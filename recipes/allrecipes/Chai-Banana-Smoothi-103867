Place bananas in freezer for about 30 minutes or until frozen. Pour milk into a microwave-safe measuring cup; microwave at HIGH for 1 minute or just until milk boils; add chai tea bag and let steep for 20 minutes, pressing bag gently with a spoon to release chai flavor. Remove and discard tea bag; chill chai flavored milk for 10 minutes. Combine frozen bananas, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, yogurt, and chai flavored milk in a blender. Process mixture until smooth, stopping to scrape down sides.
