Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In large bowl, combine flour, oats, brown sugar, baking soda and salt; cut in butter until crumbly. Reserving 1-1/2 cups crumb mixture, press remainder on bottom of 13x9-inch baking pan. Bake 15 minutes. Add nuts to reserved crumb mixture. In heavy saucepan, over low heat, melt caramels with sweetened condensed milk, stirring until smooth. Spoon apple filling over prepared crust; top with caramel mixture, then reserved crumb mixture. Bake 20 minutes or until set. Cool. Serve warm with ice cream. Store leftovers covered in refrigerator.
