Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium saucepan over medium heat, place the green beans in water, and bring to a boil. Cover, and cook 6 minutes, until tender. Remove from heat, and drain. In an 8x8 inch baking dish, mix together the cream of mushroom soup, milk, pimentos, and pepper. Stir in the green beans. Sprinkle with French-fried onions. Bake, uncovered, 30 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until the casserole is hot and bubbly in the center.
