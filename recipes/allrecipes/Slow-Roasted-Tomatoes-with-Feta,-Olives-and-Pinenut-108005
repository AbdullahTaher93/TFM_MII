Sprinkle tomatoes with salt and turn, cut side down, to drain for 30 minutes on a wire rack set over a cookie sheet with a rim. Meanwhile, warm a small skillet over low heat. Add pinenuts; saute, stirring constantly until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Adjust oven rack to center position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Mix feta, cream cheese, olives, pinenuts and oregano in a medium bowl. Turn tomatoes cut side up and fill with about 2 Tbs. of the feta mixture. Bake until tomatoes are soft but still hold their shape, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven and brush with oil. Serve hot, warm or at room temperature.
