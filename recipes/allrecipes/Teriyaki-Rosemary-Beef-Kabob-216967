Cut beef into 1-inch cubes. Combine teriyaki sauce, mustard and rosemary; pour over beef and vegetables in large plastic food storage bag. Press air out of bag; close top securely. Turn bag over several times to coat all pieces. Refrigerate 2 hours, turning bag over occasionally. Skewer beef and vegetables alternately onto bamboo skewers. Grill 5 inches from hot coals 5 minutes on each side (for medium-rare), or to desired doneness.
