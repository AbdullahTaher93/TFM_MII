Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. Place starch in a medium bowl. Combine milk, oil and salt in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Pour over the starch and stir until crumbly and blended. When the mixture has cooled slightly, stir in egg, egg white and cheese. Knead the dough until smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. It will be dry, yet hold together. Pinch off 1 tablespoon of dough at a time and roll into a ball. Place 20 balls on the prepared baking sheet for the first batch. Bake the balls until puffed and golden on the bottom, about 20 minutes. Repeat with the remaining dough. Let the cheese puffs cool for a minute or so before serving warm.
