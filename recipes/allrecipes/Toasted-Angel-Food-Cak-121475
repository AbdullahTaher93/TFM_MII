Spread cream cheese on one slice of cake; spread preserves on second slice. Place slices together, sandwich-style. Spread butter on outsides of cake. In a skillet over medium heat, toast cake on both sides until lightly browned and cream cheese is melted. Dust with confectioners' sugar. Serve immediately.
