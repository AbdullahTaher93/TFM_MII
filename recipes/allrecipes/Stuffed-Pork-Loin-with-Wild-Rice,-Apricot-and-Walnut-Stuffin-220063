In a medium saucepan, combine wild rice and broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir well, reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 23-25 minutes for brown or wild rice (15-20 minutes for white rice). Cook until broth is absorbed, then remove from heat and set aside, covered, for 10 minutes. While the rice is cooking, melt butter over moderate heat in a medium skillet. Add onion and cook gently, stirring frequently, until softened. Add walnuts and continue to cook and stir 2-3 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then scrape mixture into a large bowl. When rice is ready, add it to the walnut mixture, then stir and toss with a fork to combine. Let cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally. Add apricots, parsley, chives and eggs to the rice mixture. Stir until evenly mixed. Set aside. Lay the pork loin out flat on a clean work surface. Spread it with the garlic, then sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Spread cooled rice mixture over meat, then roll loin up, snugly like a carpet. Using heavy-duty cotton string, tie the roast firmly around its circumference in three or four places, at 2-inch intervals. If stuffing oozes from the ends, push it back it. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Put the oil in a heavy, ovenproof skillet, or coat the skillet with nonstick cooking spray, and place over high heat. Brown the rolled-up roast, turning it frequently, for 8-10 minutes. Place in oven until thermostat inserted into center reads 160 degrees F, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Remove from oven and let rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing crosswise into 10 pieces, about 1/2-3/4 inches thick.
