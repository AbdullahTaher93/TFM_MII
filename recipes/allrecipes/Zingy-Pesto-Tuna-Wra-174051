Lightly stir together the tuna, mayonnaise, pesto, lemon juice, and pepper in a bowl until well combined. Microwave the tortilla on High until warmed and pliable, 5 to 10 seconds. Spread the tuna mixture on the tortilla, and top with the lettuce leaves, provolone cheese, and kalamata olives. Fold the bottom of the tortilla up about 2 inches to enclose the filling, and roll the tortilla tightly into a compact wrap.
