In a large saucepan, soften gelatin in cold water; let stand for 1 minute. Cook and stir over low heat (do not boil) until gelatin is dissolved, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat; slowly stir in syrup. Set pan in ice water; whisk in milk. Continue whisking until mixture has thickened, about 10 minutes; remove pan from ice bath and set aside. In a mixing bowl, beat cream until stiff peaks form. Fold in 3/4 cup pecans and the maple mixture. Sprinkle 1 cup wafer crumbs into a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. dish; top with maple mixture. Sprinkle with remaining pecans and wafer crumbs. Cover and chill for at least 6 hours or overnight. Refrigerate any leftovers.
