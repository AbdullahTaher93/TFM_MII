In a large nonstick skillet, saute the onions and garlic in the oil until limp. Add the lettuce, chili peppers, cilantro, and oregano. Cook until the lettuce has wilted, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Clean the skillet and coat with nonstick spray. Add the egg substitute and lightly scramble over low heat. Divide among the tortillas. Top with the chili mixture. Serve flat or rolled up, topped with sour cream, sprouts and tomatoes.
