Using a meat grinder fitted with the plate having medium-size holes, grind the pork. Combine the pork, garlic, salt, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, cayenne, black pepper, sherry, and Â½ cup cold water. Set aside in the refrigerator while you prepare a sausage stuffer (take the grinding plate off the meat grinder and attach the sausage-stuffing tube, or put a sausage-stuffing attachment on a heavy-duty stand mixer). Stuff the casings somewhat loosely with the pork mixture, twisting off links every few inches. Pat the sausages dry with paper towels and refrigerate, covered, until you are ready to cook them; alternatively, wrap them tightly and freeze for up to several months.
