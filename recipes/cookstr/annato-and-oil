In a small saucepan, heat oil over medium heat; when hot, add seeds or half the axiote block dissolved in warm water; lower heat and simmer for 5 minutes until oil acquires a rich orange-red color. Remove from heat; cool. Strain oil, discard seeds, and store in a jar in refrigerator for later use. The oil will keep for several months.
