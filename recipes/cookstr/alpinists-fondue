Prepare a medium-high-heat fire, with the flames occasionally licking the grill grate. Let it burn steadily for 30 minutes. Rub the inside of a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed saucepan with the garlic; discard the garlic (tossing it into the flame is a pleasantly fragrant way to do this). Place the pot upon the grill grate. Pour 1 cup of the wine into the pot; divvy the remainder among one's party (or keep for oneself). Bring the wine in the pot to a simmer. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, toss the cheeses with the cornstarch. Add the cheese to the simmering wine; reduce the heat to medium and stir constantly until the cheese is completely melted. Heat until bubbling, about 5 minutes. Season with pepper and kirsch. Transfer the Dutch oven to the resting place to cool slightly, then serve it with crusty bread, chunks of crisp apple and pear, or a platter of blanched asparagus or broccoli for dipping.
