Wash the lettuce, spin dry, wrap in a dry towel, and set aside in the refrigerator to crisp. Preheat the oven to 400°F (205°C). Put the bread slices onto an ungreased baking sheet and bake until crisp 20 minutes. Brush with 1½ tablespoons of the oil and return to the oven to brown-about 10 minutes. Crush together the garlic and the anchovies and gradually add 1 tablespoon of the oil. Spread this mixture onto the bread slices and set aside. Cover the egg with boiling water and cook for 1 minute; the white should be opaque and just setting. Put the lettuce leaves into the salad bowl, add the remaining ingredients, and toss with the egg and bread until well incorporated.
