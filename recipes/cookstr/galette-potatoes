Melt the butter in a heavy skillet that can be tightly covered. Arrange the potatoes in a spiral, beginning in the center and continuing outward so that the potatoes overlap. Repeat for two or three layers, dotting with butter and adding salt and pepper. Cover the pan and cook slowly over medium heat till the potatoes are tender and the bottom layer is brown and crisp. Either invert the potatoes on a hot platter or invert them on a tray and slip back into the pan with additional butter so that they brown on the other side. Bouillon Potatoes Bouillon Potatoes
