In a heavy saucepan, melt the butter over moderate heat. When the foam subsides, remove from the heat. Whisk in the flour until smooth. Return to heat and whisk in the curry powder. Add the stock and cook until the mixture thickens. Add the cream, reduce the heat, and simmer, stirring from time to time, for 15 minutes. Add the clams and cover until the clams open. Discard any that do not open. Season with pepper and serve in heated bowls.
