To prepare the sauce, place all the ingredients in a small sauté pan and bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved and well combined. Turn off the heat and set aside. To prepare the crab, remove the triangular-shaped belly flap or apron. Turn over and remove the outer shell by inserting your thumb between the body and shell at the rear of the crab and pulling the shell up. Remove the gills and roe or “crab butter.” Remove the spongy gills and small paddles (beak) and discard. Break each crab into two pieces: holding the crab body facing up and away from you, force both halves upward, breaking the crab body in half Pull the crab legs from the body and break each half-body in half again, quartering the body meat. Let the pieces dry completely on a plate lined with paper towels. To prepare the Asian Slaw, in a small bowl, whisk together all the dressing ingredients except for the Thai chile. Gently stir in the chile. Allow the mixture to sit for 15 minutes. In a large bowl, combine all the slaw ingredients and toss well. Remove the chilies from the dressing and discard (if you prefer more heat, transfer a few slices to a cutting board and finely dice before returning to the dressing). Pour the dressing over the law and toss well to coat. In a 10- or 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat, heat the vegetable oil. When hot, add the crab and cook for 3 minutes. With tongs, turn the crab and cook for 3 minutes more. Add the chilies and half the scallions. Add 1½ cups of the tamarind sauce and the garlic, turning several times to coat the crab completely. Serve directly from the skillet or place on a platter and sprinkle the remaining scallions and salt. Provide guests with bowls of warm water, each with a lemon wedge, and plenty of napkins. Serve with extra sauce on the side, steamed rice, and Asian Slaw.
