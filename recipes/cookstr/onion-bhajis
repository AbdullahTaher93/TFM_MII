In a large bowl, mix together the onions, chickpea flour, cumin seeds, coriander, turmeric, and chile. Add enough cold water (about ½ cup) to make a thick batter. Pour enough oil into a large, deep saucepan to reach 2 in (5cm) up the sides, and heat to 350°F (180°C). In batches, carefully add spoonfuls of batter (about the size of golfballs) to the oil. Deep-fry, about 3 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bhajis to paper towels to drain. Just before serving, return the bhajis to hot oil and deep-fry again until crisp and golden-brown. Drain briefly on paper towels and serve hot.
