Add all of the ingredients to a food processor and process until a powder is formed. There should not be any discernible chunks or large granules of cashews, so this may take 3 to 4 minutes of processing. Store this in a jar or portion out into 1?3 cup increments and put in ziplock bags and store in the pantry for a month or two or in the refrigerator for up to 6 months.
