Combine the sugars, syrup, butter, and 5 tablespoons water in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil. Add the pecans and continue cooking until the mixture reaches the soft ball stage (238Â°F). Remove the pan from the heat and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the candy begins to turn opaque. Quickly drop spoonfuls onto aluminum foil and allow to harden.
