In a medium bowl, combine all the ingredients except the mustard paste. Add the mustard paste little by little, stirring. Taste the dressing when youâ€™ve added half the mustard paste, and either stop or continue adding it, to suit your taste. Toss the dressing with about 9 ounces of briefly boiled and cooled vegetables, and serve.
