Advance Preparations: Prepare Classic Piecrust as directed. Refrigerate it for at least 2 hours before rolling. Prepare Streusel. Store in a sturdy container in the refrigerator for 1 week or freeze it for up to 1 month. Remove from container and spread it on a baking sheet about 1 hour before it is to be used. This removes some of the chill, allows you to break the large chunks into smaller pieces, and makes it easier to handle. Rolling the Dough: Follow the instructions in the Piecrust recipe for rolling the dough and for lining a 9-inch pie pan. Refrigerate after fluting while you make the apple filling. Baking Preparations: Position rack in lower third of oven; preheat oven to 450°F. Making the Filling and Applying the Streusel: When you’re ready to bake the pie, melt the butter in a small saucepan; set aside. Mix the sugars, flour, and spices in a small bowl. Peel the apples with a vegetable peeler, cut them into halves, and core them with a melon baller. Cut 1/8-inch slices on a cutting board with a chef’s knife, or slice apple halves using a food processor with a 1/8-inch slicing blade. You need 9 cups sliced thin. Pour into a large mixing bowl, sprinkle with the dry mixture, and toss gently and briefly with a rubber spatula. Sprinkle with the lemon juice and melted butter, tossing again just to combine. Remove the pastry-lined pan from the refrigerator. Spoon the filling into the pan, spreading the apple slices evenly. (They will mound higher in the center.) Pat out the streusel to form a thin topping over the apples. Baking the Pie: Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350°F and bake for 30 to 40 minutes longer, or until the bottom crust is golden. Cooling and Serving the Pie: Remove from oven to a cooling rack. Serve lukewarm or at room temperature with vanilla ice cream or Classic Crème Anglaise as an accompaniment.
