Lay the eggplant slices on paper towels and sprinkle the salt over them. Let stand for about 30 minutes, then pat the eggplant slices dry. As a result of this process, the eggplants will be crispier when fried. Place a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Pour enough oil into the skillet to fill it halfway. The oil will be ready for frying when it sizzles upon contact with a drop of water. Be careful, however--if the oil is too hot, the outer surface of the eggplant slices will brown before the interior flesh is fully cooked. Place a single layer of eggplant slices in the oil. Fry for about 1 minute, then turn them over and fry for 1 minute more. They should be slightly brown. Remove the slices with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining slices, adding more oil if necessary. Drain on paper towels.
