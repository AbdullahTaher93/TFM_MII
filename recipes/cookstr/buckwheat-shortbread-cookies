Preheat the oven to 325°F. In the bowl of a stand mixer, using the paddle attachment, combine the butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add the all-purpose flour, polenta, buckwheat flour and sale and mix until just combined. On your countertop, place the dough between two pieces of parchment and roll it out to ¼-inch thickness with a rolling pin. Transfer the parchment-covered dough to a baking sheet and refrigerate until firm to the touch, about 30 minutes. Cut the dough into shapes of your choice. Coat each cookie with sugar, place on a baking sheet, and bake for 16 minutes. Cool the cookies on a cooling rack. The cookies will keep for several days in an airtight container.
