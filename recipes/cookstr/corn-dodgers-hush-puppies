Mix the cornmeal, sugar, flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder in a bowl. Beat the buttermilk and egg together and combine with the dry ingredients and onion. The batter should be stiff enough to hold its shape. If the batter is too soft, add more cornmeal until it is firm enough to hold shape. In a deep frying pan, pour peanut oil to a depth of 2 inches and heat to 350°F. Drop heaping tablespoons of batter into the hot oil and fry for 3 to 4 minutes, until golden brown. Maintain the oil temperature and fry in batches of four or five. Drain on paper towels and hold in a warm oven until all the hush puppies are finished. Serve hot.
