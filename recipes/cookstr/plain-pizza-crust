BREAD MACHINE METHOD In a large bowl or plastic bag, combine brown rice flour, potato starch, sugar, xanthan gum, yeast, salt and oregano. Mix well and set aside. Pour water, vinegar and oil into the bread machine baking pan. Select the Dough Cycle. Allow the liquids to mix until combined. Gradually add the dry ingredients as the bread machine is mixing, scraping with a rubber spatula while adding. Try to incorporate all the dry ingredients within 1 to 2 minutes. Allow the bread machine to complete the cycle. MIXER METHOD In a large bowl or plastic bag, combine brown rice flour, potato starch, sugar, xanthan gum, yeast, salt and oregano. Mix well and set aside. In a separate bowl, using a heavy-duty electric mixer with paddle attachment, combine water, vinegar and oil until well blended. With the mixer on the lowest speed, slowly add the dry ingredients until combined. With a rubber spatula, scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. With the mixer on medium speed, beat for 4 minutes. FOR BOTH METHODS With a wet rubber spatula, remove the very sticky dough to prepared pan (see Note), spreading out as much as possible. Generously sprinkle with sweet rice flour. With floured fingers, gently pat out dough to fill the pan evenly. Continue to sprinkle with sweet rice flour as required. Form a rim at the edge of pan. Allow to rise in a warm, draft-free place for 15 minutes. Bake in 400°F (200°C) preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until firm. Spread with your choice of toppings. Return to oven and bake according to recipe topping directions. VARIATION Substitute your favorite herb for the oregano — try basil, marjoram or thyme.
