Combine the chocolate and cream in a medium-size saucepan and stir over medium-low heat until the chocolate melts and the mixture begins to bubble a little around the sides. Quickly whisk the mixture until it comes together in a smooth chocolate sauce. Remove from the heat and whisk in the vanilla. Pour into a heatproof bowl that can go into the freezer. Chill the ganache in the freezer just until it thickens, about 15 minutes. Use immediately to glaze the top of a cheesecake. Let some ganache drizzle down the sides-or, if you wish, frost the sides completely, using a narrow metal icing spatula. Do not cover. Return the cake to the freezer for 1 hour before cutting.
