In a covered pasta pot over high heat, bring water to a rapid boil. Meanwhile, in a large sauté pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add leeks and stir. Add wine, season to taste with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until leeks are soft and tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. Add salt and tagliatelle to the boiling water and cook, uncovered, until pasta is al dente. Scoop out about 1 cup (250 mL) of the pasta water and set aside. Drain pasta. Return sauté pan to medium heat. Add 2 tbsp (25 mL) of the reserved pasta water and the butter. Cook, stirring, until heated through, about 2 minutes. Add tagliatelle and, using a wooden spoon, toss to coat evenly, adding more pasta water if necessary. Add half of the Parmigiano- Reggiano and toss well. Transfer to a large serving bowl and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Serve immediately.
