Separate the rice grains with your fingers and set aside in a bowl. In a small bowl, mix the eggs and sherry until combined. Place the scallions, celery, carrots, peas, and diced vegetables in another bowl. Heat a wok or a large skillet over medium heat. Pour in 2 tablespoons of the oil. Add the eggs and stir constantly until scrambled and broken into small lumps. Stir in the rice and cook until the eggs and rice are evenly distributed throughout. Increase the heat, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and add the vegetables, salt, pepper, and soy sauce. Cook until the vegetables are just cooked and heated through.
