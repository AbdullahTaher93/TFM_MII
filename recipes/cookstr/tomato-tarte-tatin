Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. Melt the butter, add the sugar and keep over low heat until starts to thicken. Add balsamic vinegar. Layer tomato slices in rows, working from the outside in. Lay pastry sheet gently over top, tucking sides in with a knife. Put pan in oven for around 30 minutes, or until pastry is nicely browned. Remove, and put plate over top, making sure it covers most of the pastry but fits inside pan. Holding plate tightly, flip the pan so the plate is on the bottom. Garnish with fresh basil.
