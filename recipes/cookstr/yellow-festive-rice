Trim the stalks of lemongrass to about 3 inches in length. Trim away any hard portions, discard the outer leaves, and coarsely chop. Place the coriander, cumin, turmeric, cayenne, ginger, garlic, shallots, and 1 cup of water in a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. Heat a heavy skillet over high heat, add the oil, and when very hot, add the spice blend. Sauté in the oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the coconut milk and bring to a slow boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer. Add the rice and lemongrass, cover, and cook until the rice is done—about 40 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat, add a tablespoon of oil, and when hot, add the rings of a sliced green onion and fry until crispy. Remove and drain on paper towels. Mound the rice on a platter, garnish with the onion rings, and serve.
