Preheat oven to 450°F. Wash chicken and clean out cavity. Rub chicken with 1 tablespoon butter, sea salt, and pepper. Squeeze lemon juice allover chicken. In the cavity, place 2 tablespoons butter, garlic cloves, rosemary, and thyme. Tie legs together with a piece of hemp or kitchen string. Place chicken in a large roosting pan on a rock, which will help cook the chicken more evenly. Add carrots, potatoes, onions, and tomatoes to the pan, surrounding the chicken. Drizzle them with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover chicken and veggies with cheesecloth. Cook for about 20 minutes at 450°F, then decrease oven temperature to 375°F and cook for another 20 minutes. Test far doneness; juice should be clear, not rosy (cut behind the leg to check). When the chicken is almost finished, melt dark chocolate in the top of a double boiler. Add cayenne to the melting chocolate and stir until chocolate is completely melted and smooth. Serve chicken and roasted veggies with warm chocolate sauce on the side for dipping.
