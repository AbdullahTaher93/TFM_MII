Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water, stirring until smooth. Set aside to cool slightly. In the bowl of an electric mixer set on medium speed or with a hand mixer, beat the egg yolks and sugar until pale yellow. Stir in the chocolate and espresso until well mixed. In another bowl, with the mixer set on high speed or with a hand mixer, whip the cream until it forms stiff peaks. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold it into the chocolate mixture. In a clean, dry bowl, beat the egg whites at high speed with a clean, dry whisk or hand mixer until stiff peaks form. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold into the chocolate mousse, taking care to incorporate the whites thoroughly. Spoon the mousse into a large serving bowl or individual dessert bowls or goblets. Chill in the refrigerator overnight. Serve garnished with strawberries.
