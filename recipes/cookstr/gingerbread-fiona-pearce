Beat the butter, dark brown sugar, and egg yolk in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and all the ingredients are well combined. Stir in the golden syrup, sifted flour, ginger and mixed spice in two batches to ensure all the ingredients are mixed together properly. If the dough is slightly crumbly, add a little more golden syrup. Knead the dough on a floured surface, then wrap it in plastic wrap and allow it to firm in a refrigerator for at least an hour. Preheat the oven to 35°F (180°C/gas mark 4) while you are letting the dough rest. Once the dough is ready to roll out, place it on a floured surface and roll it out to the required thickness. If you find that the dough sticks to the rolling pin, put a piece of plastic wrap or parchment paper between the dough and the rolling pin. Cut the dough into shapes, Using cookie cutters or a knife. Carefully lift the cookies with a palette knife onto baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Be sure to place the cookies an inch or so apart on the sheets, so that they are not touching. Bake the cookies for 12 to 15 minutes until they are lightly browned on the edges, before placing them on wire racks to cool. The cookies will harden as they cool.
