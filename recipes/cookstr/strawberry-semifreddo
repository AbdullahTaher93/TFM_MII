Lightly brush the springform pan with vegetable oil. Line the bottom with parchment paper. Purèe the strawberries in a blender or food processor. Whip the cream with the confectioner's sugar just until soft peaks form. Fold into the strawberry purèe, then fold in the crushed meringues and liqueur. Spread the mixture evenly in the pan. Cover and freeze for at least 6 hours or overnight. Meanwhile, make the strawberry coulis. Purèe the strawberries, then strain through a fine wire sieve to remove the seeds. Stir in the lemon juice, then the sugar, adding more sugar if needed. Just before serving, remove the sides of the springform. Invert onto a platter and peel off the paper. Cut into slices, dipping a sharp knife into hot water between slices. Transfer each slice to a plate. Spoon the coulis around each serving and garnish each with a whole strawberry. Serve chilled.
