Toast the cumin seeds and coriander in a dry pan over medium heat for 1 minute, or until fragrant. Transfer to a large bowl and cool. Add the flour, yeast, and salt and stir. Mix in the chickpeas and cilantro. Make a well in the center, add the water and yogurt, and stir to make a sticky dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand for 10 minutes. Knead the dough on a lightly floured work surface about 8 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Shape into a ball. Place in an oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm place about 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Lightly dust 2 large baking sheets with flour. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and cut into 8 equal pieces. Using a rolling pin, flatten out into ovals about ¼ in (5mm) thick. Place on the baking sheets. Brush each with oil and sprinkle with cumin seeds. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the breads are golden and puffed.
