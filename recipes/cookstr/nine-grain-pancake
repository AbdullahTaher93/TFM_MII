Place the brown rice in a small saucepan, add 1 cup water, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and let simmer until the rice is tender, about 30 minutes. Transfer the rice to a separate dish to cool completely. Combine the nine-grain mix, flax seeds, sesame seeds, and sunflower seeds in a bowl. Bring 1¼ cups water to a boil, and pour it over the grains and seeds. Let them soak for 30 minutes or until they’re soft. Place the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and oats in a mixing bowl. Stir to combine, and make a well in the center. In a separate bowl, whisk together the molasses, buttermilk, egg yolks, the grain and seed mixture, and ½ cup of the cooked brown rice. Pour the liquid mixture into the well, and combine with a wooden spoon. In an electric mixer fitted with the wire whisk attachment, whisk the egg whites at high speed until soft peaks form. Using a rubber spatula, fold the whites into the flour mixture. (You can hold the batter in the refrigerator until you’re ready to use it, but keep in mind that the sooner you bake the pancakes, the lighter they’ll be.) Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 350°F. Preheat two 9-inch cast-iron skillets in the oven for 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter to each pan and swirl it around to coat the pan. Pour one fourth of the batter into each pan, transfer them to the oven, and bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Check the pancakes the same way you would a regular cake: the pancakes are ready when a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean. Flip each pancake onto a plate, and serve. Bake the other 2 pancakes the same way.
