Place a medium to large skillet over medium heat and wait about 2 minutes. Add the oil and swirl to coat the pan. Add the onion, saut√© for 5 minutes, then cover the pan and lower the heat. Cook, covered, for 15 minutes, stirring once or twice during this time. Stir in the salt and vinegar. Cover and cook for another 5 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and sugar and cook, uncovered, for about 5 more minutes. Remove from the heat, and stir in the lemon zest. Cool to room temperature, then pack into a tightly capped jar. Cover and refrigerate for up to 3 weeks. Serve cold or at room temperature.
