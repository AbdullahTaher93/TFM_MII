Stir the yogurt and salt together. Spoon onto a large piece of rinsed and squeezed dry cheesecloth. Gather together the four corners and tie the top of the bundle with a long length of kitchen twine to make a bag. Tie the bag on a faucet or cabinet knob and suspend over a bowl. Let the whey drain from yogurt for at least 12 hours. Remove the thickened yogurt from the cheesecloth, shape into a ball, and place on a platter.
