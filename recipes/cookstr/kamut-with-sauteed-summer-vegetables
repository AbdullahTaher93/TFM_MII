In a saucepan, combine kamut and stock. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight (see Notes). Bring stock and kamut to room temperature. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, reduce heat and simmer for 45 to 60 minutes or until kamut is tender and most of the liquid is absorbed. Drain, rinse and let cool. In a skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add bell pepper, zucchini, peas and corn. Sauté for 4 minutes or until vegetables are tender-crisp. Stir in kamut, parsley and tamari and heat through. Serve immediately or chill before serving. Variations: Add a chopped fresh garlic clove in Step 3. For protein, add 1 or 2 cups (250 or 500 mL) cooked chickpeas or lentils in Step 4. Garnish with ½ cup (125 mL) chopped nuts.
