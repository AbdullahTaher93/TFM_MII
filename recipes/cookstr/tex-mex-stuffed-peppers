Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Coat a shallow roasting pan with cooking spray. Cook the rice according to the package directions. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the beef and cook until no longer pink, about 5 minutes, breaking up the meat as it cooks. Add the chili powder, cumin, oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper and cook for 1 minute. Add the cooked rice, corn, beans, and sour cream and cook for 1 minute to heat through. Remove from the heat and stir in the cilantro. Stuff the beef mixture into the bell peppers and arrange them side by side in the prepared pan. Top with the shredded cheese. Bake until the peppers are soft and the cheese is golden and bubbly, about 30 minutes.
