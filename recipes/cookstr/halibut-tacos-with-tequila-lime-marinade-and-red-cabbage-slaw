To prepare the slaw, toss the cabbage with the salt. Place in a colander. Locate a bowl that will fit nicely into the colander, fill it with water, and set it on top of the cabbage. Set this in the sink. The weight of the bowl of water will help force water from the cabbage, concentrating its flavor. In a large bowl, mix the grated apple with the mustard seeds, cilantro, apple cider vinegar, and olive oil. Give the cabbage a squeeze with those fancy kitchen tools of yours called “hands.” Rinse the salt off the cabbage and squeeze again, getting all the liquid out. Combine the cabbage with the rest of the slaw ingredients and season to taste with salt. Set aside. To prepare the marinade, combine all of its ingredients in a small bowl. To prepare the halibut, place it in a large pan. Pour the marinade over the fillet and set aside for 20 minutes. In a grill pan or sauté pan over high heat, add the vegetable oil. Add the halibut, reserving the marinade, and cook until the fish is browned on one side, about 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the halibut carefully and continue cooking until the fish is thinking about flaking, but not quite yet flaking, about 8 minutes per inch of fish (measured at its thickest point). The fish will continue to cook a bit more after you take it from the heat. Transfer the fish to a platter. Add the marinade to the pan (or get out a fresh pan if you grilled the fish) and cook the marinade over high heat for 5 to 7 minutes, until the liquid evaporates and the jalapenos and onions are lightly charred. Then add the marinade back on top of the fish, which, by this point, should be flaking nicely. Set up the best taco bar you’ve ever seen, with warmed tortillas; bowls of sour cream, guacamole, and red cabbage slaw; the platter of halibut with charred jalapenos and onions; limes; shot glasses filled with good tequila; and beer, lots of beer.
