Get all your ingredients chopped and ready to go. Rub the crushed peppercorns into the pork slices. Heat your wok and a frying pan to make them as hot as you can. Add the oils to the hot wok and fry the ginger, chilli and mushrooms for 1 minute until slightly colored. Throw in the pepper, spring onions, pak choi, garlic and bean sprouts, and stir-fry until wilted. Add the noodles, fish and oyster sauces, cilantro and stock. Stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes until steaming hot. Taste and season with soy sauce. Meanwhile, drizzle a little sunflower oil into the hot frying pan and fry the pork for 2 minutes each side, or until cooked through and golden. Remove from the heat and serve with the stir fry.
