Wash and drain the asparagus, then cut into approximately 1-inch lengths, discarding the tough thick bottom ends. Set aside. In a small bowl, mix together the ginger, garlic, and ground coriander. Set aside. Heat a wide heavy skillet or a wok over medium-high heat. Add the oil and swirl to coat the pan, then add the fenugreek and stir. After about 20 seconds, add the sliced onion and stir-fry until softened and starting to brown, about 7 minutes. Stir in the reserved flavor paste. Add the asparagus and sprinkle on the turmeric and salt. Stir-fry for a minute to expose all the surfaces of the asparagus to the hot pan, then add the water. Bring to a boil, cover, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the lid and cook for a few minutes more (timing will vary depending on the thickness and freshness of the asparagus), until the asparagus is just tender. Taste and adjust the salt if necessary. Serve hot.
