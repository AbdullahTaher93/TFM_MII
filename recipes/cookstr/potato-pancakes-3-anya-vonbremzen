Grate the potatoes coarsely by hand or in a food processor using a coarse grating blade. Squeeze the mixture in a clean linen or cotton (not terry cloth) kitchen towel to remove any excess moisture. Let the mixture stand for 5 minutes and squeeze again. Rinse the potatoes in several changes of cold water. Drain and squeeze again to remove as much moisture as possible. In a bowl, combine the potatoes with the onion and carrot and stir well with a fork. Sprinkle on the flour and mix in. Add the milk, egg, baking powder, and salt and pepper, and mix thoroughly. Heat about ½ inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Drop the potato mixture by tablespoonfuls into the oil and press gently with a spatula to flatten. Fry until golden brown on both sides. Transfer to drain on paper towels (if necessary, keep the fried deruni warm in a 200°F oven). Repeat the process with the remaining potato mixture. Serve at once.
