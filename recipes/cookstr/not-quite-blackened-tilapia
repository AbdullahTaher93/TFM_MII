Prepare the spice mixture: Combine all the ingredients for the spice mixture in a small bowl. Place the melted butter in a bowl. Heat a heavy nonstick skillet over high heat for 5 minutes (see Notes). Meanwhile, dip the fish fillets in the butter. Sprinkle them allover with the spice mixture. Reduce the heat very slightly and sear the coated fish, 2 fillets at a time until very dark brown and crispy, 2 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining 2 fish fillets. Serve immediately, garnished with lime halves.
