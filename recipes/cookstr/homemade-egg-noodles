In a medium bowl, mix together the flour and eggs to make a dough. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until elastic. Form into a ball and let rest for 15 minutes. Using a rolling pin to roll the dough into an oval sheet, roll the dough outward until very thin. On a lightly floured cloth, place the dough so that one third of it is on the cloth and two thirds of the sheet hangs off the table or counter. Carefully stretch the sheet out further. Lightly flour the sheet and roll it up into about a 3-inch-diameter tube. Flatten and use a sharp knife to slice the dough into very thin noodles. Separate the noodles and form them into a nest. You may now use the noodles in any noodle recipe. You can boil them in chicken stock to make soup. You can pan fry them in oil and garlic and top with soy sauce. You can top them with any stir-fry combination.
