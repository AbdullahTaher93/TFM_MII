Soak the salt cod, immersed in cool water, overnight in the refrigerator, covered well—two nights are even better. Change the water four times at 3-hour intervals during day hours. Drain the salt cod well and pat it dry, pressing out excess water. Clean thoroughly, removing any skin and bones. Finely chop the salt cod and put it into a bowl with the eggs, currants, pine nuts, parsley, garlic, onion, salt and pepper to taste, and the bread crumbs, and mix well. Form the mixture into little egg shapes and coat with flour. Heat ½ inch of sunflower or vegetable oil in a large frying pan until the oil is hot but not smoking. Cook the salt-cod eggs until golden brown allover and serve immediately with lemon wedges.
