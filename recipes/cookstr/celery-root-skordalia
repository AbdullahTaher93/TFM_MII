Cut both ends of the celery root so it stands on a cutting board, Using a knife, peel it by following its shape, starting at the north pole, rounding out at the equator, and ending at the south pole, shave it without cutting into too much of the vegetable. After peeling, rinse the celery root to remove any dirt and then cut it into eighths. Place the pieces in a medium saucepan. Cover them with warm water and 1 teaspoon of the salt. Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat to medium and simmer about 25 minutes, until tender. Drain the celery root, reserving 1 cup of the cooking water. While the celery root is still hot, purée it in a food processor fitted with a metal blade, with the yogurt and 1 to 2 tablespoons of the reserved cooking liquid, until smooth and creamy, 3 to 4 minutes, Place the purée into a medium mixing bowl and set it aside. Place the potatoes in a medium saucepan with enough water to cover them and 1 tablespoon of the salt, and bring them to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer the potatoes for about 18 minutes, until tender, and then drain them. While the potatoes are still hot, mash them through a ricer or food mill and mix into the celery root. The ricer or food mill gives you a fine, fluffy puree. Place the almonds, garlic, remaining cooking liquid, lemon juice, and olive oil in a blender with 2 teaspoons of the salt, Blend until completely smooth, for about 2 minutes, so that there are no bits of nuts left and the mixture is blond and creamy. Fold the nut mixture into the potato-celery root mixture and reseason with salt and black pepper.
