Peel potatoes, and cut them into 2-inch pieces. Place them in a bowl covered with cold water, and soak for 10 minutes to remove starchiness; drain. Fill a large stockpot about three-quarters full with water, and bring to a boil. Add potatoes and 1 teaspoon salt; cook until tender (about 18 minutes). Drain thoroughly in a colander. To further remove moisture (no one wants watery mashed potatoes), return potatoes to the pot on medium to high heat for a minute or two, turning them constantly so they don’t burn. For the smoothest results, put them through a ricer. If you don’t have one, apply a lot of elbow grease to a potato masher. Do not mash them in a food processor or blender; it ruins the fluffy texture. Add 3 tablespoons schmaltz per pound of potatoes, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Optional additions: Sautéed finely chopped onion or roasted garlic. For the latter, preheat oven to 350 degrees, chop tip off garlic head to expose cloves, and pull off loose peel. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil, sprinkle with fresh pepper, and bake, wrapped in tin foil, for 45 minutes. Squeeze garlic head to release cloves, mash them up, and mix them into the potatoes. Alternately, you can simply sauté large chunks of garlic in olive oil. Variation: If you’re making mashed potatoes as an accompaniment for fish, you might substitute unsalted butter for schmaltz and whip in some heated cream or half-and-half (about 3?8 cup per pound of potatoes).
