Heat the oil in a 2-quart saucepan or small soup pot. Add the onion and garlic and saut√© over medium heat until golden. Add the broth, mushrooms, and soy sauce. Bring to a simmer, then cover and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand another 15 minutes. Strain through a sieve, reserving the mushrooms. Trim them of their tough stems. Save the caps the another use, or slice them and return to the broth.
