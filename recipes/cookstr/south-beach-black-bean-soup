Cook the black beans in enough Coca-Cola ham stock and water, if needed, to cover by about 2 inches until they’re tender. Let the liquid first come to a boil and then reduce the heat to low and cook, partially covered, for 1 to 1½ hours. Remove about 3 ladles of the soup to a blender, add the lime juice and ground spices, blitz to a muddy purée and stir this back into the pan of soup. And that’s it. Swirl some sour cream, as you please, into the bowls of soup as you ladle them out and sprinkle with freshly chopped cilantro. Plonk the lime wedges onto the table and let people squeeze the sharp juice into this dense, sweet soup as they eat.
