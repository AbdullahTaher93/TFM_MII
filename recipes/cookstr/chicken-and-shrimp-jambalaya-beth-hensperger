Combine the onion, celery, tomatoes with their juice, broth, tomato paste, Worcestershire, and Cajun seasoning in the slow cooker. Stir in the chicken and rice. Cover and cook until most of the liquid is absorbed, the chicken is cooked through, and the rice is tender, on LOW for 5 to 6 hours, or on HIGH for 2Â½ to 3 hours. Stir in the shrimp and green pepper, cover, and cook on HIGH for 10 to 15 minutes, until the shrimp is cooked through. Serve immediately in shallow bowls with fresh French bread and butter.
