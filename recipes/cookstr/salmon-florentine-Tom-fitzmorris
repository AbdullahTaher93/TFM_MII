Preheat the broiler. Lightly grease a baking sheet and set aside. Pick stems from the spinach; discard bad leaves. Wash the spinach in several changes of water. Place the wet spinach in a large saucepan and cook, uncovered, over medium-low heat until wilted. Drain the spinach and set aside until cool enough to handle. Squeeze out excess water, coarsely chop, and return to pan. Set the spinach aside. Combine the marinade ingredients in a wide bowl. Add the salmon fillets and marinate for a minute on each side. Lift the salmon from the marinade and place on the prepared baking sheet. Broil 3 inches from the heat for 3 minutes. Flip the fish, dot each with Â½ teaspoon of the butter and continue to broil for another 2-3 minutes. Loosely cover with foil to keep warm. To the spinach, add the cream and cook over medium-low heat, stirring, until the spinach is heated through. Meanwhile, melt the remaining butter in a saucepan over low heat. Add the dill, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and whisk constantly until a creamy sauce forms. Divide the spinach among 4 serving plates. Arrange a salmon fillet on top of the spinach on each plate and spoon sauce over all.
