Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Brush a baking sheet lightly with oil and set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, coriander, salt, and sugar. With a pastry blender or two knives, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Scatter in the cherries and orange zest. With a fork, stir in the buttermilk until just combined. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead it three or four times with floured hands. Divide the dough into 8 equal portions and shape each into a ball. Place the balls of dough on the baking sheet with at least 2 inches between them. With a sharp knife, cut a cross in the top of each ball. Refrigerate for 15 minutes. Bake the scones for 13 to 15 minutes, until golden brown.
