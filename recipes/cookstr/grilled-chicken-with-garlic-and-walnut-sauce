Rub the chicken pieces thoroughly with salt and pepper. Combine the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, tarragon, and additional salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Add the chicken and turn to coat with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, turning occasionally. In a food processor, combine the walnuts, garlic, and Â¼ cup of the cilantro. Process until the walnuts are finely ground. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the stock, lemon juice to taste, salt, coriander, fenugreek, cayenne, turmeric, and the remaining cilantro. Let the sauce stand at room temperature, covered, for at least 2 hours before serving. Makes about 2 cups. Prepare the coals for grilling until coated with white ash, or preheat the broiler. Oil the grill or broiler rack. Remove the chicken from the marinade and, without drying, grill or broil it 3 to 4 inches from the heat, turning a few times and basting with the marinade. The chicken is ready when the juices run clear when the thickest part of the thing is pricked with a skewer, after about 30 minutes. Serve the chicken with the sauce in a sauceboat.
