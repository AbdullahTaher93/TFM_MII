Heat a frying pan slightly. Place one tortilla in the pan and sprinkle with all the grated cheese, the sliced scallion and chile, if using. Cover with the other tortilla and press down with a spatula or your hands. The cheese will have started melting at this stage and the tortilla on the bottom should be golden brown. When it is, carefully turn it over and then cook the other side for another couple of minutes, until it is golden and all the cheese has melted. Transfer to a board and cut into wedges. Serve immediately on its own or with Crème Fraîche with Sweet Chili or Tomato and Cucumber Salsa. Variations: Quesadillas With Chicken: Make as for the basic quesadillas, but add 3 oz shredded cooked chicken with the grated cheese. Quesadillas With Spinach: Make as for the basic quesadillas, but add one handful of baby spinach leaves (½ oz) with the grated cheese.
