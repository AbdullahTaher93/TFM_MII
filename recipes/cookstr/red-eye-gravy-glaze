Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add the ham steak. Cook on both sides until browned and warmed through. Remove the meat from the pan when browned on the edges. (If using bacon, pour out any excess fat.) Raise the heat, and when the pan is really hot, pour in the espresso and scrape up the seasoned food bits from the pan surface. Add the molasses and brown sugar and stir into the coffee. Bring to a simmer, add salt, and taste. The glaze should be thick and black. Use immediately.
