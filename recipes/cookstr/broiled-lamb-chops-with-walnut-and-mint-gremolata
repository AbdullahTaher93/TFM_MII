Preheat the broiler to high and adjust the oven rack so that it is about 6 inches from the broiler element. Season the lamb chops generously with salt and pepper and evenly rub the olive oil over the meat. Place the lamb chops on a broiler pan and cook for 6 to 7 minutes per side for medium. While the lamb is cooking, make the gremolata: Use a food processor to chop the walnuts to the consistency of very coarse sand. Transfer the ground walnuts to a large mixing bowl and mix in the remaining ingredients. Top each lamb chop with a good sprinkling of the gremolata and serve.
