Heat oven to 375°F (190°C) with oven rack in middle. To Make the Crust: Combine graham cracker crumbs, pecans, and sugar in medium bowl. Add melted butter and mix well. Spoon crust into 9-inch (22.5-cm) pie pan. Using your fingers, press crumbs evenly into bottom and up sides of pie pan. Press along edge between bottom and side of pan so crust won’t be too thick. Bake 8 to 10 minutes until lightly browned and crust gives a little when touched lightly. Cool completely on wire cooling rack. This usually takes about 1 hour. To Make the Filling: Place chocolate and butter in a medium bowl set over, not in, simmering water until chocolate melts; or use a double boiler. Remove from heat. The last little lumps will melt as the mixture sits. Cool to room temperature. Reserve. Beat cream cheese in bowl of a heavy-duty mixer on Medium speed until soft and creamy. Scrape down sides of bowl, and add powdered sugar and vanilla. Continue beating on High speed until smooth. Gradually add whipping cream and continue beating until soft peaks form. Scrape down sides of bowl. Reduce mixer to Low speed and slowly beat in the melted chocolate. Continue beating until mixture stiffens slightly. Spoon filling into cooled crust. Smooth top and garnish with pecan halves. Chill several hours or freeze until serving. Spoon a little caramel sauce onto serving places and top with pie. Baker’s Note: If the pie is frozen, remove it from the freezer and plate it in refrigerator for several hours before serving. It can be cut and served while frozen, but I prefer to serve it with the filling softened. Secret to success: Toast the pecan halves by placing in a 350°F (180°C) oven for 8 to 10 minutes. Cool before placing on the pie.
