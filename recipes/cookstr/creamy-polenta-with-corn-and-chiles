In a large saucepan over medium heat, bring milk, garlic, rosemary, salt and black pepper to taste to a boil. Gradually add polenta, in a steady stream, whisking to remove all lumps. Continue whisking until mixture begins to thicken and bubbles like lava, about 5 minutes. Add corn, Jack and Parmesan cheeses and chiles and mix well. Transfer to slow cooker stoneware. Cover and cook on Low for 2 hours, until mixture is firm and just beginning to brown around the edges.
