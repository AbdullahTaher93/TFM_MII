In a large skillet, cook bacon over medium-high heat until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Drain off all but 1 tbsp (15 ml) fat from pan, reserving remainder. Add beef to pan, in batches, and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes per batch, adding more bacon drippings between batches if necessary. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to slow cooker stoneware as completed. Reduce heat to medium. Add onions to pan, adding more bacon drippings if necessary, and cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, thyme, salt and peppercorns; cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add flour and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Stir in tomato paste. Add beer, stock and bay leaves; bring to a boil. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute, scraping up any brown bits in the pan. Transfer to stoneware and stir well. 4. Cover and cook on Low for 8 hours or on High for 4 hours, until beef is tender. Stir in paprika solution and reserved bacon. Add collard greens, in batches, completely submerging each batch in liquid before adding another. Cover and cook on High for 30 minutes, until collards are tender. Discard bay leaves. MAKE AHEAD MAKE AHEAD
