In the workbowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade, process the beans until mashed. Add the olive oil, lemon juice. 1 tbsp of the water, the salt, and a few grinds of pepper. Process until pur√©ed and smooth, adding additional water until the spread is smooth and creamy. Scatter the garlic scapes over the top and pulse just until incorporated. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve immediately.
