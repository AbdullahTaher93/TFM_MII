Line a 13-by-9 inch jelly-roll pan with parchment or wax paper, then lightly grease the paper with nonstick cooking spray or butter. In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, stir the sugar and water together. Add the butter and corn syrup and clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pan. Place the pan over medium-high heat and bring the mixture a boil. Turn up the heat to high and continue to cook until the mixture turns deep golden brown and registers 350Â°F on the candy thermometer. Immediately turn off the heat and very carefully remove the candy thermometer. Stir in the salt with a large wooden spoon, a slotted metal spoon, or a heatproof spatula, then stir in the pine nuts. Make sure the caramel coats all the nuts. Turn the mixture out onto the jelly-roll pan, and using a spatula, spread it toward the sides of the pan so the nuts are in a single layer. Let the brittle cool completely before breaking it into pieces and storing in an airtight plastic container. Keep in a cool, dry place for up to 2 weeks.
