In a small bowl, lightly beat the egg with the sesame oil. Brush each tortilla with the egg mixture and then sprinkle two of the tortillas with the sesame seeds and green onions. Place one of the plain tortillas over each of the sprinkled tortillas and sandwich them together, pressing down to seal, forming two whole pancakes. Heat the peanut or vegetable oil in a saut√© pan over medium heat. When hot, add a pancake to the pan and cook until lightly browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining pancake, using more oil if needed.
