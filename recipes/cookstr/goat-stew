Trim the fat and membranes from the goat. Thoroughly rub with the lemon juice to remove any gamy taste. Rinse well, drain, and dry with paper towels. Put the garlic, oregano, cumin, curry powder, cloves, 2 teaspoons of the salt, the black pepper, and cayenne in a blender and process until smooth. Rub the goat with this paste, cover with plastic wrap, and let marinate in the refrigerator for a few hours or overnight. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring a few times, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the meat and cook, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Chop the tomatoes with their juices in a blender. Add to the pan along with the bouquet garni, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 2 hours. Add the wine and continue to cook until the meat is tender, about 1 hour. While the meat is cooking, prepare the eggplant. Peel and cut into 1-inch cubes. Place in a large bowl of cold water mixed with the remaining 1 tablespoon salt to remove the bitterness. After 30 minutes, drain well. Add to the stew when the meat is tender. Cook until the eggplant is very soft, about 20 minutes. Also while the meat is cooking, peel the potatoes, cut into 1-inch-thick rounds, and then cut into quarters. Cook in salted boiling water until tender. Add to the finished stew and simmer for 5 minutes to allow the potatoes to absorb some of the flavor. Taste for salt and black pepper and serve. To Serve: Serve with rice and Pattu.
