If grilling, prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill or preheat a gas grill. Place the tomatillos (or hog plums), shallots, and garlic cloves on a grill screen or other fine-mesh surface on the grill. Alternatively, place them in two heavy (preferably cast-iron) skillets over medium-high heat. Grill or cook, turning frequently, until well softened and touched with black patches all over, 10 to 15 minutes, depending on your cooking method. Set aside to cool. Meanwhile, place the water in a small pan and bring to a boil. Add the salt and pork and cook, stirring to break up lumps and to prevent sticking, until all the pork has changed color, about 1 minute. Set aside. Peel the grilled tomatillos, shallots, and garlic and trim off any very black spots. Place them in a blender or food processor and pulse or process briefly, just until you have a coarse sauce texture. Turn out into a bowl. Add the pork with its cooking liquid, and stir to blend together. Just before you serve the salsa, stir in the coriander. Taste and adjust the salt if you wish. Serve in a decorative bowl and provide a serving spoon so guests can help themselves. Leftovers will keep for several days stored in a tightly sealed glass container in the refrigerator.
