Pour the mirin into a medium pot, set it over medium heat, and bring it to a simmer. Add the shoyu and bring it to a gentle boil, then add the fish flakes and quickly turn off the heat. Let stand until the fish flakes all sink to the bottom of the pot. Strain the liquid through a strainer lined with a fukin, finely woven cotton cloth, or a doubled paper towel and discard the fish flakes. Transfer the liquid to a sterilized bottle and store, capped, in the refrigerator. The sauce will keep for half a year. The longer it is stored, the milder and better the flavor becomes.
