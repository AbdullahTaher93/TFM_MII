In a medium-sized saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil and sauté the scallions for about 3 minutes. Add the peas and coat them in the oil, stirring. Add the stock and mint and cook for about 10-15 minutes. Transfer to a blender and whiz in batches if the blender isn’t big enough. Cool in the fridge, season and whirl in the creme fraiche. Serve with a bit more mint chopped on top.
