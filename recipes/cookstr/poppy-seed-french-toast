In a bowl, whisk together the poppy seeds, eggs, milk, vanilla, nutmeg, and sugar. Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat. Dip one slice of the bread into the egg batter, then quickly take it out (I gently squeeze some of the batter back into the bowl so the bread isn’t dripping wet). Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over the griddle or in the skillet, and add the dipped bread. Continue dipping bread slices, stirring the batter frequently so all the poppy seeds don’t sink to the bottom, and laying the bread on the griddle or in the skillet until no more bread will fit. Cook the slices for about 2 minutes per side, or until they are golden. Keep the French toast warm in a slow oven while you melt more butter and use the rest of the bread and batter. Serve the French toast with maple syrup.
