In a wide saut√© pan or saucepan over low heat, melt butter. Add onions, season with salt, and stir to coat with butter. Cover pan and, stirring occasionally, cook until softened, 20 to 25 minutes. Uncover and cook just until most of the liquid has evaporated. Look for the viscous texture of a marmalade. Stir in chives and season with salt and pepper to taste.
