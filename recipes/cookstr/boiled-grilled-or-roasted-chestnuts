1 To boil: Place in a pot with lightly salted water to cover and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat after 3 or 4 minutes. Remove a few chestnuts from the water at a time and use a sharp knife to cut off the outer and inner skins. Use the chestnuts in other recipes, or reheat according to the directions for Precooked Vegetables in Butter or Oil (see Notes). 2 To grill or roast: Start a charcoal or wood fire, or preheat a gas grill, or turn the oven to 450Â°F. Place the chestnuts directly on the grill, or on a sheet of aluminum foil with holes poked in it, or on a baking sheet. Grill (preferably with the cover down) or roast, turning occasionally, until you can remove the shells easily, about 15 minutes. Eat warm, out of hand.
