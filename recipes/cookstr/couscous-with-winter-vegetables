Warm the butter in a wide, heavy pot or casserole, add the onion, and cook over medium heat for 1 or 2 minutes. Add the saffron, ground spices, and cinnamon stick. Lightly salt and cook for another 3 minutes or until the onions have begun to soften, stirring occasionally. The onions should be exceedingly aromatic and golden. Add the turnips, carrots, parsnips, squash, chick-peas, raisins, jalape√±o, cilantro, and parsley. Give the mixture another stir to combine; then add the broth (or water if beans were canned). Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer, covered, for 25 minutes or until the vegetables are nearly tender. Add the peas and cook until everything is done, another 5 minutes or so. Taste for salt. (You can cook the vegetables ahead of time, up to the point of adding the peas, and then finish them just before serving.) Make the cilantro salsa and the red sauce below and cook the couscous. Combine all the ingredients in a small saucepan. Break up the paste with a spoon or whisk, boil vigorously for a minute, and remove from the heat. Bring the water to a boil, add the salt, and stir in the couscous. Remove from the heat, cover, and set aside until all the liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Lightly fluff the grains with a fork and pile them into a mound in the middle of a shallow, round platter. Serve the vegetables over the top and serve the sauces on the side.
