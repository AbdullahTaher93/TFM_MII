Using a kitchen scrub pad (such as a Dobie pad), vigorously wash the clams under cold running water. Place in a large bowl of cold water and swish the water to dislodge any remaining debris. Pour off the water and rinse the clams 2 or 3 more times, or until the water is perfectly clear. Combine the garlic, parsley, and bay leaf in a large shallow nonreactive saucepan over medium heat. Add the wine and bring to a boil. Boil for about 5 minutes, or until reduced by half. Add 2 quarts water and bring to a simmer. Put the clams into the broth, cover, and raise the heat. Bring to a low simmer and cook for about 15 minutes, or until the clams have opened and a fragrant broth has formed. Turn off the heat and steep for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and drain well through a fine sieve, discarding the solids. Taste the broth. If too strongly flavored for your taste, add water, Â¼ cup at a time. Place in an ice bath to cool quickly. Store, covered and refrigerated, for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 3 weeks.
