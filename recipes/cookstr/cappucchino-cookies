Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). In a medium bowl, stir together flour, cocoa, cinnamon and salt; set aside. In a small bowl, dissolve coffee in vanilla; set aside. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat together egg, ¾ cup (175 mL) of the granulated sugar, brown sugar and shortening until fluffy. Gradually beat in flour mixture and coffee mixture until dough starts to hold together. Divide mixture into 48 equal portions and form into 1-inch (2.5 cm) balls. Place the remaining granulated sugar in a small bowl and roll each ball in sugar to coat. Arrange cookies on prepared baking sheet, leaving 1 inch (2.5 cm) between each. Bake in batches in preheated oven for about 20 minutes, or until firm to the touch.
