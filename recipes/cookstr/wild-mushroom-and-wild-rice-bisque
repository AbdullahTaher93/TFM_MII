Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, carrot, celery, and cremini mushrooms and saut√© until the vegetables brown lightly, about 6 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme, and rosemary and cook for another minute. Transfer to a 5- to 6-quart slow cooker. Add the wild rice, dried wild mushrooms, beef broth, tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Cover the cooker and cook on high for 4 hours, or on low for 6 to 8 hours, until the wild rice is tender. Stir in the potato flakes and parsley and cook on high for 10 minutes
