In a 4-quart saucepan, combine the rice, milk, and water. Place over medium heat, cover, and bring to a simmer. Lower the heat and simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Keep an eye on this, as the milk has a tendency to boil over. The rice should be fully cooked and soft. Remove from the heat. When the rice is done, place the sugar and egg yolks in a medium mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Slowly add small amounts of the rice mixture to the egg mixture, whisking constantly. Once you have added half of the rice mixture to the egg and sugar, return this to the saucepan and place over low heat. Add the salt and vanilla and cook for 2 minutes, whisking constantly. Remove from the heat and ladle the pudding into 8 (8-ounce) ramekins. Sprinkle the top of each with a little cinnamon.
