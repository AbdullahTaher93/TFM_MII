Cut off the tops of the oranges and keep them to use as lids. Scoop the insides out of the oranges and chop in a food processor or blender. Strain into a bowl, with the juice of 4 more oranges and the juice of 1 lemon. In a heavy pan, dissolve the sugar in ½ cup water and heat gently until the sugar has completely dissolved. Allow to cool and mix with the orange juice. Fill the empty oranges with the mixture and freeze. If there is more than enough, freeze the rest separately. Twenty minutes before serving, preheat the oven to 450°F and make the meringue. Beat the egg whites with a few drops of lemon juice until stiff, then gradually add the powdered sugar, beating all the time. Remove the oranges from the freezer, arrange them in an ovenproof dish, and surround them with ice cubes. Pour a little Cointreau into each one and spoon some of the meringue on top. Bake for 3 or 4 minutes, until the meringue is golden. Serve at once with their lids.
