Place the flour, salt, and pepper in a large bowl and season the brisket on both sides, shaking off any excess. In a large casserole, heat 1½ tablespoons of the vegetable oil over medium-high heat until hot, about 2 minutes. Add the meat and brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. If the pan dries out, add the remaining ½ tablespoon of oil. Remove the meat and clean out the pot. In the same pot, heat the olive oil over low heat. Add the onions, leeks, and garlic and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add the carrots, celery, parsnips, and half the parsley and cook another 5 minutes, making sure to stir the vegetables around thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the meat back to the pot. Spread the tomato paste on top of the meat. Raise the heat to high and add the wine and broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, add the bay leaf, and cook, covered, for about 2 hours, spooning the sauce on top of the meat every go minutes or so. The meat is ready when it feels tender when gently prodded with a small, sharp knife. Taste the sauce for seasoning. Let cool 10 minutes off the heat before serving. If making the brisket a day ahead of time, cover and refrigerate overnight. Spoon off any excess fat that has risen to the surface. Reheat in a 350 degree F oven for about 20 minutes, or until hot and bubbling throughout. Transfer the meat to a carving board and cut into ½ inch slices. Serve the meat topped with the vegetables and juices from the pot. Sprinkle with the remaining parsley. Season to taste.
