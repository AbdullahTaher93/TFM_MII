Bring 6 cups water to a boil and add the pork. Cook for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to a simmer and add the rest of the ingredients (except the garnish). Salt to taste. Cook, covered, for 1Â½ to 2 hours (or longer), stirring and adding water if needed. Serve in soup bowls. Pass around a plate of garnishes for everyone at the table to add to their soup.
