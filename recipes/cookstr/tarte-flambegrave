Heat the oil and butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the onions and cover. Cook 10 minutes, until softened. Uncover and cook, stirring often, 15 minutes, until golden. Let cool. Beat the fromage blanc, eggs, and cornstarch until smooth. Stir in enough créme fraîche until the mixture is spreadable. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Lightly oil two 13 × 9in (33 × 23cm) rimmed baking sheets. Cut the dough in half and stretch and press each portion into a baking sheet. Spread an equal amount of the cheese mixture over each, leaving a 1in (2.5cm) border, and top with equal amounts of the onion and bacon. Bake for 30 minutes, until the crust is golden brown. Serve hot.
