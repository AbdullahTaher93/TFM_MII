To Make the Beef: Place the beef in a shallow dish and cover with the shallots, oil, rosemary, thyme, and garlic. Cover in plastic wrap, refrigerate, and marinate the meat overnight. Remove the filet from the refrigerator and allow it to come to room temperature, about 1 hour. Remove any remaining garlic, shallots, and herbs from the meat. Season with salt and pepper on all sides. Tuck the tip end under to make a uniformly thick piece of meat and tie the roast crosswise with kitchen twine every 2 inches, inserting the rosemary sprigs under the twine. Prepare a medium-hot grill. Grill the meat uncovered, turning a few times, until an instant-read thermometer reads 125°F. for medium rare, about 35 to 40 minutes. Transfer the filet to a carving board and let it rest for 15 to 20 minutes. If you plan to serve the meat cold, wrap it in plastic and refrigerate. When ready to serve, carve in ½-inch slices and serve with Watercress Sauce on the side. To Make the Watercress Sauce: In a blender or food processor, pulse the watercress until finely chopped. Add the crème fraîche, mayonnaise, salt, and pepper and process until smooth. Transfer to a bowl or plastic container and refrigerate until ready to use. It will keep for up to 5 days.
