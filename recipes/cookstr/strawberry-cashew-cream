Place the cashews in a food processor and grind to a meal. While the processor is running, gradually add the soymilk through the opening at the top. Then add the maple syrup and vanilla. When the mixture is well blended, add the strawberries, and continue to blend until the mixture has the consistency of whipped cream. Taste and more maple syrup, if desired. Use immediately. For A Change: • Use cherries or blackberries instead of strawberries. • Substitute almonds for the cashews, and increase the soymilk to ½ cup • Replace the fresh strawberries with frozen. The consistency will be more like a sauce, but still very tasty.
