Heat the ¼ cup olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the shallots, garlic, chili, and kale and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are just beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the lentils, a healthy pinch of salt, and the water. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer gently until the lentils and kale are not just cooked through, but really soft and lovely, a good hour, maybe even two; it will depend on the age and type of lentil you choose. Splash the mixture with additional water as it cooks if it’s threatening to dry out; you want the final product to be moist, but not at all brothy. Just before serving, stir in the nutmeg and season the mixture with salt. Serve hot or at room temperature with generous spoonfuls of cold crème fraîche and a healthy drizzle of the raw, high-quality, extra-virgin olive oil.
