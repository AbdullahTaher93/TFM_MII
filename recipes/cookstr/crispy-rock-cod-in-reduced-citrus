Combine the orange juice, ginger, salt, cayenne, and maple syrup in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat and simmer to reduce by about half (until you have about 1 cup). Taste and adjust salt and sweetness. Whisk the egg and flour until smooth and add a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Spoon this mixture onto one side of each fillet and sprinkle on the rice flakes. Melt the butter with the olive oil in a large skillet over low heat. Add the fish, coated side down. Saut√© until golden and crisp, 4 or 5 minutes. Flip the fish and cook for 2 or 3 minutes longer. Spoon about a tablespoon of the sauce onto each individual plate and place the fish, crispy side up, on each one. Top with chives.
