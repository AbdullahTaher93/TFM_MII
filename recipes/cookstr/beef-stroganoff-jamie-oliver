Dust the steaks with the flour and paprika. Heat a pan and add half the oil and butter. When the butter is foaming, sear the steaks in the pan â€“ cook for 2 minutes on each side and remove to a plate. To make the sauce, add the rest of the oil and butter to the pan and gently fry the onion, garlic, thyme and mushrooms for 4 minutes. Add the brandy to the pan and simmer for 3 minutes. To finish the sauce, add the sour cream, chopped gherkin and steaks. Heat through and season to taste. Slice each steak thinly and spoon over the sauce. Delicious served with rice and green beans.
