Rub the shrimp with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Then squeeze the orange halves over the shrimp and simmer in a large frying pan, covered, for 5 minutes. Remove the shrimp to a bowl and add a few ice cubes to prevent the shrimp from discoloring or shrinking. Strain the juice from the frying pan and pour into the bowl of a blender or food processor. Add 1 cup each of the parsley and cilantro as well as the tomato to the juice, then pulverize. Peel the shrimp, cut in half lengthwise, and return to the bowl. Stir the diced onion, sugar, and salt in a bowl with the herb mixture. Cut the limes in half. Stick the tines of the fork in the center of a lime and rotate it as you squeeze it over the shrimp and onions, discarding any seeds. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the ketchup and mix with a spoon then toss with the shrimp. Refrigerate for a couple of hours, until cold. Just before serving, dice and add the avocado. Serve the ceviche in individual bowls, topped with dabs of ketchup or hot sauce and sprinkled with the remaining parsley and cilantro. Pass the plantain chips.
