Cook bacon, stirring often, in a Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel to drain; discard all but 2 tablespoons of fat from the pan. Add leeks to the Dutch oven. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are limp, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the beer, bay leaf and thyme; heat to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer; cook 2 minutes. Add mussels; cover. Cook, stirring once halfway through cooking, until all shells are open, about 5 minutes. Turn off heat; transfer the mussels with a slotted spoon to 4 shallow bowls. Whisk the cold butter into the liquid in the Dutch oven; season with salt, pepper to taste and a few drops of lemon juice. Pour over mussels in bowls; garnish with reserved bacon.
