Cream butter with sugar until light and fluffy. Add almonds, extract, egg and yolk to butter and mix thoroughly. Gradually stir in flour until dough is smooth enough to handle. Knead for a minute or two, until smooth, on a lightly floured board. Wrap in waxed paper and chill for 2 hours. Using a generous amount of butter, grease small fluted tart-shell pans. Press an even layer of dough into each pan, making sure that you press it firmly into all the identations. Bake in preheated 375Â° oven for about 15 minutes, or until a pale golden sand color. Invert over rack and tap bottom of mold gently with a spoon or rub with a cool damp cloth until tart slips out. Cool completely and serve plain or filled with whipped cream and a dab of jam or jelly.
