Peel and devein the shrimp, reserving the shells. Chop the shrimp finely. Put the shells in a saucepan with enough water just to cover them. Bring to a simmer, adjust the heat to maintain a simmer, and cook for 15 minutes. Strain and discard the solids. Reserve the broth. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over high heat until hot. Add the garlic and sauté until lightly browned. Add the basil and the red pepper flakes and allow them to crackle in the hot oil for about 15 seconds. Add the shrimp, season with salt and pepper, and stir for about 1 minute. Add the white wine and simmer until the wine is reduced by half. Add the Marinara Sauce and ¾ cup of the reserved shrimp broth and simmer for another minute. Taste and adjust the seasoning, then stir in the parsley and the butter. The sauce should be brothy, as the pasta will absorb some of the liquid. Keep the sauce warm over low heat while you cook the pasta. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until it is just shy of al dente, then drain and return to the warm pot over moderate heat. Add the sauce and cook briefly so the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Serve immediately in warmed bowls.
