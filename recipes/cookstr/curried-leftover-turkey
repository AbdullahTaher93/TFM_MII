Saut√© the onion in the butter till soft. Add the apple and green pepper and cook till tender. Mix in the curry powder and cook for a few minutes to remove the raw taste. Pour in the broth and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the turkey pieces and cook until they are heated through. Mix in any leftover turkey gravy. Season to taste and mix in the grapes. Serve with steamed rice, chutney, chopped salted peanuts, thinly sliced cucumbers dressed with oil and vinegar, and baked bananas. Beer is good with this.
