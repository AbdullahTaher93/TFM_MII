The chicken should be cut to yield 2 pieces of breast, 2 wings, 2 legs, and 2 second joints. Save the back, wing tips, neck, and giblets for a broth. Dredge the chicken with a mixture of the flour, salt, and pepper. Heat the butter in a large skillet and brown the chicken. Transfer to a hot platter. Add the onion, green pepper, garlic, curry powder, and thyme to the skillet. Stir over low heat and scrape loose the browned residue in the pan. Add the stewed tomatoes, with their liquid. Arrange the chicken in the skillet, skin side up. Cover and cook slowly until tender, about 20 to 30 minutes. Stir the currants into the sauce. Serve topped with the toasted almonds. Variation: For the final cooking, the dish may be baked, covered, in a 325Â°F oven until tender, about 45 minutes.
