Lightly butter shallow a microwave-safe dish. Peel the apples, cut them in half, then core them and slice them into 6 to 8 slices. Spread them out over the bottom of the buttered baking dish. Sprinkle with the vanilla, sugar, sherry, cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg, and half the lavender flowers. Cook at 100% power for about 7 minutes or until the apples are softened and pierce easily with a knife. Transfer the apples to a serving dish and sprinkle with the remaining lavender flowers.
