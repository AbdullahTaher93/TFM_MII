Preheat the oven to 350Â°. Grease two 12-cup muffin tins. Place them in the oven to warm. Soak the farfel in water to cover for 1 minute; drain. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs with the salt and pepper. Stir in the farfel and mix well. Spoon the mixture into the muffin tins, filling each cup. Bake until the tops become golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Serve immediately.
