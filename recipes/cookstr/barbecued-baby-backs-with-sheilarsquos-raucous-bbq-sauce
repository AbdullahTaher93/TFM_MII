For the Sauce: Combine all the ingredients in a heavy saucepan. Add 1 cup water, stir well, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the sauce has thickened slightly and the flavors have blended, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour the sauce through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, discarding the onion and garlic. Taste, and adjust the seasonings as needed. Use immediately, or let the sauce cool to room temperature, transfer it to a covered container, and refrigerate it for up to 1 week. Makes 3 Cups For the Ribs: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place the ribs, meaty side up, in a shallow roasting pan. Pour 1½ cups of the barbecue sauce over the ribs, and pour ½ cup water into the bottom of the pan. Bake, basting occasionally, for 1 hour. Meanwhile, preheat a barbecue grill to high and then reduce the heat to medium. Oil the grill grate well. Remove the ribs from the oven and arrange them, meaty side down, on the grill. Grill, brushing them occasionally with the extra barbecue sauce, until they are caramelized and have some nice grill marks, about 5 minutes. Put the ribs on a large cutting board and cut them apart, slicing between the bones. Arrange them on a large platter and serve, with extra sauce on the side for dipping.
