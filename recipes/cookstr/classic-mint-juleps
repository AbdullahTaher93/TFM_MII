First, make the sugar syrup (simple syrup). Mix the sugar with 1 cup water in a small saucepan, bring to a simmer, and cook just until the sugar dissolves. Pour into a container, add 1 bunch of the mint, cover, and refrigerate overnight. Remove the mint, draining it well, and discard it. For each julep, fill a metal julep cup (or an old-fashioned glass) with crushed ice. Pour in 1 tablespoon of the mint syrup and 2 ounces (Â¼ cup) bourbon. Stir. Add a splash of club soda, if desired, garnish with fresh mint, and serve.
