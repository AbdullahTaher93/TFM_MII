Preheat the oven to 475°F. In a small pot over medium-low heat, melt together the butter and olive oil. Rinse the chicken well and pat dry with paper towels. Season the cavity with salt and pepper and stuff with the fresh herbs and garlic cloves. Arrange the diced vegetables in an even layer on the bottom of a roasting pan just big enough to accommodate the chicken (13 by 9 by 2 inches). Place the chicken breast-side up on top of the vegetables and brush with the butter mixture. Sprinkle on all sides with salt and pepper and herbes de Provence. Roast 15 minutes, then turn the chicken on its side, brush with the butter mixture, and roast 10 minutes. Turn, brush, and roast on the other side, about 8 minutes. Reduce the oven to 400°F. Turn the chicken breast-side up and roast 18 to 20 minutes more, basting 2 or 3 times with pan juices and butter; the juices should run clear when the chicken is pierced at the junction of the leg and thigh. Remove from the pan and let rest 5 minutes before carving. For the pan sauce: Spoon or pour off the grease from the roasting pan. Place the pan over high heat, add the stock, and cook, scraping up the cooked-on bits from the bottom of the pan. Bring to a boil and reduce to one third of its original volume. Whisk in the butter. Season to taste and stir in the optional herbs. To serve, carve the chicken and serve with the pan sauce. Variations: Use fresh rosemary, thyme, sage, oregano, or any other herbs you prefer. If desired, strip the leaves from a sprig of rosemary and sprinkle over the chicken before roasting.
