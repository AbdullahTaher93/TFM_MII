Rub the interior of the chicken with half a lemon. Stuff it with the following mixture: Fry the sausage meat in a skillet till it is rendered of its fat. Pour off most of the fat and add the onions and garlic. Let this cook a few minutes before adding the bread crumbs. Mix well and add the reserved liver and gizzard chopped, and the parsley, thyme, and salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and let cool. Add the beaten egg yolks. Mix thoroughly with the hands and stuff the bird, but not too tightly. Place a crust of old bread over the vent and sew it up securely. Tie the neck skin and truss the bird (see Notes). Place in a large pot with beef shin, veal neck, and a small piece of salt pork or bacon (see Variation in Notes). Cover with cold water, bring to a boil, and skim. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer till the chicken is tender, about 50 to 60 minutes. Remove the chicken to cool. Reduce the broth by one-third until you have one that is rich and strong. Skim off the fat. Serve the hot broth in bowls, and follow with the cooled chicken and the stuffing, which may be removed and sliced. Serve with a good mustard mayonnaise and salad. VARIATION: Carrots and onions may be added to the broth while it is cooking, and then may be served with the soup. You may also flavor the broth with parsley, thyme, and rosemary.
