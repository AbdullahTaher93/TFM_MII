Combine the walnuts and almonds in a large bowl. Cover with water and let soak for 10 minutes. (This step will help the spices adhere to the nuts.) Place the pumpkin seeds in a separate bowl. Cover with water and let soak for 10 minutes. Drain the nuts, dry the bowl, and return the nuts to the bowl. Add the remaining ingredients and mix well. Using a slotted spoon, remove the nuts from the bowl and arrange on a baking sheet. Bake in a preheated 350Â°F oven for 5 minutes. Drain the pumpkin seeds and place in the bowl with the remaining spice mixture. Stir to coat, then add to the roasting nuts. Bake 5 minutes, or until the nuts and seeds are dry and lightly toasted.
