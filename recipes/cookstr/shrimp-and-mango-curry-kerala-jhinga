Marinate the shrimp in a mixture of the lime juice, a pinch of the turmeric powder, and salt. Let it sit for about 30 minutes. In a blender or food processor grind the coconut, coriander seeds, half the sliced onions, cumin seeds, the remaining ground turmeric, garlic, and tamarind paste to make a really fine and smooth paste. Add a little water to facilitate grinding, which will take 7-10 minutes for a really smooth paste. Heat the oil in a wide large skillet or wok over medium heat. Add the remaining sliced onion and green chili peppers until lightly colored, about 5-7 minutes. Add the mangoes and spice paste and saut√© over moderate heat for 6-7 minutes, adding a little water if necessary to prevent sticking. When the oil begins to separate from the spices in the form of little globules on the surface of the paste, add the water. Add the shrimp and cook until done, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with the chopped coriander leaves when serving.
