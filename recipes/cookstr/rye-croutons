Preheat oven to 350째F (180째C) In a bowl stir together butter or oil and, if desired, the ingredients for one of the variations below. Add bread cubes; toss until lightly coated. Spread in a single layer on baking sheet (or shallow baking dish). Bake, stirring once, for 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown and crisp. Set aside to cool before using. If stored croutons lose crispness, spread out on a baking sheet; bake at 300째F (150째C) for 3 to 5 minutes or just until hot and crisp. From Marilyn Crowley and Joan Mackie: The Best Soup Cookbook
