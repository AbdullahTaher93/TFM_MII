Preheat the broiler and place an oven rack 4 inches from the heat. In a bowl, stir together the salsa ingredients. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary. Place 2 tortillas on a baking sheet. Crumble the cheese over the tortillas. Top with the remaining tortillas. Broil, flipping once halfway through, until the cheese is melted and the tortillas are golden, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Quarter the quesadillas and top each section with 1 tablespoon salsa. Serve immediately.
