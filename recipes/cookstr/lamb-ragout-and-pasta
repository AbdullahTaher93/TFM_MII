Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain. Heat oil in a 3-quart soup pot over high heat until hot. Reduce heat. Add the onion. Cook and stir until tender but not brown. Add the ground lamb. Cook and stir until browned. Stir in the wine and rosemary. Simmer until the wine evaporates. Meanwhile, pour the undrained tomatoes into a bowl and crush the tomatoes with your hands. Add the tomatoes to the soup pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until the juices are pretty well evaporated and the ragout is thick, about 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve ragout over pasta. Sprinkle with Romano cheese.
