Place the onions in a colander set over a bowl or in the sink, sprinkle on the 1 tablespoon salt, and toss to mix well. Let drain for 15 minutes or so, then rinse well with cold water and gently squeeze out excess liquid. Separate the slices as you place the onions in a shallow bowl. In a small bowl, mix together the vinegar, sugar, and chile flakes, whisking well to blend them, then pour over the onions. Toss to distribute the dressing. Taste, and add a little salt if needed. Add the coriander and toss, then sprinkle on the pomegranate seeds.
