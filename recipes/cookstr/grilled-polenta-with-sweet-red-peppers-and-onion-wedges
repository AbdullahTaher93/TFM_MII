Prepare a hot fire in a charcoal grill or preheat a gas grill on high. Trim off the irregular ends and slice the polenta into ten 1/2 -inch-thick slices. Arrange on a rimmed baking sheet. Generously brush the slices on both sides with olive oil and season lightly with salt and pepper. Brush the peppers and onions with olive oil, coating them lightly. Oil the grill grate. Arrange the polenta slices directly over the hot fire and grill, turning once, until they have grill marks etched across both sides, 8 to 10 minutes total. While the polenta is grilling, arrange the peppers and onions directly over the hot fire and grill, turning once, until the edges begin to char and the peppers and onions are tender but still firm, about 5 minutes total. (Use tongs and a spatula to turn the onion slices.) To serve, cut the peppers into thin strips, and slice the onion rounds in half. Arrange 2 polenta slices, slightly overlapping them, on each plate and top with some peppers and onions. Sprinkle with the cheese and serve immediately.
